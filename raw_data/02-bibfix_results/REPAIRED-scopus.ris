TI  - Riverine fish diversity varies according to geographical isolation and land use modification
PY  - 2017
AB  - Understanding the environmental factors driving species-genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs) is critical for designing appropriate conservation and management strategies to protect biodiversity. Yet, few studies have explored the impact of changing land use patterns on SGDCs specifically in aquatic communities. This study examined patterns of genetic diversity in roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) together with fish species composition across 19 locations in a large river catchment, spanning a gradient in land use. Our findings show significant correlations between some, but not all, species and genetic diversity end points. For example, genetic and species differentiation showed a weak but significant linear relationship across the Thames catchment, but additional diversity measures such as allelic richness and fish population abundance did not. Further examination of patterns in species and genetic diversity indicated that land use intensification has a modest effect on fish diversity compared to the combined influence of geographical isolation and land use intensification. These results indicate that environmental changes in riparian habitats have the potential to amplify shifts in the composition of stream fish communities in poorly connected river stretches. Conservation and management strategies for fish populations should, therefore, focus on enhancing connectivity between river stretches and limit conversion of nearby land to arable or urban use to maintain current levels of biodiversity. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Strong genetic differentiation among populations of the freshwater shrimp Caridina cantonensis in Hong Kong: Implications for conservation of freshwater fauna in urban areas
PY  - 2017
AB  - Freshwater organisms generally exhibit strong genetic structuring. Although understanding the level and spatial distribution of genetic diversity is crucial for conservation management planning, such information has received little attention until recently in highly developed cities where local extinction attributed to habitat destruction and urbanisation is intense. We compared the genetic divergence in mitochondrial COI of the freshwater shrimp Caridina cantonensis collected from 32 sites in Hong Kong, to determine the connectivity among populations and the levels of genetic diversity of the shrimp. We found that shrimp from different streams are genetically highly differentiated and each stream always has its own unique haplotype groups, even though some of the streams are separated only by a few kilometres, indicating very limited gene flow across streams. Moreover, genetic diversity within each stream is very low, usually with a single haplotype dominating the entire population, and genetic differentiation was observed among tributaries from the same drainage. The high genetic diversity of these species over short distances has significant conservation implications because a substantial amount of biodiversity may have already been lost as a result of past development. Careful conservation planning is essential for future development in Hong Kong and other cities. © CSIRO 2017.

TI  - Pollinator-Mediated Gene Flow Connects Green Roof Populations Across the Urban Matrix: A Paternity Analysis of the Self-Compatible Forb Penstemon hirsutus
PY  - 2019
AB  - Gene flow between populations can help maintain genetic diversity and prevent inbreeding, which is especially important for small, fragmented habitats. Many plant species rely on pollinators to move pollen between populations. In urban areas, insufficient pollinator services may result in limited gene flow, which can have negative consequences such as genetic drift and inbreeding depression. Furthermore, restored populations that are established with few founders of low genetic diversity may have limited long-term population persistence. Here, we tested the hypotheses that populations of a self-compatible forb established on urban green roofs from nursery stock are genetically depauperate and that limited gene (pollen) flow between populations will result in increased inbreeding. We compared the neutral genetic diversity of Penstemon hirsutus, using nine microsatellite loci, between three green roof populations established from nursery stock and three natural populations. We also established ten experimental populations on green roofs and measured rates of outcrossing and inbreeding and identified the movement of pollen within and between roofs using a paternity analysis. We found that neutral genetic diversity of populations established from nursery stock was lower than that of natural populations, although the level of inbreeding was also lower on the green roofs. In our experimental populations, we found that the rates of outcrossing and inbreeding varied between the roof populations. Our results suggest that inbreeding may be correlated with cover of co-flowering species but not with any of the other measured site properties. The location of likely pollen donors suggested that on average, 75% of pollen was derived from plants within the population (including self) and 25% came from plants on different roofs. Our results document realized pollen movement within and between green roofs, demonstrating that these habitats provide important connectivity in a fragmented environment. © 2019 Ksiazek-Mikenas, Fant and Skogen.

TI  - Genetic diversity of a tropical rainforest understory bird in an urban fragmented landscape
PY  - 2015
AB  - Analyzing the genetic diversity of a population can be useful in identifying some of the silent effects of habitat fragmentation. We examined and compared 4 mitochondrial loci of the near threatened Short-tailed Babbler (Pellorneum malaccense), a rainforest understory bird, between a highly fragmented population in Singapore and populations from elsewhere in the Sundaic region. We found that the fragmented Singaporean population is genetically impoverished, with ,< 20% of the intrapopulation genetic diversity present in a comparable sample from Borneo within intact forest. Differences in haplotype diversity among Singaporean sites of occurrence suggest that there may be extremely poor genetic diversity and connectivity among Singaporean subpopulations. These findings highlight the importance of connectivity in maintaining population genetic diversity in urban tropical forest patches. Our results also corroborate previous findings that there are 3 deeply diverged lineages of Short-tailed Babbler across the Sundaic region. © 2015 Cooper Ornithological Society.

TI  - Varying genetic imprints of road networks and human density in North American mammal populations
PY  - 2021
AB  - Road networks and human density are major factors contributing to habitat fragmentation and loss, isolation of wildlife populations, and reduced genetic diversity. Terrestrial mammals are particularly sensitive to road networks and encroachment by human populations. However, there are limited assessments of the impacts of road networks and human density on population-specific nuclear genetic diversity, and it remains unclear how these impacts are modulated by life-history traits. Using generalized linear mixed models and microsatellite data from 1444 North American terrestrial mammal populations, we show that taxa with large home range sizes, dense populations, and large body sizes had reduced nuclear genetic diversity with increasing road impacts and human density, but the overall influence of life-history traits was generally weak. Instead, we observed a high degree of genus-specific variation in genetic responses to road impacts and human density. Human density negatively affected allelic diversity or heterozygosity more than road networks (13 vs. 5-7 of 25 assessed genera, respectively); increased road networks and human density also positively affected allelic diversity and heterozygosity in 15 and 6-9 genera, respectively. Large-bodied, human-averse species were generally more negatively impacted than small, urban-adapted species. Genus-specific responses to habitat fragmentation by ongoing road development and human encroachment likely depend on the specific capability to (i) navigate roads as either barriers or movement corridors, and (ii) exploit resource-rich urban environments. The nonuniform genetic response to roads and human density highlights the need to implement efforts to mitigate the risk of vehicular collisions, while also facilitating gene flow between populations of particularly vulnerable taxa.

TI  - Songbird genetic diversity is lower in anthropogenically versus naturally fragmented landscapes
PY  - 2011
AB  - Natural habitats, and the populations they sustain, are becoming increasingly fragmented by human activities. Parallels between 'true' islands and 'habitat' islands suggest that standing levels of individual genetic diversity in naturally fragmented populations may predict the genetic fate of their anthropogenically fragmented counterparts, but this hypothesis remains largely untested. We compared neutral-locus genetic diversity of individual song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) breeding in a naturally fragmented landscape (small coastal islands) to that of song sparrows in similar-sized 'urban islands' separated by roads and housing developments rather than by water. Individuals on coastal islands were more heterozygous and less inbred than those in urban islands. Estimates of population genetic structuring (assessed by pairwise genetic differentiation and Bayesian clustering methods) and contemporary dispersal (based on assignment tests) revealed little structure within either landscape, suggesting that lack of connectivity at the geographic scale we investigated cannot explain the reduced heterozygosity of urban birds. However, within-site genetic similarity was higher in the urban than the coastal landscape. Assuming that historic genetic diversity was similar in these two environments, our findings suggest that anthropogenically fragmented populations may lose genetic diversity faster than their naturally fragmented counterparts. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Genetic analyses reveal high connectivity among populations of the Honduran white bat Ectophylla alba in the Caribbean lowlands of central eastern Costa Rica
PY  - 2022
AB  - Vagility, ecological requirements, and forest patches can all influence gene flow among populations. These aspects are critical for the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations. Ectophylla alba is a fruit bat belonging to the family Phyllostomidae with specialized feeding and habitat requirements. Studies examining population genetics in this specialist bat are lacking. In this study, ten microsatellite loci were used to evaluate the current genetic structure of this bat species. Six localities in Costa Rica were evaluated. These localities are included in a landscape with remnants of lowland forests surrounded by cattle pastures, plantations, urban areas, and roads. Our results suggest a genetic population with moderate genetic diversity that was observed at most studied loci, with a statistically non-significant difference between the observed and expected heterozygosity. Most of the genetic variation was observed within rather than among sampled populations. The Mantel test showed a non-significant correlation between genetic diversity and geographic distance. These results suggest that E. alba populations have not shown an effect of habitat fragmentation in the studied area. We argue that the increase of forest patches is too recent to alter genetic diversity among sampled localities. Current migration among populations appears to be high enough to balance allele frequencies among localities. © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.

TI  - Conservation genetics of the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata): population structure, genetic diversity and landscape effects in an endangered amphibian
PY  - 2021
AB  - Revealing patterns of genetic diversity and barriers for gene flow are key points for successful conservation in endangered species. Methods based on molecular markers are also often used to delineate conservation units such as evolutionary significant units and management units. Here we combine phylo-geographic analyses (based on mtDNA) with population and landscape genetic analyses (based on microsatellites) for the endangered yellow-bellied toad Bombina variegata over a wide distribution range in Germany. Our analyses show that two genetic clusters are present in the study area, a northern and a southern/central one, but that these clusters are not deeply divergent. The genetic data suggest high fragmentation among toad occurrences and consequently low genetic diversity. Genetic diversity and genetic connectivity showed a negative relationship with road densities and urban areas surrounding toad occurrences, indicating that these landscape features act as barriers to gene flow. To preserve a maximum of genetic diversity, we recommend considering both genetic clusters as management units, and to increase gene flow among toad occurrences with the aim of restoring and protecting functional meta-populations within each of the clusters. Several isolated populations with especially low genetic diversity and signs of inbreeding need particular short-term conservation attention to avoid extinction. We also recommend to allow natural gene flow between both clusters but not to use individuals from one cluster for translocation or reintroduction into the other. Our results underscore the utility of molecular tools for species conservation, highlight outcomes of habitat fragmentation onto the genetic structure of an endangered amphibian and reveal particularly threatened populations in need for urgent conservation efforts. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Effects of low-density urbanization on genetic structure in the Song Sparrow
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization fragments landscapes and can impede the movement of organisms through their environment, which can decrease population connectivity. Reduction in connectivity influences gene flow and allele frequencies, and can lead to a reduction in genetic diversity and the fixation of certain alleles, with potential negative effects for populations. Previous studies have detected effects of urbanization on genetic diversity and structure in terrestrial animals living in landscapes that vary in their degree of urbanization, even over very short distances. We investigated the effects of low-intensity urbanization on genetic diversity and genetic structure in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We captured 208 Song Sparrows at seven sites along a gradient of urbanization in and around Blacksburg, VA, USA, then genotyped them using a panel of fifteen polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found that genetic diversity was comparable among the seven study sites, and there was no evidence of genetic structuring among sites. These findings suggest that over a gradient of urbanization characterized by low density urban development, Song Sparrows likely exist in a single panmictic population.

TI  - Landscape changes decrease genetic diversity in the Pallas’ long-tongued bat
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Species with high mobility may have low genetic differentiation among populations due to historical long-distance dispersal, but recent studies show that bat dispersal may be affected by habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we analyze the effects of landscape contemporary changes and dynamics in paleodistribution during the Quaternary on genetic diversity and differentiation in the Pallas’ long-tongued bat, Glossophaga soricina. We sampled 18 populations in landscapes with different land cover, and used nine microsatellite loci and the sequence of a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (CYB) to obtain genetic data. We performed ecological niche modelling and used general linear mixed models and optimization of multiple resistance surfaces to analyze how landscape structure and climatic suitability affect genetic diversity and differentiation. Our results show that the conversion of natural vegetation, such as forests and savannas, to agriculture, pastures or urban matrices (unsuitable habitats) decreases genetic diversity and increases inbreeding, but has no effect on genetic differentiation among populations, that was likely affected by spatial distance. Our findings point to the importance of maintenance of large areas of natural vegetation remnants to conserve genetic diversity of G. soricina, an important bat pollinator in the Neotropics.

TI  - Effects of landscape heterogeneity on population genetic structure and demography of Amazonian phyllostomid bats
PY  - 2021
AB  - Anthropogenic landscape changes resulting in habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation might decrease connectivity and effective sizes of wild populations, threatening local biodiversity. Assumed large distributions of both species and habitats have probably discouraged studies correlating altered landscapes’ structure and composition to patterns of genetic diversity in the Neotropics. Yet, considering the increasingly high rates of deforestation and habitat conversion in Amazonia, investigating local and regional-scale effects of habitat conversion on Amazonian mammals is of paramount importance. Here, we use widespread, non-threatened, phyllostomid bats to understand how current forest dynamics are influencing genetic diversity patterns and functional connectivity of eastern Amazonian volant mammals. Four frugivorous species, Carollia perspicillata, Rhinophylla pumilio, Dermanura gnoma and Artibeus obscurus, were sampled across a heterogeneously fragmented region. Twelve more or less isolated rainforest remnants surrounded by urban areas, pastures, crops, secondary forests and other land uses comprise the studied landscapes, and are compared using a landscape genetics approach applied to mitochondrial DNA loci. Here, we report species-specific consequences of habitat fragmentation. Although the overall levels of genetic diversity were high, our data show that (i) population structure is heterogeneous across the altered landscapes; (ii) landscapes with higher habitat availability harbour populations with higher genetic diversity; and (iii) the populations assessed might be demographically declining.

TI  - Genetic diversity of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans (L.) stearn in Northwestern Mexico
PY  - 2016
AB  - Mangrove forests of Mexico have been threatened by the effects of anthropogenic activities during the last decades, mostly related to aquaculture, agriculture, livestock and urban development. Genetic diversity and fine-scale genetic structure of two generations of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn were investigated in perturbed and preserved sites from three lagoon systems in Sinaloa, Mexico. Genetic diversity and overall genetic structure were similar between perturbed and preserved sites. However, lower levels of fine-scale spatial genetic structure were observed in two of the younger (sapling) generations. We attribute this to differences in local dynamics of each lagoon system, their status of conservation and levels of fragmentation. Also, low connectivity and the effects of disturbance could restrict the movement of pollinators and seed dispersal capabilities, resulting in low levels of genetic diversity and signs of inbreeding. Perturbed populations of A. germinans may play an important role in in situ conservation of this complex ecosystem. © 2016 by the authors.

TI  - Landscape and climate influence the patterns of genetic diversity and inbreeding in Cerrado plant species
PY  - 2020
AB  - The anthropization of the landscape of the Cerrado biome that has occurred over the past few decades has fragmented its natural environments, impacting the connectivity of the plant populations and altering their gene flow. Plant species may also reduce population size in response to sub-optimal climatic and environmental conditions, and observed distribution patterns may align with theoretical schemes, such as the center–periphery model, that is, it is possible that populations on the edge have lower genetic diversity than center populations, theoretically submitted to environmental conditions closer to the optimum. In this context, we evaluate whether the genetic diversity and inbreeding coefficients of Cerrado plant species are affected by landscape features and climate characteristics, and in particular, if the distribution of the genetic diversity of these plants is consistent with the center–periphery model. To do this, we conducted a literature search for genetic studies of Cerrado plant populations using Scopus, Web of Science, and Scielo databases and the species found were used as a proxy to explore patterns throughout the biome. The data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and multiple matrix regressions (MMRRs) to evaluate the effects of landscape features and climatic variables on the observed (HO) and expected heterozygosity (HE), allelic richness (AR) and inbreeding (Fis) patterns of the local populations. The landscape was evaluated in terms of the percentage land cover of agriculture (AG), forestry (FO), remnant vegetation (RV), urban areas (UA), pasture (PA), and water (WA) within buffers of 1 km, 3 km, and 5 km around the study populations. We analyzed 121 populations of 31 plant species. The GLMMs showed that HO was affected by FO regardless of buffer size, while HE was also affected by FO, but also by WA and UA. AR was affected by WA and UA in all three buffer zones while the Fis was affected by FO and AU. The MMRRs showed that WA may affect HO, HE, and Fis within the 1 km buffer, while FO affects HO and UA affects AR within the 5 km buffer. In the case of the 1 km and 3 km buffers, however, the geographic distance between populations was identified as a factor determining the genetic diversity and inbreeding indices, indicating that isolation by distance may be an important factor defining the breeding patterns of the Cerrado plant populations. The GLMMs and MMRRs also showed that the mean annual temperature (MAT) and, to a lesser extent, isothermality (ISO) can explain the variation in genetic diversity observed in the Cerrado plant populations. We also found that the center–periphery model fits the distribution pattern observed in most of the species evaluated, including Annona crassiflora,Annona coriacea, Copaifera langsdorffii, and Eugenia dysenterica. Our results indicate that changes in the climate and the landscape of Brazilian Cerrado must be considered carefully to guarantee minimizing the impacts of these processes on the genetic diversity of Cerrado plant species and ensuring the long-term conservation of these species in this biome.

TI  - High genetic diversity but spatially restricted genetic connectivity in a tropical montane cloud forest tree (Magnolia schiedeana)
PY  - 2023
AB  - Magnolias are representative shrub and tree species of the tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) in Mexico, which is one of the most endangered ecosystems due to anthropogenic landscape degradation and climate change. Magnolia schiedeana is a vulnerable and restricted endemic TMCF species, occurring in scattered TMCF fragments in the Sierra Madre Oriental. In this study, we investigated spatial patterns of genetic diversity across the M. schiedeana species range and assessed whether gene flow was influenced by topographic and environmental factors. We sampled 11 remnant populations across the species range and genotyped 180 individuals at eight nuclear microsatellite loci. Our data showed a strong spatial structure in five genetic clusters, which match the patchy geographic distribution of M. schiedeana. Contemporary migration rates between these genetic clusters were very low. Levels of genetic diversity within populations were moderate to high, and no evidence of inbreeding was found. Our results from landscape genetic analysis showed that isolation by distance, rather than topography or environmental variation, was the main process shaping genetic differentiation. Urgent actions are needed to protect M. schiedeana populations as most of them persist isolated within agricultural and urban landscapes. Ex situ management actions would be crucial to ensure the conservation of genetically diverse germplasm for the in situ propagation where it has gone locally extinct. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Multivariate analysis of polyploid data reveals the role of railways in the spread of the invasive South African Ragwort (Senecio inaequidens)
PY  - 2015
AB  - Genetic studies constitute a powerful approach to study the introduction and expansion of invasive species. Senecio inaequidens DC is one of the Europe’s fastest plant invaders and is suspected to use railway corridors to expand. In France, the species has first been observed in the city of Paris in the late 1990’s and today it is present throughout the region. In order to assess the role of railways in S. inaequidens invasion, we used innovative multivariate analyses to study population genetic diversity of this allotetraploid species. We analyzed the genetic diversity at 11 microsatellite markers of a total of 450 individuals sampled at 15 locations along railways connecting the city of Paris to the surrounding suburban/rural areas. Geographical distances among locations ranged from 1 to 83 km with four locations within Paris at the departure train stations of the national/international train lines studied. To our knowledge, studies on invasive allotetraploid plants where data were kept in the tetraploid format are still scarce. Our analyses revealed substantial genetic diversity and clear genetic differentiation among some populations, with a genetic gradient detected along one railway line. Results also showed no genetic bottleneck between Parisian populations and the historically introduced population located in South of France. Our study thus revealed the role of railways as a corridor among S. inaequidens populations within central Paris. However, connecting networks appeared more complex in the suburban and rural areas suggesting other potential vectors.

TI  - Genetic diversity and gene flow decline with elevation in the near Eastern fire salamander (Salamandra infraimmaculata) at Mount Hermon, Golan Heights
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Near Eastern fire salamander (Salamandra infraimmaculata) reaches its southern distribution range in Israel. Although the population structure has been analysed in central Israel and at the southern distribution limit, we lack knowledge on populations in the northern area, such as along Mount Hermon. S. infraimmaculata occurs at Mt. Hermon along an altitudinal gradient and appears to be fragmented by urban and agricultural landscape. We studied the genetic structure of four populations based on microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial D-loop to determine the genetic diversity and connectivity between populations. We observed moderate gene flow at lower parts, i.e. from Tel Dan and Nimrod Castle to Banias indicating extant but limited connectivity. Genetic diversity and gene flow declined along the altitudinal gradient at Mt. Hermon, reaching rock-bottom levels in the highest located population of Nimrod Pool. The observed isolation-by-elevation gradient might induce a higher extinction risk for the highland populations of S. infraimmaculata. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2020.

TI  - Effects of habitat fragment size and isolation on the density and genetics of urban red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus)
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban expansion is creating environmental stressors through land use change, habitat fragmentation, and habitat loss. These stressors, along with a host of others, are driving precipitous declines in vertebrate taxa around the world. Amphibians, often requiring a narrow range of environmental conditions, can be especially susceptible to the stressors of environmental change. Despite habitat loss and degradation, some amphibian species continue to persist in altered urban landscapes. The red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one such- species and in this study, we assess how habitat patch size affects population density and genetic diversity of salamander populations in and around an urban center in Ohio, United States. Further, we examined patterns of genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity to understand gene flow between populations and tested for historic demographic bottleneck effects. Populations were sampled from 9 urban forest patches ranging in size from less than 1 ha to approximately 250 ha. There was no apparent effect of contiguous habitat patch size on salamander density nor genetic diversity, but we did observe significant genetic differentiation between 97% of pairwise population comparisons. The differentiation observed was not a result of overland distance or effective distance due to landscape resistance. There was evidence of historic bottlenecks at every site. These results suggest that density is driven by within-patch heterogeneity and that genetic diversity is affected by drivers other than patch size or contemporary population density. Our study demonstrates that red-backed salamanders can persist in wooded, urban parks, but that genetic diversity remains susceptible to demographic changes. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Systemic racism alters wildlife genetic diversity
PY  - 2022
AB  - In the United States, systemic racism has had lasting effects on the structure of cities, specifically due to government-mandated redlining policies that produced racially segregated neighborhoods that persist today. However, it is not known whether varying habitat structures and natural resource availability associated with racial segregation affect the demographics and evolution of urban wildlife populations. To address this question, we repurposed and reanalyzed publicly archived nuclear genetic data from 7,698 individuals spanning 39 terrestrial vertebrate species sampled in 268 urban locations throughout the United States. We found generally consistent patterns of reduced genetic diversity and decreased connectivity in neighborhoods with fewer White residents, likely because of environmental differences across these neighborhoods. The strength of relationships between the racial composition of neighborhoods, genetic diversity, and differentiation tended to be weak relative to other factors affecting genetic diversity, possibly in part due to the recency of environmental pressures on urban wildlife populations. However, the consistency of the direction of effects across disparate taxa suggest that systemic racism alters the demography of urban wildlife populations in ways that generally limit population sizes and negatively affect their chances of persistence. Our results thus support the idea that limited capacity to support large, well-connected wildlife populations reduces access to nature and builds on existing environmental inequities shouldered by predominantly non-White neighborhoods.

TI  - Urbanisation versus agriculture: A comparison of local genetic diversity and gene flow between wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus populations in human-modified landscapes
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanisation and agriculture dramatically modify the landscapes available for use by wildlife, affecting key aspects of their ecology such as survival, foraging, predation, competition and reproductive success. Relatively little is known about the effects of urbanisation and agriculture on the genetic structure, gene flow and genetic diversity of wild species. Here, landscape genetic techniques were applied to compare local genetic diversity and gene flow between wood mouse populations in urban and arable landscapes. Using nine microsatellite markers, individuals were genotyped from six arable and seven urban sample sites. Inter-population genetic differentiation was significantly greater in urban than arable habitat, while allele richness, private allele richness and heterozygosity were higher for arable sample sites, with varying degrees of significance. These suggest that urban habitat was sufficiently fragmented to limit gene flow. To test the effect of landscape features on gene flow, several cost-distance measures were generated. Overland distance and Euclidean distance correlated best with inter-population genetic differentiation in arable habitat, whereas distances that accommodated differences in habitat quality better explained differentiation in urban habitat. There was no evidence that margins adjacent to roads, rivers or railways facilitated gene flow. Together, the results indicate that urban landscapes expose wood mice to greater fragmentation in habitat quality than arable areas, leading to greater population isolation that is not mitigated by the presence of dispersal corridors. © 2015 Nordic Society Oikos.

TI  - Changes in the distribution of cloud forests during the last glacial predict the patterns of genetic diversity and demographic history of the tree fern Alsophila firma (Cyatheaceae)
PY  - 2014
AB  - Aim: We investigated changes in distribution of cloud forests during the last 130 kyr, and tested whether these changes explain the spatial patterns of genetic diversity of the tree fern Alsophila firma (Cyatheaceae), a species restricted to this habitat. Location: Mexican cloud forests. Methods: We sampled 204 individuals from 16 localities. Genetic data consisted of DNA sequences for five chloroplast microsatellites and one nuclear gene. We used distribution modelling to predict the historical distribution of cloud forests during the last glacial period, using two palaeoclimate models: the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) and the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). We tested the correlation between temporal cloud forest stability and genetic diversity and used an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework to test two plausible demographic scenarios. Results: The range fluctuations observed for cloud forests during the last 130 kyr are key factors affecting the distribution of genetic variation in A. firma. Increased genetic diversity in areas with high temporal environmental suitability is probably the result of increased population sizes and higher interpopulation connectivity. In accordance with the expansion of cloud forests predicted by CCSM, the genetic data supported the scenario of a population expansion occurring c. 110 ka, followed by population divergence c. 20 ka. However, population dynamics involving expansion of suitable microclimates could reconcile the stability of cloud forests predicted by MIROC and the observed genetic patterns. Main conclusions: The predicted changes in the distribution of cloud forests were congruent with the population genetics of A. firma. However, the choice of palaeoclimate model has a substantial impact on the inferences drawn from the observed genetic and demographic patterns. The use of alternative palaeoclimate hypotheses and biome modelling can provide a common analytical framework for evaluating the historical cohesiveness of forest communities. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Genetic and ecological consequences of recent habitat fragmentation in a narrow endemic plant species within an urban context
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding the timescales that shape spatial genetic structure is pivotal to ascertain the impact of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity and reproductive viability of long-lived plant populations. Combining genetic and ecological information with current and past fragmentation conditions allows the identification of the main drivers important in shaping population structure and declines in reproduction, which is crucial for informing conservation strategies. Using historic aerial photographs, we defined the past fragmentation conditions for the shrub Conospermum undulatum, a species now completely embedded in an urban area. We explored the impact of current and past conditions on its genetic layout and assessed the effects of genetic and environmental factors on its reproduction. The historically high structural connectivity was evident in the genetics of the species. Despite the current intense fragmentation, we found similar levels of genetic diversity across populations and a weak spatial genetic structure. Historical connectivity was negatively associated with genetic differentiation among populations and positively related to within-population genetic diversity. Variation partitioning of reproductive performance explained ~ 66% of the variance, showing significant influences for genetic (9%), environmental (15%), and combined (42%) fractions. Our study highlights the importance of considering the historical habitat dynamics when investigating fragmentation consequences in long-lived plants. A detailed characterization of fragmentation from 1953 has shown how low levels of genetic fixation are due to extensive gene flow through the non-fragmented landscape. Moreover, knowledge of the relationships between genetic and environmental variation and reproduction can help to implement effective conservation strategies, particularly in highly dynamic landscapes. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Effect of Landscape Pattern on Insect Species Density within Urban Green Spaces in Beijing, China
PY  - 2015
AB  - Urban green space is an important refuge of biodiversity in urban areas. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the relationship between the landscape pattern of green spaces and biodiversity to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization. In this study, we collected insects from 45 green patches in Beijing during July 2012 using suction sampling. The green patches were dominated by managed lawns, mixed with scattered trees and shrubs. We examined the effects of landscape pattern on insect species density using hierarchical partitioning analysis and partial least squares regression. The results of the hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that five explanatory variables, i.e., patch area (with 19.9%independent effects), connectivity (13.9%), distance to nearest patch (13.8%), diversity for patch types (11.0%), and patch shape (8.3%), significantly contributed to insect species density. With the partial least squares regression model, we found species density was negatively related to patch area, shape, connectivity, diversity for patch types and proportion of impervious surface at the significance level of p &lt; 0.05 and positively related to proportion of vegetated land. Regression tree analysis further showed that the highest species density was found in green patches with an area &lt;500 m2. Our results indicated that improvement in habitat quality, such as patch area and connectivity that are typically thought to be important for conservation, did not actually increase species density. However, increasing compactness (low-edge) of patch shape and landscape composition did have the expected effect. Therefore, it is recommended that the composition of the surrounding landscape should be considered simultaneously with planned improvements in local habitat quality. © 2015 Su et al.

TI  - Spatial genetic structure and gene flow of the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), in a rapidly urbanising landscape
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban landscapes contain many barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow, particularly for large terrestrial mammals with extensive natural home ranges. Eastern grey kangaroos ( Macropus giganteus ) are a large macropodid, whose biological range partially coincides with areas subjected to high rates of urban expansion, including the Southeast Queensland (SEQ) bioregion of Australia. Within this region, M. giganteus populations have had recent, rapid declines in numbers with ongoing urbanisation posing a significant threat due to the isolation of populations. Therefore, we investigated the genetic profile of kangaroos in a rapidly urbanising SEQ region (Sunshine Coast) by comparing them to other SEQ kangaroos (Greater Brisbane) and to higher density kangaroo populations in a landscape matrix with greater levels of connectivity (Australian Capital Territory; ACT). We utilised a targeted genetic probe of genome-wide SNPs to obtain baseline genetic profiles of M. giganteus using scat samples collected from 24 sites in the Sunshine Coast (n = 103) and compared these to Greater Brisbane (n = 20) and ACT (n = 29) scat samples. Genetic diversity was similar when comparing the ACT, Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane regions (H E: 0.224–0.238), yet effective population size was markedly higher for the ACT region ( N e = 3453) than for both the Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane ( N e = 43.3 and 25.0, respectively), with clear genetic differentiation on a regional scale. We also identified six genetic groups within our SEQ study area, with significant differences in genetic diversity ( H E : 0.188 – 0.289). The presence of high numbers of private alleles in all regions and within some SEQ populations highlights the conservation significance of preserving local populations. We also identified natural and anthropogenic barriers, which may have impacted genetic processes such as gene flow in the region. Therefore, this research highlights the need for localised management of kangaroo populations to preserve genetic diversity and structure in the SEQ region, by maintaining and improving landscape connectivity. We emphasise that for the conservation of local and global biodiversity, it is imperative to assess baseline genetic status of both common and threatened species, particularly when declines and extirpations are occurring across these species’ ranges.

TI  - Urban habitat fragmentation and genetic population structure of bobcats in Coastal Southern California
PY  - 2012
AB  - Although habitat fragmentation is recognized as a primary threat to biodiversity, the effects of urban development on genetic population structure vary among species and landscapes and are not yet well understood. Here we use non-invasive genetic sampling to compare the effects of fragmentation by major roads and urban development on levels of dispersal, genetic diversity, and relatedness between paired bobcat populations in replicate landscapes in coastal southern California. We hypothesized that bobcat populations in sites surrounded by urbanization would experience reduced functional connectivity relative to less isolated nearby populations. Our results show that bobcat genetic population structure is affected by roads and development but not always as predicted by the degree that these landscape features surround fragments. Instead, we suggest that urban development may affect functional connectivity between bobcat populations more by limiting the number and genetic diversity of source populations of migrants than by creating impermeable barriers to dispersal.

TI  - The population genetics of urban and rural amphibians in North America
PY  - 2021
AB  - Human land transformation is one of the leading causes of vertebrate population declines. These declines are thought to be partly due to decreased connectivity and habitat loss reducing animal population sizes in disturbed habitats. With time, this can lead to declines in effective population size and genetic diversity which restrict the ability of wildlife to efficiently cope with environmental change through genetic adaptation. However, it is not well understood whether these effects generally hold across taxa. We address this question by repurposing and synthesizing raw microsatellite data from online repositories for 19 amphibian species sampled at 554 georeferenced sites in North America. For each site, we estimated gene diversity, allelic richness, effective population size, and population differentiation. Using binary urban-rural census designations, and continuous measures of human population density, the Human Footprint Index, and impervious surface cover, we tested for generalizable effects of human land use on amphibian genetic diversity. We found minimal evidence, either positive or negative, for relationships between genetic metrics and urbanization. Together with previous work on focal species that also found varying effects of urbanization on genetic composition, it seems likely that the consequences of urbanization are not easily generalizable within or across amphibian species. Questions about the genetic consequences of urbanization for amphibians should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. This contrasts with general negative effects of urbanization in mammals and consistent, but species-specific, positive and negative effects in birds. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Design of protected area by tracking and excluding the effects of climate and landscape change: A case study using neurergus derjugini
PY  - 2021
AB  - This study aimed to use the applications of Ensemble Species Distribution Modelling (eSDM), Geographical Information Systems (GISs), and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for the design of a protected area (PA) for the critically endangered yellow-spotted mountain newt, Neurergus derjugini, by tracking and excluding the effects of climate and landscape changes in western Iran and northeastern Iraq. Potential recent and future distributions (2050 and 2070) were reconstructed by eSDM using eight algorithms with MRI-CGCM3 and CCSM4 models. The GIS-based MCDA siting procedure was followed inside habitats with high eSDM suitability by eliminating the main roads, cities, high village density, dams, poor vegetation, low stream density, agricultural lands and high ridge density. Then, within the remaining relevant areas, 10 polygons were created as “nominations” for PAs (NPAs). Finally, for 10 different NPAs, the suitability score was ranked based on ratings and weights (analytical hierarchy process) of the number of newt localities, NPA connectivity, NPA shape, NPA habitat suitability in 2070, NPA size, genetic diversity, village density and distance to nearest PAs, cities, and main roads. This research could serve as a modern realistic approach for environmental management to plan conservation areas using a cost-effective and affordable technique.

TI  - Nativity and seed dispersal mode influence species’ responses to habitat connectivity and urban environments
PY  - 2018
AB  - Aim: Urbanization alters local environmental conditions and the ability of species to disperse between remnant habitat patches within the urban matrix. Nonetheless, despite the ongoing growth of urban areas worldwide, few studies have investigated the relative importance of dispersal and local environmental conditions for influencing species composition within urban and suburban landscapes. Here, we explore this question using spatial patterns of plant species composition. Location: The Research Triangle area, which includes the cities of Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill and Cary, in central North Carolina, USA. Time period: 2012–2014. Major taxa studied: Vascular plants. Methods: We sampled riparian forest plant communities along an urban-to-rural gradient and used redundancy analysis to identify predictors of species composition patterns for groups of species categorized by nativity and seed dispersal mode. We first compared the ability of different models of habitat connectivity (least-cost paths that avoided urban land cover versus Euclidean and along-stream distance) to explain spatial patterns of species composition. We then partitioned the variation in species composition explained by habitat connectivity models, local environmental conditions and measures of urbanization in the surrounding landscape. Results: We found that several groups of native species were best explained by least-cost path models that avoided urban development, suggesting that urbanization impedes dispersal within this landscape, particularly for short-dispersed species. Environmental variables related to urbanization (e.g., temperature, stream incision) were important predictors of species composition for many species groups, but measures of urbanization in the surrounding landscape were more important for exotic than for native species. Main conclusions: Our results demonstrate that urbanization influences plant species composition via its effects on both habitat connectivity and environmental conditions. However, the strength of these effects varies somewhat predictably across seed dispersal modes and between native and exotic species. These results highlight the importance of landscape-scale planning for urban conservation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Genetic Diversity among Four Populations of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) from Honduras as Revealed by Mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase I
PY  - 2022
AB  - Aedes aegypti is a hematophagous and highly anthropophilic mosquito with a wide dis-tribution, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Ae. aegypti is the main vector of several febrile diseases called arboviruses (dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and zika viruses), which represent an important public health problem. Populations of this mosquito were nearly eliminated from the Americas in the mid-20th century; however, after the abandonment of control measures, mosquito populations have been recovering territory, have expanded by anthro-pogenic mechanisms, and have been joined by new populations reintroduced from other continents. The objective of this pilot study was to determine the genetic variability of Aedes aegypti collected in four cities located along the so-called logistics corridor of Honduras, which connects the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean. We studied the sequences of two molecular markers: the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI mtDNA) gene and the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2 rDNA) of 40 mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analyzes show two separate clades with a low number of nucleotide differences per site, three haplotypes, and low haplotype diversity. These results suggest a low genetic diversity in the populations of Ae. aegypti in Honduras in relation to that reported in other countries of the Central American isthmus. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Pollen dispersal and genetic variation in an early-successional forest herb in a peri-urban forest
PY  - 2009
AB  - In order to conserve forest plant species under the particularly high constraints that represent urban surroundings, it is necessary to identify the key factors for population persistence. This study examined within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (<15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) and high genetic differentiation (F(ST)), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges. These landscape elements might therefore have a potential conservation value by contributing to connectivity of early-successional species populations located in patchy open habitats.

TI  - Long-term urbanization impacts the eastern golden frog (Pelophylax plancyi) in Shanghai City: Demographic history, genetic structure, and implications for amphibian conservation in intensively urbanizing environments
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of how urbanization influences the evolution of native species is vital for urban wildlife ecology and conservation in the Anthropocene. With thousands of years of agriculture-dominated historical urbanization followed by 40 years of intensive and rapid urbanization, Shanghai provides an ideal environment to study how the two-stage urbanization process influences the evolution of indigenous wildlife, especially of anuran species. Therefore, in this study, we used mitochondrial Cyt-b gene, microsatellite (SSR), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to evaluate the demographic history and genetic structure of the eastern golden frog (Pelophylax plancyi), by sampling 407 individuals from 15 local populations across Shanghai, China. All local populations experienced bottlenecks during historical urbanization, while the local populations in urban areas maintained comparable contemporary effective population sizes (Ne) and genetic diversity with suburban and rural populations. Nevertheless, the rapid modern urbanization has already imposed significant negative effects to the integrity of populations. The 15 local populations were differentiated into eight genetic clusters, showing a spatial distribution pattern consistent with the current urbanization gradient and island-mainland geography. Although moderate gene flow still occurred from the rural peripheral cluster to urban and suburban clusters, population fragmentation was more serious in the urban and suburban populations, where higher urbanization levels within 2-km radius areas showed significant negative relationships to the Ne and genetic diversity of local populations. Therefore, to protect urban wildlife with limited dispersal ability, improving conditions in fragmented habitat remnants might be most essential for local populations living in more urbanized areas. Meanwhile, we highlight the need to preserve large unfragmented rural habitats and to construct corridor networks to connect discrete urban habitat remnants for the long-term wildlife conservation in intensively urbanizing environments.

TI  - Weak genetic structuring suggests historically high genetic connectivity among recently fragmented urban populations of the scincid lizard, Ctenotus fallens
PY  - 2015
AB  - Populations in fragmented urban remnants may be at risk of genetic erosion as a result of reduced gene flow and elevated levels of inbreeding. This may have serious genetic implications for the long-term viability of remnant populations, in addition to the more immediate pressures caused by urbanisation. The population genetic structure of the generalist skink Ctenotus fallens was examined using nine microsatellite markers within and among natural vegetation remnants within a highly fragmented urban matrix in the Perth metropolitan area in Western Australia. These data were compared with samples from a large unfragmented site on the edge of the urban area. Overall, estimates of genetic diversity and inbreeding within all populations were similar and low. Weak genetic differentiation, and a significant association between geographic and genetic distance, suggests historically strong genetic connectivity that decreases with geographic distance. Due to recent fragmentation, and genetic inertia associated with low genetic diversity and large population sizes, it is not possible from these data to infer current genetic connectivity levels. However, the historically high levels of gene flow that our data suggest indicate that a reduction in contemporary connectivity due to fragmentation in C. fallens is likely to result in negative genetic consequences in the longer term. © 2015 CSIRO.

TI  - Combining genetic and demographic monitoring better informs conservation of an endangered urban snake
PY  - 2020
AB  - Conversion and fragmentation of wildlife habitat often leads to smaller and isolated populations and can reduce a species' ability to disperse across the landscape. As a consequence, genetic drift can quickly lower genetic variation and increase vulnerability to extirpation. For species of conservation concern, quantification of population size and connectivity can clarify the influence of genetic drift in local populations and provides important information for conservation management and recovery strategies. Here, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and capture-mark-recapture methods to evaluate the genetic diversity and demography within seven focal sites of the endangered San Francisco gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia), a species affected by alteration and isolation of wetland habitats throughout its distribution. The primary goals were to determine the population structure and degree of genetic isolation among T. s. tetrataenia populations and estimate effective size and population abundance within sites to better understand the present and future importance of genetic drift. We also used temporally sampled datasets to examine the magnitude of genetic change over time. We found moderate population genetic structure throughout the San Francisco Peninsula that partitions sites into northern and southern regional clusters. Point estimates of both effective size and population abundance were generally small (≤ 100) for a majority of the sites, and estimates were particularly low in the northern populations. Genetic analyses of temporal datasets indicated an increase in genetic differentiation, especially for the most geographically isolated sites, and decreased genetic diversity over time in at least one site (Pacifica). Our results suggest that drift-mediated processes as a function of small population size and reduced connectivity from neighboring populations may decrease diversity and increase differentiation. Improving genetic diversity and connectivity among T. s. tetrataenia populations could promote persistence of this endangered snake.

TI  - Dependence of animal diversity on plant diversity and environmental factors in farmland ponds
PY  - 2010
AB  - Farmland ponds represent habitats with a high conservation value that make a significant contribution to regional biodiversity. Understanding the influence of plant species composition and environmental variables in driving variations in animal species composition in ponds is an important issue in the fields of ecological research and conservation biology. Using variance partitioning techniques to quantify independent effects, we examined how plant species composition, local-landscape configuration and physicochemical variables interact in influencing aquatic insect and amphibian community composition. The ponds investigated in this study were located in the Site of Community Importance - Special Protected Area (Natura 2000 Network) \"Monte Labbro - Alta Valle dell'Albegna\" (Tuscany, central Italy). Our results showed that: (i) plant community composition (such as Carex hirta, Glicerya fluitans, Potamogeton natans, Typha latifolia) is a good predictor for amphibian but not for aquatic insect species composition; (ii) aquatic insect species composition was more strongly affected by the landscape context, whereas for amphibians the local characteristics of the ponds were determining; (iii) the physicochemical context is a poor predictor for these animal taxa; (iv) lastly, and notably, the explanatory variables explained a high proportion of the total variation in amphibian and aquatic insect species composition. Our results have important implications with respect to the creation of new ponds, which should preferentially take place close to semi-natural grasslands and other wetlands, in order to maintain greater connectivity, and away from urban areas. Moreover, larger ponds are preferable for the preservation of pond biodiversity. The management and conservation of ponds is necessary to ensure the protection of habitats, the survival of individual species and overall pond biodiversity.

TI  - Growing Out of the Tropical Forests: Gene Flow of Native Mesoamerican Trees Among Forest and Mayan Homegardens
PY  - 2021
AB  - This work aimed to evaluate domestication effects on the genetic structure of two dioecious species Brosimum alicastrum Sw. (Moraceae) and Spondias purpurea L. (Anacardiaceae), and a heterostylous one Cordia dodecandra A. DC. (Cordiaceae), growing in remnant forests and homegardens within two climatic regions of the Peninsula of Yucatan. The trees of B. alicastrum and C. dodecandra are propagated by seeds in both population types, while those of S. purpurea are propagated asexually in the homegardens. ISSRs genetic markers were amplified from foliar tissue of 18 to 21 plants per population type/region combination for each species. Genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and genetic structure estimators were obtained and compared among species at the regional and population level. We found higher polymorphism (37.5-41), but lower private alleles (4-4.4) and similar heterozygosity (0.1-0.12) in the species with sexual reproduction compared to S. purpurea (34, 8, and 0.11, respectively). Genetic diversity in B. alicastrum populations varied with the region; in C. dodecandra, to the population type; and in S. purpurea, to both the population type and the region. Unrestricted gene flow among regions was suggested by low RT in C. dodecandra and S. purpurea (-0.006 and 0.002) but not for B. alicastrum (0.1). Gene flow between populations within the regions for the sexually reproducing species was suggested by lower II (0.005-0.07 and 0.008-0.1) estimates than those of S. purpurea (0.09 and 0.13). Even though the lowest paired FST (0.002-0.05) and ST (0.002-0.12) values were found between the northeastern forest and homegarden populations for the three species, the dendrogram, Bayesian assignment, and K-Means analyses suggest that the least differentiated populations are southwestern forest and homegarden populations of B. alicastrum and S. purpurea, and the southwestern forest and northeastern homegarden of C. dodecandra. The sexual reproduction, biotic interactions, and extensive management of B. alicastrum and C. dodecandra in the agroforestry and the urban systems may contribute to connectivity between wild and domesticated populations, while in S. purpurea this connectivity is interrupted by the clonal propagation of the species in the homegardens.

TI  - Admixture of hybrid swarms of native and introduced lizards in cities is determined by the cityscape structure and invasion history
PY  - 2018
AB  - Introductions of non-native lineages increase opportunities for hybridization. Non-native lineages of the common wall lizard, Podarcis muralis, are frequently introduced in cities where they hybridize with native populations. We aimed at unravelling the invasion history and admixture of native and non-native wall lizards in four German cities using citywide, comprehensive sampling. We barcoded and genotyped 826 lizards and tested if gene flow in populations composed of admixed native and introduced lineages is facilitated by similar environmental factors to those in native populations by comparing fine-scale landscape genetic patterns. In cities with non-native lineages, lizards commonly occurred in numerous clusters of hybrid swarms, which showed variable lineage composition, consisting of up to four distinct evolutionary lineages. Hybrid swarms held vast genetic diversity and showed recent admixture with other hybrid swarms. Landscape genetic analyses showed differential effects of cityscape structures across cities, but identified water bodies as strong barriers to gene flow in both native and admixed populations. By contrast, railway tracks facilitated gene flow of admixed populations only. Our study shows that cities represent unique settings for hybridization, caused by multiple introductions of non-native taxa. Cityscape structure and invasion histories of cities will determine future evolutionary pathways at these novel hybrid zones. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Widespread genetic connectivity in Australia’s most common owl, despite extensive habitat fragmentation
PY  - 2020
AB  - Reductions in genetic diversity and genetic connectivity have been documented in some predatory bird species in response to anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. The Southern Boobook (Ninox boobook) is the most common and widely-distributed owl in Australia but declines in abundance have been observed across its range. We used polymorphic microsatellite loci to investigate landscape-scale patterns of genetic variation and spatial genetic structure in boobooks from a variety of fragmented landscape types and relatively undisturbed landscape types across Western Australia. The maximum distance between collection locations of genetic samples was 1391 km. Indirect estimates of connectivity inferred from these genetic data were complemented by direct estimates of post-breeding dispersal of juvenile boobooks gathered from banding data resulting from this and other studies across Australia. We found high genetic diversity in microsatellite markers, weak spatial genetic structuring and no evidence of genetic erosion associated with inbreeding in heavily fragmented landscapes. Bayesian modelling, spatial autocorrelation analysis and principal coordinates analysis suggested a single large panmictic population across all areas sampled. Within the heavily fragmented landscape of an extensive urban area, band re-sightings and recoveries substantiate the considerable capacity of juvenile boobooks to disperse across areas far greater than the distance between patches. We hypothesise that the genetic homogeneity observed in this species is a consequence of long-distance dispersal capacity in addition to their ability as habitat and dietary generalists to make use of highly altered habitats. © 2020 BirdLife Australia.

TI  - Urbanization as a facilitator of gene flow in a human health pest
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban fragmentation can reduce gene flow that isolates populations, reduces genetic diversity and increases population differentiation, all of which have negative conservation implications. Alternatively, gene flow may actually be increased among urban areas consistent with an urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter pests are able to thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing human-mediated transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population genetic approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic connectivity in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model of human health concern. We collected genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism variation from mitochondrial and nuclear double-digest RAD (ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals sampled from 11 urban and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western United States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic, and network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population genetic diversity, lower between-population genetic differentiation and higher estimates of genetic connectivity. Social network analyses show that urban locales not only have more connections, but can act as hubs that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, which show signatures of historical isolation. These results are consistent with an urban facilitation model of gene flow and demonstrate the importance of sampling multiple cities and markers to identify the role that urbanization has had on larger spatial scales. As the urban landscape continues to grow, this approach will help determine what factors influence the spread and adaptation of pests, like the venomous black widow spider, in building policies for human and biodiversity health. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Population genetic structure of black-tailed prairie dogs, a highly interactive species, in fragmented urban habitat
PY  - 2010
AB  - Fragmentation of wildlife populations can have detrimental effects, including genetic differentiation of populations, loss of genetic diversity, and inbreeding depression. We evaluated the genetic structure among isolated colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) along an urban gradient in southern Denver, Colorado. Urban colonies are important ecologically and for educational purposes, and they serve as source populations for relocation efforts. Levels of genetic differentiation between colonies were high relative to colonies in natural habitat at comparable or greater distances. Prairie dog colonies depend on dispersal among colonies for long-term persistence, and we found evidence for reduced but measurable rates of movement of individual prairie dogs among urban fragments. We observed a trend for smaller and more isolated colonies to exhibit lower genetic diversity, but we did not detect inbreeding in any of the colonies sampled. Isolation-by-distance measures, including measures based on permeability of various features of urban habitat such as roads and development, did not explain genetic differences. Our system represents a possible end point in the genetic consequences of continued loss and isolation of prairie dog colonies as fragmentation increases in both urban and natural landscapes. Urban development could affect dispersal in unexpected and complex ways and requires further study, but prairie dog colonies and their associated wildlife communities in urban areas have the potential for long-term persistence if not extirpated by human activity. © 2009 American Society of Mammalogists.

TI  - Canals as ecological corridors and hybridization zones for two cyprinid species
PY  - 2019
AB  - Predicted increases in the human population, in a context of climatic change and limiting freshwater resources, have raised awareness of the need to preserve aquatic ecosystems, their functions, and the biodiversity they harbor. The ecological reconciliation approach proposes the long-term co-existence of biodiversity preservation and the development of human activities. We investigated the ecological and evolutionary contributions of irrigation and hydroelectric canals in the highly fragmented and regulated Durance River (Rhône basin, Southern France), to the genetic diversity patterns of two interbreeding cyprinid species, the native Parachondrostoma toxostoma, and the introduced Chondrostoma nasus species. We observed a high degree of genetic homogeneity along the length of the river. The maintenance of gene flow despite the presence of dams, and the detection of admixed populations and hybridization events in canals suggest that these canals may act as ecological corridors and hybrid zones with the potential to influence genetic resources for the native and introduced species. These anthropogenic structures vary considerably in terms of their spatial organization, size, and overall management, increasing habitat diversity in the urbanized section of river. Together with the restoration of natural habitats, canals can be considered as important structures for biodiversity dynamic in such urban conditions. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Synergistic effects of climate and human-induced landscape changes on the spatial distribution of an endangered dung beetle
PY  - 2022
AB  - Introduction: The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) is undergoing alarming deforestation, land overexploitation, and unregulated occupation. The Coastal Sandy Vegetation of BAF, known as Restinga, is under the most pressure of the BAF ecosystems. Understanding the effects of Restinga deforestation on biodiversity is a conservation priority. Aims/Methods: We predicted the effect of landscape modifications on the large-scale spatial distribution of an endangered dung beetle (Dichotomius schiffleri) endemic to the BAF Restinga ecosystem. We tested the hypothesis that almost all the potential distribution area of this species has suffered from landscape modification, and reduced its spatial distribution. We used niche-based modeling approaches to predict the potential species distribution (climate-based models) and the species distribution under the current land-use scenario (landscape-based models). We then combined these models to predict the effects of landscape modification. Results: The spatial distribution of D. schiffleri has decreased drastically as a consequence of landscape modification. The decreasing patch size, canopy cover percentage, and functional connectivity, and the increasing edge distance explain the decrease in the potential species distribution as predicted by climate variables. Discussion: Suitable sites for this species are isolated in a vast matrix of pasture, tree plantations, and urban areas. D. schiffleri is sensitive to anthropogenic changes such as disturbances of preserved Restinga areas. Therefore, human coastal-plain land uses over the past five centuries pose multiple synergistic threats to the persistence of this species. Implications for insect conservation: Our findings suggest an alarming trend toward species extinction in the near future, highlighting the need for specific conservation actions to protect Restinga biodiversity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Loss of genetic connectivity and diversity in urban microreserves in a southern California endemic Jerusalem cricket (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae: Stenopelmatus n. sp. \"santa monica\")
PY  - 2009
AB  - Microreserves may be useful in protecting native arthropod diversity in urbanized landscapes. However, species that do not disperse through the urban matrix may eventually be lost from these fragments. Population extinctions may be precipitated by an increase in genetic differentiation among fragments and loss of genetic diversity within fragments, and these effects should become stronger with time. We analyzed population genetic structure in the dispersal limited Jerusalem cricket Stenopelmatus n. sp. \"santa monica\" in the Santa Monica Mountains and Simi Hills north of Los Angeles, California (CA), to determine the impacts of fragmentation over the past 70 years. MtDNA divergence was greater among urban fragments than within contiguous habitat and was positively correlated with fragment age. MtDNA genetic diversity within fragments increased with fragment size and decreased with fragment age. Genetic divergence across 38 anonymous nuclear Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) loci was influenced by the presence of major highways and highway age, but there was no effect of additional urban fragmentation. ISSR diversity was not correlated with fragment size or age. Differing results between markers may be due to male-biased dispersal, or different effective population sizes, sorting rates, or mutation rates among sampled genes. Results suggest that genetic connectivity among populations has been disrupted by highways and urban development, prior to declines in local population sizes. We emphasize that genetic connectivity can rapidly erode in fragmented landscapes and that flightless arthropods can serve as sensitive indicators for these effects. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

TI  - Isolation-by-distance and male-biased dispersal at a fine spatial scale: a study of the common European adder (Vipera berus) in a rural landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - Human activities have a major impact on habitat connectivity and landscape structure. In this context, it is critical to better understand animal movements and gene flow to develop appropriate conservation and land management measures. It is also important to better understand difference between sexes in space use and spatial scale of dispersal. We studied the common adder (Vipera berus), an elusive snake species with low mobility that is facing a substantial decline in Europe. A systematic sampling was carried out to clarify the dispersal pattern at a fine spatial scale (10 × 7 km2) in a rural landscape with both semi-natural (preserved heathlands, hedgerow networks) and degraded (crops, roads) habitats. Based on 280 captured adults and using 11 microsatellite markers, we detected no marked genetic differentiation, however, we detected relatively strong isolation-by-distance (IBD). Under IBD, we quantified a low neighborhood size (Ns ≈ 50) associated with limited natal dispersal (σ ≤ 1 km). We detected sex-biased dispersal in favor of males, but the pattern was dependent on the spatial scale considered. Our results also suggest that there is higher genetic diversity in the preserved habitat, notably among males. Overall, our study underlines the importance of sex variation in dispersal, and the spatial scale of landscape effects. This contrast between sexes should be considered to improve functional connectivity at fine spatial scales for reptile conservation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Brownsville common yellowthroats maintain genetic diversity in a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2013
AB  - Habitat fragmentation is particularly severe in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas, where greater than 90% of the native wetland habitat has been replaced by agriculture and urban development. The Brownsville Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas insperata), a rare subspecies of the Common Yellowthroat restricted to this area, is a good model for studying the effects of this extensive fragmentation on avian genetics and ecology. In this study, three hypotheses addressing genetics and habitat fragmentation were tested: (1) the density of Brownsville Yellowthroats is greatest along the Rio Grande rather than away from the river; (2) individuals found on or near the Rio Grande are more closely related than individuals farther away; and (3) a source-sink metapopulation model is best fit to describe the population dynamics of this subspecies. We used 15 microsatellites to examine the genetic diversity of 128 individuals from Cameron and Hidalgo Counties (Texas) sampled during 2008-2009. The densities of yellowthroats at sites near the Rio Grande were not significantly different from densities at sites farther from the river. Genetic analysis indicated that individuals were as related to each other as would be expected in distant relatives and indicated the presence of a single, admixed population. The results suggest that the Brownsville Common Yellowthroat is able to move freely among isolated habitat patches and that wetlands along the Rio Grande do not act as an exclusive corridor for this species. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

TI  - Population genetic diversity of the clonal self-incompatible herbaceous plant Linaria vulgaris along an urbanization gradient
PY  - 2015
AB  - How increasing urbanization affects biodiversity is one of the most understudied aspects of global change biology. It is, however, known that it may negatively affect plant population genetic diversity in numerous ways, for example through its negative effects on plant population size, between-population connectivity, and reproductive success. Therefore, it is important to investigate to what extent different levels of urbanization result in these negative phenomena. Here we used microsatellite markers to investigate urbanization effects on the population genetic structure of 23 populations of the self-incompatible, partially clonal herb Linaria vulgaris which were sampled across a gradient of urbanization. Clonal diversity as measured by the Pareto-parameter varied between 1.11 and 2.97 and was negatively correlated to both the degree of urbanization and to population size. Urbanization and population size were not interrelated. The least clonally rich populations also experienced significantly reduced seed set. Irrespective of the degree of urbanization, L. vulgaris populations exhibited strong genetic differentiation (FST = 0.33) and there was no significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances, suggesting low gene flow among populations. In conclusion, we showed that urbanization negatively affected fitness of L. vulgaris populations through decreasing their clonal diversity and reproductive success, an effect that may be exacerbated by the low gene flow between populations. Although the effect was modest, the results could probably be extrapolated to bigger cities where it would be considerably more pronounced. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.

TI  - From the Source to the Outlet: understanding the Distribution of Invasive Knotweeds along a North American River
PY  - 2016
AB  - Understanding the drivers of exotic plant invasions along waterways is crucial for helping environmental managers devise effective control strategies. We combined a field survey, molecular data and a logistic regression model to further our understanding of the spatial distribution of Japanese (Fallopia japonica) and Bohemian (Fallopia × bohemica) knotweeds along the entire course (185 km) of a river located in Québec (Canada). Both knotweeds were abundant along the river, but each had a distinct spatial distribution pattern. Only one genotype for each knotweed species or hybrid was found, suggesting that the individuals established along the Chaudière River resulted from the propagation of rhizome or stem fragments. The distance from the nearest town or village was the only explanatory variable significantly correlated to the spatial distribution of knotweeds. However, spatial autoregressive coefficients were significant, indicating that knotweeds were more likely to occur close to other knotweeds. In summary, the invasion was probably initiated by the introduction, in riverside towns and villages, of a few individuals of the same genotype. The clones then spread vegetatively, probably during spring floods. The rhizome and stem fragments spread over short distances, dispersing downstream from urban centres. The introduction of just two knotweed genotypes along the Chaudière River was sufficient to initiate a massive riverside colonization, as few riparian vegetation types were apparently able to resist knotweed invasion.

TI  - Landscapes drive the dispersal of Monochamus alternatus, vector of the pinewood nematode, revealed by whole-genome resequencing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Pine wilt disease (PWD), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is an extremely threatening invasion forest disease throughout the world, especially in Asia. B. xylophilus is spread in Asia by vector beetles of Monochamus alternatus, which has long no effective control method. Understanding of landscape effects on the dispersal and outbreaks of forest pests is crucial to establishing effective ecological control strategies. Here, we analyzed the samples of M. alternatus collected in a fine-scale in order to estimate the effects of landscape types on the genetic structure and dispersal of M. alternatus. The landscapes included the geographical scales, forest types and land uses. The individuals of M. alternatus were genotyped by using whole-genome resequencing. Population genetic structures were clearly differentiated at the range of 250 kms, suggesting the intermediate scale is an effective barrier against natural dispersal of M. alternatus. We used the least-cost distances, least-cost transect analysis, and distance-based redundancy analysis to estimate the effects of forest types and land uses within the fine scales. The results showed that the gene flow and genetic diversity were positively correlated with host and mixed forests, whereas negatively with non-host forests. Among land-use landscapes, the roads had the positive effect on gene flow and genetic diversity but farmland and urban uses had negative effects. This highlights that human-mediated transport via roads was likely to be the main factor leading to the long-distance invasion of M. alternatus, whereas non-host landscapes could suppress the spread of this species. These findings may be useful to control the PWD dispersed by M. alternatus. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Reduced genetic diversity and isolation of remnant ocelot populations occupying a severely fragmented landscape in southern Texas
PY  - 2011
AB  - The ocelot Leopardus pardalis has become a conservation priority in the US as a result of severe population decline and loss of habitat during the 20th century. Only two small populations remain in this country. Their short-term viability is threatened by the disappearance of dense thornshrub communities, human-caused mortality and demographic stochasticity. The influence these factors have on ocelot persistence must be considered to develop effective conservation initiatives. We therefore examined neutral genetic diversity and connectivity among ocelots in the US and northeastern Mexico using 25 autosomal microsatellites and a 395-bp segment of the mitochondrial control region. Genetic variation was lowest in the population occurring on Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, Texas (autosomal microsatellite HE = 0.399 and mtDNA-haplotype diversity = 0) and highest in northeastern Mexico (0.637 and 0.73, respectively), while intermediate on private lands in Willacy County, Texas (0.553 and 0.252, respectively). Significant genetic differentiation between the two Texas populations was observed, despite their close proximity (� 30 km). Both populations were also significantly divergent from northeastern Mexico. The absence of any detectable gene flow implies that the human modified landscape of the Lower Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas acts as a strong barrier to ocelot movement, disrupting metapopulation dynamics and contributing to loss of diversity. As a consequence, continued genetic erosion among the Texas populations is expected. The lack of movement through the fragmented landscape also suggests it is unlikely ocelots will recolonize unoccupied habitat patches along the Lower Rio Grande and the delta interior where agriculture and urban land uses predominate. The continued rapid development will exacerbate this problem. These factors threaten the persistence of the Texas populations and limit their recovery. Translocations are necessary to link ocelot populations in the US.

TI  - Response of Beetle Assemblages (Insecta: Coleoptera) to Patch Characteristics and Habitat Complexity in an Ever-Expanding Urban Landscape in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico
PY  - 2021
AB  - Insect diversity levels and change in remnant urban habitats have been poorly examined in Neotropical regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity and composition of foliage/shrub dwelling beetles (Insecta: Coleoptera) regarding the influence of patch attributes (i.e., patch size, connectivity, and surrounding matrix) and within-patch habitat complexity, in an urban landscape at Chetumal, Yucatán peninsula, Mexico. Despite the potential species-specific responses to urban landscape pattern, our study reveals that there are effects of patch spatial features and habitat complexity on overall beetle diversity. These effects are as follows: 1) relatively larger urban patches contained higher overall beetle richness, 2) beetle species composition varied significantly regarding understory vegetation structure and tree richness, and 3) patches of intermediate vegetation age had highest beetle richness. This research provides a case study of patch and habitat features related to Neotropical insect assemblages in urban settlements, underlying the importance of using ecological information to offer management recommendations in ever-expanding urban tropical settlements. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - Riparian plant composition in an urbanizing landscape in southern California, U.S.A
PY  - 2008
AB  - In coastal southern California, natural riparian corridors occur in a landscape mosaic comprised of human land uses (mainly urban and suburban development) interspersed among undeveloped areas, primarily native shrublands. We asked, does the composition of the landscape surrounding a riparian survey point influence plant species distribution, community composition, or habitat structure? We expected, for example, that invasive non-native species might be more abundant as the amount of surrounding urbanization increased. We surveyed 137 points in riparian vegetation in Orange County, California, along an urbanization gradient. Using logistic regression we analyzed 79 individual plant species' distributions, finding 20 negatively associated and 12 positively associated with the amount of development within a 1-km radius around the survey points, even after accounting for the effects of elevation. However, after summarizing plant community composition with Detrended Correspondence Analysis we observed that, overall, community composition was not statistically correlated with the amount of development surrounding a survey point once the association between development and elevation was taken into account. Non-native species were not particularly associated with increasing development, but instead were distributed throughout vegetation and urbanization gradients. However, the extent of the tree and herb layers (structural attributes) was associated with development, with the tree layer increasing and the herb layer decreasing as urbanization increased. Thus, although the degree of surrounding urbanization appears to influence the distribution of a number of individual plant species, overall composition of the community in our study system seemed relatively unaffected. Instead, we suggest that community composition reflected larger-scale environmental conditions, such as stream order and other variables associated with elevation, and/or regional-scale disturbances, such as historic grazing or enhanced atmospheric deposition of nitrogen. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Identifying habitats and corridors of an invasive plant, Ageratina altissima, in an urban forest
PY  - 2019
AB  - The spread of invasive plants in urban forests is of great concern to land managers and ecologists. Here, we analyse the distribution pattern and potential occurrence of a problematic invasive plant, Ageratina altissima, on Mt. Umyeon, in the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea, using multiple species distribution modelling with geographic information system layers and a time series of Landsat 8 satellite imagery data. Also, we identify this species’ potential dispersal corridors using a network-based landscape lattice approach. All five species distribution models performed well with a range of test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.843–0.899 with an average of 0.876. Distance from trails had the greatest effect on its occurrence probability, and generally exerted a negative influence within ca. 20 m of trails, indicating that urban forest trails facilitate the spread of invasive plants. Of the remote sensing-based predictors used, 7 August 2016 tasselled cap brightness index was an important variable having a negative effect on the presence of A. altissima. Elevation generally had a positive effect on its presence, although it was less important than tasselled cap brightness index. We explicitly detected the distribution pattern of high invasion risk corridors, mostly located on or around trails, which follow the central ridgeline of the study area. The results and approaches employed here can be useful for understanding, monitoring, and predicting invasive plant distribution and spread for the management of urban natural resources and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Disrupted fine-scale population processes in fragmented landscapes despite large-scale genetic connectivity for a widespread and common cooperative breeder: The superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus)
PY  - 2013
AB  - Understanding how habitat fragmentation affects population processes (e.g. dispersal) at different spatial scales is of critical importance to conservation. We assessed the effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal and regional and fine-scale population structure in a currently widespread and common cooperatively breeding bird species found across south-eastern Australia, the superb fairy-wren Malurus cyaneus. Despite its relative abundance and classification as an urban tolerant species, the superb fairy-wren has declined disproportionately from low tree-cover agricultural landscapes across the Box-Ironbark region of north-central Victoria, Australia. Loss of genetic connectivity and disruption to its complex social system may be associated with the decline of this species from apparently suitable habitat in landscapes with low levels of tree cover. To assess whether reduced structural connectivity has had negative consequences for genetic connectivity in the superb fairy-wren, we used a landscape-scale approach to compare patterns of genetic diversity and gene flow at large (landscape/regional) and fine (site-level) spatial scales. In addition, using genetic distances, for each sex, we tested landscape models of decreased dispersal through treeless areas (isolation-by-resistance) while controlling for the effect of isolation-by-distance. Landscape models indicated that larger-scale gene flow across the Box-Ironbark region was constrained by distance rather than by lack of structural connectivity. Nonetheless, a pattern of isolation-by-resistance for males (the less-dispersive sex) and lower genetic diversity and higher genetic similarity within sites in low-cover fragmented landscapes indicated disruption to fine-scale gene flow mechanisms and/or mating systems. Although loss of structural connectivity did not appear to impede gene flow at larger spatial scales, fragmentation appeared to affect fine-scale population processes (e.g. local gene flow mechanisms and/or mating systems) adversely and may contribute to the decline of superb fairy-wrens in fragmented landscapes in the Box-Ironbark region. © 2012 The Authors.

TI  - Towards Ecological Management and Sustainable Urban Planning in Seoul, South Korea: Mapping Wild Pollinator Habitat Preferences and Corridors Using Citizen Science Data
PY  - 2022
AB  - The preservation and restoration of habitats and ecological connectivity inside cities is crucial to ensure wildlife can find suitable areas to forage, rest and reproduce, as well as to disperse, thereby allowing metapopulation functioning. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul and with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities. Using species distribution modeling and landscape graph approaches, we located the main habitats and corridors to reinforce connectivity for six pollinator families. Finally, we identified habitats and corridors where conservation actions should be prioritized. In total, 178 species belonging to 128 genera and 60 families were observed. Hymenopterans were the most recorded, followed by dipterans and lepidopterans. The most suitable habitats for pollinators were constituted of public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. In a dense city like Seoul, most of the conservation corridors are located in built-up areas. Innovative urban planning and architecture are therefore required as well as the setting-up of ecological management practices to lead to a more sustainable urbanism for pollinators and wildlife in general. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Factors influencing bird distribution among isolated woodlots on a heterogeneous landscape in Saitama Pref., Japan
PY  - 1998
AB  - Bird communities on the 20 fragmented woodlots in a suburban area were surveyed in the Tokorozawa City, Central Japan, to analyze the factors that influenced the distribution of birds. Our results showed that woodlot area is an important predictor of the number of individuals and the species richness of birds in each woodlot. Based on the species composition of birds in wintering season, the fragmented woodlots were classified into four types by TWINSPAN: those are core woodlots, woodlots surrounding core ones, isolated and small woodlots, and isolated and middle-sized woodlots. By canonical discriminant analysis, it was indicated that the connectivity between woodlots and the vegetation structure are also important factors influencing bird communities. The necessity of controlling these factors for avian conservation was pointed out.

TI  - Do species distribution models predict species richness in urban and natural green spaces? A case study using amphibians
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urban green spaces are potentially important to biodiversity conservation because they could provide patches of high quality habitat or connectivity to nearby habitat. Presence-only species distribution models (SDMs) represent a potential tool for assessing the biodiversity value of urban green space; however, there is limited research to validate SDM results with field surveys to see if the predictions accurately represent observed species richness. We generated a range of SDMs using multiple suitability thresholds for 23 species of amphibians that occur in southwest, Ohio, USA. The distributions were overlaid to enumerate species richness. We surveyed 20 sites for amphibian species to evaluate model predictions. Our models over-predicted species richness relative to survey data. For example, we observed a mean pairwise difference of 14 species between models of species richness and observed values. Our results suggest either SDMs built with landscape variables we selected did not represent accurately amphibian richness, or the amphibian surveys did not detect all species present. Analyzing sites that had more than three sampling events suggests the explanation of inadequate sampling effort is only partially correct. Differences such as that between predicted and observed values of species richness is a challenge for land managers and conservation biologists that need a tool for modeling biodiversity. Species distribution models did project relative species richness well in urban and non-urban green space, which suggests this technique offers a spatially explicit way to identify more species rich areas and may help managers and conservation biologists manage systems with greater efficiency. © 2012.

TI  - Fine-scale changes in spatial habitat use by a low-density koala population in an isolated periurban forest remnant
PY  - 2018
AB  - Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) populations in south-east Queensland are in decline. Although various studies have looked at broad-scale tree preference and habitat quality, there has been little attempt to quantify fine-scale activity shifts from one year to the next or examination of activity at the mesoscale. This study quantified koala activity levels in a 909-ha forest patch at Karawatha Forest Park, in south Brisbane. The Spot Assessment Technique was used to quantify activity and tree selection on 33 long-term monitoring plots in 2009 and 2010. In total, 843 trees were searched and koala pellets were found underneath 34 and 47 trees in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A higher proportion of pellets was found underneath Eucalyptus tindaliae and E. fibrosa and there was weak selection for larger trees. A low occurrence of revisits and a minor shift in activity distribution from 2009 to 2010 indicate that the koala population exists at a low density. Rapid declines in koala populations are occurring in primary habitats. Hence, stable low-density koala populations are important for maintaining genetic diversity and connectivity in fragmented urban landscapes. © Australian Mammal Society 2018.

TI  - Urban power line corridors as novel habitats for grassland and alien plant species in South-Western Finland
PY  - 2015
AB  - Regularly managed electric power line corridors may provide habitats for both earlysuccessional grassland plant species and disturbance-dependent alien plant species. These habitats are especially important in urban areas, where they can help conserve native grassland species and communities in urban greenspace. However, they can also provide further footholds for potentially invasive alien species that already characterize urban areas. In order to implement power line corridors into urban conservation, it is important to understand which environmental conditions in the corridors favor grassland species and which alien species. Likewise it is important to know whether similar environmental factors in the corridors control the species composition of the two groups.We conducted a vegetation study in a 43 kilometer long urban power line corridor network in south-western Finland, and used generalized linear models and distance-based redundancy analysis to determine which environmental factors best predict the occurrence and composition of grassland and alien plant species in the corridors. The results imply that old corridors on dry soils and steep slopes characterized by a history as open areas and pastures are especially suitable for grassland species. Corridors suitable for alien species, in turn, are characterized by productive soils and abundant light and are surrounded by a dense urban fabric. Factors controlling species composition in the two groups are somewhat correlated, with the most important factors including light abundance, soil moisture, soil calcium concentration and soil productivity. The results have implications for grassland conservation and invasive alien species control in urban areas. © 2015 Lampinen et al.

PY  - 2021
AB  - We investigated the genetic variability and differentiation among 12 Ae. aegypti populations collected within the Madurai city in Tamil Nadu state of Southern India. Genotyping of 12 microsatellite markers in 353 individual samples showed moderate levels of genetic diversity among 12 populations. UPGMA tree, hierarchical clustering, Bayesian clustering and Discriminant Analysis on Principal Components roughly divided these populations into two genetic clusters: main city populations and the populations located at the border of the corporation limit. Significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distance was observed among 12 populations, however, the correlation was non-significant within each genetic cluster. Population assignment and divMigrate graph depicted less migration between two groups. Overall, the findings of this study provided an overview of Ae. aegypti population structure within an urban setting in India that have implications in effective implementation of vector control in the city area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Biotic homogenization and differentiation of the flora in artificial and near-natural habitats across urban green spaces
PY  - 2013
AB  - Shenzhen, a new city existed for less than three decades, experienced dramatic biological invasions of alien plants resulting from the construction of urban green spaces. In an investigation of plant species from 390 plots in 186 sites across five main types of green space (public parks, forests, vegetation corridors, residential and industrial area), a total of 474 plant species, including 221 alien species (46.6%), were recorded. Our study witnessed the spread and establishment of alien species across all urban green spaces and revealed significantly greater proportions of alien species in artificial green spaces than in natural ones. Furthermore, we found the positive relationship between native and alien species richness existed across all the green spaces and was particularly prevalent in the artificial ones. Additionally, successful establishment of alien species instigated by anthropogenic disturbances and most frequent species assemblages caused biotic homogenization in the artificial habitats. In contrast, biotic differentiation in the near-natural habitats was still preserved due to a greater level of protection for native species, which showed some resistance against the establishment of alien species. Therefore, urbanization was proven distinct effects on the flora of artificial and near-natural habitats, coexisting in the new city. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effect of patch size and isolation on mating patterns and seed production in an urban population of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.)
PY  - 2010
AB  - Fragmentation is a critical issue for tree populations because the creation of small patches can reduce local population size and increase isolation, both of which can promote inbreeding and its negative consequences, as well as loss of genetic diversity. To test the hypothesis that patch size and isolation influence mating patterns or seed production in forest trees, we utilize the spatial array of trees of an urban population of Chinese Pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) planted in patches around Beijing. Our design includes 28 urban patches, with patch size ranging from 1 to 2000 adult trees and isolation (edge distance index) ranging from 37.5m to 245.8m. We examined the average number of seeds per cone and percentage of viable seed per cone for each patch as measures of seed production. By utilizing seven paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite loci, we estimated the mating pattern parameters for each patch, including the level of selfing, the amount of immigrant pollen and the effective number of pollen sources (Nep). Using a general linear model selection procedure based on AIC value, we found patch size was the best predictor of the selfing and immigration rate; smaller patches had a higher selfing and immigration rate. Small patches with one adult had relatively high Nep which indicates connectivity among urban patches. However, due to the reduced amount of immigrant pollen and limited diversity of local pollen, intermediate sized patches (with 5-10 adults) had the lowest Nep among the study patches. For patches with more than 10 adults, Nep was increased with patch size. The percentage of viable seeds per cone significantly decreased with patch size, indicating a possible negative consequence of inbreeding. The effect of patch size on mating patterns and seed production suggests that the patches of trees experience less connectivity than trees within continuous forest. These findings indicate that forest management practices should emphasize the maintenance of an optimal patch size because, despite the fact that tree species show the potential for long distance pollen movement, the number of local trees strongly influences the mating patterns. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The role of golf courses in maintaining genetic connectivity between common frog (Rana temporaria) populations in an urban setting
PY  - 2013
AB  - We studied population size, genetic diversity and differentiation of common frog (Rana temporaria) populations at urban golf courses and reference natural ponds in the greater Helsinki region, southern Finland. A total of 248 tadpoles from 12 locations (six golf courses, six reference sites) were genotyped with 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The most urban populations, situated in northern Helsinki, were the largest breeding sites having &gt;120 (golf courses) and &gt;200 (reference sites) spawn clumps at the time of sampling. On average, there was no difference in the number of spawns between the anthropogenic ponds at golf courses and the natural water bodies. Genetic variation within populations was substantial (H O = 0.68) while genetic differentiation between populations was low (F ST = 0.016; average distance = 17.6 km). The golf course populations did not differ from natural populations in terms of genetic variability or differentiation. Hence, our results suggest that golf courses contribute positively to urban amphibian populations by providing suitable water bodies for reproduction and green corridors for dispersal, thus preventing isolation and loss of genetic variability within populations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Linkages beyond borders: Targeting spatial processes in fragmented urban landscapes
PY  - 2008
AB  - Management of ecosystems often focuses on specific species chosen for their habitat demand, public appeal, or levels of threat. We propose a complementary framework for choosing focal species, the mobile link concept, which allows managers to focus on spatial processes and deal with multi-scale ecological dynamics. Spatial processes are important for three reasons: maintenance, re-organization, and restoration of ecological values. We illustrate the framework with a case study of the Eurasian Jay, a mobile link species of importance for the oak forest regeneration in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden, and its surroundings. The case study concludes with a conceptual model for how the framework can be applied in management. The model is based on a review of published data complemented with a seed predation experiment and mapping of Jay territories to reduce the risk of applying non-urban site-specific information in an urban setting. Our case study shows that the mobile link approach has several advantages: (1) Reducing the vulnerability of ecological functions to disturbances and fluctuations in resources allocated to management, (2) Reducing management costs by maintaining natural processes, and (3) Maintaining gene flow and genetic diversity at a landscape level. We argue that management that includes mobile link organisms is an important step towards the prevention of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Identifying and managing mobile links is a way to align management with the ecologically relevant scales in any landscape. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Connectivity of public urban grasslands: implications for grassland conservation and restoration in cities
PY  - 2017
AB  - An important limitation of studies on the ecological value of urban habitats is the question of habitat connectivity. While connectivity allows spread and genetic exchange of species, isolation can lead to the extinction of populations through inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. However, while practitioners already start improving urban habitat patches by means of restoration, issues of connectivity have not been taken in account although being crucial for a self-sustaining habitat network. In our study, we evaluate the connectivity of public urban grasslands such as lawns, grasslands in residential areas, playgrounds or parks in the city of Münster, Germany. Employing a graph theory approach, which uses a map (graph) of habitat patches to calculate functional connectivity measures using patch area size and patch connectivity, we studied four groups of different plant dispersal distances (2 m, 20 m, 44 m and 100 m). This approach can be recommended for planning issues due to the output of different indicator values and comparably low data demands. Our results show for the first time, that connectivity of urban grasslands is extremely low for species of short-distance dispersal but slightly increases for long-distance dispersal. Except two larger conglomerations of well-connected patches, urban grasslands were found to be mostly sparsely connected. Thus, future research should focus on options to improve connectivity and to prioritize patches for ecological improvement. The graph theory approach turned out to be a useful tool to analyse urban habitat connectivity but also to illustrate results obtained. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Genetic structure in neotropical birds with different tolerance to urbanization
PY  - 2022
AB  - Gene flow in birds can be affected by urbanization depending on natural history traits and adaptability to habitat change. Contrasting results can be expected when comparing species with opposite resilience to urbanization. In this study, we assessed genetic diversity and structure for two bird species, the urban avoider white-eared ground-sparrow, Melozone leucotis, and the urban dweller house wren Troglodytes aedon. We used seven microsatellite loci and sampled five locations with differing levels of urbanization in Costa Rica. We found considerably higher genetic structure in white-eared ground-sparrows than in house wrens. Circuit theory analyses proved a higher isolation from urban resistance for the white-eared ground-sparrow than for house wrens. These results support that urbanization is a significant barrier for gene flow in urban avoiders, in contrast to urban dweller species that showed little to no impact. Differences could be attributed to a higher plasticity in habitat and nesting site preferences in the house wren, and significant dispersal limitation for the white-eared ground-sparrow. These results emphasize the need for conservation strategies towards white-eared ground-sparrows and other urban avoider species whose habitat and connectivity have been reduced by the recent urban expansion. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - From rainforest to wasteland in 100 years: The limnological legacy of the Queenstown mines, Western Tasmania
PY  - 2000
AB  - Areas within the rainforests of south-west Tasmania, home to Aboriginal tribes for more than 36,000 years, were dramatically changed in the late 1800s with the arrival of European prospectors. Subsequent large-scale mining and smelting operations resulted in acid rain, local deforestation and extensive soil erosion. Much of the area is now bare rock. The aims of this study were to examine the terrestrial and lacustrine responses to industrial acidification and deforestation as revealed by a sediment core from 'Owen Tarn', a small cirque lake down-wind of the mining town of Queenstown, and adjacent to a World Heritage Area. Terrestrial responses were investigated using pollen analysis to document both the state of the rainforest before and after the arrival of the Europeans. Limnological responses were documented by examining changes in diatom communities in the core. Results show both the terrestrial vegetation and the aquatic microscopic vegetation have been considerably modified by mining activities in the last 100 years. Pollen analysis provides a chronology of industrial deforestation and diatom analysis shows changes in species composition and a decline in species richness. Indirect ordination (PCA) of sediment diatom assemblages in the core with autecological data from 76 Tasmanian highland lakes (TASDIAT) reveals that diatom assemblages in the bottom parts of the core are analogous to those of Tasmanian oligotrophic 'corridor lakes' while recent species assemblages are similar to those of acidic Tasmanian 'western lakes'. Although a number of 'cosmopolitan' species indicative of lake acidification in the northern hemisphere are present in Owen Tarn, acidification has resulted in a different species response. In the most recent sediments the assemblage is dominated by Eunotia species in which valve deformation is manifest. These are a possible response to chemical stress. Lower abundances of deformed diatoms occur in the surface sediments and there is an increase in pollen from herbaceous taxa which reflects the revegetation of the catchment. Both responses are consistent first signs of recovery of the lake and revegetation of the catchment following the cessation of smelting activities in 1969. The most recent diatom assemblages in Owen Tarn (top 1.5 cm) resemble those of L. Spicer and L. Dora in the nearby Tyndall range. It cannot be excluded that these, and other lakes in the World Heritage Area, may have experienced some degree of ecological change as a result of long-range pollution from historic smelting activities.

TI  - Urbanization influences small mammal composition, but not species richness in forest fragments in Accra, Ghana
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Accra Plain of Ghana is experiencing rapid urbanization, but there is scant information on its impact on local biodiversity. We assessed the changes in land use/land cover of the Accra Plain since 1991 and evaluated how the observed changes have influenced local small mammals in forest fragments. We applied supervised classification and intensity analysis time-series Landsat imagery data to assess land use/land cover changes between 1991 and 2017. Small mammals were surveyed in two forest fragments, the Pinkwae and Adumanya forests from June 2019 to January 2020, using capture-mark-recapture technique. We compared our data with baseline data gathered in 1991-1992, when large areas of the city remained mostly undeveloped. Our data revealed that the urban area has increased by 832%, while the forest area declined by 85% between 1991 and 2017. The Pinkwae and Adumanya forests, which covered 120 and 1.5 ha, respectively, in 1991 have each been reduced to < 1 ha. We found changes in the small mammal species composition in the forest fragments, but not species richness due to species turnover. Grammomys poensis and Dephomys defua are first records for the Accra Plain. Our data suggested that small forest fragments within the urbanizing landscape are important for maintaining the local small mammal species. For the conservation of local small mammals in urbanizing landscapes, it is important to maintain the greatest possible number of small forest fragments and establish policies that prevent forest remnants from being further depleted.

TI  - High thematic resolution land use change models refine biodiversity scenarios: A case study with Belgian bumblebees
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aim: Projections of biodiversity scenarios often rely solely on climate change to inform species distribution shifts in the future. Land use projections are rarely used due to their unavailability and, when available, are often at coarse spatial and thematic resolutions, making them unsuitable to capture fine scale habitat suitability. This study aims to (a) show how coupled land use change (LUC) models of high thematic resolution (HTR) can be used in species distribution models (SDM), (b) compare the impacts of HTR and low thematic resolution (LTR) explanatory predictors on biodiversity scenarios and (c) assess the impact of species' present area of occupancy on the effect of thematic resolution in SDMs. Location: Belgium. Taxon: Bumblebees (Bombus). Methods: We compared species distribution models with 17 land use predictors (HTR) against models with 5 land use predictors (LTR). We modelled the distribution of 17 bumblebee species in Belgium projected until 2035. We examined how model performance, variable importance and projections of distribution change differed depending on the thematic resolution of the land use predictors. Results: Overall, HTR models performed better than LTR models. LTR models predicted greater extent per species. HTR projected a greater percentage of range gains, and both models projected similar losses of suitable habitat. However, the percentage loss and connectivity of suitable habitats varied differently for HTR and LTR models along a gradient of rare to common species. The HTR models projected greater loss of suitable areas for rare species and less loss for common species compared to LTR models. Main conclusions: These results illustrate the importance of using ecologically relevant explanatory variables in SDMs, particularly for rare and localized species with specific habitat requirements. The results also indicate the need for large-scale LUC projections to improve future biodiversity scenarios under climate change and to improve the ability of conservationists and policymakers to use SDM projections. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Shoreline infrastructure degradation and increasing littoral naturalization accommodates juvenile fish and crab assemblages in heavily urbanized Upper New York Harbor
PY  - 2020
AB  - Many estuarine shorelines are influenced by urbanization. Extensive shoreline modification in Upper New York Harbor (UNYH) included port development, landfilling marshes, and armoring. Recent sedimentation in constructed shipping terminal embayments, abandonment of shoreline structure maintenance, subsequent recruitment of upland and intertidal vegetation, and restoration projects have naturalized some shorelines in this urban setting. We determined the species composition and relative abundance of fishes and crabs in shallow shoreline habitats in constructed embayments of UNYH with seine sampling to determine the potential for restoring similar isolated shallow water sites as functional habitats. Twenty-seven identified species of fishes and crabs, including seasonally transient and resident marsh species, were represented in samples dominated by Menidia menidia, but marsh resident and coastal ocean species were also periodically abundant. Differences in assemblage structure among the sampled embayments as measured by principal components analysis were weak despite some differences in the slope and colonization of vegetation along shorelines. The mere presence of shallow shorelines was sufficient to recruit numerous species. Assemblage differences relative to a nearby relatively unaltered estuary revealed a lack of southern, warm affiliated species reflecting a natural clinal gradient. Marsh resident species dominated in UNYH, but not as strongly as at the reference estuary. Together with a previously published evaluation of life cycle connectivity for several sentinel species, this study shows that even small, isolated projects seeking to restore shallow shorelines add value to the estuarine landscape and are worth pursuing. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration

TI  - Mountain lions avoid burned areas and increase risky behavior after wildfire in a fragmented urban landscape
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban environments are high risk areas for large carnivores, where anthropogenic disturbances can reduce fitness and increase mortality risk.1 When catastrophic events like large wildfires occur, trade-offs between acquiring resources and avoiding risks of the urban environment are intensified. This landscape context could lead to an increase in risk-taking behavior by carnivores if burned areas do not allow them to meet their energetic needs, potentially leading to human-wildlife conflict.2,3 We studied mountain lion behavior using GPS location and accelerometer data from 17 individuals tracked before and after a large wildfire (the 2018 Woolsey Fire) within a highly urbanized area (Los Angeles, California, USA). After the wildfire, mountain lions avoided burned areas and increased behaviors associated with anthropogenic risk, including more frequent road and freeway crossings (mean crossings increased from 3 to 5 per month) and greater activity during the daytime (means from increased 10% to 16% of daytime active), a time when they are most likely to encounter humans. Mountain lions also increased their amount of space used, distance traveled (mean distances increased from 250 to 390 km per month), and intrasexual overlap, potentially putting them at risk of intraspecific conflict. Joint pressures from urbanization and severe wildfire, alongside resulting risk-taking, could thus increase mortality and extinction risk for populations already suffering from low genetic diversity, necessitating increased connectivity in fire-prone areas. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - The importance of genetic considerations for planning translocations of the rare coastal heath species Boronia rivularis (Rutaceae) in Queensland
PY  - 2009
AB  - The Sunshine Coast of Queensland, Australia, is facing increasing pressure from rapid urban expansion. Because of the area's high biodiversity, developers are facing pressure to translocate rare, endangered, and vulnerable plants to more protected areas. Translocation of turves, comprising sections of soil and intact aboveground vegetation, has been used as a strategy for reintroducing understory species where establishment from seed is difficult. Moving populations spatially can change levels and direction of gene flow. In what appears to be one of the largest reported translocations of a rare species, this study uses allozymes, which are variant forms of enzymes, to investigate the genetics of a population of the rare heath species Boronia rivularis, which is to be translocated to compensate for an urban development. The population on the development site was found to be significant due to its large size and high genetic diversity and distinctiveness. Diversity and inbreeding levels were not evenly distributed across the development site; inbreeding was highest where density was highest. It was found that retention of a significant portion of the population on the development site reduced the potential loss of connectivity. However, we found that ecological assessments based on density could have led to the loss of the most genetically diverse and least inbred parts of the population. ©2009 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

TI  - Importance of estimating matrix quality for modeling species distribution in complex tropical landscapes: A test with Atlantic forest small mammals
PY  - 2008
AB  - Information to guide decision making is especially urgent in human dominated landscapes in the tropics, where urban and agricultural frontiers are still expanding in an unplanned manner. Nevertheless, most studies that have investigated the influence of landscape structure on species distribution have not considered the heterogeneity of altered habitats of the matrix, which is usually high in human dominated landscapes. Using the distribution of small mammals in forest remnants and in the four main altered habitats in an Atlantic forest landscape, we investigated 1) how explanatory power of models describing species distribution in forest remnants varies between landscape structure variables that do or do not incorporate matrix quality and 2) the importance of spatial scale for analyzing the influence of landscape structure. We used standardized sampling in remnants and altered habitats to generate two indices of habitat quality, corresponding to the abundance and to the occurrence of small mammals. For each remnant, we calculated habitat quantity and connectivity in different spatial scales, considering or not the quality of surrounding habitats. The incorporation of matrix quality increased model explanatory power across all spatial scales for half the species that occurred in the matrix, but only when taking into account the distance between habitat patches (connectivity). These connectivity models were also less affected by spatial scale than habitat quantity models. The few consistent responses to the variation in spatial scales indicate that despite their small size, small mammals perceive landscape features at large spatial scales. Matrix quality index corresponding to species occurrence presented a better or similar performance compared to that of species abundance. Results indicate the importance of the matrix for the dynamics of fragmented landscapes and suggest that relatively simple indices can improve our understanding of species distribution, and could be applied in modeling, monitoring and managing complex tropical landscapes. © 2008 The Authors.

TI  - Neo- and archaeophytes respond more strongly than natives to socio-economic mobility and disturbance patterns along an urban-rural gradient
PY  - 2009
AB  - Aims To clarify the distribution and abundance of natives, archaeophytes and neophytes in settlements along an urban-rural gradient we investigated the importance of site-related and socio-economic factors within settlements in determining the abundance and species richness of these three groups of plant species. Location The Wetterau region north of Frankfurt/Main, Hesse, Germany. Methods The occurrence and abundance of plant species were recorded in 2003 along transects in 66 settlements in a region north of Frankfurt/Main (Germany). The transect routes had been established in an earlier study in 1974-81. We used ordinations to analyse species composition, fitting 10 independent variables to explain the main gradient in species composition. Additionally, socio-economic styles (derived from interviews of 1359 households) were fitted, to analyse the influence of these on plant communities. Finally, we analysed species richness by calculating independent contributions of the variables using hierarchical partitioning. Results Many species of neophytes have expanded their range since the 1974-81 survey, but this was not associated with a general decline of archaeophytes and natives. The main variation of species composition was along a rural to urban gradient, associated with site conditions and with socio-economic factors that vary from settlements dominated by households rooted in the local community to settlements characterized by a mobile new middle class. For neophytes, variables describing the connection to Frankfurt (distance or connectivity) were most important in predicting species richness. For archaeophytes, the data showed a positive relationship between species richness and increasing herbicide application. Main conclusions These results suggest that the occurrence of neophytes within settlements along the urban-rural gradient is triggered by dispersal, related to human mobility patterns. In contrast, the occurrence of archaeophytes in settlements is determined by disturbance-related factors that predominantly depend on traditional gardening practices and weed control practices associated with farming. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Geotechnology-Based Modeling to Optimize Conservation of Forest Network in Urban Area
PY  - 2016
AB  - Forest network development in urban areas faces the challenge from forest fragmentation, human-induced disturbances, and scarce land resources. Here, we proposed a geotechnology-based modeling to optimize conservation of forest network by a case study of Wuhan, China. The potential forest network and their priorities were assessed using an improved least-cost path model and potential utilization efficiency estimation. The modeling process consists of four steps: (i) developing species assemblages, (ii) identifying core forest patches, (iii) identifying potential linkages among core forest patches, and (iv) demarcating forest networks. As a result, three species assemblages, including mammals, pheasants, and other birds, were identified as the conservation targets of urban forest network (UFN) in Wuhan, China. Based on the geotechnology-based model, a forest network proposal was proposed to fulfill the connectivity requirements of selected species assemblages. The proposal consists of seven forest networks at three levels of connectivity, named ideal networks, backbone networks, and comprehensive network. The action priorities of UFN plans were suggested to optimize forest network in the study area. Additionally, a total of 45 forest patches with important conservation significance were identified as prioritized stepping-stone patches in the forest network development. Urban forest conserve was also suggested for preserving woodlands with priority conservation significance. The presented geotechnology-based modeling is fit for planning and optimizing UFNs, because of the inclusion of the stepping-stone effects, human-induced pressures, and priorities. The framework can also be applied to other areas after a sensitivity test of the model and the modification of the parameters to fit the local environment. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Floristic comparison of freshwater wetlands in an urbanizing environment
PY  - 1999
AB  - We evaluated the floristic condition of freshwater palustrine wetlands dominated by wet meadow, emergent marsh, aquatic vegetation, or open water within the rapidly urbanizing area of Portland, Oregon, USA by (1) characterizing plant species richness (presence/absence) and composition of naturally occurring wetlands (NOWs) and mitigation wetlands (MWs) and (2) identifying relationships between floristic characteristics and variables describing land-use, site conditions, and mitigation activities. Data were collected on 45 NOWs and 51 MWs. Overall species richness was high (365 plant taxa), but more than 50% of the species present on both NOWs and MWs were introduced. Only 14 species occurred on more than half the sites, and nine of them were invasive introduced species. The mean number of native species per site did not differ between land-use categories (ANOVA, F = 0.62 at 3 and 88 df, p = 0.6031); however, wetlands surrounded by agricultural and commercial/industrial/transportation corridor uses had more introduced species per site than wetlands surrounded by undeveloped land (Fishers Protected LSD at 88 df, p ≤ 0.05). Although overlapping in floristic composition, NOWs and MWs had significantly different (MRPP, p < 0.0001) species assemblages that were identified using TWINSPAN. MRPP analyses for all sites showed that watershed, land-use, HGM class, percent cover of water, and MW age were significantly related to the floristic composition of the study wetlands. Canonical correspondence analyses further revealed that the primary gradient for species distribution in NOWs was related to moisture; the secondary gradient was related to land-use. The primary gradient also described a strong relationship between percent cover of water and HGM class. For MWs, the primary gradient was related to watershed location and surrounding land-use; the secondary gradient was related to percent cover of water and MW age. Most MWs (44 out or 51 sites) were depressions in various settings, so while HGM class separates NOWs from MWs, it does little to distinguish MW assemblages. Our results show that wetlands in the urbanizing study area are floristically degraded. Further, current wetland management practices are replacing natural marsh and wet meadow systems with ponds, resulting in changes in the composition of plant species assemblages.

TI  - Biodiversity in urban habitat patches
PY  - 2006
AB  - We examined the biodiversity of urban habitats in Birmingham (England) using a combination of field surveys of plants and carabid beetles, genetic studies of four species of butterflies, modelling the anthropochorous nature of the floral communities and spatially explicit modelling of selected mammal species. The aim of the project was to: (i) understand the ecological characteristics of the biota of cities model, (ii) examine the effects of habitat fragment size and connectivity upon the ecological diversity and individual species distributions, (iii) predict biodiversity in cities, and (iv) analyse the extent to which the flora and fauna utilise the 'urban greenways' both as wildlife corridors and as habitats in their own right. The results suggest that cities provide habitats for rich and diverse range of plants and animals, which occur sometimes in unlikely recombinant communities. The studies on carabids and butterflies illustrated the relative importance of habitat quality on individual sites as opposed to site location within the conurbation. This suggests that dispersal for most of our urban species is not a limiting factor in population persistence, although elements of the woodland carabid fauna did appear to have some geographical structuring. Theoretical models suggested that dormice and water voles may depend on linear habitats for dispersal. The models also indicated that other groups, such as small and medium sized mammals, may use corridors, although field-based research did not provide any evidence to suggest that plants or invertebrates use urban greenways for dispersal. This finding indicates the importance of identifying a target species or group of species for urban greenways intended as dispersal routeways rather than as habitat in their own right. Their importance for most groups is rather that greenways provide a chain of different habitats permeating the urban environment. We suggest that planners can have a positive impact on urban biodiversity by slowing the pace of redevelopment and by not hurrying to tidy up and redevelop brownfield sites. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Hidden dispersal in an urban world: genetic analysis reveals occasional long-distance dispersal and limited spatial substructure among Dutch pine martens
PY  - 2016
AB  - Especially in urbanized landscapes, habitat fragmentation and increasing numbers of infrastructural features may limit genetic exchange among wildlife populations. Yet, whether this results in genetic differentiation among individuals in different habitat fragments will depend on both the species studied and the composition of the landscape. European pine martens (Martes martes) show clear spatial structure at a Europe-wide scale, but whether gene flow among habitat patches can be maintained at a more local scale in intensively urbanized areas remained unclear. Here, we analysed genotypic data from 270 pine martens sampled from locations scattered across the Netherlands, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Using Bayesian clustering models we show that most likely maximum two large subpopulations exist in the Netherlands. We observed relatively low levels of genetic differentiation and genetic evidence of regular long-distance dispersal by juveniles that must have crossed one or multiple major highways. Our results suggest that genetic exchange among Dutch pine martens has, until 2010, not been impacted severely by the countries’ dense infrastructural network. Furthermore this species seems to have maintained its genetic diversity despite a recent demographic bottleneck. These conclusions support the idea that the effects of habitat fragmentation may strongly differ between (groups of) species, and that prioritization and optimization of management decisions thus requires direct study of the targeted species.

TI  - Urban population genetics of slum-dwelling rats (Rattus norvegicus) in Salvador, Brazil
PY  - 2013
AB  - Throughout the developing world, urban centres with sprawling slum settlements are rapidly expanding and invading previously forested ecosystems. Slum communities are characterized by untended refuse, open sewers and overgrown vegetation, which promote rodent infestation. Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are reservoirs for epidemic transmission of many zoonotic pathogens of public health importance. Understanding the population ecology of R. norvegicus is essential to formulate effective rodent control strategies, as this knowledge aids estimation of the temporal stability and spatial connectivity of populations. We screened for genetic variation, characterized the population genetic structure and evaluated the extent and patterns of gene flow in the urban landscape using 17 microsatellite loci in 146 rats from nine sites in the city of Salvador, Brazil. These sites were divided between three neighbourhoods within the city spaced an average of 2.7 km apart. Surprisingly, we detected very little relatedness among animals trapped at the same site and found high levels of genetic diversity, as well as structuring across small geographical distances. Most FST comparisons among sites were statistically significant, including sites &lt;400 m apart. Bayesian analyses grouped the samples in three genetic clusters, each associated with distinct sampling sites from different neighbourhoods or valleys within neighbourhoods. These data indicate the existence of complex genetic structure in R. norvegicus in Salvador, linked to the heterogeneous urban landscape. Future rodent control measures need to take into account the spatial and temporal linkage of rat populations in Salvador, as revealed by genetic data, to develop informed eradication strategies. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

TI  - Effects of land use on population presence and genetic structure of an amphibian in an agricultural landscape
PY  - 2017
AB  - Species distributions are a function of an individual’s ability to disperse to and colonize habitat patches. These processes depend upon landscape configuration and composition. Using Blanchard’s cricket frogs (Acris blanchardi), we assessed which land cover types were predictive of (1) presence at three spatial scales (pond-shed, 500 and 2500 m) and (2) genetic structure. We predicted that forested, urban, and road land covers would negatively affect cricket frogs. We also predicted that agricultural, field, and aquatic land covers would positively affect cricket frogs. We surveyed for cricket frogs at 28 sites in southwestern Ohio, USA to determine presence across different habitats and analyze genetic structure among populations. For our first objective, we examined if land use (crop, field, forest, and urban habitat) and landscape features (ponds, streams, and roads) explained presence; for our second objective, we assessed whether these land cover types explained genetic distance between populations. Land cover did not have a strong influence on cricket frog presence. However, multiple competing models suggested effects of roads, streams, and land use. We found genetic structuring: populations were grouped into five major clusters and nine finer-scale clusters. Highways were predictive of increased genetic distance. By combining a focal-patch study with landscape genetics, our study suggests that major roads and waterways are key features affecting species distributions in agricultural landscapes. We demonstrate that cricket frogs may respond to landscape features at larger spatial scales, and that presence and movement may be affected by different environmental factors.

TI  - Data-integration of opportunistic species observations into hierarchical modeling frameworks improves spatial predictions for urban red squirrels
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The prevailing trend of increasing urbanization and habitat fragmentation makes knowledge of species’ habitat requirements and distribution a crucial factor in conservation and urban planning. Species distribution models (SDMs) offer powerful toolboxes for discriminating the underlying environmental factors driving habitat suitability. Nevertheless, challenges in SDMs emerge if multiple data sets - often sampled with different intention and therefore sampling scheme – can complement each other and increase predictive accuracy. Here, we investigate the potential of using recent data integration techniques to model potential habitat and movement corridors for Eurasian red squirrels (<jats:italic>Sciurus vulgaris</jats:italic>), in an urban area. We constructed hierarchical models integrating data sets of different quality stemming from unstructured on one side and semi-structured wildlife observation campaigns on the other side in a combined likelihood approach and compared the results to modeling techniques based on only one data source - wherein all models were fit with the same selection of environmental variables. Our study highlights the increasing importance of considering multiple data sets for SDMs to enhance their predictive performance. We finally used Circuitscape (version 4.0.5) on the most robust SDM to delineate suitable movement corridors for red squirrels as a basis for planning road mortality mitigation measures. Our results indicate that even though red squirrels are common, urban habitats are rather small and partially lack connectivity along natural connectivity corridors in Berlin. Thus, additional fragmentation could bring the species closer to its limit to persist in urban environments, where our results can act as a template for conservation and management implications.</jats:p>

TI  - Functional assemblages of birds in heterogeneous landscapes along an urban-rural gradient in Tiruchirappalli, India
PY  - 2012
AB  - As a result of urbanisation, landscapes and land use patterns are changing the world over. This extreme form of land use alteration has affected species composition and abundance, moulding a few species to dominate the urban environment and a few others to extinction. Urbanisation occurs at different scales and the community composition of species gets affected accordingly. In this paper, we look into species richness and abundance of birds, and their variation along an urban-rural gradient at Tiruchirappalli, India. In Tiruchirappalli, bird species diversity increases from more to less urbanised centres. Though diversity is less in urban areas, the abundance of species occupying these areas is higher. During this study, the maximum recorded birds were omnivores. The most affected species is the House Sparrow, with a few populations residing in the urban environment. Along the urban-rural gradient, farmlands and wetlands are the most preferred landscapes of birds, and conservation measures need to be oriented in this direction to protect the most vulnerable species. Species diversity in urban areas is significantly contributed to by edge species that occupy the fringes of urban areas. Though urban landscapes are less species rich, they too play a significant role in biodiversity conservation as they are species abundant zones. City planners and urban foresters need to pay more attention towards preserving habitats not only in urban areas but along the urban fringes, as they provide suitable corridors for various activities of birds and their movement. © Bombay Natural History Society 2012.

TI  - Are current ecological restoration practices capturing natural levels of genetic diversity? A New Zealand case study using AFLP and ISSR data from mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus)
PY  - 2015
AB  - Sourcing plant species of local provenance (eco-sourcing) has become standard practice in plantcommunity restoration projects. Along with established ecological restoration practices, knowledge of genetic variation in existing and restored forest fragments is important for ensuring the maintenance of natural levels of genetic variation and connectivity (gene flow) among populations. The application of restoration genetics often employs anonymous ‘fingerprinting’ markers in combination with limited sample sizes due to financial constraints. Here, we used two such marker systems, AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphism) and ISSRs (inter-simple sequence repeats), to estimate population-level genetic variation of a frequently used species in restoration projects in New Zealand, mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus, Violaceae). We examined two rural and two urban forest fragments, as potential local source populations, to determine whether the māhoe population at the recently (re)constructed ecosystem at Waiwhakareke Natural Heritage Park, Hamilton, New Zealand, reflects the genetic variation observed in these four potential source populations. Both marker systems produced similar results and indicated that, even with small population sizes, levels of genetic variation at the heritage park were comparable with in situ populations. However, the AFLPs did provide finer resolution of the population genetic structure than ISSRs. ISSRs, which are less expensive and technically less demanding to generate than AFLPs, may be sufficient for restoration projects where only a broad level of genotypic resolution is required. We recommend the use of AFLPs when species with a high conservation status are being used, due to the greater resolution of this technique. © New Zealand Ecological Society.

TI  - Nature-based solutions for urban biodiversity governance
PY  - 2020
AB  - In this paper, we examine how cities are working with nature-based solutions for biodiversity. Drawing on a sample of 199 nature-based solutions across Europe, we identify how cities work with nature-based solutions to conserve nature, restore nature, and to find ways to thrive through harnessing nature's contribution to people. Our findings show that cities are making explicit contributions to biodiversity through nature-based solutions, and often adopt specific and quantifiable targets to guide their actions. Yet there is significant variation in the ways in which biodiversity goals and interventions are being pursued. Where biodiversity goals and actions are included in nature-based solutions, they are mainly ecosystem-based - focusing on the protection, restoration or enhancement of the integrity, functionality, and connectivity of habitats and ecosystems - with fewer focused on specific species, and very few projects concerned with genetic diversity. Although it is often assumed that urban action towards biodiversity goals will be undertaken through local planning processes, our analysis shows that European cities are taking project-based actions for biodiversity through a set of explicit, quantitative and measurable targets, which are tailored to the specific conditions of urban settings. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that if cities are to achieve ambitious goals for biodiversity over the next decade, new international frameworks being developed for the post-2020 period should include targets that acknowledge the way in which biodiversity is governed in cities and the contribution that cities make to conserve, restore and thrive with nature to guide urban action. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The coming of age of conservation genetics in Latin America: what has been achieved and what needs to be done
PY  - 2018
AB  - Genetic research is a well-recognized component of understanding biodiversity and is an invaluable approach for documenting and mitigating increasingly high rates of loss. Here we present a quantitative synthesis of conservation genetics science in Latin America and its progress, focusing on evolving trends on different taxonomic groups, environments and markers. We reviewed 528 conservation genetics research papers published in 57 journals from 1992 to 2013. Brazil and Mexico were the most represented countries in the literature and there was a marked disparity between terrestrial (~64%) and aquatic-marine research (~36%). More than a third or the articles focused on plants (~35%) while the other (65%) were animal studies with a clear emphasis on mammals (35%) and bony fishes (24%). Most research (42%) addressed patterns of population structure, while 17% focused on genetic diversity issues and 14% focused on the description of novel genetic markers. Finally, although genetics has become an integral part of conservation biology, genetic analyses have often not been completely integrated into the development of conservation and management strategies and formal policies. We discuss the levels to which these types of studies can effectively contribute to biodiversity conservation in this region, and offer suggestions on how conservation genetic approaches may be used more broadly, enhancing the connectivity between scientists and policy makers. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Type and intensity of surrounding human land use, not local environment, shape genetic structure of a native grassland plant
PY  - 2021
AB  - Landscape heterogeneity can shape genetic structure and functional connectivity of populations. When this heterogeneity imposes variable costs of moving across the landscape, populations can be structured according to a pattern of \"isolation by resistance\" (IBR). At the same time, divergent local environmental filters can limit gene flow, creating an alternative pattern of \"isolation by environment\" (IBE). Here, we evaluate IBR and IBE in the insect-pollinated, biennial plant Sabatia angularis (L.) Pursh (Gentianaceae) across serpentine grasslands in the fragmented landscape of SE Pennsylvania, USA using ~4500 neutral SNP loci. Specifically, we test the extent to which radical alteration of the landscape matrix by humans has fundamentally altered the cost of movement, imprinting a pattern of IBR dictated by land use type and intensity, and the potential for IBE in relation to a gradient of heavy metal concentrations found in serpentine soil. We reveal a strong signal of IBR and a weak signal of IBE across sites, indicating the greater importance of the landscape matrix in shaping genetic structure of S. angularis populations in the study region. Based on Circuitscape and least cost path approaches, we find that both low- and high-intensity urbanization resist gene flow by orders of magnitude greater than \"natural\" habitats, although resistance to low-intensity urbanization weakens at larger spatial scales. While cropland presents a substantially lower barrier than urban development, cumulative human land use surrounding populations predicts within-population genetic diversity and inbreeding in S. angularis. Our results emphasize the role of forest buffers and corridors in facilitating gene flow between serpentine grassland patches and averting local extinction of plant populations.

TI  - Nest suitability, fine-scale population structure and male-mediated dispersal of a solitary ground nesting bee in an urban landscape
PY  - 2015
AB  - Bees are the primary pollinators of flowering plants in almost all ecosystems. Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests.We genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low (Nei's GST = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance. Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators. © 2015 López-Uribe et al.

TI  - Holocene Population Decline and Conservation Implication for the Western Hercules Beetle, Dynastes grantii (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae)
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Western Hercules beetle (Dynastes grantii) is endemic to the highland forest habitats of southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The habitats harbor many endemic species, but are being threatened by rapid climate change and urban development. In this study, the genetic structure of D. grantii populations from southwestern United States was investigated. Specifically, genomic data from double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing libraries were utilized to test whether geographically distant populations from the Mogollon Rim (Arizona [N = 12 individuals] and New Mexico [N = 10 individuals]) are genetically structured. The study also estimated the effective population size of the Mogollon Rim populations based on genetic diversity. The results indicated that the 2 geographic populations from the Mogollon Rim were not genetically structured. A population size reduction was detected since the end of the last glacial period, which coincided with a reduction of forest habitat in the study area. The results implied that the connectivity and the size of highland forest habitats in the Mogollon Rim could have been the major factors shaping the population genetic structure and demographic history of D. grantii. The Western Hercules beetle could be a useful flagship species for local natural history education and to promote the conservation of highland forest habitats. © 2019 The American Genetic Association 2019.

TI  - Correlation between bird species composition and multi-scale environmental factors in spring in Wenyu River ecological corridor of Beijing
PY  - 2022
AB  - [Objective] In recent years, urban green space is increasingly fragmented because of urbanization, which seriously threatens urban bird diversity. River ecological corridor plays an important role in the protection of urban bird habitats. However, the diversity of different ecological community of birds is influenced by environmental factors at multiple scales. The habitat pattern optimization and habitat construction of birds in urban ecological corridors for specific ecological community need the support of theoretical research urgently. Based on the analysis of bird species composition in Beijing Wenyu River ecological corridor in spring, we comprehensively analyzed the effects of environmental factors on bird species composition of different ecological communities at three scales of landscape pattern, habitat patch and micro-habitat, in order to understand the impact of environmental factors on bird habitat selection, and provide reference for bird diversity protection and habitat construction of urban river ecological corridors. [Method] In the spring of 2019, we conducted a field survey of bird species composition and plant community structure in the Wenyu River ecological corridor. Landscape pattern analysis was conducted after visual interpretation of the habitats in the corridor. Redundant analysis (RDA) was used to analyze the correlation between bird species composition and multi-scale environmental factors. [Result] The pattern characteristics within 50−200 m had the highest interpretation for the overall composition of birds. The composition of songbirds was mainly related to the Pielou index of trees in the community, the area of water and wetland within a small range, and some indexes of grassland and deciduous forest within a large range. The composition of terrestrial bird was mainly related to cropland and shrub. The composition of swimming birds and wading birds had a strong correlation with water body area and wetland area within a small range. The composition of raptorial birds was associated with wetland waters. In same ecological community, the composition of different reside pattern birds had different correlations with environmental factors. Most bird abundance was positively correlated with wetland area, wetland largest patch index and wetland cohesion index within 100 m, and waterbody splitting index within 2 000 m. [Conclusion] The relationship between birds of different ecological communities and various environmental factors is diverse, but the indices of water body and wetland have influence on birds of all ecological communities in the river ecological corridor. In the future construction of urban ecological corridors, we suggest to consider the habitat preferences of different bird communities, pay attention to the optimization of the habitat pattern of wetland water in corridors, and carry out the construction and protection of bird habitats for targeted species. © 2022 Beijing Forestry University.

TI  - Riparian Mesquite bushes are important for bird conservation in tropical arid Mexico
PY  - 2008
AB  - Riparian habitats are important sites for avian conservation in western North America. These sites are also places of increasing human exploitation due to water availability and vegetation composition. Degradation and habitat patchiness of these systems may cause declines in avian species that are obligate breeders or use these habitats as corridors during migration. Our objective was to examine species composition and diversity of birds inhabiting a patchy Mesquite landscape in central Mexico. The study was conducted in the Salado River watershed in the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve. We conducted bird censuses using circular plot surveys in four zones of similar size differing mainly in proximity to town. We compared bird presence and density with plant coverage and density measured at the same points. We recorded 80 bird species, 53.6% of which were winter migrants. The four zones studied were not statistically different in bird species composition but differed in bird densities. Points counted inside the zones differed in bird densities and were positively correlated with plant density. The study site can be considered important for bird conservation due to its bird species richness, migratory species found exclusively in riparian habitat, and the presence of resident endemic species that breed in the area. Vegetation clearance that involves partial reduction of plants can represent a threat to bird conservation in the area. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of mosquito diversity (Diptera: Culicidae) at places with different land-use types within a neotropical montane cloud forest matrix
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: Land-use change has led to a dramatic decrease in total forest cover, contributing to biodiversity loss and changes of ecosystems' functions. Insect communities of medical importance can be favored by anthropogenic alterations, increasing the risk of novel zoonotic diseases. The response of mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) abundance and richness to five land-use types (shade coffee plantation, cattle field, urban forest, peri-urban forest, well-preserved montane cloud forest) and three seasons (\"dry\", \"rainy\" and \"cold\") embedded in a neotropical montane cloud forest landscape was evaluated. Methods: Standardized collections were performed using 8 CDC miniature black-light traps, baited with CO2 throughout the year. Generalized additive mixed models were used to describe the seasonal and spatial trends of both species richness and abundance. Rank abundance curves and ANCOVAs were used to detect changes in the spatial and temporal structure of the mosquito assemblage. Two cluster analyses were conducted, using 1-βsim and the Morisita-Horn index to evaluate species composition shifts based on incidences and abundances. Results: A total of 2536 adult mosquitoes were collected, belonging to 9 genera and 10 species; the dominant species in the study were: Aedes quadrivittatus, Wyeomyia adelpha, Wy. arthrostigma, and Culex restuans. Highest richness was recorded in the dry season, whereas higher abundance was detected during the rainy season. The urban forest had the highest species richness (n = 7) when compared to all other sites. Species composition cluster analyses show that there is a high degree of similarity in species numbers across sites and seasons throughout the year. However, when considering the abundance of such species, the well-preserved montane cloud forest showed significantly higher abundance. Moreover, the urban forest is only 30 % similar to other sites in terms of species abundances, indicating a possible isolating role of the urban environment. Conclusion: Mosquito assemblage was differentially influenced by land-use change and seasonality, but at the same time the assemblage is rather homogeneous across the studied landscape, suggesting a high degree of spatial connectivity. Information generated in this study is potentially useful in the development of urban planning and surveillance programs focused mainly on mosquito species of medical and veterinary importance. © 2015 Abella-Medrano et al.

TI  - Gene flow and pathogen transmission among bobcats (Lynx rufus) in a fragmented urban landscape
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urbanization can result in the fragmentation of once contiguous natural landscapes into a patchy habitat interspersed within a growing urban matrix. Animals living in fragmented landscapes often have reduced movement among habitat patches because of avoidance of intervening human development, which potentially leads to both reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Mammalian carnivores with large home ranges, such as bobcats (Lynx rufus), may be particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. We performed genetic analyses on bobcats and their directly transmitted viral pathogen, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), to investigate the effects of urbanization on bobcat movement. We predicted that urban development, including major freeways, would limit bobcat movement and result in genetically structured host and pathogen populations. We analysed molecular markers from 106 bobcats and 19 FIV isolates from seropositive animals in urban southern California. Our findings indicate that reduced gene flow between two primary habitat patches has resulted in genetically distinct bobcat subpopulations separated by urban development including a major highway. However, the distribution of genetic diversity among FIV isolates determined through phylogenetic analyses indicates that pathogen genotypes are less spatially structured-exhibiting a more even distribution between habitat fragments. We conclude that the types of movement and contact sufficient for disease transmission occur with enough frequency to preclude structuring among the viral population, but that the bobcat population is structured owing to low levels of effective bobcat migration resulting in gene flow. We illustrate the utility in using multiple molecular markers that differentially detect movement and gene flow between subpopulations when assessing connectivity. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Dispersal ability predicts spatial genetic structure in native mammals persisting across an urbanization gradient
PY  - 2021
AB  - As the rate of urbanization continues to increase globally, a growing body of research is emerging that investigates how urbanization shapes the movement-and consequent gene flow-of species in cities. Of particular interest are native species that persist in cities, either as small relict populations or as larger populations of synanthropic species that thrive alongside humans in new urban environments. In this study, we used genomic sequence data (SNPs) and spatially explicit individual-based analyses to directly compare the genetic structure and patterns of gene flow in two small mammals with different dispersal abilities that occupy the same urbanized landscape to evaluate how mobility impacts genetic connectivity. We collected 215 white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and 380 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) across an urban-to-rural gradient within the Providence, Rhode Island (U.S.A.) metropolitan area (population =1,600,000 people). We found that mice and bats exhibit clear differences in their spatial genetic structure that are consistent with their dispersal abilities, with urbanization having a stronger effect on Peromyscus mice. There were sharp breaks in the genetic structure of mice within the Providence urban core, as well as reduced rates of migration and an increase in inbreeding with more urbanization. In contrast, bats showed very weak genetic structuring across the entire study area, suggesting a near-panmictic gene pool likely due to the ability to disperse by flight. Genetic diversity remained stable for both species across the study region. Mice also exhibited a stronger reduction in gene flow between island and mainland populations than bats. This study represents one of the first to directly compare multiple species within the same urban-to-rural landscape gradient, an important gap to fill for urban ecology and evolution. Moreover, here we document the impacts of dispersal capacity on connectivity for native species that have persisted as the urban landscape matrix expands.

TI  - Biotic homogenization at the community scale: Disentangling the roles of urbanization and plant invasion
PY  - 2013
AB  - Aim: Urbanization as a major global trend profoundly changes biodiversity patterns, and homogenization of urban biota due to expanding exotic species and declining native species is of increasing concern. Previous studies on this topic have mostly taken place at large scales that include high habitat heterogeneity. Here, we aimed at disentangling the effects of urbanization and plant invasion on species composition through the analysis of similarity patterns of urban plant assemblages at the community scale where species interact. Location: Berlin, Germany. Methods: We analysed how different levels of urbanization, specific components of the urban matrix and the dominance of a native (Betula pendula) versus an exotic tree species (Robinia pseudoacacia) affect alpha and beta diversity of urban woodland understorey vegetation in sixty-eight 100-m2 plots. Results: Exotic dominance reduced alpha diversity, but not beta diversity of the total species pool. Comparing beta diversity among different species groups revealed significant but divergent effects of exotic dominance, habitat connectivity and levels of urbanization in native and non-native species assemblages. In particular, urbanity proved to homogenize the native species pool, whereas the beta diversity of the non-native species pool showed a more pronounced response to exotic dominance. Main conclusions: Our data provide evidence that both the urban context and the dominance of exotic species can modify homogenization processes at the community level. These novel insights into the mechanisms of biotic homogenization of urban floras may contribute to mitigating the effects of urbanization on biodiversity. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution of an invasive insect in an urban landscape: introduction, establishment and impact
PY  - 2017
AB  - Biological invasions are characterized by dynamic spatiotemporal distribution patterns. Yet landscape scale distribution patterns of invasive species are rarely leveraged to understand invasion in a comprehensive manner. Characterize three key stages of invasion from the landscape scale distribution patterns for an invasive insect—Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), and investigate the potential spatial variability in establishment and impact risk. The study focuses on the recent invasion of D. citri in Southern California’s urban landscape. We used a combination of spatiotemporal pattern analyses and species distribution models (SDMs) to characterize the introduction, establishment and impact of D. citri invasion. Diaphorina citri detections in relation to major roadways revealed that initial detections are significantly closer to major roads than later detections, suggesting that transportation corridors serve as introduction pathways. SDMs of D. citri establishment and impact potential using presence-(pseudo)absence and abundance revealed percent impervious surface as the best landscape predictor. Inclusion of prior D. citri detections as a lagged spatiotemporal effect improved both model fit and performance suggesting that small-scale dispersal events do matter. Interestingly, interpolated risk maps based on the predicted occurrence and abundance highlighted substantial spatial variability in D. citri establishment and impact risk. Our study demonstrates how examining spatiotemporal patterns of an invasive species is useful in inferring key stages of the invasion, and how occurrence and abundance information can be leveraged to quantify variability in establishment and impact risk. The study thus provides a useful baseline in formulating effective landscape-level management actions.

TI  - Seasonal Activity of Urban Bats Populations in Temperate Climate Zone—A Case Study from Southern Poland
PY  - 2021
AB  - Municipal greenery can mitigate the negative impact of urbanization on biodiversity, including bats, by providing a migration corridor, food base and roosts. Our study aimed to evaluate the species composition and diversity, test the differences in activity between seasons, and identify the atmospheric conditions influencing the bats’ activity in the Planty Park (Cracow). Fieldworks were conducted in 2016 and 2017. We recorded 10 species, two new for this part of Poland: the Kuhl’s pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and the Savi’s pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). Taxa were divided into three ecological guilds. Myotis group’s activity was insufficient to perform statistical analyses. The activity of Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio group peaked in late summer. A similar insignificant trend was observed for Pipistrellus and Hypsugo. Temperature enhanced the activity of Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio group in spring and early summer, while cloud cover suppressed their activity in autumn. Temperature also enhanced Pipistrellus and Hypsugo group activity in spring and autumn, but it suppressed their summer activity. Our study is one of the first to investigate temperate urban bats’ phenology and may serve as a preface for further research to introduce detailed urban landscape planning recommendations.

TI  - Conservation Genomics of the Threatened Western Spadefoot, Spea hammondii, in Urbanized Southern California
PY  - 2020
AB  - Populations of the western spadefoot (Spea hammondii) in southern California occur in one of the most urbanized and fragmented landscapes on the planet and have lost up to 80% of their native habitat. Orange County is one of the last strongholds for this pond-breeding amphibian in the region, and ongoing restoration efforts targeting S. hammondii have involved habitat protection and the construction of artificial breeding ponds. These efforts have successfully increased breeding activity, but genetic characterization of the populations, including estimates of effective population size and admixture between the gene pools of constructed artificial and natural ponds, has never been undertaken. Using thousands of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we characterized the population structure, genetic diversity, and genetic connectivity of spadefoots in Orange County to guide ongoing and future management efforts. We identified at least 2, and possibly 3 major genetic clusters, with additional substructure within clusters indicating that individual ponds are often genetically distinct. Estimates of landscape resistance suggest that ponds on either side of the Los Angeles Basin were likely interconnected historically, but intense urban development has rendered them essentially isolated, and the resulting risk of interruption to natural metapopulation dynamics appears to be high. Resistance surfaces show that the existing artificial ponds were well-placed and connected to natural populations by low-resistance corridors. Toad samples from all ponds (natural and artificial) returned extremely low estimates of effective population size, possibly due to a bottleneck caused by a recent multi-year drought. Management efforts should focus on maintaining gene flow among natural and artificial ponds by both assisted migration and construction of new ponds to bolster the existing pond network in the region. © 2021 The American Genetic Association.

TI  - Maximizing habitat connectivity in the mitigation hierarchy. A case study on three terrestrial mammals in an urban environment
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Environmental policies and the objective of no net loss highlight the importance of preserving ecological networks to limit the fragmentation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss, especially due to urbanization. In the environmental impact assessment context, habitat connectivity and the spatio-temporal dynamics of biodiversity are crucial to obtaining reliable predictions that can support decision-making. We propose a methodological framework 1) to quantify the overall impact of a development project on the functioning of an ecological network, and 2) to select the best locations for implanting new habitat patches intended to enhance landscape connectivity. The amount of reachable habitat concept was applied to three representative terrestrial mammal species: the red squirrel, the Eurasian badger and the European hedgehog. All three species are recognized as vulnerable to human pressures and potentially affected by the construction of a new stadium in our study site, Lyon (Southern France). The method combines the species distribution model Maxent with the landscape functional connectivity model Graphab. The results showed that using any one of the avoidance and reduction measures on its own was unsuccessful in achieving the objective of no net loss when habitat connectivity is considered. However, the combination of new habitat patches and corridors offered a higher gain than distinct measures. This is especially important in the short term, when new hedgerow plantations have not yet developed enough to be used by the target species. Our findings indicate, first, the need to take the temporal scale into account in environmental impact assessment. We also show that applying the optimal scenario, constructed using a cumulative patch addition followed by a similar process testing a set of potential land-use changes, maximizes habitat connectivity. Our methodology provides a useful tool to increase target species’ habitat connectivity within the mitigation hierarchy and to enhance development project design for increased environmental efficiency.

TI  - Plant species surplus in recent peri-urban forests: the role of forest connectivity, species’ habitat requirements and dispersal types
PY  - 2021
AB  - In peri-urban regions, the establishment of new forest patches can be affected by specific community assembly rules driving species extinction debts and colonization credits. This might result in species surpluses or deficits and shifts in species composition along forest establishment, whose association with human-driven landscape transformation remains largely unknown. We have compared plant assemblages in peri-urban Mediterranean forests of contrasting history (recent vs. preexisting; post- vs. pre-1956) according to species’ habitat requirements (forest, scrub-grassland, synanthropic or other) and dispersal mode (vertebrate- vs. non-vertebrate), while considering site and landscape characteristics. Species richness and cover were mostly associated to site characteristics, but also to forest connectivity and history. Connectivity increased total species cover, forest species richness and both richness and cover of vertebrate-dispersed species, while reducing non-forest species richness and synanthropic species cover. Regarding forest history, recent stands showed higher total and non-forest species richness, higher scrub-grassland species cover and lower cover of vertebrate-dispersed species than preexisting forests. Thus, recent stands exhibit a species surplus due to the extinction debt of scrub-grassland species and the transient abundance of synanthropic species, despite the observed colonization credit of vertebrate-dispersed species. These results emphasize the importance of forest connectivity when managing plant species assemblage in peri-urban forest patches but also highlight the need to consider recent history of habitat patches to manage time lags in biodiversity change in human-transformed landscapes.

TI  - A hawkmoth crossroads? Species richness, seasonality and biogeographical affinities of Sphingidae in a Brazilian Cerrado
PY  - 2009
AB  - Aim The aim of the study was (1) to describe the biodiversity of the sphingid assemblage in a Cerrado area in the Triângulo Mineiro region, south-east of Brazil; (2) to evaluate the seasonal variations in species composition; (3) to compare the faunistic relationships between the Cerrado biome and adjacent ecosystems; and (4) to analyse the biogeographical pattern of species distribution in the Neotropical region in a historical context. Location Panga Ecological Station (PES), 30 km south of the city of Uberlândia, and other areas of the Triângulo Mineiro region, Minas Gerais state, south-eastern Brazil. Methods Moth richness and abundance were monitored monthly at the PES from August 2003 to July 2004, with additional collections at this locality in 2001/2002, 2005 and 2006. Complementary moth richness and abundance data were also collected in other areas of the Triângulo Mineiro region. All collections were made using light traps, and the hawkmoths were mounted and identified. Cluster analysis, rarefaction curves and estimators of total species richness were used to compare the Cerrado hawkmoth assemblage with assemblages derived from other surveys in the Neotropics. Results In total, 61 hawkmoth species were recorded for the study region and their occurrence was markedly seasonal. The hawkmoth assemblage in the study area presented the closest similarity with rain forest areas and with a tropical dry forest area in Central America. The area shared species with both rain forest and seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) ecosystems, including supposedly endemic species previously recorded only in the latter areas. Rarefaction curves and estimators of the total number of species showed species richness to be comparable with other highly diverse forest areas in the Neotropics, such as the Brazilian Amazon and Costa Rica. Main conclusions This short-term study is the first systematic survey of hawkmoths in the Cerrado. It has recorded around 22% of the South American fauna and highlighted the high species richness of the region, which compares favourably with that in other rain forest ecosystems. The survey indicates high regional diversity, and has shown that the Cerrado harbours a hawkmoth fauna comprising both rain forest elements, probably distributed along humid gallery forest corridors, and SDTF elements, supporting the idea of a historical Pleistocene arc connecting the Caatinga domain and other seasonal dry forest areas across the Cerrado region. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Effects of power-line maintenance on forest structure in a fragmented Urban Forest, Raleigh, NC
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract With the increase in urban development, forest fragments are becoming more prevalent. In urban areas, there is a tendency to hide power-lines within or on the edges of these fragmented forests; however, it is unknown how the maintenance of vegetation under and along power-lines impacts the forest composition and structure of an adjacent fragmented, urban forest. An urban, fragmented maple-oak-hickory forest is located on the Meredith College campus, Raleigh, NC. A 1-ha plot with a hundred 10- × 10-m subplots was established in 2007 to initiate a long-term project supporting undergraduate research. An adjacent meadow is cut and maintained regularly up to the forest and plot edge for power-line clearance and access. We identified, tagged, and measured all of the trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm in this permanent plot, and compared the tree species richness (S), Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H), Sorenson's similarity index (Ss ), DBH, stem density, and basal area along the 100-m...

TI  - Decisive environmental characteristics for woody regrowth in forest edges - Patterns along complex environmental gradients in Southern Sweden
PY  - 2016
AB  - Early and late successional stages of forest edge development were studied across long, complex environmental gradients in order to disentangle and assess the woody species composition and functional traits' relations to abiotic and biotic environmental characteristics at site and landscape scale. Data were sampled from 78 randomly stratified locations along a 610-km railway corridor between the cities of Stockholm and Malmö, Sweden, and subsequently analysed in multiple steps of unconstrained, constrained and partial constrained ordination and variation partitioning. Different analytical methods were applied at each step and only the environmental characteristics that repeatedly showed significant impacts on woody species composition were selected for analysis of average weighted community traits to provide verification and a more detailed understanding. Following this approach, 10 environmental characteristics were identified as decisive for the woody species composition of the forest edges. The variation partitioning revealed a marked shift in the relative explanatory power of the environmental variables in relation to the succession of the forest edges. In the early successional stage, the abiotic variables related to site productivity (as reflected by field layer type and soil moisture) and climate (humidity and altitude) dominate, while in the late successional stages of forest edges more complex patterns evolved due to hierarchical and dynamic filter effects, where biotic variables reflecting structural aspects at site (forest edge profile, canopy stratification and canopy cover) and landscape (forest continuity and the shape and contrast of edges in the surrounding landscape) level were equally important as the abiotic variables. We concluded that management efforts in early succession stages of forest edges should depart from basic abiotic gradients of site fertility and moisture; and that it is crucial to incorporate vegetation structure variables at site and landscape level into long-term management planning. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Applying network theory to prioritize multispecies habitat networks that are robust to climate and land-use change
PY  - 2017
AB  - Designing connected landscapes is among the most widespread strategies for achieving biodiversity conservation targets. The challenge lies in simultaneously satisfying the connectivity needs of multiple species at multiple spatial scales under uncertain climate and land-use change. To evaluate the contribution of remnant habitat fragments to the connectivity of regional habitat networks, we developed a method to integrate uncertainty in climate and land-use change projections with the latest developments in network-connectivity research and spatial, multipurpose conservation prioritization. We used land-use change simulations to explore robustness of species' habitat networks to alternative development scenarios. We applied our method to 14 vertebrate focal species of periurban Montreal, Canada. Accounting for connectivity in spatial prioritization strongly modified conservation priorities and the modified priorities were robust to uncertain climate change. Setting conservation priorities based on habitat quality and connectivity maintained a large proportion of the region's connectivity, despite anticipated habitat loss due to climate and land-use change. The application of connectivity criteria alongside habitat-quality criteria for protected-area design was efficient with respect to the amount of area that needs protection and did not necessarily amplify trade-offs among conservation criteria. Our approach and results are being applied in and around Montreal and are well suited to the design of ecological networks and green infrastructure for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in other regions, in particular regions around large cities, where connectivity is critically low.

TI  - Dynamic modelling to predict the likelihood of plant species persisting in fragmented landscapes in the face of climate change
PY  - 2011
AB  - Many species are threatened by global climate change, but plants are particularly vulnerable because, as sessile organisms, they are unable to move to areas with more suitable conditions as the climate changes. Instead they must rely on their seeds dispersing far and often to keep pace with a changing climate. This problem is exacerbated by the fragmentation of natural landscapes by clearing for agricultural or urban development, or similarly by a species requirement for particular soil types or topography. Models can help predict how different species will be affected by climate change. Most previous modelling work on predicting the persistence of plant and other species under climate change has been static, regression style modelling, known as climate envelope modelling. This has focussed on predicting where suitable environments for a species will likely occur under possible future climatic conditions, based on the species' distribution under current conditions. While the existence of suitable environments in a new climate is a necessary condition for a species' persistence, for sessile organisms such as plants, the ability of a species to move and colonise these suitable environments is also likely to be a major limitation. There is therefore a need for models that account for the dynamic processes involved in plant species' migration and colonisation in changing climates. This paper presents such a dynamic model, called PPunCC (Plant Persistence under Climate Change). We describe how the PPunCC model represents the important factors and processes likely to affect a plant species' capacity to migrate across a landscape fast enough to keep pace with a changing climate, such as the rate of climate change, the degree of landscape fragmentation, and the plant species' life history, seed production, dispersal, and establishment. We also discuss how the model could be used to inform management decisions regarding adaptation options such as assisted migration or the creation of large-scale corridors that increase the connectivity of fragmented landscapes in order to help species migrate naturally and find suitable environments in new climates.

TI  - Impacts of land use on riparian forest along an urban - Rural gradient in southern Manitoba
PY  - 2004
AB  - Extensive landscape modification by humans has led to the fragmentation of riparian forests across North America. We compared the vegetation of extant riparian forest along an urban-rural disturbance gradient. In 1999, twenty-five sites along Assiniboine River in Manitoba, Canada were categorized according to land use: urban, suburban, high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference forest. Differences in herbaceous, shrub, and tree species composition and diversity were related to the proportion of surrounding land use, forest patch size, connectivity, and area:perimeter ratio. Urban riparian forests were more disturbed and isolated. They were smaller and characterized by drier, more alkaline soils. Moreover, they had significantly lower native and overall understorey species diversity, and had a higher proportion of exotics including Solanum dulcamara and Hesperis matronalis. Suburban forests were less disturbed, faced greater development pressure, and had sandier soils. Although suburban understorey diversity was similar to that of rural forests, suburban sites had a higher proportion of exotic species, especially escaped horticultural and invasive species including Caragana arborescens and Rhamnus cathartica. Reference sites were relatively large and exhibited greater connectivity, but there was little difference in species composition and diversity among high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and reference sites. These site types were less disturbed than either urban or suburban forests, and reference sites were characterized by hydrophilic species including Scirpus fluviatilis and Carex aquatilis. Our results suggest that landscape measures of disturbance, and related changes in environment, may be confidently used to assess impacts of land use on vegetation along urban-rural gradients.

TI  - Plant migration and persistence under climate change in fragmented landscapes: Does it depend on the key point of vulnerability within the lifecycle?
PY  - 2013
AB  - Many organisms are threatened by global climate change, but as sessile organisms, plants are particularly vulnerable. Unable to individually move to areas with more suitable conditions as the climate changes, plants must instead rely on their seeds dispersing far and often in order to migrate fast enough to keep pace with the changing climate. The fragmentation of natural landscapes by clearing for agricultural or urban development, or a species' requirement for particular soil types or topography, makes this migration even more problematic. The likelihood of a plant species persisting will thus depend on factors such as the rate of climate change, the degree of landscape fragmentation, and also the plant species' lifecycle, seed production, dispersal, and establishment. This paper presents a dynamic model, called PPunCC (Plant Persistence under Climate Change), that represents the important factors and processes likely to affect a plant species' capacity to migrate across a landscape fast enough to avoid extinction. We use the model to show that creating large-scale corridors that increase the connectivity of fragmented landscapes through targeted restoration could help species migrate naturally and find suitable environments in new climates. We also examine the effect of varying the key point of vulnerability within its lifecycle between juvenile establishment, adult mortality or seed production and conclude that this has a relatively minor effect on the prognosis for the plant and does not affect the predicted benefits of restoration. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim As accurate and up-to-date distribution data for plant species are rarely available, cumulative records over long periods of time are frequently used for mapping distributions, without taking into account that species do not persist in their historical localities forever. However, persistence is highly relevant in changing modern landscapes, especially for invasive species that dynamically spread in unstable human-made habitats. We studied how an invasive species, Heracleum mantegazzianum, persists at sites once colonized and how its ability to persist affects its distribution. Location The Czech Republic. Methods We visited 521 localities of H. mantegazzianum occurrence reported in the literature and herbaria to determine whether the species still occurs at these sites. By using G-tests and classification trees, we explored the roles of various factors affecting its persistence at a site. Results Of the total number of 521 historical sites at which the species has occurred since the end of the 19th century, it persists at only 124 (23.8%). The persistence rate differs with respect to habitat type and is highest in meadows and forest margins. Analysis using classification trees indicated that the factors that best explain persistence are: type of habitat (with meadow and forest margins over-represented); urbanity (with a higher persistence outside urban areas); proximity to the place of the species' introduction into the country; metapopulation connectivity; and distance to the nearest neighbouring population. Main conclusions The use of cumulative historical records as a measure of species distribution, which is common in invasion literature, can seriously overestimate the actual distribution of alien plant species with low persistence. In the case of alien species such as H. mantegazzanium, which is non-clonal and reproduces only by seed, estimates of distribution and spread based on historical data are informative about potentially suitable habitat but may be unreliable as indicators of current occurrence and invasion dynamics. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Asian elephants in China: Estimating population size and evaluating habitat suitability
PY  - 2015
AB  - We monitored the last remaining Asian elephant populations in China over the past decade. Using DNA tools and repeat genotyping, we estimated the population sizes from 654 dung samples collected from various areas. Combined with morphological individual identifications from over 6,300 elephant photographs taken in the wild, we estimated that the total Asian elephant population size in China is between 221 and 245. Population genetic structure and diversity were examined using a 556-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA, and 24 unique haplotypes were detected from DNA analysis of 178 individuals. A phylogenetic analysis revealed two highly divergent clades of Asian elephants, α and β, present in Chinese populations. Four populations (Mengla, Shangyong, Mengyang, and Pu'Er) carried mtDNA from the α clade, and only one population (Nangunhe) carried mtDNA belonging to the β clade. Moreover, high genetic divergence was observed between the Nangunhe population and the other four populations; however, genetic diversity among the five populations was low, possibly due to limited gene flow because of habitat fragmentation. The expansion of rubber plantations, crop cultivation, and villages along rivers and roads had caused extensive degradation of natural forest in these areas. This had resulted in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and had formed artificial barriers that inhibited elephant migration. Using Geographic Information System, Global Positioning System, and Remote Sensing technology, we found that the area occupied by rubber plantations, tea farms, and urban settlements had dramatically increased over the past 40 years, resulting in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and forming artificial barriers that inhibit elephant migration. The restoration of ecological corridors to facilitate gene exchange among isolated elephant populations and the establishment of cross-boundary protected areas between China and Laos to secure their natural habitats are critical for the survival of Asian elephants in this region. © 2015 Zhang et al.

TI  - Visibility from roads predict the distribution of invasive fishes in agricultural ponds
PY  - 2014
AB  - Propagule pressure and habitat characteristics are important factors used to predict the distribution of invasive alien species. For species exhibiting strong propagule pressure because of human-mediated introduction of species, indicators of introduction potential must represent the behavioral characteristics of humans. This study examined 64 agricultural ponds to assess the visibility of ponds from surrounding roads and its value as a surrogate of propagule pressure to explain the presence and absence of two invasive fish species. A three-dimensional viewshed analysis using a geographic information system quantified the visual exposure of respective ponds to humans. Binary classification trees were developed as a function of their visibility from roads, as well as five environmental factors: river density, connectivity with upstream dam reservoirs, pond area, chlorophyll a concentration, and pond drainage. Traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction (road density and proportion of urban land-use area) were alternatively included for comparison instead of visual exposure. The presence of Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) was predicted by the ponds' higher visibility from roads and pond connection with upstream dam reservoirs. Results suggest that fish stocking into ponds and their dispersal from upstream sources facilitated species establishment. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) distribution was constrained by chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting their lower adaptability to various environments than that of Bluegill. Based on misclassifications from classification trees for Bluegill, pond visual exposure to roads showed greater predictive capability than traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction. Pond visibility is an effective predictor of invasive species distribution. Its wider use might improve management and mitigate further invasion. The visual exposure of recipient ecosystems to humans is important for many invasive species that spread with frequent instances of human-mediated introduction. © 2014 Kizuka et al.

TI  - Building ecological networks in Beijing Plain based on local species distribution
PY  - 2022
AB  - Rapid urbanization has been reshaping terrestrial ecosystems worldwide in last few decades, and this process has resulted in habitat fragmentation, deterioration and even habitat loss, which is considered to be one of key drivers of biodiversity reduction in global scale. In this context, building ecological networks to increase habitat connectivity in urban scale is vitally important for effective conservation. Because the data of other species is inaccessible, taking the observed bird population as focal species and to build ecological networks provides us a novel idea for protecting local biodiversity. This paper takes Beijing plain as study area to build a systematic ecological network. Based on the data of spatial distribution of typical 86 kinds of bird that are in the list of threatened species, we explore the potential habitats as source patches under the support of Maxent model. Then we utilize the land use data to create resistance surface which symbolizes the degree of difficulty of species′ passing through among habitats, by means of that we integrate the spatial data with the minimum cumulative resistance model, and a classified ecological network is constructed. The result shows that wetlands and public gardens are the dominant habitats, which represent 81% natural areas in Beijing plain. The identified habitat sources are classified two types according to the linear relation of species richness and the extent of habitats, and the number of primary and the secondary habitats are 58 and 146, respectively. Similarly, the modelled ecological corridors are also classified into the primary and secondary types. The former represents the corridors among primary habitats, and the latter are corridors that connects the primary habitats with the secondary habitats. Totally, the number of corridors is 948 and the length is 3760 kilometers. Moreover, 12 essentially ecological nodes are selected by kernel density analysis, and 6 key corridors are confirmed according to their ecological attributes. These nodes and corridors are important ecological infrastructures in biodiversity conservation on Beijing plain. In conclusion, building up 948 corridors are believed to be beneficial for biodiversity conservation. Additionally, the ecological network is also an optional solution and reference for local decision makers to draw up scientifically and rationally a spatial optimized planning for human-nature harmonious Beijing. © 2022 Science Press.

TI  - Species distribution modelling of the endangered Mahogany Glider (Petaurus gracilis) reveals key areas for targeted survey and conservation
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Mahogany Glider (Petaurus gracilis) is one of the most endangered marsupials in Australia. Its known distribution is an approximately 120 km strip of fragmented coastal woodland in north-east Queensland, from north of Townsville to the Tully area. Records are clustered in a number of well-surveyed areas, with significant areas of lowland habitat unsurveyed. Around 30% of historic records fall in areas that were subsequently cleared for farmland, and ongoing clearing and fragmentation of lowland sclerophyll forest continues within the potential distribution. Resolving the distribution is an urgent requirement to guide conservation but Mahogany Gliders are difficult to detect in the field. Species distribution modelling offers a technique for estimating the fine-scale distribution and for targeting further field survey and conservation efforts. We used known occurrence records (N = 481) to predict the distribution of Mahogany Gliders across the Wet Tropics bioregion. We used climatic, topographic and other environmental predictors to generate distribution models using Maxent and Random Forest algorithms, each with two bias correction methods. The predictions revealed that many unknown populations may exist within the currently defined distribution and in important areas beyond this (e.g. Hinchinbrook Island). There was reasonable congruence between models, and we include syntheses of the models to present the most likely current distribution. The most important predictor variables across the models were precipitation seasonality (high seasonality), elevation (generally <100 m), soil type (hydrosols) and vegetation type (including Eucalyptus and Melaleuca woodlands). Our results identify core habitat and reveal key areas that require targeted field surveys. Importantly, the predicted suitable habitat is highly fragmented and ongoing conservation efforts need to improve habitat connectivity and limit further fragmentation. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - The distribution of plant species in urban vegetation fragments
PY  - 1999
AB  - (1) The presence and absence of 22 plant species of various growth forms and habitat associations were analysed in 423 habitat fragments totalling 10.4 km2 in a 268 km2 urban and suburban region, in Birmingham, UK. (2) Multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess the effects of patch geometry and quality on the species distributions. Measures of geometry were area, shape (S-factor), distance from open countryside and various measures of isolation from other patches. Potential habitat for each species was determined quantitatively, and the distribution of each species was considered within a subset of patches containing potentially suitable habitat types. There was found to be a significant positive correlation between the density of patches available to a species and the proportion of these patches which were occupied. (3) Logistic analyses and incidence functions revealed that, for many of the species, occupancy increased with site age, area, habitat number and similarity of adjacent habitats, while increasing distance to the nearest recorded population of the same species decreased the likelihood that a species would be found in a patch. (4) Patterns of occupancy are consistent with increased extinction from small sites, and colonisation of nearby habitats, coupled with an important role for site history. We conclude that spatial dynamics at the scale of the landscape are of importance to the long-term persistence of many plant species in fragmented landscapes, and must be seriously considered in conservation planning and management. These results have direct implications for the siting and connectivity of urban habitat reserves.

TI  - Predicting habitat suitability and connectivity for management and conservation of urban wildlife: A real-time web application for grassland water voles
PY  - 2022
AB  - Natural habitats in urban areas provide benefits for both humans and biodiversity. However, to achieve biodiversity gains, we require new techniques to determine habitat suitability and ecological connectivity that will inform urban planning and development. Using an example of an urban population of water voles Arvicola amphibius, we developed a habitat suitability model and a resistance-surface-based model of landscape connectivity to identify potential connectivity between areas of suitable habitat. We then updated the environmental variables according to new urban development plans and used our models to generate spatially explicit predictions of both habitat suitability and connectivity. To make models accessible to urban and conservation planners, we developed an interactive mapping tool that provided users with a graphical user interface (GUI) to inform conservation planning for this species. The model found that habitat suitability for water voles was related to the proportion and distance from key environmental variables, such as built-up areas and urban green spaces, while the connectivity model identified important corridors connecting areas of potential distribution for this species. Future development plans altered the potential spatial distribution of the water vole population, reducing the extent of suitable habitat in some core areas. The interactive mapping tool made available suitable habitat and connectivity maps for conservation managers to assess new planning applications and for the development of a conservation action plan for water voles. Synthesis and applications. We believe this approach provides a framework for future development of nature conservation tools that can be used by planners to inform ecological decision-making, increase biodiversity and reduce human–wildlife conflict in urban environments.

TI  - Diving beetle (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) community dissimilarity reveals how low landscape connectivity restricts the ecological value of urban ponds
PY  - 2022
AB  - Context: Structural and functional connectivity, as subconcepts of landscape connectivity, are key factors in biodiversity conservation and management. Previous studies have focused on the consequences of connectivity for populations of terrestrial organisms, which may not be appropriate for aquatic organisms. Objectives: As landscape connectivity critically affects the potential value of ponds for biodiversity, here we used diving beetles (Dytiscidae), an indicator taxon of wetland biodiversity, to investigate how structural connectivity affects functional connectivity to aquatic invertebrates in an urban landscape. Methods: We assessed pairwise similarities of dytiscid community, i.e. the variation of species composition between clustered and isolated ponds in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. We investigated how dytiscid community similarity is affected by Euclidean distances between ponds, as an indicator of structural connectivity. Results: We found that clustered ponds shared more species than isolated ponds. Dytiscid species community similarity responded negatively to increasing Euclidean distance between ponds. Effectively dispersing species were widely distributed across the landscape, while poor dispersers were scarcely distributed in the same landscape. Conclusions: Structural connectivity determines which species are able to disperse successfully, with poor dispersers restricted to well-connected ponds. The different responses of effective dispersers and poor dispersers to the same structural connectivity indicate that functional connectivity determines species composition. We recommend providing well-connected aquatic habitats in urban landscapes and the implementation of measures to reduce isolation of wetland assemblages. Even clustered ponds need dispersal from other habitats to ensure their contribution to urban biodiversity. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - A spatial framework for targeting urban planning for pollinators and people with local stakeholders: A route to healthy, blossoming communities?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Pollinators such as bees and hoverflies are essential components of an urban ecosystem, supporting and contributing to the biodiversity, functioning, resilience and visual amenity of green infrastructure. Their urban habitats also deliver health and well-being benefits to society, by providing important opportunities for accessing nature nearby to the homes of a growing majority of people living in towns and cities. However, many pollinator species are in decline, and the loss, degradation and fragmentation of natural habitats are some of the key drivers of this change. Urban planners and other practitioners need evidence to carefully prioritise where they focus their resources to provide and maintain a high quality, multifunctional green infrastructure network that supports pollinators and people. We provide a modelling framework to inform green infrastructure planning as a nature based solution with social and ecological benefits. We show how habitat suitability models (HSM) incorporating remote sensed vegetation data can provide important information on the influence of urban landcover composition and spatial configuration on species distributions across cities. Using Edinburgh, Scotland, as a case study city, we demonstrate this approach for bumble bees and hoverflies, providing high resolution predictive maps that identify pollinator habitat hotspots and pinch points across the city. By combining this spatial HSM output with health deprivation data, we highlight ‘win-win’ opportunity areas in most need of improved green infrastructure to support pollinator habitat quality and connectivity, as well as societal health and well-being. In addition, in collaboration with municipal planners, local stakeholders, and partners from a local greenspace learning alliance, we identified opportunities for citizen engagement activities to encourage interest in wildlife gardening as part of a ‘pollinator pledge’. We conclude that this quantitative, spatially explicit and transferable approach provides a useful decision-making tool for targeting nature-based solutions to improve biodiversity and increase environmental stewardship, with the aim of providing a more attractive city to live, work and invest in.

TI  - Non-native species in Canada's boreal zone: Diversity, impacts, and risk1
PY  - 2014
AB  - More than 1180 non-native species, mostly of Palaearctic origin, have been recorded from the boreal zone of Canada, with the highest diversity on the island of Newfoundland and in the southern boreal zone of Ontario and Quebec. The non-native biota of the boreal zone (and of Canada in general) is poorly known in terms of species composition and distribution. A large proportion of species are associated with disturbed anthropogenic habitats such as urban areas, agricultural landscapes, transportation and communication corridors, and industrial developments. Natural habitats in the boreal zone have a high degree of resistance to invasion compared with those of other Canadian zones, likely owing to harsh climates, low light levels, poor soil nutrient availability, low soil pH, low productivity, and dense covering of the ground by plants, especially bryophytes. Of the relatively few non-native species that have successfully colonized the boreal zone, many decline greatly in abundance after a few years, suggesting biotic resilience. To date the boreal zone has shown the least resistance and resilience to large vertebrates (moose and white-tailed deer) translocated to islands, diseases of vertebrates, and earthworms. In general, the ecological impacts of non-native species on the boreal zone have been poorly studied, and there are few examples where such impacts are evident. Likewise, there has been little attempt to quantify the economic impacts of non-native species in either the boreal zone or in Canada as a whole. In the few cases where management measures have been implemented for highly destructive non-native species, results have been somewhat successful, especially where classical biological control measures have been implemented against insects on trees. Chemical and mechanical management measures have had only limited success in localized situations. Management resources are most effectively applied to reducing the risk of introduction. The risk to the boreal zone posed by future new non-native species is increasing with the warming climate and the fast and direct transport of goods into the boreal zone from points of origin. Five recommendations are provided to address recognized gaps concerning non-native species. © 2014 Published by NRC Research Press.

TI  - The use of remotely sensed data to model habitat selections of pileated woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus) in fragmented landscapes
PY  - 2022
AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and four-channel red, green, blue, and near-infrared (RGBI) remote sensed imageries allow an accurate quantification and contiguous measurement of vegetation characteristics and forest structures. This information facilitates the generation of habitat structure variables for forest species distribution modelling. However, applications of remote sensing data, especially the combination of structural and spectral information, to support evidence-based decisions in forest managements and conservation practices at local scale are not widely adopted. In this study, we examined the habitat requirements of pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) (PW) in Hamilton County, Ohio, using ecologically relevant forest structural and vegetation characteristics derived from LiDAR and RGBI data. We hypothesized that the habitat of PW is shaped by vegetation characteristics that are directly associated with the availability of food, hiding and nesting resources, the spatial arrangement of habitat patches within home range, as well as proximity to water sources. We used 186 PW presence or absence locations to model their presence and absence in generalized additive model (GAM) at two scales, representing foraging and home range size, respectively. The results confirm PW's preference for tall and large mature stands with structural complexity, typical of late-successional or old-growth forests. Besides, the crown size of dead trees shows a positive relationship with PW occurrence, therefore indicating the importance of declining living trees or early-stage dead trees within PW home range. These locations are preferred by PW for nest cavity excavation as it attempts to balance the ease of excavation and tree security. In addition, we found that PW can adjust its travel distance to the nearest water resource, suggesting that habitat fragmentation can have certain impacts on PW. Based on our findings, we recommend that forest managers should use different priorities to manage nesting, roosting, and feeding habitats. Particularly, when devising forest management and hazard tree removal plans, one needs to consider retaining enough cavity trees within high-quality PW habitat. By mapping PW habitat suitability for the study area, we highlight the importance of riparian corridor in facilitating PW to adjust to the fragmented urban landscape. Indeed, habitat improvement for PW in the study area could be achieved by conserving riparian corridors and promoting riparian forest succession along major rivers in Hamilton County. © 2022

TI  - Assessing urban forest structure and health in Shenyang, China
PY  - 2008
AB  - This article summarizes the assessment of the urban forest structure and health in central areas of Shenyang, China. Urban forest cover analysis was conducted using aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and a field survey of 282 plots as major study methods. Based on the location, function, and management objectives, the urban forests were classified into five cover types: landscape forests, ecologic forests, road forests, park forests, and commercial forests. Total tree cover in the study area is 7.85%. Most trees and shrubs are in good to very good health and have relatively small diameter at breast height and height. The major tree species are different in urban and suburban areas, which was the result of the natural occurrence of the species and manmade disturbances. Major recommendations for the future management include increasing urban forest cover, especially in the city center, east side, and outskirts; and increasing species diversity and urban forest connectivity. © 2008 International Society of Arboriculture.

TI  - Bird diversity along a riparian corridor in a moderate urban landscape
PY  - 2020
AB  - Civilization built around rivers directly affects riparian corridor structure and ecology. Degradation, pollution, and deterioration along riparian corridors in urban landscapes change species composition and biodiversity. Birds are one of the most vulnerable taxa to ecological changes. The main objective of our study was to spatially compare bird species richness, abundance, and community structure along the Asar River, an urban riparian corridor in Düzce, Turkey. We identified 63 bird species, comprising 6722 individuals, and classified them into one of three groups: generalist species (11 species), woodland species (40 species), and waterbird species (12 species). Bird species richness was positively related to vegetative cover and negatively to urbanization. Richness was low in the winter and was higher during spring and summer. Riparian Quality Index (RQI) scores (mean = 54.8 ± 33.7; max. = 97 and min. = 5) were relatively low for all sampling plots and was reduced by human activities (e.g., roads, farmland, settlement). The number of woodland bird species changed positively (r = 0.71) with RQI. The generalist bird species, adapted to urbanization, were more common around settlements and open areas. Human population and settlement around Asar River increased one-third and farmland and natural habitat decreased one-fifth during the last decade. The area has high potential for growth and increased urbanization, thus increasing the pressure on the natural areas. Activities that diminish the amount of tree cover in the riparian corridor should be avoided. Habitat restoration and rehabilitation will increase RQI values, which can be used as indicators for bird richness in urban landscapes and benefit avian diversity along the riparian corridor. The existing riparian corridor and any enhancements to the corridor will help conserve Düzce's biodiversity in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Long-distance dispersal of plants by vehicles as a driver of plant invasions
PY  - 2007
AB  - Roadsides are preferential migration corridors for invasive plant species and can act as starting points for plant invasions into adjacent habitats. Rapid spread and interrupted distribution patterns of introduced plant species indicate long-distance dispersal along roads. The extent to which this process is due to species' migration along linear habitats or, alternatively, to seed transport by vehicles has not yet been tested systematically. We tested this by sampling seeds inside long motorway tunnels to exclude nontraffic dispersal. Vehicles transported large amounts of seeds. The annual seed rain caused by vehicles on the roadsides of five different tunnel lanes within three tunnels along a single urban motorway in Berlin, Germany, ranged from 635 to 1579 seeds/m2/year. Seeds of non-native species accounted for 50.0% of the 204 species and 54.4% of the total 11,818 seeds trapped inside the tunnels. Among the samples were 39 (19.1%) highly invasive species that exhibit detrimental effects on native biodiversity in some parts of the world. By comparing the flora in the tunnel with that adjacent to the tunnel entrances we confirmed long-distance dispersal events (&gt;250 m) for 32.3% of the sampled species. Seed sources in a radius of 100 m around the entrances of the tunnels had no significant effect on species richness and species composition of seed samples from inside the tunnels, indicating a strong effect of long-distance dispersal by vehicles. Consistently, the species composition of the tunnel seeds was more similar to the regional roadside flora of Berlin than to the local flora around the tunnel entrances. Long-distance dispersal occurred significantly more frequently in seeds of non-native (mean share 38.5%) than native species (mean share 4.1%). Our results showed that long-distance dispersal by vehicles was a routine rather than an occasional mechanism. Dispersal of plants by vehicles will thus accelerate plant invasions and induce rapid changes in biodiversity patterns. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.

TI  - City-Dwellers and Country Folks: Lack of Population Differentiation Along an Urban-Rural Gradient in the Mosquito Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae).
PY  - 2017
AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera, Culicidae) occur in natural, urban, and peri-urban areas throughout the globe. Although the characteristics of urban and peri-urban habitats differ from those of natural habitats in many ways (e.g., fragmentation, pollution, noise, and light), few studies have examined the population connectivity of mosquitoes in urban areas. To obtain an overview of the species composition, we sampled mosquitoes from 23 sites in and around the city of Berlin, Germany. Of 23 species, five occurred in urban, 10 in peri-urban, and 20 in rural areas. Culex pipiens Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) was the most common species collected (75% of all individuals) and occurred in all habitats. Hence this species was selected to be analysed at 10 microsatellite markers. There was no significant differentiation (FST = 0.016, P = 0.9) or isolation by distance (P = 0.06) among Cx. pipiens populations along an urban-rural gradient. The only significant differences detected were between Cx. pipiens and a laboratory population of Cx. pipiens f. molestus (pairwise FST = 0.114-0.148, P ≤ 0.001 in all comparisons), suggesting that the markers chosen were suitable for the identification of population differentiation. Our results indicate that Cx. pipiens gene flow is widespread within and among urban, peri-urban, and rural areas and that urban habitat does not necessarily impede or enhance gene flow among these populations.

TI  - Fine-scale temporal and spatial population fluctuations of medium sized carnivores in a Mediterranean agricultural matrix
PY  - 2017
AB  - Many Mediterranean ecosystems are human-dominated landscapes comprising a mosaic of agricultural, natural and semi-natural habitats alongside urban areas. The size, spatial pattern and connectivity of these “mosaic landscapes” promote changes in wildlife behavior, movement patterns and habitat use. Study how spatiotemporal landscape changes impact the spatial dynamics of a mammalian carnivore guild. We quantified multi-season activity rates/density from camera trap encounters using N-mixture models. One hundred cameras were located at 25 sites, divided into five categories: nature reserve; large natural area; vineyards within natural area; vineyards near settlements; vineyards within the core agricultural matrix. Golden jackals (Canis aureus) were active in anthropogenic modified landscapes. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) avoided the core activity areas of jackal during summer and restricted their activity to their peripheries. European badgers (Meles meles) were active in natural patches during winter, but shifted their activity during summer to agricultural fields embedded within natural patches. Feral and wilds cats (Felis silvestris) were highly active in the natural patches during winter and shifted their activity to the agricultural matrix during summer. Intra-guild spatio-temporal activity patterns of carnivores in mosaic landscapes are distinct and unique to each species. The patterns were affected by season, land-use, and jackal activity rates, reflecting inter-specific resource-dependent competitive interactions. The findings highlight the complexity of intra-guild space-use patterns, and shed doubt on the effectiveness of simple solutions to landscape conservation problems.

TI  - Population genetics, community of parasites, and resistance to rodenticides in an urban brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) population
PY  - 2017
AB  - Brown rats are one of the most widespread urban species worldwide. Despite the nuisances they induce and their potential role as a zoonotic reservoir, knowledge on urban rat populations remains scarce. The main purpose of this study was to characterize an urban brown rat population from Chanteraines park (Hauts-de-Seine, France), with regards to haematology, population genetics, immunogenic diversity, resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides, and community of parasites. Haematological parameters were measured. Population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. Immunogenic diversity was assessed for Mhc-Drb. Frequency of the Y139F mutation (conferring resistance to rodenticides) and two linked microsatellites were studied, concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver. Combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used to investigate the occurrence of 25 parasites. Statistical approaches were used to explore multiple parasite relationships and model parasite occurrence. Eighty-six rats were caught. The first haematological data for a wild urban R. norvegicus population was reported. Genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between Chanteraines rats and surrounding population(s). We found a high prevalence (55.8%) of the mutation Y139F and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals. The parasite species richness was high (16). Seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified, together with a surprisingly high diversity of Leptospira species (4). Chanteraines rat population is not closed, allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging, particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent. Parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception. Furthermore, the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens, of which four Leptospira species, in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens. Our findings should stimulate future discussions about the development of a long-term rat-control management program in Chanteraines urban park. © 2017 Desvars-Larrive et al.

TI  - Butterfly (Lepidoptera) assemblage composition and distribution patterns in king sabata dalindyebo municipality, eastern cape, South Africa
PY  - 2014
AB  - Butterflies (Lepidoptera) have attracted more attention as bio-indicators of terrestrial ecosystems than other terrestrial arthropods. This study determined butterfly species turnover at a priori selected habitat patches inside Nduli Nature Reserve and its surrounding landscape, and their response to measured environmental variables. Using the line transect method, 516 butterfly individuals belonging to 22 species were sampled from all 16 sampling units (Sus), of which 13 species occurred in two or more Sus across the study site. Habitat patches outside the reserve were higher in butterfly species richness and abundance than inside the reserve. Papilio demodocus Esper, Borbo gemella Mabille, Precis octavia (Cramer) and Hypolimnas missipus (Linnaeus) were each restricted to one sampling unit. Hierarchical clustering using Bray-Curtis similarity matrices and correspondence analyses grouped sampling units according to butterfly species sampled. Canonical correspondence analysis results indicated that certain site (environmental) variables, e.g. percentage herb cover, grazing intensity, distance to the city centre and average flower density accounted for species distribution patterns across Sus. The implications of the study suggest that habitat patch level management for conservation action should aim at preserving sufficient herb cover and nectaring plants, especially during the summer season to cater for all developmental stages of butterfly species in the study area. Furthermore, species richness within the reserve can be encouraged by using vegetation linkages and corridors between the reserve and its surrounding landscape. Butterflies identified during the study can serve as indicator species for assessing the conservation value of habitat patches in the study area and for increasing public awareness of the need to conserve butterflies and the invertebrate fauna of the King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality between the months of November and April.

TI  - Relationship between parameters of public parks and their surroundings and the richness, diversity and species composition of vascular herbaceous plants on the example of Krakow in Central Europe
PY  - 2021
AB  - Greenery is a natural value in urban space. To maintain the richness and diversity of greenery, it is necessary to understand the factors and mechanisms that influence vegetation. The purpose of this paper was to determine the impact of selected features of public parks and factors on the richness and diversity of herbaceous plants. In Krakow public parks, this richness and diversity is greater in parks with a larger area and habitat heterogeneity, the presence of migration corridors, and natural elements. Full stand coverage negatively affects diversity. Biologically inactive surface affects richness and diversity as well as a number of different groups of plant species. The presence of rare and nonsynanthropic species is related to the park’s surface, natural elements, and its heterogeneity. © 2021, Landscape Online. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Predicting future distributions and dispersal pathways for precautionary management of human-raccoon dog conflicts in metropolitan landscapes
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Human-wildlife conflicts in cities are becoming increasingly common worldwide and are a challenge to urban biodiversity management and landscape planning. In comparison to compensatory management, which often focuses on addressing emergency conflicts, precautionary management allows decision-makers to better allocate limited resources on prioritized areas and initiate long-term actions in advance. However, precautionary approaches have rarely been developed or applied in biodiversity conservation. Since 2020, human-raccoon dog conflicts in Shanghai, one of the largest cities in the world, have tripled in reported number due to the rapid spread of the species in the city from 70 residential districts in 2020 to 249 residential districts in 2022. Here, we use ensemble and circuit modeling to predict suitable raccoon dog habitat and identify their potential dispersal pathways to aid the development of precautionary management strategies. We find that raccoon dog distribution is positively associated with several anthropogenic factors, including residential buildings and nighttime light, which could be signs that the species’ foraging behavior has adapted to the urban environment. We find that raccoon dogs only occupy 10.1% of its suitable habitat, and thus there is a high potential for the expansion of the raccoon dog population and more frequent human-raccoon dog conflicts in the near future. We predict 60 potential dispersal pathways across Shanghai, seven of which cross densely human populated areas and are likely to trigger excessive conflicts. Based on our findings, we propose priority areas where precautionary management strategies, such as constraining stray animal feeding and wildlife-vehicle collision prevention, would potentially alleviate human-raccoon dog conflicts. We present the first study on the precautionary approach of human-wildlife conflict in China’s major cities, and provide a practical example of how comprehensive modeling approaches can be used as the foundation of precautionary management in urban landscapes.</jats:p>

TI  - Ecological effects of daylighting and plant reintroduction to the Cheonggye Stream in Seoul, Korea
PY  - 2020
AB  - Seoul's Cheonggye Stream Reconstruction Project removed the concrete road surface that had covered the stream basin for decades to allow sunlight to the stream, reconstructed the stream's channel, restored the surface flow of water by pumping water from the river's downstream to its upstream area, and reintroduced riparian vegetation. Although the project did not fulfill the conditions of ecological restoration, there were a few ecological effects that this project brought. The reconstructed Cheonggye stream has enhanced species diversity and decreased the percentage of exotic species compared to an unrestored urban stream. Also, the species composition of the reintroduced riparian vegetation of the Cheonggye stream has since grown to more closely resemble the natural reference streams, whereas dissimilar to the degraded urban reference site. The re-established vegetation has attracted numerous animal species, and thereby increasing the size and diversity of the biota from 17 species before reconstruction to approximately 400 species. Consequently, the naturalness of the reconstructed Cheonggye stream, as indicated by morphological and ecological characteristics, has improved markedly. In addition, the reconstruction project also improved the water quality, as reflected by the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). But the restoration of the Cheonggye stream is still underway and several requirements still need to be met to fully actualize true restoration. First, the river zone should be extended and linked to the surrounding terrestrial ecosystems to create an ecological network based on ecological information from the reference area. Second, more diverse microhabitats should be created within the waterway to support greater biodiversity. Flooding during the rainy season produces various microhabitats and human assistance can aid this natural occurrence. Finally, species composition and its spatial arrangement were focused on landscaping during the reconstruction; this approach should be changed to reflect the principles of ecological restoration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatio-temporal survey of small mammal-borne Trypanosoma lewisi in Cotonou, Benin, and the potential risk of human infection
PY  - 2019
AB  - Human trypanosomoses are the sleeping sickness in Africa and Chagas disease in Latin America. However, atypical human infections by animal trypanosomes have been described, but poorly investigated. Among them, the supposed rat-specific T. lewisi was shown to be responsible for a few severe cases. In Africa, the scarcity of data and the null awareness about the atypical human trypanosomoses suggest that the number of cases may be higher that currently thought. Furthermore, T. lewisi is resistant to normal human serum and therefore a potential human pathogen. In order to document T. lewisi distribution and ecology, a qPCR- and 16DNA sequencing-based survey was conducted in 369 rodents from three urban districts of Cotonou city, Benin, during three different periods of the same year. Our study demonstrated very high prevalence (57.2%) even when considering only individuals identified as positive through DNA sequencing (39.2%). Black rats represented the most dominant as well as the most T. lewisi-parasitized species. No difference was retrieved neither between seasons nor districts, suggesting a large infestation of rodents by trypanosomes throughout the year and the city. Our results suggest that conditions are gathered for rat to human transmission of T. lewisi in these socio-environmentally degraded urban areas, thus pointing towards the rapidly urbanizing Abidjan-Lagos corridor as a region at particular risk. © 2019

TI  - Implementing green infrastructure for the spatial planning of peri-urban areas in Geneva, Switzerland
PY  - 2020
AB  - The concept of green infrastructure (GI) seeks to identify and prioritize areas of high ecological value for wildlife and people, to improve the integration of natural values in landscape planning decisions. In 2018, the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, established a roadmap for biodiversity conservation, which includes the operationalization of GI covering 30% of the territory by 2030. In this paper, we demonstrate a GI mapping framework in the canton of Geneva. Our approach is based on the combined assessment of three 'pillars', namely species' distribution, landscape structure and connectivity, and ecosystem services, to optimize the allocation of conservation actions using the spatial prioritization software, Zonation. The identified priority conservation areas closely overlap existing natural reserves. Including the three pillars in the landscape prioritization should also improve adhesion to the GI idea, without undermining the protection of threatened species. With regards to land use planning, public and private land parcels with high values for GI may require specific incentives to maintain their desirable characteristics, as they are more likely to be degraded than areas with more building restrictions. Visualizing priority conservation areas in a spatially explicit manner will support decision-makers in Geneva to optimally allocate limited resources for ecosystem preservation. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Large scale patterns of genetic variation and differentiation in sugar maple from tropical Central America to temperate North America
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: Geological events in the latter Cenozoic have influenced the distribution, abundance and genetic structure of tree populations in temperate and tropical North America. The biogeographical history of temperate vegetation that spans large ranges of latitude is complex, involving multiple latitudinal shifts that might have occurred via different migration routes. We determined the regional structuring of genetic variation of sugar maple (Acer saccharum subsp. saccharum) and its only subspecies in tropical America (Acer saccharum subsp. skutchii) using nuclear and chloroplast data. The studied populations span a geographic range from Maine, USA (46°N), to El Progreso, Guatemala (15°N). We examined genetic subdivisions, explored the locations of ancestral haplotypes, analyzed genetic data to explore the presence of a single or multiple glacial refugia, and tested whether genetic lineages are temporally consistent with a Pleistocene or older divergence. Results: Nuclear and chloroplast data indicated that populations in midwestern USA and western Mexico were highly differentiated from populations in the rest of the sites. The time of the most recent common ancestor of the western Mexico haplotype lineage was dated to the Pliocene (5.9 Ma, 95 % HPD: 4.3-7.3 Ma). Splits during the Pleistocene separated the rest of the phylogroups. The most frequent and widespread haplotype occurred in half of the sites (Guatemala, eastern Mexico, southeastern USA, and Ohio). Our data also suggested that multiple Pleistocene refugia (tropics-southeastern USA, midwestern, and northeastern USA), but not western Mexico (Jalisco), contributed to post-glacial northward expansion of ranges. Current southern Mexican and Guatemalan populations have reduced population sizes, genetic bottlenecks and tend toward homozygosity, as indicated using nuclear and chloroplast markers. Conclusions: The divergence of western Mexican populations from the rest of the sugar maples likely resulted from orographic and volcanic barriers to gene flow. Past connectivity among populations in the southeastern USA and eastern Mexico and Guatemala possible occurred through gene flow during the Pleistocene. The time to the most common ancestor values revealed that populations from the Midwest and Northeast USA represented different haplotype lineages, indicating major divergence of haplotypes lineages before the Last Glacial Maximum and suggesting the existence of multiple glacial refugia. © 2015 Vargas-Rodriguez et al.

TI  - Detecting nestedness in city parks for urban biodiversity conservation
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanization has been a global phenomenon producing great environmental and ecological challenges including species composition shifts in urban areas. To evaluate the interaction networks of the inhabitant metacommunities in urban parks, we applied the nestedness analysis using ecological survey data of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies among 16 parks in Taipei City of Taiwan and identified critical environmental factors for biodiversity conservation. Results found significant nestedness of the metacommunities among these parks, which indicated strong interaction networks and the importance of urban parks for sustaining these metacommunities. In addition, various types of land use had different effects on the species incidence of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies. It demonstrates that landscape design should consider the taxonomic differences in the development of conservation guidelines. Results also showed that the area of parks and the area of woodlot in the park were critical elements for the nested structure. Nonetheless, abundant bird generalists were found to be highly related to the area of buildings within parks, distance to forests, rivers, and the neighbouring parks. Moreover, exotic species were found to affect the interaction networks of native species. However, based on the current information, we cannot confirm the actual effects of the exotic species on the native assemblages. Reptiles and frogs appeared to be more easily threatened by land development and habitat fragmentation due to their lower vagility. In this regard, we suggest that conservation action should focus on preserving green space with large areas and constructing green corridors, creating crucial elements, and increasing the vertical complexity in the parks for species with various vagilities. We believe these strategies can help reduce the impact of urbanization to retain healthy interactions and connections of metacommunities among habitats for effective biodiversity conservation in urban areas. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Housing is positively associated with invasive exotic plant species richness in New England, USA
PY  - 2010
AB  - Understanding the factors related to invasive exotic species distributions at broad spatial scales has important theoretical and management implications, because biological invasions are detrimental to many ecosystem functions and processes. Housing development facilitates invasions by disturbing land cover, introducing nonnative landscaping plants, and facilitating dispersal of propagules along roads. To evaluate relationships between housing and the distribution of invasive exotic plants, we asked (1) how strongly is housing associated with the spatial distribution of invasive exotic plants compared to other anthropogenic and environmental factors; (2) what type of housing pattern is related to the richness of invasive exotic plants; and (3) do invasive plants represent ecological traits associated with specific housing patterns Using two types of regression analysis (best subset analysis and hierarchical partitioning analysis), we found that invasive exotic plant richness was equally or more strongly related to housing variables than to other human (e.g., mean income and roads) and environmental (e.g., topography and forest cover) variables at the county level across New England. Richness of invasive exotic plants was positively related to area of wildland-urban interface (WUI), low-density residential areas, change in number of housing units between 1940 and 2000, mean income, plant productivity (NDVI), and altitudinal range and rainfall; it was negatively related to forest area and connectivity. Plant life history traits were not strongly related to housing patterns. We expect the number of invasive exotic plants to increase as a result of future housing growth and suggest that housing development be considered a primary factor in plans to manage and monitor invasive exotic plant species. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Comparative analysis of ecological network pattern using 2D and 3D information in main urban area of Nanjing, China
PY  - 2020
AB  - Habitat fragmentation leads to a sharp decline in biodiversity, affecting habitat ecosystem services. A rational and effective ecological network construction can restore the connection between broken habitat patches in cities. The construction and simulation of the existing urban ecological network are mostly based on two-dimensional data information, and the impact of the multi-ecological niche represented by the three-dimensional structure information of vegetation on the habitat quality is not well considered, so the function effectiveness of the ecological network remains to be verified. This paper quantified the three-dimensional green space vegetation structure based on the airborne LiDAR and high-resolution remote sensing image data in the main urban area of Nanjing city. We extracted the ecological source area and built the landscape resistance surface in two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios, and identified the ecological corridor under the two scenarios based on least-cost path method. Meanwhile we identified the ecological key nodes in the corridors that need to be protected according to the circuit theory, then analyzed the impact of using two-dimensional and three-dimensional ecological spatial information on the results of ecological network construction. The results show that: 1) there are 11 different ecological sources extracted under different scenarios within the study area. Compared with the traditional two-dimensional scenario, using three-dimensional vegetation parameters can more accurately identify ecological sources with rich vegetation structures. 2) There are 137 and 129 ecological corridors constructed in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios, and the average unit resistance of each corridor is 18.2 and 24.0, respectively. The traditional two-dimensional information simulation overestimated the landscape connectivity of the study area. 3) The spatial distribution of key ecological nodes in different scenarios is similar, mainly concentrated in the northwest, middle and southeast of the study area, and more often appear in the source patches with close distance. Based on the above results, this paper proposes some targeted strategies to guide the construction and optimization of the ecological network pattern in the main urban area of Nanjing city. © 2020 Science Press.

TI  - Vegetation succession in restoration of disturbed sites in Central Europe: The direction of succession and species richness across 19 seres
PY  - 2014
AB  - Questions: (1) How do seres differ with respect to vegetation changes? (2) What are the directions of succession? (3) How do species numbers change? (4) How do target species, i.e. those typical of natural and semi-natural vegetation, participate in succession? (5) Are spontaneously developed successional stages acceptable from the point of view of ecosystem restoration? Location: Extracted peatlands, bulldozed sites in forests destroyed by air pollution, an emerged bottom of a water reservoir, corridors of former Iron Curtain, artificial fishpond islands and barriers, sedimentary basins, spoil heaps from mining, stone quarries, forest clearings, road verges, sand and gravel-sand pits, ruderal urban sites, river gravel bars and abandoned arable fields, located in various parts of the Czech Republic in Central Europe. Methods: Phytosociological relevés were recorded in 10-25 m2 plots located in the centre of representative successional stages defined by their age, ranging from 1 to 100 yrs. In total, we obtained 2392 vegetation samples containing 951 species. We performed DCA ordination to compare 19 seres. Desirable target species were considered as those representing (semi)-natural vegetation and all Red List species. Results: The seres studied are more similar in their species composition in the initial and early stages, in which synathropic species prevail, than in the later stages when the vegetation differentiates. This divergence is driven mainly by local moisture conditions. In most cases, succession led to woodland, which usually established after ca. 20 yrs. In very dry or wet places (with limited presence of woody species) open vegetation developed, often highly valuable from the restoration and conservation point of view. The total number of species and the number of target species increased in the majority of seres with successional age. Conclusions: The vegetation in the sites studied formed a continuum along a moisture gradient and by successional age. The individual seres largely overlapped in their species composition; the sere identity was not significant. Spontaneous succession usually proceeded towards woodland, except at very dry or wet sites, and generally appeared to be an ecologically suitable way of ecosystem restoration of disturbed sites because target species became dominant over time. © 2013 International Association for Vegetation Science.

TI  - Urban forest corridors in Australia: Policy, management and technology
PY  - 2013
AB  - This paper demonstrates the importance of the remaining urban forests, and the related policy and management issues, by reviewing the current situation in Sydney, Australia. Transport corridor vegetation surveys are used to show challenges and implications for the future. The process of medium to long-term policy formulation, with initial management strategy development at the local level, is outlined. This study also addresses the increasing need for integration with other urban issues, including the existing general urban forest strategies. The benefits of using active remote sensing technologies are illustrated by using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to generate a high resolution, 3-dimensional surface model. Among the major transport corridors in the Sydney metropolitan area, segments of two long-established main roads were selected for detailed studies of the roadside forest resource. Data analysis indicated that roadside trees are very diverse and distributed in a patchy way. Some areas are treeless and some have dense stands. The results also showed high variability in species composition between local areas, with canopy cover and shading varying widely. We identify a number of issues and lessons from conservation, pollution and socio-economic perspectives, which have broader applications, and relate these findings back to policies and planning. © 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Ecological Networks in Urban Forest Fragments Reveal Species Associations between Native and Invasive Plant Communities
PY  - 2022
AB  - Forest fragments are characteristic features of many megacities that have survived the urbanisation process and are often represented by unique assemblages of flora and fauna. Such woodlands are representations of nature in the city-often dominated by non-native and invasive species that coexist with resilient native congeners and purposefully introduced flora. These forest fragments also provide significant ecosystem services to urban society and therefore, understanding their compositional patterns is of considerable importance for conservation and management. In this work, we use a complex network approach to investigate species assemblages across six distinct urban forest fragments in the South Delhi Ridge area of the National Capital Territory, India. We generate bipartite ecological networks using conventional vegetation sampling datasets, followed by network partitioning to identify multiple cliques across the six forest fragments. Our results show that urban woodlands primarily form invasive-native associations, and that major invasive species, such as <i>Prosopis juliflora</i> and <i>Lantana camara</i> exclude each other while forming cliques. Our findings have implications for the conservation of these urban forests and highlight the importance of using network approaches in vegetation analysis.

TI  - Floral abundance, richness, and spatial distribution drive urban garden bee communities
PY  - 2017
AB  - In urban landscapes, gardens provide refuges for bee diversity, but conservation potential may depend on local and landscape features. Foraging and population persistence of bee species, as well as overall pollinator community structure, may be supported by the abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources. Floral resources strongly differ in urban gardens. Using hand netting and pan traps to survey bees, we examined whether abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources, as well as ground cover and garden landscape surroundings influence bee abundance, species richness, and diversity on the central coast of California. Differences in floral abundance and spatial distribution, as well as urban cover in the landscape, predicted different bee community variables. Abundance of all bees and of honeybees (Apis mellifera) was lower in sites with more urban land cover surrounding the gardens. Honeybee abundance was higher in sites with patchy floral resources, whereas bee species richness and bee diversity was higher in sites with more clustered floral resources. Surprisingly, bee species richness and bee diversity was lower in sites with very high floral abundance, possibly due to interactions with honeybees. Other studies have documented the importance of floral abundance and landscape surroundings for bees in urban gardens, but this study is the first to document that the spatial arrangement of flowers strongly predicts bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings, it is likely that garden managers may promote bee conservation by managing for floral connectivity and abundance within these ubiquitous urban habitats. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.

TI  - Predicting forest grouse distribution taking account of spatial autocorrelation
PY  - 2005
AB  - Spatially explicit, multi-scale models for predictions of species potential distribution can be useful tools for integrating biodiversity considerations in planning and strategic environmental assessment. In such models, the occurrences of focal species are related to habitat and landscape variables, which in urbanising areas should also include effects of urban disturbances. Moreover, the accuracy of the spatial predictive models may be affected by spatial autocorrelation, which means that a part of the variance is explained by neighbouring values. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of habitat and disturbance patterns on the distribution of two forest grouse species, Tetrao urogallus and Bonasa bonasia, and to detect and model the effects of spatial autocorrelation. The distribution of the two species could be explained in terms of reduction of a main predator, habitat quality, quantity and connectivity, including urban disturbances. The residuals of the initial regressions showed positive spatial autocorrelation that could be quantified by using a spatial probit model. The application of the spatial probit model revealed strongly significant spatial dependencies for both species. Furthermore, the model fit could be increased for T. urogallus by applying this model. The results implied that both species distributions might be affected by both reactions to the underlying land-use pattern, but also by interaction with neighbours. The use of the spatial probit model is a way to incorporate spatial interactions that otherwise cannot be captured by the independent variables. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling the trade-offs between urban development and ecological process based on landscape multi-functionality and regional ecological networks
PY  - 2020
AB  - The process of urbanization and urban land use conversion inevitably disturbs the structure and function of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem services. Integrating ecosystem services into effective policies and planning at the regional scale to achieve sustainable urban development is still a challenge. The goal of this research is to optimize spatial patterns of urban development by assessing and comparing multiple trade-off scenarios between ecological processes and urban expansion, incorporating planning and design into spatially explicit methods, and integrating ecosystem services into decision-making procedures. We develop a conceptual framework for regional urban-ecological sustainability with six steps: pattern recognition, landscape process, problem diagnosis, integrated ecological network, urbanization simulation, and decision-support. We apply this framework to a case in which planning and design have followed the rational-comprehensive approach. Results demonstrate that landscape multi-functionality and regional ecological networks are significantly improved using our integrated approach to planning and design, because it provides vital information for regional planning to cope with the urgent need for ecological protection and urban development. By comparing urban growth under three scenarios, we found that the trade-off scenario based on ecological conservation and restoration (medium security level) resolved conflict more effectively, which restricted urban expansion on land of high ecological importance by constructing regional ecological networks. In addition, using field survey and species distribution model approaches, we design plant community types with complementary tree, shrub, and herb species as part of the decision-making procedure, which can restore zonal vegetation and the hydrological cycle in rugged mountain regions. The research concludes that regional urban-ecological sustainability based on scientific assessment, planning, and design provides a rational basis for sustainable urban development and landscape management. © 2020 Newcastle University.

TI  - FIRELAN—An Ecologically Based Planning Model towards a Fire Resilient and Sustainable Landscape. A Case Study in Center Region of Portugal
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>This paper explores the role of landscape planning as a tool for rural fire prevention. It presents a methodology for a fire resilient and sustainable landscape model (FIRELAN) that articulates the ecological and cultural components in a suitable and multifunction land-use plan. FIRELAN is a conceptual and ecologically based model that recognizes river basin’ land morphology, microclimate and species combustibility as the fundamental factors that determine fire behavior and landscape resilience, along with the ecological network (EN) for achieving ecological sustainability of the landscape. The model is constituted by the FIRELAN Network and the Complementary Areas. This network ensures the effectiveness of discontinuities in the landscape with less combustible land-uses. It also functions as a fire-retardant technique and protection of wildland-urban interface (WUI). This model is applied to municipalities from Portugal’s center region, a simplified landscape severely damaged by recurrent rural fires. The results show that land-use and tree species composition should change drastically, whereas about 72% of the case study needs transformation actions. This requires a significant increase of native or archaeophytes species, agricultural areas, landscape discontinuities and the restoration of biodiversity in Natura 2000 areas. The EN components are 79% of the FIRELAN N area, whose implementation ensures soil and water conservation, biodiversity and habitats. This paper contributes to the discussion of the Portuguese rural fires planning framework.</jats:p>

However, it is not clear how urbanization affects amphibian communities at both local (pond) and landscape scales. We assessed the breeding distribution of frogs in ponds along an urban-rural gradient in Greater Melbourne, Australia, and examined community relationships with habitat quality and landscape context. We sampled frog larvae at 65 ponds on four separate occasions and collected data on local pond and landscape variables. Using Bayesian Poisson regression modeling we found that species richness decreased at ponds surrounded by high densities of human residents and at ponds with high water conductivity, whereas species richness increased substantially at ponds surrounded by a high proportion of green open space. Ordination of individual species presence-absence data by canonical correspondence analysis largely confirmed these findings. Ordination also highlighted the negative influences of pond shading and density of predatory fish, and the positive influence of aquatic vegetation, on community composition. Individual species' responses to urbanization varied. Urbanization had strong negative effects on species that were associated with well-vegetated, sunny, fish-free ponds. Our study highlights the importance of strategic management actions in urban landscapes to improve terrestrial habitat and connectivity around ponds and other wetlands, and local management actions to improve water quality, remove predatory fish, and plant aquatic vegetation at breeding sites. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Spatial mismatch analysis among hotspots of alien plant species, road and railway networks in Germany and Austria
PY  - 2017
AB  - Road and railway networks are pervasive elements of all environments, which have expanded intensively over the last century in all European countries. These transportation infrastructures have major impacts on the surrounding landscape, representing a threat to biodiversity. Roadsides and railways may function as corridors for dispersal of alien species in fragmented landscapes. However, only few studies have explored the spread of invasive species in relationship to transport network at large spatial scales. We performed a spatial mismatch analysis, based on a spatially explicit correlation test, to investigate whether alien plant species hotspots in Germany and Austria correspond to areas of high density of roads and railways. We tested this independently of the effects of dominant environments in each spatial unit, in order to focus just on the correlation between occurrence of alien species and density of linear transportation infrastructures. We found a significant spatial association between alien plant species hotspots distribution and roads and railways density in both countries. As expected, anthropogenic landscapes, such as urban areas, harbored more alien plant species, followed by water bodies. However, our findings suggested that the distribution of neobiota is strongest correlated to road/railways density than to land use composition. This study provides new evidence, from a transnational scale, that alien plants can use roadsides and rail networks as colonization corridors. Furthermore, our approach contributes to the understanding on alien plant species distribution at large spatial scale by the combination with spatial modeling procedures. © 2017 Benedetti, Morelli.

TI  - Macroinvertebrates in the bed sediment of the Yellow River
PY  - 2011
AB  - Extensive agricultural, industrial and urban development in the Yellow River, China, have modified the sediment-water balance, flow and inundation regimes, longitudinal connectivity, integrity of riparian vegetation, and water quality. Macroinvertebrate assemblages in the bed sediment of main channel and major reservoirs of the Yellow River are described in detail for the first time. A total of 74 taxa comprising 17 taxa of oligochaetes, 48 taxa of aquatic insects, 5 taxa of molluscs, and 4 taxa of other animals were recorded. A range of feeding guilds were represented, including, collector-gatherers (32 taxa), predators (17 taxa), scrapers (16 taxa), shredders (6 taxa) and collector-filterers (2 taxa). Both the mean density and biomass of macroinvertebrates were significantly higher in sites located in the artificial reservoirs compared with the main river channel. Assemblages varied spatially; Oligochaetes dominated assemblages in upper reaches, insects dominated in middle reaches and other animals (e.g. Crustacea) dominated in lower reaches. Collector-gatherers were dominant throughout the entire river. Classification analysis identified five site-groups on the basis of macroinvertebrate presence/absence: downstream of reservoirs; vegetated sites; reservoir sites; polluted sites, and; lower-reach sites. Lower macroinvertebrate richness, density and biomass, compared with other similar large rivers, were attributed to modification of the sediment-water balance and associated disturbance of benthic habitats. Pollution, stability of sediment and sediment concentration combined to influence the distribution of macroinvertebrates. This knowledge will substantially benefit the recent focus on the health and environmental water requirements of the Yellow River. © 2011 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation and the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.

TI  - Ecological niche modeling in practice: Flagship species and regional conservation planning
PY  - 2013
AB  - Conservation of rare or endemic species is a multifaceted matter, especially whenever knowledge gaps in species' distribution and anthropogenic pressures converge. We combined Geographic Information Systems and ecological niche modeling tools with field data to characterize the habitat types used for different behavioral activities and to identify important areas for conservation of a charismatic bird endemic to northeast South America, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola rupicola). Using species' occurrences and climatic, topographic, and remotely sensed vegetation variables we developed potential distribution models at two scales: (1) broad geographic scale (northern South America), based on georeferenced occurrences obtained from literature and natural history museum specimens, and (2) local scale, based on precise occurrences (GPS coordinates) recorded in the field (Caverna do Maroaga Protected Area, Amazonas, Brazil). We identified six priority areas for the conservation of the cock-of-the-rock corresponding to high environmental suitability and lowest anthropogenic pressure, measured as distance from urban areas and highways (>5 km). Protecting the areas identified in this study from anthropogenic threats such as hunting and selective logging will help to preserve not only the cock-of-the-rock, but also the biodiversity of the whole mosaic of habitats in the region. Our results were incorporated in a regional management plan developed by state agencies and non-governmental organizations. Geographic Information Systems and ecological niche modeling techniques combined with on the ground, local surveys can be useful in species conservation efforts, for planning new inventories, prioritizing areas to be protected, and for creating ecological corridors.

TI  - Multiscale effects of habitat loss and degradation on occurrence and landscape connectivity of a threatened subspecies
PY  - 2021
AB  - Land use change can result in complex environments of varying habitat quality and permeability that directly and indirectly influence the effectiveness of natural areas for wildlife conservation. To assess how isolation and degradation of protected natural areas may affect long-term conservation efforts across the range of a sensitive subspecies, we used multiscale occupancy analysis, species distribution modeling, and circuit theory to identify hotspot areas of occurrence and potential landscape connectivity among areas of high quality habitat within and between protected natural areas. Big Cypress fox squirrels (Sciurus niger avicennia: BCFS) are state-threatened subspecies of fox squirrel endemic to forested wetlands in southwest Florida, which have been highly altered by human activities. Probability of occupancy of BCFS among conservation areas varied widely due to differences in environmental features (Hedge's g = 1.4705, 95% CI: 1.074–1.763). Fine-scale features indicative of habitat degradation, such as increasing midstory vegetation cover and decreasing bromeliad cover, negatively influenced BCFS occurrence. Home-range-level tree canopy cover differentially affected probability of occupancy dependent on proximity to urban areas. Additionally, home-range-level high summer temperature differentially affected probability of occupancy dependent on proximity to cypress domes. Habitat was distributed patchily both within and among conservation areas, separated by large areas of unsuitable vegetation communities and urbanized features that were barriers to movement. Considering the threat of increasing isolation of conservation areas due to continued development as well as current and impending degradation caused by land use and climate change within conservation area boundaries, we suggest a strong need for interagency coordination to improve, maintain, and acquire rights for protection of additional remaining habitat. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Bird community in a forest patch isolated by the urban matrix at the Sinos River basin, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, with comments on the possible local defaunation
PY  - 2010
AB  - We compared the avifauna recorded in a recent survey in an urban park (Parque Municipal Henrique Luís Roessler, Parcão) and surroundings, Novo Hamburgo, RS, with past data, to evaluate the possible alterations in species composition over time. Of the 265 species compiled as original elements of that region, 114 were found at Parcão. Among forest species, 37% were considered locally extinct. The most affected guild was the large frugivores, with nine extinct species and one survivor (Trogon surrucura). Birds highly sensitive to disturbance as well as endemic species were the most extinguished. The possible causes for this loss are fragmentation, hunting and environmental changes. The diversity today is threatened, thus conservation measures are necessary in that region. The most important actions are: maintenance of ecological corridors, protection of natural remnant areas and the establishment of protected areas.

TI  - A multi-scale, multi-species approach highlights the importance of urban greenspace and pond design for amphibian communities
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanisation threatens species through habitat loss, isolation and fragmentation. Greenspace in urban landscapes often provides connectivity and habitat for wetland-dependent species. Accessible greenspace measures the combined effects of movement barriers (e.g., roads) and the total amount of greenspace on populations. I determined whether accessible greenspace was a better predictor of amphibian occupancy at ponds than the total amount of greenspace, and at what spatial scale. I also assessed the relative importance of habitat variables at the local pond-scale. Frog surveys were conducted at 65 ponds distributed along an urban–rural gradient over two breeding seasons in the greater Melbourne region, Australia. Accessible greenspace was mapped around ponds at varying spatial scales (250 m – 2000 m) using potential barriers to amphibian movement. The best-ranked multi-species occupancy model included the proportion of total greenspace within a 1000-m radius of a pond and four local-scale covariates (presence of mosquitofish, pond permanence, vertical pond walls and water conductivity). There was no support for models containing accessible greenspace. There was a positive relationship between the probability of community and species-level occupancy and total greenspace within 1000 m of a pond. There was a negative relationship between mean community occupancy and the presence of a vertical pond wall at a site. There was no apparent effect of barriers on occupancy, indicating that urban areas may be more permeable for movement by some species than predicted. Individual species responses demonstrated that management actions are required at fine and broad spatial scales to benefit amphibian communities in urban landscapes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Adapting floodplain connectivity conditions - A prerequisite for sustaining aquatic macrophyte diversity in the UNESCO biosphere reserve lobau (Austria)
PY  - 2009
AB  - The UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Lobau (Austria), established in 1977 within the city limits of Vienna, is part of the Danube National Park and one of the ecologically richest parts of the Danube River Corridor. Hardly noticed by diverging stakeholder interests the smaller aquatic habitats in the floodplain area are acutely threatened by wetland ageing and terrestrialisation processes. In 2007 an aquatic plant survey was carried out in the water bodies of the active floodplain on the left bank of the Danube main river channel as well as in the semi-separated water bodies of the Lobau. Results clearly show the impact of through-flow on aquatic plant species composition and abundance, as these metrics are significantly higher in the semiseparated location. Suitable water regime for all sensitive aquatic plants is an essential prerequisite for sustaining aquatic macrophyte diversity in the Lobau Biosphere Reserve, and could provide an ecohydrological basis for rehabilitation activities in other regulated river floodplains located in cultivated landscapes.

TI  - Combining land cover, animal behavior, and master plan regulations to assess landscape permeability for birds
PY  - 2021
AB  - Cities are new and expanding ecosystems that harbor a variety of habitats with different degrees of permeability to the local fauna. However, the assessment of urban landscape permeability usually considers biotic and abiotic conditions, with sociopolitical dimensions (e.g., zoning regulations) – also important in shaping urban biodiversity – being underrepresented in the formulation of resistance surfaces. Our main goal was to compare urban landscape permeability for birds between two scenarios: one that considers only species’ responses to land cover for the formulation of resistance surfaces (LandC), and another that incorporates how birds would respond to different levels of occupation (i.e., amount of permeable area and maximum building height per individual lot) given the urban zoning regulations defined by the city's master plan (LandC + UrbZ). We used the software LSCorridors to simulate Multiple Least Cost Corridors (MLCC) for five forest bird species. We hypothesized that incorporating master plan regulations would better describe the variation on landscape resistance through the urban landscape. The simulations resulted in different MLCC among species and between scenarios, highlighted by differences in landscape permeability. As expected, simulations for scenario LandC resulted in more options for straighter paths than simulations for scenario LandC + UrbZ. Our results demonstrate the potential influences of sociopolitical aspects on landscape permeability modelling. Within cities, species movements are influenced not only by behavioral and environmental characteristics, but also by the urban landscape that was shaped by planning and management decisions throughout a city's history. Therefore, we emphasize that sociopolitical dimensions must be considered when assessing urban landscape permeability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Reconciling cities with nature: Identifying local Blue-Green Infrastructure interventions for regional biodiversity enhancement
PY  - 2022
AB  - Increasing urbanization degrades quantity, quality, and the functionality of spatial cohesion of natural areas essential to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. The uncontrolled pace of building activity and the erosion of blue (i.e., aquatic) and green (i.e., terrestrial) landscape elements threaten existing habitat ranges and movability of wildlife. Local scale measures, such as nature-inspired engineered Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) are emerging mitigation solutions. Originally planned to promote sustainable stormwater management, adaptation to climate change and improved human livability in cities, such instruments offer interesting synergies for biodiversity in support of existing ecological infrastructure. BGI are especially appealing for globally declining amphibians, a rich and diverse vertebrate assemblage sensitive to urbanization. We integrated biological and highly resolved urban-rural land-cover data, ensemble models of habitat suitability, and connectivity models based on circuit theory to improve multi-scale and multi-species protection of core habitats and ecological corridors in the Swiss lowlands. Considering a broad spectrum of amphibian biodiversity, we identified distributions of amphibian biodiversity hotspots and four landscape elements essential to amphibian movability at the regional scale, namely i) forest edges, ii) wet-forest habitats, iii) soils with variable moisture and iv) riparian zones. Our work shows that cities can make a substantial contribution (e.g., up to 15% of urban space in the study area) to wider landscape habitat connectivity. We highlight the importance of planning BGI locally in strategic locations across urban and peri-urban areas to promote the permeability and availability of 'stepping stone' habitats in densely populated landscapes, essential to the maintenance of regional habitat connectivity and thereby enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Healthy urban streams: The ecological continuity study of the Suzhou creek corridor in Shanghai
PY  - 2016
AB  - The urban river corridor is an important ecological space that is known for its landscapes and ecological continuity. Compared with the natural river, the urban river is seriously affected by human activities, which are constructed with the hope of recreating a similar natural environment and are uniquely designed so that ecological specialists, landscape experts and scientists could study both the surrounding environment's ecological effects and the continuity degree of the river corridor area. A system, including 10 indices urban river corridor, is established. This assessment method adapts the Analytic Hierarchy Process, GIS data analysis and GIS space technology, and is combined with these methods based on quantitative and qualitative analyses. Using the results obtained by studying the Suzhou River Corridor and the assessment of ecological continuity is completed and the spatial distribution characteristics are approved, thus it allows future development throughout the corridor. Eventually, a development policy is proposed. Firstly, a method to improve the landscape connectivity among the river's greenways is needed. Secondly, a high value area with ecological continuity related to the river greenway is planned along the river greenway. Thirdly, a sufficient natural area is needed to give the area a river corridor influence, maintain the river's ecological continuity, and keep this natural area undisturbed by zoning. Lastly, the plant species distribution need to link ecological traits and landscape matrix. The study of this assessment method provides a rational development path and decision-making basis for the construction of healthy and sustainable urban river corridors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Habitat connectivity and local conditions shape taxonomic and functional diversity of arthropods on green roofs
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary
Increasing development of urban environments creates high pressure on green spaces with potential negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. There is growing evidence that green roofs – rooftops covered with vegetation – can contribute mitigate the loss of urban green spaces by providing new habitats for numerous arthropod species.
Whether green roofs can contribute to enhance taxonomic and functional diversity and increase connectivity across urbanized areas remains, however, largely unknown. Furthermore, only limited information is available on how environmental conditions shape green roof arthropod communities.
We investigated the community composition of arthropods (Apidae, Curculionidae, Araneae and Carabidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 green sites at ground level in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. We assessed how the site's environmental variables (such as area, height, vegetation, substrate and connectivity among sites) affect species richness and functional diversity using generalized linear models. We used an extension of co-inertia analysis (RLQ) and fourth-corner analysis to highlight the mechanism underlying community assemblages across taxonomic groups on green roof and ground communities.
Species richness was higher at ground-level sites, while no difference in functional diversity was found between green roofs and ground sites. Green roof arthropod diversity increased with higher connectivity and plant species richness, irrespective of substrate depth, height and area of green roofs. The species trait analysis reviewed the mechanisms related to the environmental predictors that shape the species assemblages of the different taxa at ground and roof sites.
Our study shows the important contribution of green roofs in maintaining high functional diversity of arthropod communities across different taxonomic groups, despite their lower species richness compared with ground sites. Species communities on green roofs revealed to be characterized by specific trait assemblages. The study also provides details on the environmental conditions that influence arthropod diversity and gives new perspectives on how the design of green roofs can be improved to increase their ecological value. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of integrating green roofs in planning policies which aim to enhance urban habitat connectivity.

AB  - Since the 1950s, human activities have been driving economic development and land changes, hindering the conservation of biological habitats and landscape connectivity. Constructing ecological networks is an effective means to avoid habitat destruction and fragmentation. Mountain areas are hotspots of biological habitats and biodiversity; however, the pace of urbanization in mountain areas is also accelerating. To protect an ecosystem more effectively, it is necessary to identify ecological corridors and ecological networks. Therefore, based on the Minimal Cumulative Resistance model and taking Chongqing in China as an example, the identification of potential ecological corridors and the construction of an ecological network in Chongqing were realized using the Linkage Mapper software. The results were as follows: (1) From 2005 to 2015, the patch area of cultivated land and grassland in Chongqing decreased by 0.08% and 1.46%, respectively, while that of built-up areas increased by 1.5%. The fragmentation degree of cultivated land was higher, and the internal connectivity of forestry areas was worse. (2) In total, 24 ecological sources were selected, and 87 potential ecological corridors and 35 ecological nodes were generated using the Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis and the Conefor2.6 software. The total length of the ecological network in Chongqing is 2524.34 km, with an average corridor length of 29.02 km. (3) The overall complexity and network efficiency are high, but the spatial distribution of ecological corridors is uneven, especially in the southwest of Chongqing. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Avifauna richness enhanced in large, isolated urban parks
PY  - 2011
AB  - Urbanization causes fragmentation creating \" islands\" of natural habitat. The resulting fragmented landscapes represent a challenge for migratory and resident species because of decreased connectivity among fragments. We examined the effects of urbanization on avifauna communities in remnant and restored parks in the greater St. Louis area (St. Louis), Missouri and Illinois, USA. St. Louis is located along the Mississippi flyway, a significant North American migratory bird route, and ranks second among the most sprawl-threatened large cities. We compiled bird assemblages for 20 parks and used multiple linear regressions and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to analyze seven potential predictors of species richness for breeding, migratory and wintering species: area, habitat diversity, external development within 1 km and 5 km buffers, internal developed areas, road length, and presence of water bodies. The best predictors of resident bird (i.e., breeding and wintering) species richness was park area and external developed area within 5. km, a surrogate for isolation. We suspect that the high species richness in parks in heavily urbanized areas is explained by the parks' relatively large size and the funneling of species to two large parks within the most urbanized areas of St. Louis. For migratory species, the best predictors were habitat diversity and developed area within the park. As development continues to transform natural habitat along important avian migratory flyways, urban planning that includes large, diverse natural areas within urbanized landscapes is key to conserving local and migratory avifauna diversity. © 2011.

TI  - The promising combination of a remote sensing approach and landscape connectivity modelling at a fine scale in urban planning
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban landscapes are rapid changing ecosystems with diverse urban forms that impede the movement of organisms. Therefore, designing and modelling ecological networks to identify biodiversity reservoirs and their corridors are crucial aspects of land management in terms of population persistence and survival. However, the land cover/use maps used for landscape connectivity modelling can lack information in such a highly complex environment. In this context, remote sensing approaches are gaining interest for the development of accurate land cover/use maps. We tested the efficiency of an object-based classification using open-source projects and free images to identify vegetation strata at a very fine scale and evaluated its contribution to landscape connectivity modelling. We compared different spatial and thematic resolutions from existing databases and object-based image analyses in three French cities. Our results suggested that this remote sensing approach produced reliable land cover maps to differentiate artificial areas, tree vegetation and herbaceous vegetation. Land cover maps enhanced with the remote sensing products substantially changed the structural connectivity indices, showing an improvement up to four times the proportion of herbaceous and tree vegetation. In addition, functional connectivity indices evaluated for several forest species were mainly impacted for medium dispersers in quantitative (metrics) and qualitative (corridors) estimations. Thus, the combination of this reproductible remote sensing approach and landscape connectivity modelling at a very fine scale provides new insights into the characterisation of ecological networks for conservation planning. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Impacts of land use/cover changes on biological habitat connectivity: A case study of three species in Gongyi City, Henan Province, China
PY  - 2020
AB  - Land use/cover changes impact species distribution via changing biological habitats. Land use change could reduce the number of larger habitat patches, which makes species survival highly depending on the connectivity of habitat patches. However, in previous studies on land use change and its impacts on ecosystem, species selection was based on individual species, focus species, and \"virtual species\" without exact species name by setting different distance thresholds to represent species with different dispersal capacity. Few studies have been conducted on the impacts of land use type's changes on real-world multi-species. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the impacts of overall and land use changes on real-world multispecies' habitat changes, particularly changes in landscape connectivity. We attempted to answer the following research questions: ( 1 ) how to measure the positive or negative effects of overall and land use changes on landscape connectivity of multispecies with different ecological requirements; (2) how to spatialize the impacts to identify priority of the protected areas? Gongyi City of Henan Province, a typical agricultural area in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, was selected as a case study area. The mammals lived in the region, Sil>erian Weasel (Mus tela sibirica) , Tolai Hare (Lepus tolai) and Yellow-throated Marten (Martes flavigula) , were selected as the target species. Each species disj>ersal capacity was determined as 3 km, 7 km, and 7 km respectively according to their biological and ecological needs. Based on geographic information system technology, the land use changes in the study area from 1990 to 2011 were analyzed and were divided into 121 land use change types. Two connectivity indicators, the probability index of connectivity (PC) and the importance value (percentage of the variation in PC, dPCk) , were calculated. Then, the spatial distribution map of connectivity degree was constructed by using the inverse distance weight function. The results showed that great changes have taken place among 121 land use types from 1990 to 2011. The overall land use changes resulted in the increase of landscape connectivity (representing by the PC) , with an increase of 22.22%, 25.64% and 45.46% to Siberian Weasel, Tolai Hare and Yellow-throated Marten, respectively. There was a difference between the PC calculated from overall and land use types changes. The impact of each land use type change on the PC was different. The increase and decrease of the PC were closely related to the increase and decrease of habitat patches area, respectively. From the spatial distribution map of multi-species landscape connectivity, the key areas of species conservation could he well identified. The study results highlighted the importance of habitat area and habitat connectivity for the biological conservation. This methodology used in this study was useful for conservation planning and landscape management, especially to spatialize the impacts of land use change on multi-species landscape connectivity. © 2020 Science Press.

TI  - Westward Expansion of the Evening Bat (Nycticeius humeralis) in the United States, with Notes on the First Record from New Mexico
PY  - 2017
AB  - The general lack of trees in the Great Plains has limited colonization by eastern woodland mammals in the past, but recent expansion of forests in corridors along prairie waterways and in towns has enabled an assortment of woodland species to expand distributional ranges westward. The evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis) historically occurred in woodlands throughout the eastern United States. Following our capture of the first evening bat in New Mexico, we updated the distributional range for this species by amassing recent records from published literature and museum voucher records west of its historic range published in 1981, the last time the species distribution was updated throughout its range. We document that evening bats, including some reproductively active populations, now occur across much of the central and southern Great Plains, including southwestern Nebraska, western Kansas, and western Texas. Such records should encourage researchers to factor in the possible occurrence of this species beyond published historic western limits for mist-netting and acoustic surveys. While it remains unclear if the single capture in southwestern New Mexico represented a wandering individual, these compiled records suggest that established populations might occur west of our updated distribution for the species.

TI  - Urbanization and artificial light at night reduce the functional connectivity of migratory aerial habitat
PY  - 2022
AB  - Flying animals use aerial habitats to forage, communicate and travel. However, human activities that fragment aerial habitat with built structures, noise, and chemical or light pollution, may limit the ability of wildlife to use airspace efficiently. Applying landscape connectivity theory to aerial habitats could reveal how long-distance migrants respond to sources of aerial habitat fragmentation along their migratory routes. Artificial light at night is a major component of urbanization that fragments dark skies across North America. Attraction of nocturnal migrants to urban light is well documented, but species-specific responses, especially throughout a full migration from breeding to wintering grounds, are not. We tested hypotheses about long-distance migratory movements in relation to artificial light using a highly nocturnal, Nearctic-Neotropical avian migrant (Eastern whip-poor-will Antrostomus vociferus). We applied a resource selection framework at multiple spatial scales to explore whether GPS-tracked birds (n = 10) responded to urbanization in general, or artificial light specifically, during migratory flights. We found little evidence of attraction to artificial light during nocturnal flights. Artificial light and urbanization were highly correlated and difficult to disentangle, but the birds generally avoided urban areas and selected dark-connected skies for travel. Migratory stopovers (locations where GPS-tracked birds (n = 20) paused for at least one night), were located almost exclusively in dark, rural areas. Our results illustrate that considering how nocturnal aerial migrants respond to both aerial and terrestrial habitat elements can improve our understanding of what may facilitate their long-distance movements. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Celebrating stormwater at coffee Creek Center, Chesterton, Indiana
PY  - 2004
AB  - This development highlights environmental restoration as an integral part of a 640-acre \"sustainable\" development. When fully developed, the site will feature 1,200 town homes, 1,000,000 square feet of office/retail space, including a 180-acre corridor of woodlands and prairies along Coffee Creek. JFNew was involved with all environmental issues, including restoration of a trout stream, native prairies, and restoration of a bottomland forest. As a key member of the site planning team, JFNew evaluated the topography, soils and hydrology of the prairies, wetlands, woodlands, determined species appropriate and species best adapted to wastewater and stormwater absorption. Plant selections were based on native species composition of remnant prairies and riparian areas. JFNew prepared a wastewater treatment master plan of subsurface flow wetlands and absorption fields based on site characteristics and estimated wastewater volume from each phase of the development. Treated wastewater will be piped underground to biofields planted with deep-rooted native grasses and flowers. Stormwater is treated by prairies and wetlands through more than a mile of level spreaders, a series of underground pipes and gravel infiltration areas under the restored prairies.

TI  - Who can pass the urban filter? A multi-taxon approach to disentangle pollinator trait-environmental relationships.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Cities are considered important refuges for insect pollinators. This has been shown repeatedly for wild bees, but may also be true for other diverse taxa such as hoverflies. However, our understanding of how urban environmental filters shape pollinator species communities and their traits is still limited. Here, we used wild bee and hoverfly species, communities and their functional traits to illustrate how environmental filters on the landscape and local scale shape urban species pools. The multi-taxon approach revealed that environmental filtering predominantly occurred at the landscape scale as urbanisation and 3D connectivity significantly structured the taxonomic and functional composition of wild bee (sociality, nesting, diet, body size) and hoverfly (larval food type, migratory status) communities. We identified urban winners and losers attributed to taxon-specific responses to urban filters. Our results suggest that insect pollinator conservation needs to take place primarily at the landscape level while considering species traits, especially by increasing habitat connectivity. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Differential response of selected taxa to landscape context and agricultural intensification
PY  - 2004
AB  - Understanding the dynamics of biodiversity in changing agricultural landscapes is a goal for nature conservation and agricultural policies. Agriculture operates at several spatio-temporal levels from field to landscape, and induces differential response of communities according to their ecological traits. Reactions of several taxa to landscape and agricultural changes was conducted along landscape gradients in northern Brittany (France) gathering 14 sites. Landscapes ranged from fine grained areas, with a large proportion of permanent grasslands, wood and hedgerows, to coarse grained ones dominated by crops. Response of communities were either loss of species along the gradient (as for Diptera Chironomidae and Empididae), replacement (Coleoptera Carabidae) and no change in species composition (small mammals). In this paper, we present why these taxa react in such different ways according to their life history traits, their mobility patterns and to which parameters of landscape structure or agriculture intensification they are sensitive. Density of hedgerow networks, and permeability of individual hedgerows determine the spatial distribution of adults Diptera according to their flying ability. Mean body size of carabid beetles significantly decreases along the gradient of agricultural intensification, small species adapted to disturbance replacing large ones that are characteristic of stable habitats. The same small mammal species are found all along the two gradients, but their relative abundance is linked to the importance of crops versus more stable habitats in the landscape. We concluded that species survival in those fine grained agricultural landscapes depends on processes operating at the site scale and defining habitat quality, and processes operating at the landscape and/or metapopulation scale such as landscape modifications in connectivity and habitat availability. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Mapping individual tree species and vitality along urban road corridors with LiDAR and imaging sensors: Point density versus view perspective
PY  - 2018
AB  - To meet a growing demand for accurate high-fidelity vegetation cover mapping in urban areas toward biodiversity conservation and assessing the impact of climate change, this paper proposes a complete approach to species and vitality classification at single tree level by synergistic use of multimodality 3D remote sensing data. So far, airborne laser scanning system (ALS or airborne LiDAR) has shown promising results in tree cover mapping for urban areas. This paper analyzes the potential of mobile laser scanning system/mobile mapping system (MLS/MMS)-based methods for recognition of urban plant species and characterization of growth conditions using ultra-dense LiDAR point clouds and provides an objective comparison with the ALS-based methods. Firstly, to solve the extremely intensive computational burden caused by the classification of ultra-dense MLS data, a new method for the semantic labeling of LiDAR data in the urban road environment is developed based on combining a conditional random field (CRF) for the context-based classification of 3D point clouds with shape priors. These priors encode geometric primitives found in the scene through sample consensus segmentation. Then, single trees are segmented from the labelled tree points using the 3D graph cuts algorithm. Multinomial logistic regression classifiers are used to determine the fine deciduous urban tree species of conversation concern and their growth vitality. Finally, the weight-of-evidence (WofE) based decision fusion method is applied to combine the probability outputs of classification results from the MLS and ALS data. The experiment results obtained in city road corridors demonstrated that point cloud data acquired from the airborne platform achieved even slightly better results in terms of tree detection rate, tree species and vitality classification accuracy, although the tree vitality distribution in the test site is less balanced compared to the species distribution. When combined with MLS data, overall accuracies of 78% and 74% for tree species and vitality classification can be achieved, which has improved by 5.7% and 4.64% respectively compared to the usage of airborne data only. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Connectivity of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations in a highly fragmented urban landscape
PY  - 2019
AB  - Context: Urbanization is a substantial force shaping the genetic and demographic structure of natural populations. Urban development and major highways can limit animal movements, and thus gene flow, even in highly mobile species. Characterizing varying species responses to human activity and fragmentation is important for maintaining genetic continuity in wild animals and for preserving biodiversity. As one of the only common and wide-ranging large wild herbivores in much of urban North America, deer play an important ecological role in urban ecosystems, yet the genetic impacts of development on deer are not well known. Objectives: We assessed genetic connectivity for mule deer to understand their genetic response to habitat fragmentation, due to development and highway barriers, in an increasingly urbanized landscape. Methods: Using non-invasive sampling across a broad region of southern California, we investigated genetic structure among several natural areas that were separated by major highways and applied least-cost path modelling to determine if landscape context and highway attributes influence genetic distance for mule deer. Results: We observed significant yet variable differentiation between subregions. We show that genetic structure corresponds with highway boundaries in certain habitat patches, and that particular landscape configurations more greatly limit gene flow between patches. Conclusions: As a large and highly mobile species generally considered to be well adapted to human activity, mule deer nonetheless showed genetic impacts of intensive urbanization. Because of this potential vulnerability, mule deer and other ungulates may require further consideration for effective habitat management and maintenance of landscape connectivity in human-dominated landscapes. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.

TI  - Comparison of native brushland, replanted, and unaided secondary succession plant communities in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas
PY  - 2003
AB  - Agriculture and urban development have destroyed 95% of native brushland habitat in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of south Texas. Therefore, habitat restoration is an important issue in the LRGV. Since 1982, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been replanting areas in the LRGV to native brushland species to establish a wildlife corridor along the lower reach of the Rio Grande. Vegetation composition of a mature brushland, a replanted habitat and an unaided secondary succession site (fallow field) were examined at one locale in the LRGV in 1999. The mature brushland edge plot had the highest species richness (43) followed by the replanted edge plot (37), mature brushland interior (35), replanted interior plot (33) and fallow field interior (12) and edge (11) plots. Edge and interior plots in the same habitat were similar in species composition (mature brushland, 74%; replanted, 63%; fallow field, 70%). Community similarity was greater for mature brushland and replanted habitats (47%) than the mature brushland and fallow field (32%), or the replanted and fallow field habitats (28%). These data suggest that current replanting techniques used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the LRGV achieve a more diverse plant community in a shorter length of time than unaided secondary succession of fallow fields.

TI  - Alien parakeets as a potential threat to the common noctule Nyctalus noctula
PY  - 2022
AB  - The ring-necked parakeet Psittacula krameri (Aves: Psittaciformes) is a widely distributed species of Asian and African origin, which occurs with over 40 alien populations in the rest of the world. Most established populations of this species are showing a clear trend of territorial expansion and numerical growth. Recent reviews highlighted that one of the main impacts by alien ring-necked parakeets is the competition with threatened bat species using trunk cavities as roosts. In Italy, the only known reproductive population of Nyctalus bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) occurs in an urban area in the central part of the country, surrounded by increasing and expanding populations of ring-necked parakeets. In this work, we updated the population status of both ring-necked and Alexandrine parakeets and breeding noctule bats in the region. Then, we ran a species distribution model using Maxent software to analyze the environmental suitability of the region for the ring-necked parakeet and a connectivity model using Circuitscape software to predict the possibility of its expansion in the area occupied by breeding noctule bats. We recorded a high number of individual parakeets and breeding colonies, together with a remarkable noctule population decline, from about 400 to about 120 individuals, in the last 20 years, possibly due to urban green management practices. Although some ring-necked parakeets have already been observed in the study area, there is no evidence of reproduction in the surroundings of the noctule colony. However, our model showed a high environmental suitability for the ring-necked parakeet in the area occupied by breeding noctules. As well, the connectivity model showed the potential for a direct flow of individuals from the main urban centers to the area used by noctule bats. The arrival of alien parakeets to the area occupied by the bat breeding colony should be tightly monitored by surveying the suitable areas for this bird, as well as the identified ecological corridors. Early detection of new invasions, together with a sustainable urban green management practice, may prevent the extinction of the southernmost breeding colony of the common noctule. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Integrating Gap Analysis and Corridor Design with Less Used Species Distribution Models to Improve Conservation Network for Two Rare Mammal Species (Gazella bennettii and Vulpes cana) in Central Iran
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract: The dramatic rise of human population growth and urban development, especially in developing countries, has led to a decline in the quality, fragmentation and isolation of habitats which support rare or endangered fauna species. New areas designed to protect such species and form corridors and networks to support populations are needed. Two rare species of Chinkara and Blanford’s fox habitats in Isfahan Province are used to evaluate the optimal method to determine suitable habitat. Eight statistical methods, including four widely-used methods (SVM, Random Forest, GBM and MARS) and five new methods (XGBtree, XGBLinear, Treebag and SVMRadial) are evaluated in this study; to do so two Modis products and 19 worldclim parameters are applied. In addition, the ensemble of these methods was applied using gap analysis and areas with potential for protection were prioritized. Finally, minimum cost analysis was utilized to identify possible corridors between new areas and current protected areas. Results demonstrate that the eastern parts of Isfahan province have the highest potential for these two species, and because of the diverse habitats demands for these two species, the regions are able to support a large number of fauna and flora species. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

TI  - Mapping invasion potential of the pest from central asia, trypophloeus klimeschi (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), in the shelter forests of northwest china
PY  - 2021
AB  - Temperature and precipitation are the two main factors constraining the current distribution of Trypophloeus klimeschi. Currently, T. klimeschi is mainly distributed in South Xinjiang, where it occurs between the southern edge of the Tianshan Mountains and northern edge of the Tarim Basin. In addition, Dunhuang in northern Gansu also provide suitable habitats for this bark beetle. Two other potential areas for this species are in or near the cities of Alaer and Korla. Under future climate scenarios, its total suitable area is projected to increase markedly over time. Among the climate scenarios, the distribution expanded the most under the maximum greenhouse gas emission scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5). Jiuquan in Gansu is projected to become a suitable area in the 2030s. Subsequently, T. klimeschi is expected to enter western Inner Mongolia along the Hexi Corridor in the 2050s. In southeastern Xinjiang, however, the suitable area in northern Ruoqiang and most areas of Korla may decrease. By the 2050s, it is large enough to pose sub-stantial challenges for forest managers across northern China. Our findings provide information that can be used to monitor T. klimeschi populations, host health, and the impact of climate change, shedding light on the effectiveness of management responses. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Could Purposefully Engineered Native Grassland Gardens Enhance Urban Insect Biodiversity?
PY  - 2022
AB  - Progress is required in response to how cities can support greater biodiversity. This calls for more research on how landscape designers can actively shape urban ecologies to deliver context-specific empirical bases for green space intervention decisions. Design experiments offer opportunities for implemented projects within real-world settings to serve as learning sites. This paper explores preliminary ecological outcomes from a multidisciplinary team on whether purposefully engineered native grassland gardens provide more habitat functions for insects than mainstream gardens in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Six different sites were sampled: two recently installed native grassland garden interventions (young native), two contemporary non-native control gardens (young non-native) on the same premises and of the same ages as the interventions, one remnant of a more pristine native grassland reference area (old native), and one long-established, non-native reference garden (old non-native). Plant and insect diversity were sampled over one year. The short-term findings suggest that higher plant beta diversity (species turnover indicating heterogeneity in a site) supports greater insect richness and evenness in richness. Garden size, age, and connectivity were not clear factors mediating urban habitat enhancement. Based on the preliminary results, the researchers recommend high native grassland species composition and diversity, avoiding individual species dominance, but increasing beta diversity and functional types when selecting garden plants for urban insect biodiversity conservation in grassland biomes. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - People Prefer Greener Corridors: Evidence from Linking the Patterns of Tree and Shrub Diversity and Users’ Preferences in Lisbon’s Green Corridors
PY  - 2021
AB  - Despite its importance as a component of urban green spaces, as far as we are aware no study has focused on plant diversity in urban green corridors (GCs). Therefore, this study aimed at: (i) characterizing tree and shrub communities in Lisbon’s GCs and (ii) assessing whether GCs’ users value trees and shrubs. We counted Lisbon’s GCs users in the same places where we assessed the tree and shrub community. Along the nine GCs, we observed trees and shrubs belonging to 70 species, distributed across 35 families with most (≥50%) species and plants being trees, exotic, pollinated by insects, with fruit dispersion by animals, evergreen leaves, and producing dry fruits. Most GCs had a similar number of users (20–30 users h−1 survey−1) except for those of Central and Ribeirinho, which were more frequented (60 and 100 users h−1 survey−1, respectively). Most users (≥50%) were adults, walking accompanied, and performing leisure activities. Finally, the number of users was shown to be influenced by: (i) tree and shrub relative abundance, confirming that users preferred greener corridors; and (ii) function(s), showing that users preferred the most multifunctional GCs (i.e., GCs fulfilling ecological, cultural, and recreational functions). Our data suggest that Lisbon’s GCs favor more the inclusion of citizens than ecological functionality and resilience.

TI  - The effects of residential greenspace on avian Biodiversity in Beijing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Residential communities are the primary living spaces for people in China. Their associated greenspaces are important elements of the urban ecosystem, providing neighborhood ecosystem services and hosting bird populations of differing community structures compared with other urban green areas. This study analyzes avian community characteristics within residential communities and their differences compared with urban parks in Beijing. Furthermore, we assess the key environmental factors determining species composition and population sizes and the spatial scales at which these factors are most significant. We randomly selected 27 residential communities to assess the habitat structure and landscape characteristics that underpin residential avian assemblages across multiple spatial scales. Independent sample t-test and model selection methods based on AICc were used for data analysis. Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) (hereafter ETS) alone accounted for 91.0% of total individuals. Compared with urban parks, more migrants and omnivores were found in residential communities. Within-site forest patch connectivity simultaneously decided resident species diversity and individual abundance, with the exception of ETS. Tree species richness and coverage are key predictors for resident species richness and ETS numbers, respectively. Even in the most urbanized species, ETS retained ecological attributes found in “wilder” settings. Residential communities skewed toward avian communities with dominant numbers of ETS. In these low-quality habitats, our results suggest that landscape configuration is more important than local habitat structure. Within-site habitat connectivity and the number of surrounding forest patches with shorter between-patch distances deserve more attention in future landscape design for residential communities.

                <jats:title>Context</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Romania is currently one of the best-connected landscapes, with high-quality habitats and a high density of brown bears. However, regional development measures are needed for the nation’s economic growth, and without responsible government actions, these measures pose a threat to brown bear connectivity, a vital pillar of the entire Carpathian region. Despite having important implications for the species conservation, bears sex-specific behaviour has been overlooked in connectivity assessments.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Objectives</jats:title>
                <jats:p>The study’s main goals were to (i) develop sex-specific distribution and connectivity models, (ii) assess the movement patterns differences between females and males, and (iii) identify high-quality areas to be secured for species connectivity conservation.</jats:p>

                <jats:p>We designed a methodological framework based on interdisciplinary approaches and modelling tools for landscape connectivity combined with novel spatial analysis. Telemetry data of sixteen bears (females and males) were utilized to predict habitat selection (MaxEnt), and circuit-theoretic approaches (Circuitscape) were applied to identify the potential movement corridors of both sexes and high-priority areas.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                <jats:p>The obtained results provided new evidence on the uneven movement patterns and pathways used by males and females in the study region. Males’ movement preferences were related to river shores and dense forest coverage areas, avoiding urban areas, while females were predicted to move across forested and open areas and were more tolerant to human‐modified areas. Three high-quality areas were delineated for both sexes, and connectivity conservation efforts are needed due to the vicinity of anthropic pressures.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
                <jats:p>This study depicts the usefulness of combining interdisciplinary approaches and provides planners, managers, and decision-makers with practical solutions to address sustainable design and management within the intervened landscapes. Using separate female and male spatial models for leading management and conservation measures, setting connectivity targets within environmental and impact assessments while adopting conservation easements could secure a safety network for biodiversity conservation in the Carpathians.</jats:p>

TI  - The concept of nested species assemblages and its utility for understanding effects of habitat fragmentation
PY  - 2001
AB  - The concept of nestedness represents a null model that measures the order in presence-absence matrices of species in different assemblages (Patterson & Atmar 1986, 2000). Based on the assumptions of the model, consequences of fragmentation and the vulnerability of species to habitat change can be quantified. Different species assemblages are considered to be nested perfectly, if subsets of one or more species are lost at a time as communities decline in species number and none of the species lost from the richer communities reappears in one of the species poor communities once it was lost. Nestedness is most prevalent in habitat fragments (islands) derived from a once continuous system with a common species pool that became isolated. The presence-absence matrix of species at given sites can be ordered in a way to maximize regularity. Then, the order of sites and species reflects habitat suitability of the sites and the vulnerability of a given species to fragmentation. This concept of nestedness is illustrated and used 1. to derive estimates of minimum viable populations of lemurs in forest fragments of Madagascar; 2. to learn, at which size a forest fagment is perceived as \"forest\" by Malagasy reptiles; 3. to test whether the system of protected areas within the city of Hamburg represents a network for the local avifauna with species exchange or whether the single protected areas represent islands in the urban matrix; 4. to link life history traits to the vulnerability of species to the urban environment and to develop hypotheses on the causes underlying the evolution of nested patterns. The analysis of the urban system revealed that the protected areas within the city limits of Hamburg are perceived by birds as islands in an urban matrix. \"Green\" links between the areas do not act as corridors that allow free movement of all species. The vulnerability of any given bird species to fragmentation of woodland habitat within the city depends on its ability to use the urban matrix between the protected areas and seems to be related to the investments in egg-shell material. Species with high requirements for egg-shells disappear earlier from the community. Analyses of nested patterns can provide insights in biodiversity processes and valuable recommendations for decision making where longterm data are not available. The main values of the analyses of nested patterns, however, is to develop hypotheses that can then be tested with more detailed studies.

TI  - Callosobruchus phaseoli (gyllenhal, 1833) (coleoptera, chrysomelidae, bruchinae): A new invasive species in Kazakhstan
PY  - 2020
AB  - An invasive seed-beetle species cowpea weevil Callosobruchus phaseoli (Gyllenhal, 1833), was found in the south-eastern Kazakhstan (Almaty city) for the first time. Its areal includes India (species origin), South and Central America, Europe, Middle East (Israel), North Africa, Arabian Peninsula, Far East, China, Japan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Burma, Philippines, Hawaiian Islands, Australia, and Oceania. Damaged plants are adzuki bean Vigna angularis (Willd.) Ohwi & H. Ohashi (1969), mung bean Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek, broad bean Vicia faba Linnaeus, 1753, pea Pisum sativum Linnaeus, 1753, pigeon pea Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth, 1893, hyacinth bean Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet, 1826, Wisteria sp., lima bean Phaseolus lunatus Linnaeus, 1753, common bean Phaseolus vulgaris Linnaeus, 1753 and other species of beans, chickpea Cicer arietinum Linnaeus, 1753, Sesbania sp., rattlepod Crotalaria spectabilis Roth., lupine Lupinus sp. Emerged beetles immediately mate and begin to lay eggs on the same day. Beetle damage both in field and in storage. We were not able to find the species during the monitoring of agriculture lands and natural landscapes near the city. We assumed that the invasion occurred recently and the species did not have time to spread outside Almaty. Since C. phaseoli was discovered in Almaty, which is a transit crossroad for many trade routes, further species distribution should be predicted. The most probable corridor for further invasion of cowpea weevil in Kazakhstan is the south and southeast parts of the country, namely Almaty, Zhambyl, Turkestan, and Kyzylorda oblast's. © The Author(s), 2020.

TI  - Rope bridges provide safe connectivity for the southern brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba clamitans Cabrera, 1940) in an urban Atlantic Forest remnant
PY  - 2022
AB  - A southern brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba clamitans) population occurs in a remnant of Atlantic Forest located inside an urban area of the municipality of São Paulo, Brazil. This population has been heavily anthropogenically impacted by collisions with vehicles, electrocutions on power lines, and falls onto roads. With the aim of reducing these impacts on howler monkeys, we installed four rope bridges in the forest canopy in Fontes do Ipiranga State Park (PEFI). We used mortality data collected within the PEFI to identify areas with high incident rates to place the bridges. The bridges were monitored continuously (24 hours per day) with camera traps for the 12 months following bridge installation (with one exception). The goal of this study was to evaluate the functionality of the bridges in road impact mitigation for the howler monkeys in the PEFI and for other arboreal species. We recorded use of three of the four rope bridges by five of the six arboreal mammal species known to occur in the PEFI with the following frequency: southern brown howler monkey 60.5% of events, 70.8 events/month; orange-spined hairy dwarf porcupine Coendou spinosus, 26.1% of events, 31 events/month; black-eared opossum Didelphis aurita, 7.2% of events, 7.3 events/month, bare-Tailed woolly opossum Caluromys philander, 3.4% of events, 4.3 events/month and marmoset Callithrix sp., 2.7% of events, 3.38 events/month. The time to first use of the bridges by howler monkeys in the two bridges for which there were data was 2 and 77 days, while other species took longer to habituate (113344 days). Adult howler monkeys used all parts of the bridges to cross while younger howlers and the smaller species used mostly the longitudinal side lines. Given our findings of rope bridge use by five species in the PEFI, we recommend the installation of rope bridges of this design in other areas with similar species composition. © 2022 Copyright 2022 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

TI  - An endangered reed, Arundo donaciformis, in a dynamic urban environment: The need for interdisciplinary conservation proposals
PY  - 2015
AB  - The expansion of urban environments is a major cause of species decline. Regulatory protection of rare species leads however to major conflicts between urban development and species protection. Here, we develop an interdisciplinary study to address three main issues concerning a legally protected endemic reed, Arundo donaciformis (Poaceae), threatened by urban development of the town of Fréjus (Mediterranean France). First, we found an absence of genetic variation across the whole range of the species and that this species has a generalist ecological niche in ruderal habitats. These findings should facilitate its practical conservation. Second, a diachronic study revealed a decline of 50% of species distribution in the last twenty years. However, this species plays a dominant structural role in the urban network of green ways and on the banks of watercourses. It thus provides ecological services associated with riverbank stabilization and natural corridors between peripheral natural areas and urban green spaces. Third, sociological interviews revealed two contrasting perceptions of the species among local actors who view the plant either as a rare endemic species in regression or as a highly resistant, even invasive, weed of urban wastelands. Moreover, this protected species is quasi-absent from urban planning documents and local actors show little comprehension of the need for conservation management, illustrative of another case of the \"knowing-doing\" gap. In the dynamic urban environment of a Mediterranean town, this species requires pragmatic collaboration that complements scientific information with local knowledge and perceptions in order to enhance links among stakeholders and implement sustained conservation action. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Estuarine and coastal fishes from yucatan Peninsula: Diversity and ecology
PY  - 2014
AB  - The karstic nature of the Yucatan Peninsula increases substantially the biodiversity of this tropical region. Freshwater inputs that reach the coast result in heterogeneous and highly hydrologic variable ecosystems, where native fauna and high species richness are observed. An extensive (350 km) and wide temporal research (1985-2012) was realized in the Yucatan coast, with the objective to evaluate and contrast fish diversity and species distribution in Biosphere Reserves (Celestun, Ria Lagartos), Protected Areas (Palmar, Bocas de Dzilam), and the unprotected zone (Progreso, Chelem and Rosada lagoons), where urban activities are developed. A total of 202 fish species were recorded and sites with better health conditions (high species richness and diversity) were indicated (Celestun, Ria Lagartos lagoons). Highest fish density and biomass values were found in Palmar and Rosada Lagoon because of a clear dominance of few species (3 to 5) conforming 50% from total abundance, with some of them categorized as endemic and threatened. Protected and unprotected areas didn't show significant differences among them, so we considered that the Yucatan coast is in good health condition. Biosphere Reserves have an important function to maintain the biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of fishery resources in Yucatan coast. However, the increase of urbanization, fishery and tourist activities need to be regulated. It is concluded that the coastal corridor connecting the ecological reserves, gives away to the biotic flow and maintains the stability and biodiversity of the ecosystems not subject to any kind of protection. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Using LiDAR to assess transitions in riparian vegetation structure along a rural-to-urban land use gradient in western North America
PY  - 2021
AB  - Riparian forests are essential for stream ecological processes in arid and semiarid regions, however, they are often highly altered by the rapid expansion of urban areas. To maintain riparian ecosystems services, it is important to better understand the effects of urbanization on riparian forests. We quantified the three-dimensional (3D) structure and woody species composition of a riparian corridor in Utah, USA, to evaluate patterns of vegetation along stream reaches that flow through distinct hydrologic domains (with gaining and losing reaches) and through a rapid rural-to-urban gradient. By using LiDAR imaging and field observations, we explore the extent to which the riparian vegetation structure follows patterns of topography linked to energy and water subsidies and patterns of human influence along the stream. Whereas natural reaches of Red Butte Creek were characterized by native vegetation and typical riparian species (e.g., Betula occidentalis), urbanized reaches had higher numbers of introduced plants (e.g., Acer platanoides) and more upland species (e.g., Quercus gambelii). Urban reaches were also characterized by exceptionally high trees (>18 m) in older residential neighbourhoods. In the natural area, canopy height was negatively correlated with height above the river (HAR). Additionally, we found higher cover and taller canopies on north-facing aspects. These results show that LiDAR data, in combination with ground observations, can reveal strong influences of hydrology as well as land use in different canopy layers of riparian forests. We suggest that the decision making of individual landowners shapes vegetation beyond natural hydrological patterns, with implications for riparian forest management and restoration. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Pteridophytes as indicators of urban forest integrity
PY  - 2014
AB  - In this study we evaluated whether pteridophytes are reliable indicators of urban forest integrity. We inventoried the total pteridophyte diversity in 82 forest patches of the Hochelaga Archipelago (Montréal area, Québec, Canada), and evaluated their level of integrity using landscape metrics (e.g., area, connectivity, matrix composition) calculated from satellite imagery and land use maps. To obtain information at microhabitat scale, we sampled pteridophyte diversity, as well as biotic and abiotic data, in 225 sample plots within these 82 patches. Relationships of pteridophyte richness to landscape metrics and to microhabitat variables were analyzed with parsimonious regression models. Variation partitioning was used to isolate the effects of each group of variables (forest area, land use, biotic/abiotic and edge effect). To enhance the interpretation of models involving richness, distance-based redundancy analyses of species composition data were performed. Indicator species of low and high levels of urban influence were then identified using the IndVal method. Results showed a strong species-area relationship that was influenced by surrounding land use. Pteridophyte richness decreased with increasing proportions of residential areas, urban heat islands (UHI) and water bodies in a 500 m-buffer zone around patches. Greater richness at the microhabitat scale was associated to greater distance from internal and external edges. Out of 38 species, 19 were significant indicators of low levels of urban influence. We conclude that pteridophytes are positive indicator of forest integrity, since they demonstrate typical plant responses to adverse urban-generated ecological conditions. Green-spored species are of particular interest, since their presence indicates low levels of UHIs. Impact of global climate changes on biodiversity can be predicted by studying UHIs, and we suggest using pteridophytes in this broader context.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quantifying landscape connectivity: A GIS-based approach
PY  - 2010
AB  - Landscape connectivity combines a description of the physical structure of the landscape with special species' response to that structure, which forms the theoretical background of applying landscape connectivity principles in the practices of landscape planning and design. In this study, a residential development project in the southern United States was used to explore the meaning of landscape connectivity and its application in town planning. The vast rural landscape in the southern United States is conspicuously characterized by the hedgerow trees or groves. The patchwork landscape of fields surrounded by high hedgerows is a traditional and familiar feature of the American countryside. Hedgerows are in effect linear strips of trees, groves, or woodlands, which are often critical habitats for wildlife and important for the visual quality of the landscape. Based on geographic information system (GIS) and statistical analysis (FRAGSTAT), this study attempts to quantify the landscape connectivity characterized by hedgerows in south Alabama where substantial areas of authentic hedgerow landscape are being urbanized due to the ever expanding real estate industry and high demand for new residential development. The results of this study shed lights on how to balance the needs of new urban development and biodiversity conservation by maintaining a higher level of landscape connectivity, thus will inform the design intervention.

PY  - 2015
AB  - Green islands of the Moscow natural complex were studied as a habitat for Passeriformes. Their spatial distribution within the complex was analyzed. It was found that the species diversity and the abundance of birds depend on the degree of urbanization of the elements of natural complex, as well as their fragmentation and mosaic structure and the ratio of cultural and natural elements. These parameters are critical for the evaluation of the potential of natural-cultural urban ecosystems while designing and maintaining the ecological network.

TI  - Sustainability and coincidence of riparian vegetation and in-stream macroinvertebrate communities in auckland's water sensitive developments
PY  - 2012
AB  - Water Sensitive Urban Design has much in common with the New Zealand (NZ) practice, Low Impact Urban Design and Development (LIUDD). In New Zealand, both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem protection and re-creation are essential elements of greenfield developments that conform to LIUDD. This paper reports on investigations into stream and terrestrial riparian plant communities within gulley environments in headwater LIUDD sub-catchments in Manukau, Auckland. The monitoring of stream macro-invertebrates and riparian plant communities reveals the degree of coincidence of the health of these complimentary habitats. Additionally, the sustainability of planted riparian communities in adjacent countryside living sub-catchments was investigated. Vegetation was sampled using the NZ Vegetation Survey Recce method. Characteristics recorded included ground cover, top height, canopy-cover and species composition. Statistical methods showed how forest structure and composition changed in relation to three factors: age, by individual site, and by management. Management was assessed from landowner interviews. Results showed expected and adequate growth of planted trees, the need for further control of weeds, and very low rates of natural seedling establishment. This information is used to predict the sustainability of these plant communities and to provide advice to landowners on appropriate interventions including supplementary planting of future forest canopy species.

TI  - Landscape pattern analysis and optimum design of park green space in Nanchang City, China based on GIS
PY  - 2018
AB  - Based on the current map data of park green space in the main urban area of Nanchang, the spatial database of park green space was set up with GIS technique, with the corresponding landscape indices being calculated by FRAGSTATS, the software of landscape pattern. Based on analyzing current landscape pattern of green space in Nanchang, the optimization strategy and scheme were proposed and the optimized landscape pattern was evaluated. The results indicated that the spatial distribution of patches in current park green space was uneven and area discrepancy was large, which is especially true in densely populated areas with less patch number of park green space and obviously low available area for disaster shelter. By substantially increasing the quantity and area of patches, improving the inter-patch connectivity, and increasing landscape fragmentation index appropriately, the \"point-line-plane\" pattern of park green space system in Nanchang would be optimized and the spatial distribution would be more rational, which could effectively enhance its role in biodiversity conservation, disaster prevention, and risk avoidance. The optimized indices of patch diversity, evenness and aggregation would be significantly increased, the dominance index would be reduced, and the landscape diversity would be more abundant. © 2018, Science Press.

TI  - Spatial patterns and scales of collembola taxonomic and functional diversity in urban parks
PY  - 2021
AB  - Anthropogenic pressures can affect the distribution of species and elicit the appearance of spatial patterns that provide insights into the species’ responses to environmental filtering, mediated by their functional traits. Due to the functional redundancy in ecological communities, the spatial variations of species and functional traits can occur at different scales, but little is known on this topic, especially for soil arthropods with limited dispersion capabilities and highly dependent on environmental characteristics. The present research aims at shedding light on the spatial ecology of both the taxonomic and functional biodiversity of collembolan communities colonizing urban parks, adopted as model taxa for their functional traits, diversity and sensitivity to environmental drivers. To this end, the spatial patterns and scales of collembolan communities from 8 parks in Naples (Italy) and 14 in Montpellier (France) were investigated through an approach based on Moran eigenvector maps, modified to allow for evaluating the community spatial connectivity and the scales underpinning the spatial variation of each species and functional trait. The obtained findings demonstrate a limited spatial connectivity of collembolan communities in terms of both taxonomic and functional diversity, with mostly species-specific micro-scale variations that may be shaped by environmental constraints.

TI  - Urban Avian Conservation Planning Using Species Functional Traits and Habitat Suitability Mapping
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanization adversely impacts biodiversity by reducing the quantity and quality of natural habitat areas. Additionally, the quality of natural habitat depends on its bio-physical characteristics (e.g., natural cover, impervious surfaces, urban tree canopy) as well as the functional traits of species inhabiting them (e.g., breeding/foraging habitat requirements). To better plan conservation of regional biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is therefore critical to assess the relationship between the landscape and the response of key Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) of species. To identify different FTGs of 116 avian species in the urbanized landscape of the Toronto region (Canada), we conducted a Functional Trait Analysis (FTA) using RLQ-fourth corner analysis. We focused on four species traits (diet, foraging, nesting, and territoriality) to identify the FTGs and their association with natural cover and landscape characteristics (landcover types, patch quality, habitat connectivity). Then, to predict FTG presence in relation to the landscape characteristics, we performed a Habitat Suitability Analysis (HSA). From this analysis, we found 21 avian FTGs with different habitat suitability values that correspond to forested patches and wetlands. The HSA for tree canopy, forest insectivore, and ground-nesting birds (or FTGs) have higher suitability values within forest patches, while aerial insectivores have higher suitability values in older residential neighborhoods indicating the value of the urban tree canopy. This methodological approach shows that by mapping habitat suitability by FTG one can identify strategic conservation areas that target multiple species, shifting efforts from a single species to a community-based functional focus. Our study highlights the conservation value of remnant and/or restored habitat patches in near urban and urban landscapes that help to maximize the persistence of regional avian biodiversity. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Seasonal patterns of the insect community structure in urban rain pools of temperate Argentina
PY  - 2009
AB  - Temporary aquatic environments are widespread in the world, and although there are considerable regional differences in their type and method of formation they have many physical, chemical and biological properties in common. With the aim to increase knowledge of urban temporary pool fauna, the objectives of this work were to assess the seasonal patterns of species composition, richness, and diversity of the aquatic insect community inhabiting rain pools in urban temperate Argentina, and to identify the environmental variables associated to these patterns. Four temporary pools of an urban green space in Buenos Aires City were studied throughout a 1-year period. Eleven flood cycles with very varied hydroperiods and dry periods, mainly associated with rainfall, were identified. Insect species richness in these temporary urban pools, 86 taxa were documented, was found to be within the range reported for wild temporary water bodies of other regions of the world. The present results provide evidence for the existence of a clear link between habitat and community variability. Hydroperiod and seasonality were the main environmental factors involved in structuring the insect communities of the studied water bodies. Urban pools in green spaces have the potential to act to its dwellers like corridors through the urban matrix. Taking into account these characteristics and their accessibility, urban temporary pools can be considered as promising habitats for the study of ecological processes involving the insect community.

TI  - Are climates in canada and the united states suitable for the european spruce bark beetle, ips typographus, and its fungal associate, endoconidiophora polonica?
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>Invasions of exotic forest insects and pathogens can devastate evolutionarily naïve habitats and could cause irreversible changes to urban and natural ecosystems. Given the ever-increasing volume of trade in wood and plant stock worldwide, establishment of non-native pests under climate change is one of the most important forest health concerns currently. The European spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, is a damaging, phloem-feeding insect of Norway spruce, Picea abies, in Eurasia. Endoconidiophora polonica is the most virulent ophiostomatoid fungal associate of I. typographus. Spruce species native to North America are susceptible to this insect-pathogen complex. We studied the suitability of ‘current’ (1970–2000) and future climates (2021–2100) in Canada and the United States for these two species via ensemble species distribution models. We also determined overlapping regions favorable to both I. typographus and E. polonica. Our results indicate that, currently, climate is particularly suitable for I. typographus and E. polonica in western Canada and throughout the United States. Northward shifts in climatic suitability are projected to occur in Canada for both species under climate change. By the end of the 21st century, a coast-to-coast corridor of climatic suitability for I. typographus and E. polonica will occur in Canada under high-temperature regimes.</jats:p>

TI  - How urbanization affects multiple dimensions of biodiversity in tropical butterfly assemblages
PY  - 2019
AB  - We evaluated how the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversities of butterflies and their community-weighted traits are affected by urbanization in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For this purpose, a dataset of Nymphalidae species distributed across 15 urban, semiurban, and rural fragments was analyzed. Urbanization was defined by a set of environmental variables. Furthermore, the total area of each fragment was also considered in the analyses but did not influence the results, in which disturbance level and patch connectivity drove the environmental variation across the urban matrix. Species diversity increased towards the more connected fragments, while phylogenetic and functional diversity did not vary in relation to urbanization. A high forewing:hindwing ratio and the frequency of tiger-like wings were positively related to the urban fragments, while a low forewing:hindwing ratio and iridescent wings were related to the semiurban and rural fragments. The suitability of highly interconnected rural habitats for the maintenance of butterfly diversity was corroborated as expected. Nonetheless, our results also showed that semiurban fragments preserved the ecologically relevant traits of butterflies related to forested habitats, expressed in butterfly groups possibly linked with dispersal capability to avoid predation. Careful management of semiurban fragments and urban landscaping, including highly structured and native vegetation outside urban parks, may increase the functional and taxonomic diversities or at least maintain the current levels of functionality in the urban matrix. Thus, it is possible to preserve the biological diversity of native fauna and flora and recover relevant ecosystem services, ensuring the conservation of Neotropical urban centers. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Priority areas for conservation within four freshwater ecoregions in South America: A scale perspective based on freshwater crabs (Anomura, Aeglidae)
PY  - 2018
AB  - Although freshwater ecosystems contain high biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services, they are severely threatened worldwide. Many broad-scale approaches to conserve freshwater environments have been proposed, but as headwaters tend to host higher levels of biodiversity, identifying priority areas for conservation at a local scale is essential. An integrative three-step framework is proposed to recognize such areas, using anomuran crabs of the family Aeglidae as biodiversity indicator taxa, within four freshwater ecoregions in South America. First, the knowledge on the distribution of species occurring within the study area was updated and the species conservation status assessed. Second, species distribution modelling was used to identify areas of high richness and endemism. Third, these areas were compared with the existing protected area network, in addition to land-use and urban information, to indicate priority areas for conservation within four freshwater ecoregions (Laguna dos Patos, Upper Uruguay, Lower Uruguay, Tramandaí and Mampituba) studied at a local scale. Analysis of the distribution of species of the genus Aegla showed that the present protected area network poorly covers freshwater habitats within the study region. Three priority areas for conservation were identified, with high levels of endemism and richness of aeglid species. These areas are mainly located close to current protected areas, and we suggest, therefore, that the enlargement of some protected areas, through the establishment of corridors, would better protect several species with distributions restricted to headwaters, such as macroinvertebrates and fishes, some of which are threatened with extinction. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The Tawawa Woods Natural Landmark: I. Survey of flora and land use history
PY  - 2003
AB  - The Tawawa Woods Natural Landmark, Wilberforce, Xenia Township, Greene County, OH (39° 43′ N, 83° 52′ W), and the associated riparian forest corridor along Massies Creek has nurtured at least five human cultures over the past three millennia: Native Americans (Adena ca. 1000 BC, Hopewell ca. 100 BC, and Shawnee in the 17th to early 19th centuries), European Americans, and African Americans. The purpose of this study was to document the land use patterns of these cultures and their influences on the hydrological and botanical characteristics of Tawawa Woods as a basis for understanding the current dynamics of the woods. Archival accounts from photographs, correspondence, departmental board minutes, surveys, maps, and existing physical structures were used to reconstruct prior land use patterns. Historic tree species diversity was estimated using land surveys from 1799-1856. Current tree species composition of Tawawa Woods was estimated using a combination of plot and point-centered quarter sampling methods. Tree and herbaceous species outside plot sample areas were identified by walk-through surveys and documented with photographs. Historic accounts suggest that the number of springs and flow rates had significantly decreased by the beginning of the 20th century. Release of pollutants into Massies Creek, deposits of refuse into the woods, and continued demand for lumber during the late 19th and early 20th centuries may have altered both water tables and biodiversity. Witness tree data identify 15 different tree species, while current surveys recognize 31 tree species and at least 79 herbaceous and vine/shrub species.

TI  - Drosophilid Assemblages at Different Urbanization Levels in the City of Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil
PY  - 2012
AB  - The present study analyzed the drosophilid assemblages in different levels of urbanization in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Collections were carried out in 2008 in three different environments: a highly urbanized area-\"Jardim Botânico,\" a forested area with intermediary urbanization-\"Parque Gabriel Knijnik,\" and in a relatively well-preserved forested area, although threatened by the urban growth-\"Morro Santana.\" In Jardim Botânico, 36 species belonging to four genera were found, with high abundance of exotic species as Drosophila simulans Sturtevant and Zaprionus indianus (Gupta). In Parque Gabriel Knijnik, 33 species that belonged to four genera were found, with higher abundances of native species belonging to the Drosophila tripunctata species group and Drosophila willistoni species subgroup, and lower abundance of exotic species. As for Morro Santana, 32 species and three genera were found, with higher abundances of native groups, low representativeness of exotic species, and absence of Zaprionus indianus. The analysis of the Jaccard index showed higher similarity in the species composition between samples collected in summer and autumn, and between samples collected in winter and spring. On the other hand, the Morisita index differentiated Jardim Botânico from the other two studied sites. Our results show that Morro Santana is an important area of native biodiversity, reinforcing, therefore, the inclusion of this area in the project for the creation of an ecological corridor as proposed by the Ministry of the Environment of Brazil. © 2012 Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

TI  - Environmental DNA metabarcoding effectively monitors terrestrial species by using urban green spaces
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ecological corridors and urban parks are created to connect habitats that become isolated due to urban development and integrate ecological, social, and cultural functions. Establishing and implementing the ecological function of urban green structures and conservation plans for urban terrestrial species requires prioritizing developing an understanding of the community structure of urban terrestrial species. However, understanding the appearance and distribution of terrestrial species in urban ecosystems is often neglected or lacking; furthermore, the inaccurate detection of species distribution can create biased estimates of species occupancy. Recently, an applied research method for detecting terrestrial species such as mammals and birds has been proposed based on molecular biology such as environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. We installed artificial water tanks (mesocosm) in urban green spaces (Urban forests; UFs, Urban ecological corridors; UECs, Urban parks; UPs), applying eDNA metabarcoding as a tool to detect wild terrestrial species, and camera traps (CTs) and field surveys were performed in parallel to verify the results. We detected 22 urban terrestrial species only by eDNA metabarcoding and identified 43 species in total by performing eDNA metabarcoding, CTs, and field surveys in parallel. In addition, we identified 31 species of UFs, 13 species of UECs, and 28 species of UPs of urban terrestrial species using the three species survey methods in parallel. We confirmed that eDNA metabarcoding is very useful for detecting small species that are difficult to detect with the naked eye and internal species vulnerable to disturbance. However, since some species were only detected by CTs or field surveys due to DNA false-negative errors or the species’ life-history characteristics, it was judged that the species inventory can be effectively collected using several monitoring techniques. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Urban-rural ecological networks for landscape planning
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urban-rural landscape planning research is nowadays focusing on strategies and tools that support practitioners to design local areas where human and natural pressures interfere. A prominent framework is provided by ecological network studies, whose design regards the combination of a set of green areas and patches (nodes) interconnected through environmental corridors (edges). Ecological networks are key for biodiversity protection and enhancement, as they are able to counteract fragmentation, and to create and strengthen relations and exchanges among otherwise isolated elements. Biodiversity evolution, indeed, depends on the quantity and quality of spatial cohesion of natural areas. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework based on network modelling for the study and modelling of ecological networks. We use network properties and centrality measures (degree, clustering coefficient, and betweenness centrality) and take into account the intensity of the dispersal capacity by introducing the corresponding weighted centrality measures. We simulate the dynamics of ecological networks by monitoring the residual dispersal capacity and the number of connected components from three perspectives: random attacks, deterministic attacks according to decreasing betweenness centrality and influence of master plans. We demonstrate that spatial network analysis is useful to monitor the performance of ecological networks and support decision-making, management, and planning.The proposed methodology is applied to the case study of the peri-urban and urban areas of the town of Nuoro (Italy). Patches (nodes) have been selected among the ecosystems with target vegetal species Holm oak and cultivated and wild Olive while the connecting corridors (links) enable for seed dispersal. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Construction of GI Network Based on MSPA and PLUS Model in the Main Urban Area of Zhengzhou: A Case Study
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>With continuous urbanization and the fragmentation of green areas that affect human well-being, the establishment of a green infrastructure (GI) network is important in future urban planning. As a National Central City, Zhengzhou has a large population and is undergoing rapid economic development, resulting in an urgent demand for green space within the city in recent years. We selected the main urban area of Zhengzhou as the study area based on the two phases of Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing image data, for 2016 and 2021, and used the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model to predict the spatial distribution of GI in the future; compared with traditional methods, this method identified green spaces from a future perspective. A GI network—consisting of an open space with vegetation as the main body—was designed for the main urban area of Zhengzhou using the traditional landscape ecological pattern theory, integrating morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, circuit theory, and other methods. Evidently, the area of green space in Zhengzhou City in 2021 was 36 231.6 hm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. GI prediction results indicate that continuous expansion of the main urban area did not result in significant changes in the size of GI in the city. The GI within the urban area was relatively fragmented, forming 15 GI hubs, most of which were densely distributed along the edges of the main urban area. This study proposed the construction of a GI network with a target corridor and target points based on the existing corridor. This included the identification of seven target corridors and 15 target hubs; the total length of the corridor was 77.032 km, with a total of 31 target points. In summary, the GI network pattern of “one protection barrier, two lines, three loops and more points” was proposed. With new urban problems constantly emerging, this research could provide a theoretical reference basis for the planning of GI in the main urban area of the National Central City. The study provides concrete evidence on the optimum pattern for the construction of GI networks in cities with large populations.</jats:p>

TI  - Sensitivity of breeding birds to the \"human footprint\" in western Great Lakes forest landscapes
PY  - 2015
AB  - Breeding birds in forest ecosystems are generally diverse, habitat selective, and easily sampled. Because they must integrate environmental variables over space and time, local populations of forest birds (like other animal and plant taxa) may provide meaningful signals of local forest health or degradation. We evaluated 949 breeding bird surveys in areas ranging from degraded urban/suburban forest remnants to relatively pristine old growth forests in the western Laurentian Great Lakes region of North America. The \"human footprint\" across this landscape was represented by a one-dimensional numeric gradient derived from land cover variables, forest fragmentation metrics, and publicly available data on housing density and transportation corridors. We used an iterative, maximum likelihood approach to quantify species-specific responses to this human disturbance gradient. Many species showed significant directional responses, consistent with known life history attributes. Other species were most commonly detected at intermediate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, yielding unimodal responses. Relationships between the \"human footprint\" and occurrences of 38 bird species were illustrated by general Gaussian functions that represented both unidirectional and unimodal patterns. These biotic response (BR) functions were combined into a bird-based index of ecological condition (IEC) ranging from 0 (maximally degraded) to 10 (minimally degraded). We described a successful application of the IEC method at the Wild Rivers Legacy Forest (WRLF), a >260 km2 conservation landscape in northeastern Wisconsin, USA, managed primarily under a working forest conservation easement established in 2006. In general, areas within the WRLF yielded high IEC values (7.0-9.0), but nearby forest areas not under the conservation easement were characterized by significantly lower IEC values based on breeding bird assemblages. © 2015 Gnass Giese et al.

TI  - An ecosystem report on the Panama Canal: Monitoring the status of the forest communities and the watershed
PY  - 2002
AB  - In 1996, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Republic of Panama's Environmental Authority, with support from the United States Agency for International Development, undertook a comprehensive program to monitor the ecosystem of the Panama Canal watershed. The goals were to establish baseline indicators for the integrity of forest communities and rivers. Based on satellite image classification and ground surveys, the 2790 km2 watershed had 1570 km2 of forest in 1997, 1080 km2 of which was in national parks and nature monuments. Most of the 490 km2 of forest not currently in protected areas lies along the west bank of the Canal, and its management status after the year 2000 turnover of the Canal from the U.S. to Panama remains uncertain. In forest plots designed to monitor forest diversity and change, a total of 963 woody plant species were identified and mapped. We estimate there are a total of 850-1000 woody species in forests of the Canal corridor. Forests of the wetter upper reaches of the watershed are distinct in species composition from the Canal corridor, and have considerably higher diversity and many unknown species. These remote areas are extensively forested, poorly explored, and harbor an estimated 1400-2200 woody species. Vertebrate monitoring programs were also initiated, focusing on species threatened by hunting and forest fragmentation. Large mammals are heavily hunted in most forests of Canal corridor, and there was clear evidence that mammal density is greatly reduced in hunted areas and that this affects seed predation and dispersal. The human population of the watershed was 113 000 in 1990, and grew by nearly 4% per year from 1980 to 1990. Much of this growth was in a small region of the watershed on the outskirts of Panama City, but even rural areas, including villages near and within national parks, grew by 2% per year. There is no sewage treatment in the watershed, and many towns have no trash collection, thus streams near large towns are heavily polluted. Analyses of sediment loads in rivers throughout the watershed did not indicate that erosion has been increasing as a result of deforestation, rather, erosion seems to be driven largely by total rainfall and heavy rainfall events that cause landslides. Still, models suggest that large-scale deforestation would increase landslide frequency, and failure to detect increases in erosion could be due to the gradual deforestation rate and the short time period over which data are available. A study of runoff showed deforestation increased the amount of water from rainfall that passed directly into streams. As a result, dry season flow was reduced in a deforested catchment relative to a forested one. Currently, the Panama Canal watershed has extensive forest areas and streams relatively unaffected by humans. But impacts of hunting and pollution near towns are clear, and the burgeoning population will exacerbate these impacts in the next few decades. Changes in policies regarding forest protection and pollution control are necessary.

TI  - Vegetation composition and structure of woody plant communities along urban interstate corridors in Louisville, KY, U.S.A
PY  - 2011
AB  - Urban forests adjacent to interstate corridors are understudied ecosystems across cities. Despite their small area, these forests may be strategically located to provide large ecosystem services due to their ability to act as a barrier against air pollutants and noise as well as to provide flood control. The woody vegetation composition and structure of forests adjacent to urban interstates is an important determinant of their ability to provide these services. However, these forest communities may be particularly susceptible to the introduction of exotic invasive species via the interstate and the surrounding city that can potentially alter current and future forest composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of native and exotic woody vegetation and tree regeneration in forests along three interstate corridors in Louisville, KY, and to determine potential factors (e. g., traffic density) that are correlated with patterns in the woody vegetation community. We found the most important determinants of vegetation composition along these interstate corridors were the distance from the city center and the presence of an exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Compared with forested plots within 10 km of the city center, plots further from the city center had 81% lower stem density of Amur honeysuckle, 96% higher tree seedling regeneration, and 51% greater woody plant species richness. The primarily native species composition of adult trees in forests alongside urban interstates in Louisville and the regeneration of native tree species provide optimism that these forests can maintain native species while experiencing multiple impacts from the interstate as well as from the surrounding city, emphasizing their important potential for maintaining natural forest functions across the urban landscape. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Developing ecological networks based on mspa and the least-cost path method: A case study in bazhong western new district
PY  - 2015
AB  - Rapid urbanization and economic development in China has resulted in urban sprawl and has also led to a reduction of natural resources and habitat fragmentation in urban areas. Habitat fragmentation and the resultant decrease in habitat connectivity has become a serious challenge for biodiversity conservation. Green spaces are important habitat resources in the city. The development of green space ecological networks can be used to increase the connectivity between fragmented habitat patches, which promotes urban biological diversity conservation. Taking Bazhong western new district, a rapidly urbanizing area in Sichuan, China, as a case study, a novel method is proposed using Guidos, GIS and the gravity model to develop green space ecological networks. First, the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) model in the software Guidos was used to identify the main types and structure of green spaces in the landscape. The “cores”and “bridges”were extracted, which will make the foundation of the green space network. Second, using the software Conefor, the integral index of connectivity (IIC), probability of connectivity (PC) and the percentage of importance (dI) of each individual element were used to evaluate the relative importance of these cores and bridges to landscape connectivity. Accordingly, the top ten core patches acting as ecological sources were identified. The remaining cores and bridges were ranked based on their importance in maintaining ecological network connectivity. Finally, using GIS, potential ecological networks were developed using the least-cost path method, and the important corridors were identified using the Gravity model. A plan to optimize the ecological network in the study area was put forward. This research shows that the structural elements, the cores and bridges of ecological networks can be identified via the MSPA method and that landscape connectivity measurements (IIC, PC and dI) provide good quantitative measures of the relative importance of landscape patches, especially when considering landscape patch spatial distributions. The evaluation of landscape patches can help to identify and extract important protected landscape elements. Least-cost path analysis also provides important reference information for evaluating landscape patch habitat quality, which most previous researches have evaluated by subjective assessments. The research results show that the combination of MSPA with measures of landscape connectivity and least-cost path analysis are a novel and useful method for developing green space ecological networks in urban and other fragmented areas. The results will help to guide the development and management of green spaces for biodiversity conservation. © 2015, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cityscape genetics: structural vs. functional connectivity of an urban lizard population
PY  - 2016
AB  - Functional connectivity is essential for the long-term persistence of populations. However, many studies assess connectivity with a focus on structural connectivity only. Cityscapes, namely urban landscapes, are particularly dynamic and include numerous potential anthropogenic barriers to animal movements, such as roads, traffic or buildings. To assess and compare structural connectivity of habitats and functional connectivity of gene flow of an urban lizard, we here combined species distribution models (SDMs) with an individual-based landscape genetic optimization procedure. The most important environmental factors of the SDMs are structural diversity and substrate type, with high and medium levels of structural diversity as well as open and rocky/gravel substrates contributing most to structural connectivity. By contrast, water cover was the best model of all environmental factors following landscape genetic optimization. The river is thus a major barrier to gene flow, while of the typical anthropogenic factors only buildings showed an effect. Nonetheless, using SDMs as a basis for landscape genetic optimization provided the highest ranked model for functional connectivity. Optimizing SDMs in this way can provide a sound basis for models of gene flow of the cityscape, and elsewhere, while presence-only and presence-absence modelling approaches showed differences in performance. Additionally, interpretation of results based on SDM factor importance can be misleading, dictating more thorough analyses following optimization of SDMs. Such approaches can be adopted for management strategies, for example aiming to connect native common wall lizard populations or disconnect them from non-native introduced populations, which are currently spreading in many cities in Central Europe. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Soil millipede diversity in tropical forest patches and its relation to landscape structure in northeastern Puerto Rico
PY  - 2011
AB  - Uncontrolled urban development is threatening the survival of many terrestrial species worldwide, especially those with limited dispersal capabilities. Soil invertebrates account for a high proportion of the global biodiversity but there are few studies on how soil biodiversity varies with different parameters of landscape structure, especially in fragmented tropical habitats. Millipedes are among the most abundant detritivore invertebrates in the soil-litter macrofauna. We examined the relationships between soil millipede diversity and landscape structure in 12 forest patches of approximately 30 years of age, in northeastern Puerto Rico. Spatial characteristics of the landscape were determined from aerial color photographs and were digitized into a GIS package for analysis. Millipede species diversity and composition in these forest patches showed correlations with their surroundings (e. g. amount of forest in the matrix) and with the presence of vegetation corridors that connected to other forest patches, rather than forest patch attributes such as patch area and shape. Millipede species richness correlated negatively with the degree of isolation of forest patch (within 600 m radius), while species evenness correlated positively to the amount of forest within a 50 m buffer. Millipede species composition was related with the presence of vegetation corridors and the distance to the Luquillo Experimental Forest reserve. These findings show that a low degree of patch isolation, forested buffers, and presence of vegetation corridors need to be considered for the conservation and management of forest patches surrounded by urban developments, especially to protect terrestrial invertebrate species that require forested habitats for their dispersal. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - A sustainable conservation strategy of wildlife in urban ecosystems: Case of Gallinula chloropus in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region
PY  - 2022
AB  - In the context of urbanization, due to lack of the unified planning of land use for representative ecological indicators, the sustainable wildlife existence in urban ecosystems is emerging as a burning issue. A new descriptive method is proposed to establish the sustainable conservation strategy of protected wildlife in the current urbanization scenario. We use the Habitat Quality module in the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model (InVEST-HQ), straightforward construction package of complex ecological niche Ecological Niche Modeling at The MetaLand EcologyLab (ENMTML) and ecological corridors construction model Species Distribution Model toolbox (SDMtoolbox) to distinguish the priority protected areas (PAs) and construct the ecological corridors of Gallinula chloropus (G. chloropus) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China in 2018. The results show that the PAs are fragmented and only occupy 0.05% of total area in BTH region, which indicate an urgent conservation issue in highly urbanization area. For the sustainable conservation strategy of protected G. chloropus, 25 ecological corridors comprised 2790.8 km are required to construct, mainly distributed in Beijing and Tianjin city. Ecological corridors are also distributed close to the border of southeast, southwest and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. In order to optimize the ecological corridors, 9 important ecological corridors comprised 813.4 km are suggested to build firstly, which are mainly distributed in the central and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. Our combined modeling (ENMTML-InVEST-HQ) indicate that based on actual species occurrence data and land uses, it can successfully generate the PAs which should be paid more attention. Furthermore, concrete measures to build ecological corridors which connect PAs in BTH region are proposed. In order to well-targeted organized planning in highly urbanized areas, measures to protect key habitats of wildlife need to be defined and this research provides a reference for sustainable protection and management of wildlife. © 2022

TI  - Comparative landscape genetics of two pond-breeding amphibian species in a highly modified agricultural landscape
PY  - 2010
AB  - Evaluating fine-scale population structure of multiple species in the same landscape increases our ability to identify common patterns as well as discern ecological differences among species' landscape genetic relationships. In the Palouse bioregion of northern Idaho, USA, 99% of the native prairie has been converted to nonirrigated agriculture and exotic grasslands. Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) in this area breed almost entirely in artificial ponds on private land. We used genetic distances (FST and Dc) derived from eight microsatellite loci in 783 samples to evaluate the relationships among sympatric breeding populations (N = 20 and 26) of these species in a 213-km2 landscape. Both species showed a pattern of isolation by distance that was not improved when distance was measured along drainages instead of topographically corrected straight lines (P &lt; 0.01). After testing for autocorrelation among genetic distances, we used an information theoretic approach to model landscape resistance based on slope, soil type, solar insolation, and land cover, and multi-model inference to rank the resistance of landscape surfaces to dispersal (represented by genetic distance). For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient where forest provided the least resistance, while agriculture and shrub/clearcut provided the least resistance for Columbia spotted frogs. Comparative landscape genetics can be a powerful tool for detecting similarities and differences between codistributed species, and resulting models can be used to predict species-specific responses to landscape change. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Identification of environmental drivers in urban greenway communities
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban trails and greenspaces have become ubiquitous features in cities, in part due to their ability to provide ecological benefits to the built-up environment. A major factor in their popularity is their potential to enhance habitat connectivity by bridging the gaps between remnant patches across urbanized areas, however, information on the structure and function of greenways themselves is limited. In this study we examined how greenways serve as distinct habitats in their own right by characterizing the vegetative structure of the Capital Area Greenway (CAG) in Raleigh, NC. We conducted a systematic vegetation survey of woody vegetation along 39 km of trails (354 random plots) in 2016 and identified environmental variables related to site conditions (percent canopy cover, stream proximity, flood zones), management efforts (designated conservation areas), and local anthropogenic activities (percent impervious surface, street proximity). We preformed three types of multivariate analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS), multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP), and indicator species analysis (ISA)) to distinguish potential influences on species distribution and community structure. We observed highly diverse riparian, upland mesic, and xeric forest communities within the CAG. Results from NMS and MRPP suggested that vegetation patterns can be differentiated based on local environmental variables. Sites located in conservation areas and floodplains, for instance, were typically found at further distances from streets and were characterized by greater basal area, canopy cover, and higher non-native species richness. Individual study sites were highly diverse and varied even within similar local environments. Our findings indicate that the CAG serves as established natural habitat for native vegetation, supporting the idea that greenways can be used to enhance environmental quality in cities as ecological corridors. © 2019

TI  - Spatial analysis of Vegetation distributions in urbanized areas on a regional scale
PY  - 2010
AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in not only improving urban environments, but also conserving ecosystems. The spatial distribution of vegetation can be expected to make green corridors for landscape management, wind paths against heat island phenomena, etc. It is required to investigate the spatial distribution of vegetation on a regional scale because there should be green corridors and wind paths in the areas between urban areas and suburbs. We have developed a spatial analysis method of vegetation distributions using remotely sensed data on a regional scale. The method consists of a spatial autocorrelation analysis, an overlay analysis, and a hydrological analysis with the NDVI adopted as the potential of the vegetation abundance. Application of the method leads to the extraction of the lines between the core areas and sparse areas of vegetation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the vegetation distributions in urbanized areas. We applied our method to the urbanization areas and analyzed the features of vegetation distributions regarding spatial continuity through the verification of its applicability. We used a vegetation map digitized from aerial photographs as the reference. The map contained three vegetation types of land cover: grasslands, agricultural fields, and treecovered areas.

TI  - The response of ground and bark foraging insectivorous birds across an urban-forest gradient
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper assesses the response of four common species of forest dependant insectivorous birds to an urban-forest gradient. The presence or absence was recorded for each species in landscapes that varied in landscape and site level attributes. Landscapes were classified into three categories based on their level of urbanisation. Broad comparisons across the landscapes were used to determine species specific response to increasing levels of urbanisation. Site level attributes were modelled to predict the patch occupancy for each species in each of the landscape types. Two broad trends were identified: the superb fairy wren (Malurus cyaneus) and white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) displayed a tolerance to urbanisation and the eastern yellow robin (Eosaltrica australis) and white throated treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaeus) demonstrated a threshold response to urbanisation. The density of roads (-ve) and the extent of tree cover (+ve) in a landscape were highly correlated with the occurrence of urban sensitive species while at the site level the density of roads and density of rivers were the strongest contributors to their presence. The marked differences in the isolation and connectivity of patches where the threshold for urban sensitive species ceases are the likely contributors to their decline and sensitivity to suburban habitats. Conservation and management of urban sensitive species is largely dependant on the way urban development is managed. Of critical importance is careful planning in urban-fringe environments. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pigs in space: An agent-based model of wild boar (Sus scrofa) movement into cities
PY  - 2018
AB  - Last decades saw a dramatic increase in wildlife populations within urban areas. Policymakers seek to minimize human-wildlife conflicts resulting from overabundance of species, such as wild boars (Sus scrofa). To this end, there is a need to understand the drivers governing infiltration of wildlife into cities. In this paper we study the availability and distribution of food resources in urban areas as driver of wild boar movement patterns. Based on the optimal foraging theory, we utilize an agent-based simulation model to investigate the ever-growing infiltration of wild boars into some cities. We apply the model to an artificial city that mimics the landscape of the city of Haifa. Manipulating food availability and relative resistance costs of different land-covers we demonstrate that infiltration of boars depends on population size of wild boars and on the amount and spatial distribution of attractors (e.g., food). Model outputs for likely sets of parameters demonstrate good correspondence to the reports of boar observations within the city of Haifa, Israel, where the porosity of the urban fabric and the connectivity of open space patches provide a trail network that makes food throughout the city accessible at a relatively low search-cost. Our results indicate that land cover and food patterns determine critically boars’ foraging movement and infiltration into the city. The proposed modeling framework provides a tool to investigate wildlife management policies that aim at reducing people-wildlife conflicts in cities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Temporal continuity and adjacent land use exert different effects on richness of grassland specialists and alien plants in semi-natural grassland
PY  - 2022
AB  - Aims: Grassland plant species diversity is affected by local, temporal and landscape environmental factors, but what is the relative importance of those factors? Understanding this is crucial for the effective conservation of grassland vegetation. We analyzed the factors affecting species richness to contribute to native species conservation and alien species management in grassland vegetation. Location: Semi-natural grasslands in Shiroi City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Methods: The species composition in 36 grasslands was surveyed in 2014. Plants were classified as native grassland specialist, other native or alien species. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were developed, with the number of species in each plant type as the response variable and local (habitat area, use of mowing management), landscape (adjacent land use, connectivity to other grassland habitats) and temporal (period for which the grassland has been preserved from development, i.e., temporal continuity) factors as explanatory variables. Other GLM were developed with the presence/absence of each species as a response variable and three factors as explanatory variables. Results: Habitat area, use of mowing management and temporal continuity were most important in explaining the number of grassland specialist species and had significant positive effects on their richness. Species-based analysis identified a significant positive effect of temporal continuity on grassland specialist species. By contrast, habitat area and adjacent land use were most related to alien species richness. The number of alien species was high in grasslands adjacent to farmlands or roads. Conclusions: The relative importance of temporal and spatial factors differs between native grassland specialists and alien species. Mowing is effective for the conservation of grassland specialists’ species diversity, particularly in historically old grasslands. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the invasion of alien species from adjacent residential or agricultural areas. © 2022 International Association for Vegetation Science.

TI  - Responses of spontaneous plant diversity to urbanization in Wenyu River-North canal ecological corridor, Beijing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban habitat fragmentation caused by urbanization has had a negative impact on urban wildlife diversity. As the connected green space in the city, the ecological corridor plays an important role in the biodiversity conservation in the process of urbanization. As an important part of urban plant diversity, spontaneous plants provide resources for the survival of native animals and play a key role in the construction of low-maintenance plant landscape. In this study, we determined the overall composition of spontaneous species in the Wenyu River-North canal ecological corridor in Beijing, explored the changes of species composition and diversity characteristics of spontaneous plants with urbanization gradients, and analyzed the adaptability of different spontaneous species to urbanization. A total of 195 plant species were recorded which belonged to 156 genera and 73 families, and most of them were herbaceous plants. There was no significant difference in alpha-diversity of spontaneous woody plants at different urbanization levels. However, the alpha-diversity of spontaneous herbaceous plants at medium urbanization level was significantly higher than that at other levels (P < 0.05). With the increase of urbanization index, the beta-diversity of woody plants, annual herbs and biennial herbs increased, and the beta-diversity of perennial herbs, invasive plants and exotic plants decreased. The mean niche width with urbanization gradient was ranked as invasive plants > native plants > domestic exotic plants > foreign exotic plants. According to the niche width, the ecological corridor autophytes were divided into high adaptability type, moderate adaptable type and low adaptable type. We screened some native plant species with similar adaptability to the 15 invasive plants according to niche overlap. The results can provide references for constructing stable low-maintenance spontaneous plant communities, that can resist the spread of invasive plants, so as to bring the function of biodiversity conservation of urban river ecological corridors into full play. © 2022 Science Press.

TI  - Importance of riparian forest buffers in conservation of stream biodiversity: Responses to land uses by stream-associated salamanders across two southeastern temperate ecoregions
PY  - 2015
AB  - Stream microhabitats are strongly influenced by adjacent terrestrial land use and other anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, sensitive stream fauna can be highly imperiled. We investigated relative susceptibility of stream-associated salamanders to riparian land use by studying species-specific responses that influence community assembly. The Piedmont and Blue Ridge ecoregions of the southeastern United States have high aquatic biodiversity, centuries of land use, and increasingly extensive urbanization. We surveyed low-order streams in these regions for salamanders across four riparian land uses (forests, agricultural, residential, and urban) and assessed 15 habitat variables at each sampling site. We found that forested streams were more diverse compared to streams affected by riparian land uses. Our study showed two distinct assemblages of salamanders in response to riparian land use: forest-dependent, large-bodied, long-lived species sensitive to riparian land uses (disturbance avoiders) and cosmopolitan, small-bodied, short-lived species that are relatively resistant to impacts of riparian land uses (disturbance tolerants). These assemblages varied in composition between the ecoregions, with Blue Ridge harboring more land-use-intolerant species. Results indicated that multiple habitat features of the riparian zone (canopy cover, canopy height, leaf litter cover), and stream geomorphology (bank complexity, streambed heterogeneity, sedimentation) are dramatically altered by riparian land uses, and influence the assemblage structure of salamanders. Riparian buffers in both ecoregions are largely unprotected (70% in Blue Ridge, 96% in Piedmont) and are possibly threatened with anthropocentric land uses. Results suggested that conservation of stream salamander communities should be strengthened with protection and restoration of riparian forests, connectivity among riparian forests, and soil-conservation practices. © 2015 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.

TI  - How can forest fragments support protected areas connectivity in an urban landscape in Brazil?
PY  - 2022
AB  - Cities continue to grow worldwide, and the highly modified urban landscape becomes an inhospitable environment for many species because the natural vegetation cover is commonly fragmented, and the remnants are often isolated. Protected Areas (PAs) located surrounding or within urban areas may not achieve their goal of protecting local or regional biodiversity. Thus, an urban ecological network is essential to support their PAs. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the PAs connectivity in an urban landscape in Brazil and understanding whether urban forest fragments can support an urban ecological network. Besides spatial models based on functional connectivity and graph theory, we used participatory techniques to design the resistance surface and the least-cost paths (LCPs) for Atlantic Forest birds. The results showed critical paths (LCPs), important areas for restoration programs for improving PAs connectivity, and essential forest fragments for conservation and restoration. Although the landscape has a forest structure with 1873 forest fragments and 516 links through which the LCPs were structured, most forest fragments and LCPs cannot provide the necessary support for the PAs connectivity. The current ecological network is dependent on forest fragments neighboring (outside PAs) and the flux dispersions occurred mainly in the peri-urban areas. Riparian zones and anthropic grasslands also showed importance for the PAs connectivity. We identified only 28 forest fragments spatially connected, presenting several sizes, and located near large forest areas, relevant PAs, and riparian zones. Six of these forest fragments, smaller than ten hectares and strategically located in the urban matrix, were indicated for restoration actions. The current low connectivity among PAs brings the importance of native vegetation restoration in the riparian zone and anthropic grassland and the importance of the periurban areas to promote biodiversity connectivity in the urban landscape. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Seed traits, landscape and environmental parameters as predictors of species occurrence in fragmented urban railway habitats
PY  - 2011
AB  - Urbanization particularly promotes habitat fragmentation, which in turn strongly affects biodiversity patterns. A major driver of species loss in isolated habitat patches is dispersal limitation. The relative importance of dispersal ability of species, spatial habitat configuration and local environmental conditions for predicting species composition is still unclear though. Addressing urban abandoned railway areas as study areas, we analyzed the relative importance of environmental versus landscape predictors (e.g. proportions of sealed, built-up and ruderal areas) using variation partitioning methods. To add the perspective of individual species dispersal ability, we characterized the effect of species traits on explained variation in species occurrence with a regression tree. The difference in explained variation in the occurrence of individual species (ΔCfit) between a CCA with environmental predictors and environmental and landscape predictors together was analyzed. The results revealed that environmental predictors explained a slightly larger amount of variation than landscape predictors. Adding landscape predictors to the analysis with environmental predictors resulted in a sizeable increase in explained variation. The most important predictors in the CCA were photosynthetically active radiation, C/N-ratio in the soil and the proportion of ruderal habitats in the surroundings of the plots. The regression tree model showed higher ΔCfit values for species with a long-term persistent soil seed bank. The lowest ΔCfit values were found for species with a transient seed bank and long seeds. Linking dispersal-related traits to the predictability of species occurrence is a promising approach to reveal the interdependencies between environmental conditions, landscape configuration and species-specific dispersal abilities. Our results suggest that in fragmented urban habitats, a persistent seed bank is advantageous because it allows for stable populations once habitat patches have been colonized.

TI  - Forest specialist species in the urban landscape: Do different levels of urbanization affect the movements of Forest Red-tailed Black Cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso)?
PY  - 2022
AB  - Anthropogenic landscape modification which leads to the displacement of species, is arguably one of the most profound impacts on animal movement globally. In urban landscapes, animal movement is generally impacted by varying levels of increased urbanization. However, this is species dependent and is mostly guided by the surrounding habitat. Fragmentation and habitat patch isolation must be considered at scales appropriate to the study species. Using telemetry, we test these assumptions investigating movement patterns of flocks of Forest Red-tailed Black Cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso; RTBC) between three regions: urban, peri-urban, and forest using GPS and satellite PTT. This species occurs at varying levels of urbanization, however, how this might affect its movements is largely unknown. We did not find evidence that RTBC movement was impaired in the urban region compared with peri-urban or forest regions. It found, however, a significant within-region variation in movement extent among flocks and across regions depending on foraging resource availability and location. Differences in daily movement distance (Av. 4.96-16.41 km) and home range size (6.02-52.57 km2) between urban flocks appeared to be associated with the proximity of green spaces as roosts and foraging sites, with roadside vegetation providing important foraging resources and movement corridors. Key urban habitats were predominantly located in public nature reserves and private properties, with roadside vegetation connecting these sites for RTBC. The findings of this study highlight that conservation management for this and many other threatened species should regard the urban landscape as a critical habitat for urban adapted species. This would include management of its green spaces with connectivity and offsets from roads in mind. Furthermore, future research should focus on identifying additional key habitat sites (resource selection) and species distribution modeling, which will facilitate an active and adaptive approach towards this species' conservation management. © 2022 by the author(s).

TI  - Bird communities across varying landcover types in a Neotropical city
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization poses a serious threat to local biodiversity, yet towns and cities with abundant natural features may harbor important species populations and communities. While the contribution of urban greenspaces to conservation has been demonstrated by numerous studies within temperate regions, few consider the bird communities associated with different landcovers in Neotropical cities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we examined how the avifauna of a wetland city in northern Amazonia varied across six urban landcover types (coastal bluespace; urban bluespace; managed greenspace; unmanaged greenspace; dense urban; and sparse urban). We measured detections, species richness, and a series of ground cover variables that characterized the heterogeneity of each landcover, at 114 locations across the city. We recorded >10% (98) of Guyana's bird species in Georgetown, including taxa of conservation interest. Avian detections, richness, and community composition differed with landcover type. Indicator species analysis identified 29 species from across dietary guilds, which could be driving community composition. Comparing landcovers, species richness was highest in managed greenspaces and lowest in dense urban areas. The canal network had comparable levels of species richness to greenspaces. The waterways are likely to play a key role in enhancing habitat connectivity as they traverse densely urbanized areas. Both species and landcover information should be integrated into urban land-use planning in the rapidly urbanizing Neotropics to maximize the conservation value of cities. This is imperative in the tropics, where anthropogenic pressures on species are growing significantly, and action needs to be taken to prevent biodiversity collapse. © 2019 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

TI  - Constrained by aliens, shifting landscape, or poor water quality? Factors affecting the persistence of amphibians in an urban pond network
PY  - 2020
AB  - Freshwater communities and especially pond-breeding amphibians are extremely vulnerable to land-use change, alien species introductions and the use of pesticides or other toxic chemicals, as reflected in their worldwide decline. Effective conservation and management of ponds requires a better understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors that shape diversity patterns and species distribution, especially in cases of habitat loss The present study aimed to reveal and classify which pond and landscape characteristics are the most important determinants for the occurrence patterns of amphibian species as well as for the overall amphibian species richness in an urban pond network. To achieve this aim, 17 biotic and abiotic variables were measured for 61 ponds and the dataset was analysed by means of a machine-learning approach, suitability indices and co-occurrence modelling The highest probability of Triturus macedonicus occurrence was found at fishless artificial and semi-natural ponds. The persistence of Lissotriton graecus in ponds was predicted by high pond connectivity and the absence of fish reflecting the species dispersive potential. Pelophylax kurtmuelleri showed a higher probability of occurrence with increased pond connectivity and macrophyte cover. Amphibian species richness was higher in fishless ponds with well-oxygenated waters located in sites with a low to intermediate road density network. Ponds categorized as ‘average’ in terms of newt suitability were more frequently inhabited by fish than Triturus macedonicus. Alien fish species showed negative associations with both newt species, while both newt species showed a positive association between them. The results support the view that conserving a greater number of water bodies with increased landscape connectivity and without any fish presence could provide amphibian species with alternative habitat choices, especially in sites with human pressure where pond stability is at stake owing to continuous landscape changes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Urban planting for mitigating adverse urbanization impacts
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization is a worldwide phenomenon which poses both opportunity and problem for urban areas. Potential for development becomes more significant as the population grows, especially in developing countries. Various perspectives see the phenomenon differently. Economists might see that this development is preferable, while environmentalists and medical people see it is more problematic than beneficial. This paper presents research-based documents and literature regarding urban development with its implication on the urban environment and humans' health. It also suggested efforts to mitigate the impact of the inevitable urbanization, i.e., urban planting. Abundant scientific evidence confirms the benefits of urban planting to humans' health and well-being. The virtues of urban vegetation resulted in the rise of concept for urban development that accommodates the existence of greeneries with all its attributes. Among the two most popular are the green networks and ecological network. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modelling the potential geographic distribution of an endangered pollination corridor in Mexico and the United States
PY  - 2017
AB  - Aim
Every spring endangered Mexican long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris nivalis) migrate up to 1200 km from central Mexico to southern United States. Evidence suggests that L. nivalis follows the blooms of paniculate agave plants (genus Agave, subgenus Agave). Paniculate agave inflorescences are adapted to attract bats, and studies have indicated that Leptonycteris spp. played a key role in Agave speciation. We test the hypothesis of the Agave migratory corridor by (1) modelling the distribution of the relevant Agave species; and (2) testing whether bat records are significantly related to Agave species richness as predicted by our models.

Location
Mexico and United States.

Methods
We selected nine paniculate Agave species based on a set of criteria and modelled the current distribution of those species using maxent and the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP), and geographic information systems to analyse the spatial correspondence of Agave richness and presence of L. nivalis.

Results
We combined the Agave presence maps that resulted from the models with higher performance to create a richness map. This map indicated up to five species overlapping. L. nivalis occurrence areas correspond with areas with two, three and four Agave species more often than random expectations at the 0.05 significance level. The opposite is observed for areas with 0 Agave species where L. nivalis correspond less often than random.

Main conclusions
Presence–pseudo-absence and presence–background modelling tools allowed us to map potential Agave presence. These maps could guide conservation actions to ensure the maintenance of this pollination corridor. Areas with higher number of Agave species are distributed along mountain chains and may provide foraging resources for L. nivalis for longer period of time during its migration. We recommend implementing a long-term monitoring programme in those areas to document inflorescence timing in Agave species and the presence of L. nivalis.

TI  - Potential contributions of green spaces at business sites to the ecological network in an urban agglomeration: The case of the Ile-de-France region, France
PY  - 2014
AB  - For several decades, the sprawling of urbanisation has resulted in the loss of natural habitats and in landscape fragmentation and thus represents one of the main causes of the erosion of biodiversity. Green spaces in urban areas help maintain ecological connectivity and provide ecosystem services to citizens. The impact of urban green spaces on the conservation of biodiversity and their contribution to ecological networks in urban areas have been studied. However, little is known about the area occupied by green spaces at business sites (GSBS) or about their organisation within the urban matrix and their possible contribution to the maintenance of functional connectivity at local and regional scales.This study analysed the evolution in the dynamics and locations of business sites over the past 30 years in the Ile-de-France region. Cartographic data allowed us to identify GSBS which spanned 8700. ha and represented 8% of the urban green spaces forming the herbaceous network. Using a graph theoretic modelling approach, we quantified the potential contribution of GSBS to regional connectivity. We demonstrated that GSBS did not add to connectivity in terms of total area but rather through the density of the links that these sites shared with other green spaces or via their strategic position in the network, i.e., their capacity to serve as stepping stones. The contribution of GSBS was greatest in suburban and pericentral sectors, where most business activities have been developed in the past 30 years and land resources remain available for green space development. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A spatially distributed model for the assessment of land use impacts on stream temperature in small urban watersheds
PY  - 2015
AB  - Stream temperatures in urban watersheds are influenced to a high degree by changes in landscape and climate, which can occur at small temporal and spatial scales. Here, we describe a modelling system that integrates the distributed hydrologic soil vegetation model with the semi-Lagrangian stream temperature model RBM. It has the capability to simulate spatially distributed hydrology and water temperature over the entire network at high time and space resolutions, as well as to represent riparian shading effects on stream temperatures. We demonstrate the modelling system through application to the Mercer Creek watershed, a small urban catchment near Bellevue, Washington. The results suggest that the model was able to produce realistic streamflow and water temperature predictions that are consistent with observations. We use the modelling construct to characterize impacts of land use change and near-stream vegetation change on stream temperatures and explore the sensitivity of stream temperature to changes in land use and riparian vegetation. The results suggest that, notwithstanding general warming as a result of climate change over the last century, there have been concurrent increases in low flows as a result of urbanization and deforestation, which more or less offset the effects of a warmer climate on stream temperatures. On the other hand, loss of riparian vegetation plays a more important role in modulating water temperatures, in particular, on annual maximum temperature (around 4°C), which could be mostly reversed by restoring riparian vegetation in a fairly narrow corridor - a finding that has important implications for management of the riparian corridor. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The effect of fragmentation on the threatened plant community Coastal Moonah Woodland in Victoria, Australia
PY  - 2011
AB  - Coastal vegetation is under increasing pressure with the expansion of urban developments, tourism, population and changing climates. This study sought to examine the effects of fragmentation on the threatened plant community, Coastal Moonah Woodland, in southern Victoria, Australia. We examined the effects on community composition of surrounding land use (urban, rural, native vegetation), remnant size and environmental attributes at three spatial scales. At larger scales, geographic and environmental attributes, such as annual rainfall and temperature, were important drivers of community composition. At finer scales, remnant size, disturbance, weed invasion, connectivity, and immediate surrounding land use impacted more on community composition. At these scales, increasing native vegetation cover in the landscape, remnant connectivity and size positively influenced community composition. If coastal development continues at the current rate, all but a few remnants of this community will be surrounded by the urban landscape. Thus, planning for the integration of these remnants in the urban landscape through long-term management plans and community involvement is essential for the survival of these remnants. © 2011 Her Majesty the Queen in Rights of Australia.

TI  - The desert exploiter: An overabundant crow species exhibits a neighborhood diffusion pattern into the southern region of Israel
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding the causes of spread of overabundant species plays a key role in deciphering their invasion mechanisms, while providing managers with targeted management actions to control their spread. The objective of this research was to quantify the spread of Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix) in Israel and to elucidate the causes of its spread. Long-term occurrence data of Hooded Crow sightings were used to analyze the species range expansion rate. This dataset was analyzed with a range of climatic, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land-use variables. Analysis of opportunistic presence-only data, corrected for possible sampling biases, illustrated traveling waves of eastward expansion, from the Mediterranean coast into Israel's central mountain range, and a star-like pattern of spread southward into the northwestern Negev desert. A diffusion equation model revealed an expansion rate of 1.60 km year-1. Land-use analysis revealed an affinity of sighted individuals toward urban and low vegetation land types. Hooded Crow sightings were positively correlated with annual precipitation, with the remaining variation being negatively correlated with precipitation during the wettest quarter. Species distribution modeling suggested that the species has established new populations and is currently expanding its range. The slow rate of dispersal is consistent with a neighborhood diffusion pattern, corresponding to the species life-history traits. Human-managed environments, including low-cover agricultural fields, provide constant available food and nesting trees, allowing the Hooded Crow to thrive all year-round. Precipitation may aid in enhancing Hooded Crow tolerance toward other unfavorable physical conditions. In light of these new findings, management plans ought to recognize centers of Hooded Crow activity as indicators of highly disturbed native wildlife communities. Also, our findings emphasize the need to establish agri-environmental schemes (AES) in such areas, which would raise community resistance to overabundant species. As AES are currently not in place on a national scale, and since their creation has the power to improve landscape connectivity of native species, this last component is especially necessary. LAY SUMMARY: For the past several decades, the Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix) has been spreading throughout Israel, particularly into the Negev desert. This highly adaptable overabundant generalist species has been suspected of depredating native fauna, including IUCN red-listed species. The present study is the first to quantify the spread of this overabundant species in its southern geographical range and to reveal its driving forces. Our analysis illustrated traveling waves of range expansion of Hooded Crows into agricultural-dominated lands in the northwestern Negev of Israel. The rate of this spread within the last two decades was relatively slow, corresponding to a neighborhood diffusion pattern. Hooded Crow individuals were predominantly sighted in low vegetation cover and urban land-use types. Management of Hooded Crows at the expanding range edges located within agricultural and human-altered lands should emphasize agri-environmental schemes, elevating the resistance of the local community to overabundant agricultural and urban species. © American Ornithological Society 2021.

TI  - Waterbird community composition, abundance, and diversity along an urban gradient
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban riparian corridors have the capacity to maintain high levels of bird abundance and biodiversity. How riparian corridors in cities are used by waterbirds has received relatively little focus in urban bird studies. The principal objective of our study was to determine how habitat and landscape elements affect waterbird biodiversity in an arid city. We surveyed 36 transects stratified across a gradient of urbanization and water availability along the Salt River, a riparian corridor that is monitored as part of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research study system located in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Habitat and landscape variables were reduced via Principal Component Analysis to be used in a constrained ordination that identified waterbird community composition patterns, and then used to model the responses of guild abundance and diversity. Habitat and landscape components from the constrained ordination explained 39% of the variation in the waterbird community. Land use components were related to the suite of species at each site, but had a weaker relationship to guild abundance or diversity. Habitat-level components (water physiognomy, shoreline composition, and terrestrial vegetation cover) were more important in predicting both guild abundance and diversity. We found that water physiognomy was the strongest driver shaping waterbird community parameters. The implications of our study are relevant to urban planning in arid cities, offering the opportunity to design and improve wildlife habitat while providing other important public amenities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - An integrated method to analyze forest ecological networks for urban sustainable development: A case study of Wuhan in central China
PY  - 2014
AB  - This research takes Wuhan as a case study with a focus on forest ecological network analysis based on an integrated approach. This approach applies the improved least-cost path model and scenario analysis to identify and compare networks with the cost surface setting, including ecological service value and biodiversity index. We proposed cost-based δ index and patch connection index (PCI) to evaluate the whole network structure and ecological source connection, as these two indexes comprehensively consider spatial structure and species migration cost. This study proves that the improved line kernel density method based on species migration cost is an effective tool to identify conservation priority areas and break points. Based on the proposed method, we identify and evaluate four types of urban forest ecological networks from different cost setting. The forest ecological network is uneven in spatial distribution. Overall ecological network structure has poor connection. We illustrate conservation priority areas and divide these priority areas into three categories of ecological security. © 2014, Polish Journal of Environmental Studies. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Modelling the effect of in-stream and terrestrial barriers on the dispersal of aquatic insect species: A case study from a Central European mountain catchment
PY  - 2015
AB  - Worldwide, lotic ecosystems are heavily impacted by anthropogenic disturbance, leading to a significant decline in freshwater biodiversity. In recent years, increasing efforts have been directed towards the restoration and revitalization of disturbed streams and rivers to reverse this trend. Although it is widely acknowledged that species dispersal is the key to the recolonization of restored streams and rivers and ultimately to their ecological recovery, dispersal often remains unaddressed in restoration ecology. In this study, we present an approach to predict larval (aquatic) and adult (terrestrial) dispersal ranges of three lotic insect species (Hydropsyche dinarica [Trichoptera], Calopteryx virgo [Odonata] and Dinocras cephalotes [Plecoptera]) within one life cycle. The actual species' distributions (presence / absence) were obtained from a total of 1,198 sites evenly distributed within the Ruhr catchment, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The predictions for aquatic and terrestrial dispersal were made for two scenarios: with and without dispersal barriers included in the predictive modelling. In-stream dispersal barriers included weirs, dams, culverts and impounded water bodies, whereas terrestrial barriers were related to the stream corridor (degraded riparian vegetation) and different forms of land use (urban land use, coniferous and deciduous or mixed forest, open land, road infrastructure). We applied a least-cost modelling approach and combined each species' life-cycle-specific dispersal capabilities and the corresponding dispersal barrier's \"friction\" costs in a gridbased GIS model. Among the three model species, H. dinarica was the best disperser and was predicted to be able to reach between 81% (without barriers) and 67% (with barriers) of all river sections in the model catchment within one life cycle. Aerial (terrestrial) dispersal was by far the most important dispersal mechanism. For validation purposes, we conducted a logistic regression analysis to identify sample sites with environmentally suitable habitats. Within these sites that are not considered constrained by habitat limitations, the comparison of actual and predicted absences revealed a better match, if barriers were included in the dispersal models. At the same time the mismatch of actual absences and predicted presences decreased. Our results suggest that dispersal models can contribute to a better assessment of the potential recolonization of rivers. Yet, the dispersal of lotic insects may be considerably overestimated if dispersal barriers remain unaddressed. © 2015 E. Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung.

TI  - Prediction of genetic connectivity in urban ecosystems by combining detailed movement data, genetic data and multi-path modelling
PY  - 2017
AB  - Urban areas are expanding worldwide, yet little is known how anthropogenic landscape fragmentation affects the connectedness and gene flow in urban wildlife. The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is a ground dwelling mammal which also inhabits variable urban habitats. We investigated habitat connectivity and the spatial genetic structure of urban hedgehogs in the largest Swiss city. We addressed the following questions: i) At the city-scale, which prominent landscape elements affect the spatial distribution of genetic clusters? ii) Which landscape elements affect gene flow in an urban mammal within the clusters? iii) Does individual movement data improve the prediction of landscape-wide gene flow? We used two Bayesian methods to examine the influence of water bodies and major traffic routes on genetic hedgehog clusters, using microsatellite data of 147 hedgehogs. Further, we used extensive movement data to parameterise single-path and multi-path connectivity models, which were then used to predict genetic distance between hedgehog individuals. First, we found that both Bayesian methods consistently showed three distinct genetic clusters, separated by the main rivers and the parallel running transportation axes. Second, the best model indicates that gene flow was facilitated by urban green areas and hampered by all other land cover types. Third, multi-path models based on detailed GPS movement data clearly outperformed models based on a priori assumptions to predict gene flow. Multi-path connectivity models based on movement data reveal to be a powerful tool to detect gene flow in highly fragmented habitats and could be a crucial step in implementing effective conservation measures. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Urban integration of green roofs: Current challenges and perspectives
PY  - 2021
AB  - Green roofs (GRs) are a sustainable alternative to conventional roofs that provide multiple ecosystem services. Integrating GRs into urban areas is highly relevant considering the rapidly increasing built-up in cities. Therefore, this paper systematically and comprehensively reviews the recent literature from 2011 to 2019 on GRs to identify the challenges and perspectives related to the urban integration of GRs. The review suggests that the effectiveness of GRs in delivering ecosystem services is largely dependent on context-specific parameters such as weather conditions and existing construction or design-related parameters. Integrating GRs into urban areas can be challenging given the diversity of actors, functions, and conditions characterizing these areas. Although significant research has already been conducted on GRs, research covering more geographical locations and contexts is needed. The review points out the need to include future urbanization scenarios, such as tall buildings while analyzing the impact of GRs on ecological networks. Additionally, the review emphasizes the inclusion of urban morphological parameters alongside an analysis of the impact of GRs on microclimate regulation and air quality. In terms of social acceptance, this review points out the need to consider the temporal cycles of vegetation for noting users’ perspectives. Additionally, further research is required on the social impact of GRs, considering their influence on property prices. Lastly, the review stresses the need for more city-scale studies on the impact of GRs on ecosystem services.

TI  - Influence of landscape pattern changes on the restoration of stream in Dongjiang River riparian buffer
PY  - 2009
AB  - Rivers are increasingly investigated from a landscape perspective. Recognition and understanding of landscape dynamics as a historical legacy of disturbances are necessary for sustainable management of stream ecosystems. This study analyzed temporal changes in land use and cover patterns in a riparian buffer area in Dongjiang River. To analyze the riverine landscape pattern, we created a buffer zone along the stream of the Dongjiang River with width of 10 km. Based on Thematic Mapper remote sensing data of 1998 and 2006, we identified 6 land use and land cover types using supervised classification techniques, a selected group of landscape metrics at the class and landscape level was used to quantify the changing pattern of land use and land cover in the study region. All of the analyses were performed using a geographic information system and the landscape pattern analysis software Fragstats. The quantitative evidences showed that there was a net increase of 8.57% in total water patch areas as an overall change between 1998 and 2006. The fragmentation of the water decreased as indicated by the larger areas and smaller numbers of patches. Analysis of the metrics revealed that water structure in study area had changed better over the past 8 years in terms of spatial configuration. The coverage of forest becomes larger indicated by the increases of woodland areas. The revegetations of the riparian would be helpful to the soil and water conservation. The proportion of agricultural land patch decreased by 35.72%, which would be responsible for the mitigation of water quality deterioration. The fragmentation of riparian decreased in landscape level, and the structural connectivity improved. The changes of woodland, farmland and the connectivity would place positive effects to the restoration of stream. The increasing urbanization indicated by a series of indices' changes such as the increases of PLAND and LSI and so on, which would bring new challenges to water quality. Dramatic changes of the landscapes, which due to the spread of urban land use around the riparian, may hold a negative influence over the restoration of stream. On all accounts, the restoration of Dongjiang River riparian gained effects to some extent, but some aspects should be enhanced. The optimization of vegetation is especially emphasized, and the spatial allocation of vegetation and plant species composition should be improved. The ecological particularity of riparian should be considered in the urban planning. Where water restoration is the goal, integrative measures at the landscape scale are supposed to be adopted. It is suggested that the distributing configuration of landscape pattern was ought to be optimized, and reinforcing the integration of multiple factors, so as to draw appropriate lessons for water ecosystem management.

TI  - Extreme hydrological events and the ecological restoration of flowing waters
PY  - 2015
AB  - Extreme hydrological events (floods, droughts) in flowing waters can alter habitat availability and structure and produce significant shifts in biodiversity, species assemblages and ecosystem processes. Extreme floods and droughts occur over large spatial extents and can greatly alter links between streams and their catchments. The nature and strengths of these links differ between degraded and intact streams and their catchments, strongly influencing the responses to and recovery from extreme events. It is essential that these catchment-stream linkages be identified and considered when planning stream restoration. Despite the scarcity of comprehensive, long-term monitoring of most stream restoration projects, our understanding of the influence of extreme events on running waters suggests both positive and negative impacts on restoration efforts. Extreme hydrological events can impair stream restoration efforts giving rise to delays or complete failures in achieving restoration objectives. Alternatively, extreme floods may facilitate progress towards restoration goals by engendering key ecological processes. Understanding the impacts and the temporal-spatial scales over which extreme events alter the ecological structure and function of streams (in both natural and damaged systems), as well as their underlying mechanisms, is a challenge for stream restorers that will only progress with the accumulation of long-term data. Restorers should recognise and plan for hydrological extreme events and their interactions with other disturbances (e.g. fire, urban development). Increasing connectivity of restoration efforts along with their spatial extent can lessen the negative effects of extreme hydrological events on stream restoration. Successful ecological stream restoration requires long time spans and thus with a changing climate the prediction of more frequent and intense extreme events only strengthens the need to incorporate their likelihood into restoration planning and implementation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Southern marl prairies conceptual ecological model
PY  - 2005
AB  - About 190,000 ha of higher-elevation marl prairies flank either side of Shark River Slough in the southern Everglades. Water levels typically drop below the ground surface each year in this landscape. Consequently, peat soil accretion is inhibited, and substrates consist either of calcitic marl produced by algal periphyton mats or exposed limestone bedrock. The southern marl prairies support complex mosaics of wet prairie, sawgrass sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), tree islands, and tropical hammock communities and a high diversity of plant species. However, relatively short hydroperiods and annual dry downs provide stressful conditions for aquatic fauna, affecting survival in the dry season when surface water is absent. Here, we present a conceptual ecological model developed for this landscape through scientific concensus, use of empirical data, and modeling. The two major societal drivers affecting the southern marl prairies are water management practices and agricultural and urban development. These drivers lead to five groups of ecosystem stressors: loss of spatial extent and connectivity, shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity, extended hydroperiod and drying pattern reversals, introduction and spread of non-native trees, and introduction and spread of non-native fishes. Major ecological attributes include periphyton mats, plant species diversity and community mosaic, Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna prey base, American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), and wading bird early dry season foraging. Water management and development are hypothesized to have a negative effect on the ecological attributes of the southern marl prairies in the following ways. Periphyton mats have decreased in cover in areas where hydroperiod has been significantly reduced and changed in community composition due to inverse responses to increased nutrient availability. Plant species diversity and community mosaics have changed due to shifting gradients to more terrestrial or more aquatic communities, displacement of native communities by non-natives, expansion of woody plants, high-intensity dry season fires, tree-island burnout, and reduced microtopography resulting from alligator population decline. Cape Sable seaside sparrow populations are threatened by nest destruction resulting from extended hydroperiods, drying pattern reversals, and high intensity dry season fires, as well as by the expansion of woody plants into graminoid wetland habitats. Populations of marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna that constitute the aquatic prey base for higher vertebrates have decreased in density and changed in species composition and size structure due to loss of wetland spatial extent, shortened hydroperiod, increased drought severity, loss of aquatic drought refugia in solution holes and alligator holes, and spread of exotic fishes. American alligator populations have declined in the Rocky Glades, and alligator holes have filled with sediment, as a result of shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity. Habitat options for wading birds to forage during the early dry season and during unusually wet years have been reduced due to loss of spatial extent and shortened hydroperiod. © 2005, The Society of Wetland Scientists.

TI  - Landscape spatial patterns in Mexico City and New York City: contrasting territories for biodiversity planning
PY  - 2022
AB  - Context: Large cities contain different sizes and distributions of green spaces in a sea of buildings and roads. This urban landscape establishes habitats for different species that migrant through or persist in cities. Objectives: To describe and analyze how green spaces patterns differ in large cities by using new mapping methods. This tool helps urban planning for land use decisions. Methods: Using Patch Analyst Metrics, we propose a new method to analyze the current spatial arrangement of green spaces in Mexico City and New York City, long-established urban areas, as case studies. Results: The two cities differ in the number, size, and spatial distribution of green spaces. Mexico City has high numbers of large green spaces for native species habitat, but most of them are in a cluster in the south. In New York City, large spaces are distributed scattered throughout the whole territory, but New York City has much small areas than Mexico City. This spatial analysis shows areas for connectivity among existing green spaces that can improve the dispersal of many taxa of plants and animals. However, ecological planning must vary between the cities; no single generalization is appropriate. Conclusions: Much data are available on the potential dispersal of species through cities, but a easily applied framework for understanding the existing habitat distribution is needed for future decisions. The results suggest mapping mechanisms can help to increase plant and animal movement patterns. However, these older cities have idiosyncratic starting points that must be the basis of future improvements. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - The effects of human development, environmental factors, and a major highway on mammalian community composition in the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah, USA
PY  - 2022
AB  - Human development and roads threaten wildlife through distinct mechanisms and understanding the influence of these elements can better inform mitigation and conservation strategies. We used camera traps to quantify the effects of major roads, environmental factors, and human development on the mammalian community composition between sites north and south of a major interstate highway in northern Utah, USA. We found no significant differences in species richness nor community similarity across the north–south divide of the highway. Through Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we compared the effects of the distance to the highway, housing and human population density, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the human footprint index to changes in mammalian community composition and species-specific habitat usage. Community occupancy response, similarity, and species richness were negatively affected by increased housing and human population densities and positively affected by increased NDVI and decreased human footprint, whereas their response to the highway was more inconclusive. We conclude that mammalian community composition in our study area is influenced by both environmental conditions and human development while the effect of the highway was more nuanced, possibly due to the presence of a newly constructed wildlife overpass. Taken together, the lack of differences in species richness or community composition across the highway suggests that it may not currently exacerbate the effects of other anthropogenic sources of habitat fragmentation and highlights the need for additional research into human–wildlife conflict mitigation strategies.

TI  - An environmental forensic procedure to analyse anthropogenic pressures of urban origin on surface water of protected coastal agro-environmental wetlands (L'Albufera de Valencia Natural Park, Spain)
PY  - 2013
AB  - Detection and spatial distribution of 14 drugs of abuse and 17 pharmaceuticals in surface waters was investigated to determine transport hydrological connectivity between urban, agriculture and natural environments. Solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was applied to all samples. To determine spatial incidence of contaminants, analytical results of target compounds were georeferenced and integrated into a geographical information systems structure together with layers of municipal population, location of sewage water treatment plants and irrigation channels and sectors. The methodology was applied to L'Albufera Natural Park in Valencia (Spain). A total of 9 drugs of abuse were detected at 16 points (76% of the sample sites). Cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine, were the most detected substances, being found in 12 and 16 samples, respectively. Maximum concentrations were found in benzoylecgonine (78.71ng/L) and codeine (51.60ng/L). Thirteen pharmaceuticals were found at 16 points. The most detected compounds were carbamazepine (15 samples) and ibuprofen (11 samples). Maximum concentrations were detected in acetaminophen (17,699.4ng/L), ibuprofen (3913.7ng/L) and codeine (434.0ng/L). Spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals showed a clear relationship between irrigation areas, high population densities municipalities (above 1000h/km2) and sewage water treatment plants. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

PY  - 2005
AB  - Habitat modification has been pointed as one of the main causes of population decline and extinction of several species. Studies on communities in disturbed areas are very important for they provide data about the new organization of assemblages, imposed by the intense modification of habitats. An amphibian assemblage (Anura) was studied in an urban area under strong human pressure, 35 km southeast of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais state). Data collection was performed between March/2002 and March/2003, totaling 22 nights of observations. Fourteen species from three families were detected: Bufonidae (1), Leptodactylidae (5) and Hylidae (8). Most species, as well as the largest number of individuals, were recorded during the warm wet months of the year. Habitat use was quite restricted among species, unlike use of substrates. High substrate overlap was observed among hylids, which, besides sharing many types of substrate, occupied the same heights of the vegetation. The largest number of species was recorded on the vegetation at the margins of ponds, considered as the most important substrate for local anurans. Reproductive evidence was recorded for four species. The beginning of the reproductive period of Physalaemus cuvieri and Hyla faber was associated with the beginning of the rainy season, while Bufo crucifer and Scinax longilineus reproduced mostly during the dry months. The variety of habitats occupied and the local species richness, compared to other studies in the region, suggest that the study area, although greatly modified, may be of importance as an ecological corridor. © 2005 Instituto de Ciências Biológicas - UFMG.

TI  - Green space landscape pattern and its optimization in eco-factory
PY  - 2009
AB  - Rational green space landscape pattern and proper plant community composition are essential to the ecological effect of urban green space system, and also, a very important aspect in the planning and design of the system, especially for its construction in eco-factory. Under the supports of remote sensing and GIS, the green space landscape pattern and the plant community composition in twelve functional units in Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. , Ltd. were analyzed, and the results demonstrated that there were three dominant green space landscape types in the Company, i.e. , tree-shrub, tree-shrub-grass, and shrub-grass. In parts of the 12 functional units, higher degrees of landscape fragmentation and of the isolation between green patches were observed, which would apparently affect the ecological functions and ecosystem services of the green space. Aiming at these problems, some suggestions including enlarging green patch area, increasing landscape connectivity widi green corridors, complicating plant community structure, increasing more indigenous species, and enhancing green biomass in three dimensions were put forward to further improve and optimize the green space landscape pattern in the Company.

TI  - Invasive alien plant species, fragmentation and scale effects on urban forest community composition in Durban, South Africa
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Urban forests are under increased pressure from invasion by exotic (alien) species. The vegetation present in the matrix of urban sites is a rich source of alien invasive propagules, which increases the risk of alien invasion in forests within an urban space, leading to a decline in indigenous species. Therefore, determining the distribution patterns of native and exotic species as influenced by environmental factors can assist in quantifying the impact of exotic species at broad scales based on responses on a finer scale. Quantifying the effects of multiple environmental factors on the distribution patterns of both indigenous and alien species in the ecosystem may help in prescribing suitable management efforts. Methods: Fifteen forest patches were sampled in the eThekwini (Durban) Municipality and data collected from 74 100-m2 plots with different degrees of invasion. Indigenous and alien species of trees, shrubs and climbers occurring in ten and more plots were considered for analysis and the CANOCO 5.1 package was used to run various constrained ordination analyses. Variation partitioning analysis was used to assess the impact of environmental variables at different spatial scales, namely the plot and patch scales. Results: Canopy gaps are the major controlling factor for invasive alien plants (IAPs) occurrence at fine scale. At patch level, residential and industry areas outside the boundaries (buffer area) of forest patches have a high influence on the distribution of IAPs. Communities dominated by the invasive Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King are most common on the lowland coastal forests while communities dominated by either Litsea glutinosa (Lour.) C.B.Rob. or Cardiospermum grandiflorum Sw. can prevail in both lowland coastal and scarp forests. Conclusions: Canopy gaps in lowland forests can facilitate the transition of native forests to novel communities containing a variety of alien plant species. Communities of shrub, climber and tree IAPs occur in lowland coastal forests while climber and tree IAPs dominate the high-elevation scarp forests. The resilience shown by some native species to the tree, shrub and climber IAPs by remaining when IAPs establish makes these species very suitable for restoration projects. Forest patches surrounded by a high incidence of residential and industrial areas in the buffer matrix are likely to have a high diversity of IAPs. Larger patch size and high connectivity to nearby native forests are key in reducing invasion by IAPs. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Physical barriers and corridors in urban habitats affect colonisation and parasitism rates of a specialist leaf miner
PY  - 2011
AB  - 1. Urban environments are fragmented habitats characterised by the presence of physical barriers, which may negatively affect dispersal and colonisation by insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Conversely, plants growing along pavements may function as dispersal corridors, helping to moderate the harmful effects of resource patch isolation on organism movement and population persistence. 2. We experimentally tested the effects of walls as physical barriers to the dispersal of the leaf miner Liriomyza commelinae Frost and colonisation of its host plant, Commelina erecta L., in urban habitats. We also evaluated whether plants along pavements could act as corridors for this species. 3. We exposed experimental host plants to the leaf miner in houses with front gardens and back yards, the latter being completely surrounded by walls. The front gardens had walls but none separating them from the pavement. Previously mined plants were also exposed to parasitoids in the yards to determine parasitoid attack. 4. Liriomyza commelinae took longer to colonise back yards with higher walls, and the abundance of mined plants along pavements reduced the colonisation time. Leaf-miner abundance was marginally affected by the yard type, and was lower in back yards. Cumulative parasitism rates decreased with increasing distance at which mined plants were placed from pavements. 5. Constructions act as physical barriers, having a negative impact on colonisation of host plants by leaf miners. The function of pavements as corridors seems to depend on the abundance of mined plants. Parasitism may be affected by distance from the corridor rather than physical barriers or other potential hosts. © 2011 The Authors. Ecological Entomology © 2011 The Royal Entomological Society.

TI  - Land cover and rainfall interact to shape waterbird community composition
PY  - 2012
AB  - Human land cover can degrade estuaries directly through habitat loss and fragmentation or indirectly through nutrient inputs that reduce water quality. Strong precipitation events are occurring more frequently, causing greater hydrological connectivity between watersheds and estuaries. Nutrient enrichment and dissolved oxygen depletion that occur following these events are known to limit populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and commercially harvested species, but the consequences for top consumers such as birds remain largely unknown. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand how land cover and annual variation in rainfall interact to shape waterbird community composition in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The MDS ordination indicated that urban subestuaries shifted from a mixed generalist-specialist community in 2002, a year of severe drought, to generalist-dominated community in 2003, of year of high rainfall. The SEM revealed that this change was concurrent with a sixfold increase in nitrate-N concentration in subestuaries. In the drought year of 2002, waterbird community composition depended only on the direct effect of urban development in watersheds. In the wet year of 2003, community composition depended both on this direct effect and on indirect effects associated with high nitrate-N inputs to northern parts of the Bay, particularly in urban subestuaries. Our findings suggest that increased runoff during periods of high rainfall can depress water quality enough to alter the composition of estuarine waterbird communities, and that this effect is compounded in subestuaries dominated by urban development. Estuarine restoration programs often chart progress by monitoring stressors and indicators, but rarely assess multivariate relationships among them. Estuarine management planning could be improved by tracking the structure of relationships among land cover, water quality, and waterbirds. Unraveling these complex relationships may help managers identify and mitigate ecological thresholds that occur with increasing human land cover.

TI  - Characterisation of bird and bat communities in the urban parks of Aix-en-Provence
PY  - 2021
AB  - In ever larger and denser cities, spaces with a nature character provide ecosystem services, enable biodiversity conservation and are meeting places for humans and non-humans. It is therefore key for decision-makers, city designers and city managers to be able to rapidly characterise the biodiversity housed in these spaces in order to reconcile the population’s expectations and environmental issues in development projects and management methods. Here, we aim to identify the factors determining the species assemblages observed in the 10 parks of the city of Aix-en-Provence (characteristics of the parks, management methods, types of urban context), and this for two taxa with different ecological requirements: avifauna and chirofauna. We contacted 39 species of birds. Bird communities become more homogenous from the periphery to the city centre, and the richest communities are found in the larger parks, with a greater diversity of habitats and surrounded by more greenery. We also recorded more than 53,000 passings of bats, indicating a rather high level of activity for urban Mediterranean parks. There is a very strong heterogeneity of activity between parks, which is not explained by the characteristics of the parks. The park with the highest activity rate is a medium-sized park embedded in the dense city. Our results confirm that the question of biodiversity in the city must be asked by considering several spatial scales and several taxa. The habitat potential and vegetation cover in and around the park is a critical dimension for the planning and management of the city. © 2021, Ecologia Mediterranea. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - A viable population of the European red squirrel in an urban park
PY  - 2014
AB  - Whether urban parks can maintain viable and self-sustaining populations over the long term is questionable. In highly urbanized landscapes, urban parks could play a role in biodiversity conservation by providing habitat and resources to native species. However, populations inhabiting urban parks are usually small and isolated, leading to increased demographic stochasticity and genetic drift, with expected negative consequences on their viability. Here, we investigated a European red squirrel population located in an urban park close to Paris, France (Parc de Sceaux; 184 ha) to assess its viability. Using mitochondrial D-loop sequences and 13 microsatellite loci, we showed that the population presented high levels of genetic variation and no evidence of inbreeding. The size of the population was estimated at 100-120 individuals based on the comparison of two census techniques, Distance Sampling and Capture-Mark-Recapture. The estimated heterozygosity level and population size were integrated in a Population Viability Analysis to project the likelihood of the population's persistence over time. Results indicate that the red squirrel population of this urban park can be viable on the long term (i.e. 20 years) for a range of realistic demographic parameters (juvenile survival at least >40%) and immigration rates (at least one immigration event every two years). This study highlights that urban parks can be potential suitable refuges for the red squirrel, a locally threatened species across western European countries, provided that ecological corridors are maintained. © 2014 Rézouki et al.

TI  - Integrated management of water and ecology in the urban area of Laoshan district, Qingdao, China
PY  - 2006
AB  - Wastewater and storm water management are incorporated into ecological design by open water channel, storage pond, and constructed wetlands to form green waterways or ecological corridors, which connect remnant patches into an ecological network within the urban area and lead to an integrated water and ecological management. The integrated management philosophy of water and ecology is introduced into the planning of the reconstruction of Beizai Community of Laoshan District in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, which is located at the Zhangcunhe Creek watershed in China. Five residential areas were planned in Beizhai Community. Wastewater in each residential area will be collected and treated separately according to the principle of decentralized water management, and effluent from wastewater treatment plants will be discharged into the landscaping water-body combined with polishing ponds and wetlands for further treatment and storage. From this point the purified water flows with storm runoff into nearby open water courses or ecological trenches, which transport the mixed water to creeks nearby. For the prevention of eutrophication and algae bloom from nutrients, constructed wetlands and riparian aquatic plants are employed to form buffer zones. The five residential ecological patches, one open water system, and greenways along Zhuangcunhe Creek will form an ecological network and will improve the livelihood, recreation, and biological diversity of the reconstruction area. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A review of current knowledge and research priorities for conservation of lentic biodiversity in tropical wet and monsoonal urban landscapes
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban expansion is a major threat to diversity, especially in rapidly developing tropical countries where urban areas are growing at great pace and protection is limited. We conducted a systematic review of published research on the ecology of lentic habitats in tropical urban areas. The review focused on understanding: (1) how much is currently known about the biodiversity of these habitats; (2) whether this knowledge is biased towards certain taxonomic groups and/or geographic areas; (3) what is known about the factors influencing their diversity; and (4) which ecosystem services urban lentic habitats provide. The review aimed to establish whether existing knowledge is sufficient to help guide conservation and provide evidence to policy makers of the importance of conserving tropical urban wetlands. We found 64 papers that addressed questions about the diversity and/or distribution of lentic ecosystems within tropical urban areas. Papers came from 15 countries, although almost half (45%) were from India; relatively few countries from Southeast Asia, tropical Africa, or South America were represented in the literature. Publication patterns revealed a growing interest in urban wetlands, but several biases and gaps were evident from the review. Firstly, papers generally focused on larger natural or semi-natural wetlands, with other types and sizes of lentic habitat under-represented in published work. Secondly, most papers focused on a single site, with a limited number of multi-site, city-wide, or landscape-scale diversity assessments. Thirdly, studies tended to focus on understanding the influence of water quality on diversity, with work assessing the influence of physical habitat or factors related to dispersal and connectivity very limited. Finally, work assessing the ecosystem services provided by wetlands in tropical urban areas remains narrow in focus, with few quantitative assessments of the relationship between ecological characteristics and ecosystem functions and services. We suggest a number of research focal points and approaches to help address these biases. Research is needed to improve understanding of the distribution patterns tropical freshwater species in urban areas and of the relationships between species diversity and a wider set of environmental and spatial conditions. Overall, there is a need for diversity assessments of tropical urban wetlands of all types and sizes, especially new and novel habitats, and scope for much greater adoption of ecosystem service concepts and evaluation tools to help emphasise the importance of these habitats. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Reservoirs of the Peri-Pampean region
PY  - 2014
AB  - In this article we analyze the reservoirs of the Peri-Pampean region comprised in the arid western corridor, taking into account their biogeographic areas and the characteristics of their basins. Since many of these reservoirs are impacted by agriculture, tourism and effluents from industries and urban areas, they are typically meso-eutrophic and with low levels of dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion during summer. The Río Tercero Reservoir receives an additional impact from the change in operation prescribed for the functioning of a nuclear power plant. This water body, located in the \"El Espinal\" region, is oligo-mesotrophic, and its plankton has varied in composition and bioinass during the pre- and post-operational periods of the plant. In all the reservoirs here studied, blooms have been registered, most frequently and recurrently produced by Cyanobacteria (e.g., species of Dolichospermum and Microcystis), and have been associated with the presence of toxins in the reservoirs of San Luis and in the San Roque Reservoir of Córdoba. Ceratium hirundinella (Pyrrophyta), a species widely colonizing the Peri-Pampean region, was also associated with blooms. In many reservoirs of the area no studies have been performed at all, while in others the investigations have been scarce and motivated by specific objectives with the results usually being published in either private or classified reports. © 2014 E.

PY  - 2021
AB  - This study calculated the ecological network index (City Biodiversity Index 2) of 85 cities in Korea using the Land Cover Map. Based on the values of the index, four types of city were studied, including Miryang (Cluster A), Anseong (Cluster B), Samcheok (Cluster Cluster), and Yongin (Cluster D). Based on the current status of land use and natural green space in urban areas, small and medium-sized cities do not show many disconnected factors and have a positive (+) effect on the ecological network index (ENI) value. In order to promote urban biodiversity, it is necessary not only to expand the green area quantitatively, but also to improve the quality, such as expanding and connecting natural green areas, and reducing linear disconnection factors. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Developing and optimizing ecological networks in urban agglomeration of Hunan Province, China
PY  - 2011
AB  - On a regional scale, large habitat patches which are important regional sources of biological diversity can provide important functions in habitat protection for biodiversity conservation. However, due to rapid urbanization, large habitat patches have become increasingly fragmented, and are almost like an island surrounded by the built-up area. The connectivity among these habitat patches is gradually waning. Changes in land use around these large patches have very strong impacts and seriously threaten regional biodiversity conservation. Habitat fragmentation would lead to smaller and more isolated animal populations and the isolated populations are more vulnerable to local extinction and inbreeding depression. An Ecological network is a representation of the biotic interaction in an ecosystem while ecological network planning is a method that combines fragmented habitat patches to form landscapes with spatial integrity and habitat networks. This method can help raise the quality of natural ecosystems and protect biodiversity. Thus, the establishment of ecological networks and the restoration of the links between isolated habitat patches would be quite beneficial to ecosystem services. In this paper, based on the theory and principles of Landscape Ecology and Conservation Biology, taking urban agglomeration in Hunan Province as the example, the potential ecological corridors were quantitatively simulated using the Least-Cost Path and Scenario Analysis Methods with the help of Remote Sensing and GIS technology. The strength of the interaction between green patches was then evaluated quantitatively based on the Gravity model. The impacts of the result of potential ecological networks by the cost surface were also analyzed. Finally, suggestions on how to optimize the ecological network were accordingly put forward. This paper tried to answer the following three questions: (1) what are the potential ecological corridors of urban agglomeration in Hunan Provence and how to determine the relative importance of these ecological corridors scientifically? (2) how to optimize the constructed ecological networks for better maintenance of regional biodiversity? (3) to what extent can the cost surface modal influence the result of ecological network analysis? The results showed that: (1) woodlands and farmlands are the superior landscape types in the ecological network of the study area; (2) the reciprocity between different habitat patches is quite varied, and has decreased from west to east and south to north; and (3) cost surface has a strong impact on the results of the potential ecological corridors analysis, so scenario analysis is very important and essential. The results in this article can provide the scientific basis for developing and optimizing ecological networks on a regional scale, and can also provide important references for the construction of ecological networks in other urban agglomeration.

TI  - Plant ecological traits highlight the effects of landscape on riparian plant communities along an urban-rural gradient
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urban landscapes are characterized by an urban matrix often unfavorable for biodiversity, interspersed with remnant corridors such as riparian areas. Those are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. We investigated the effect of the two components, matrix versus corridor, by comparing the riparian plant diversity and the community-level ecological traits along an urbanization gradient. Species distribution was surveyed at a local-scale along an urban riparian corridor in Strasbourg, eastern France. Ninety plots were sampled along an urbanization gradient. Several plant metrics were measured using both plant richness (R) and mean ecological trait values of species weighted by their abundance (CWM). The surroundings of each plot were first described by selecting representative variables of matrix and corridor. Secondly, the distribution of plant species according to a given i ecological trait was analyzed in relation with different levels of urbanization. Using mixed effects models, we verified whether matrix or corridor variables best explain the distribution of traits. Three levels of urbanization were detected, termed urban, suburban and peri-urban, based on landscape composition. Neither the peri-urban nor the suburban level affected plant metrics. At the urban level, and whatever indicator value was considered, the CWMi metrics clearly decreased, whereas species richness Ri increased. The upstream distance to the nearest natural area and tree cover were the most influential variables on CWMi metrics, whereas Ri metrics were mainly driven by built component and landscape heterogeneity. Matrix variables were more important in explaining Ri metrics while corridor features affected CWMi metrics. These results highlight the preponderance of the corridor effect on plant ecological types and the importance of the matrix on the selection and/or the implantation of novel species. Thus, the urbanization gradient may operate simultaneously on the abundance of local species and impose the recruitment of new co-existing species. This study suggests that ecological type responds to the urbanization gradient and may be an alternative tool to understand plant distribution rather than plant diversity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The impact of different road grades on ecological networks in a mega-city Wuhan City, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - The development of road networks over the years has caused serious damage to biodiversity. However, few studies have explored the impact of different road grades on ecological network connectivity, especially at multiple levels and at different dispersal distances. Here, we propose an analytical framework based on the integrated graph theory and the circuit theory method, in order to model the ecological network of virtual species, to evaluate connectivity at the landscape, patch, and corridor levels, and to identify the key patches and key corridors that contribute the most to the maintenance of connectivity. The empirical analysis in this study was performed on six scenarios, which were designed by successively integrating different road grades into the landscape. On this basis, the impact of different road grades on the connectivity, key patches, and key corridors in Wuhan, China, were explored. The results showed that: (1) High-grade roads have a significant impact on landscape-patch-corridor connectivity, while medium-grade roads have a similar degree of impact on patch-level connectivity as high-grade roads do. (2) Species with long dispersal ability (25 km) are susceptible to roads at the landscape and corridor levels; species with low and medium dispersal abilities (10, 15 and 20 km) are vulnerable to roads at the patch levels. (3) The importance of key patches and the resistance of key corridors are significantly increased by the influence of roads, while their spatial distribution changes slightly. This integrated framework contributes to an evaluation of the impacts of different grades road on ecological processes, so as to better provide targeted suggestions for biodiversity conservation and transportation planning. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Although many studies have considered urban structure when investigating urban ecological networks, few have considered the three-dimensional (3D) structure of buildings as well as urban green spaces. Airborne LiDAR datasets provide an opportunity to quantify 3D structure and evaluate 3D metrics in connectivity mapping. We examined an urban ecological network using the 3D structure of both green spaces and buildings. Using breeding-season bird species observations and airborne LiDAR data collected, we assessed the influence of 3D structural variables on species diversity. We used correlation analyses to determine if vertical distribution, volume, area, and height of both buildings and vegetation were related to bird species diversity. Then we conducted circuit theory-based current flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) analysis using the LiDAR-derived structural variables. We found that the volumes of buildings and 8–10 m vegetation heights were both highly correlated with species richness per unit area. There were significant differences between 2D and 3D connectivity analysis using LiDAR-derived variables among urban forest patches, boulevards, and apartment complexes. Within urban forest patches and parks, 3D CFBC represented canopy structural characteristics well, by showing high variance in spatial distributions. The 3D CFBC results indicated that adjacent high-rise buildings, dense apartment complexes, and densely urbanized areas were isolated, as characterized by low centrality values, but that vegetation planted in open spaces between buildings could improve connectivity by linking isolated areas to core areas. Our research highlights the importance of considering 3D structure in planning and managing urban ecological connectivity.

TI  - Bacterial Community Composition in Cadmium-Contaminated Soils in Xinxiang City and Its Ability to Reduce Cadmium Bioaccumulation in Pak Choi (Brassica chinensis L.)
PY  - 2020
AB  - There are many types of bacteria in heavy metal-contaminated soils, including plant growth-promoting bacteria and heavy metal-immobilizing bacteria, which may potentially be used for the bioremediation of contaminated soil. In this study, the Cd-contaminated soil around a battery factory in Xinxiang City was collected and its bacterial community composition was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and the plate lineation separation method. The traditional culture method showed that bacteria isolated from contaminated soil belonged to four phyla (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) and 30 genera including Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Rhizobium. HTS showed that the soil contained 25 phyla including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria and 400 genera. The HTS analysis revealed a greater diversity of the bacterial community than the traditional culture method. Network analysis was performed using the relative abundances of bacteria based on the phylogenetic molecular ecological network (pMEN) method. Network analysis showed that the key bacteria included Arthrobacter, Marmoricola, Nocardioides, Ferruginibacter, Flavitalea, Nitrospira, and Lysobacter. The Cd fixation and adsorption abilities of the 159 cultivable strains were determined. The results showed that 30 strains from 11 genera, including Aneurinibacillus, Arthrobacter, and Bacillus, were highly efficient. Six high-efficiency strains were shown to increase the biomass of pak choi (Brassica chinensis L.) and reduce the content of Cd in different pak choi tissues. This study provides candidate bacterial species for the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil in Xinxiang City and provides references for the bacterial community and its function in heavy metal-contaminated soil. © 2020, Science Press.

TI  - Towns and trails drive carnivore movement behaviour, resource selection, and connectivity
PY  - 2022
AB  - Background: Global increases in human activity threaten connectivity of animal habitat and populations. Protection and restoration of wildlife habitat and movement corridors require robust models to forecast the effects of human activity on movement behaviour, resource selection, and connectivity. Recent research suggests that animal resource selection and responses to human activity depend on their behavioural movement state, with increased tolerance for human activity in fast states of movement. Yet, few studies have incorporated state-dependent movement behaviour into analyses of Merriam connectivity, that is individual-based metrics of connectivity that incorporate landscape structure and movement behaviour. Methods: We assessed the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on multiple movement processes including movement behaviour, resource selection, and Merriam connectivity. We simulated movement paths using hidden Markov movement models and step selection functions to estimate habitat use and connectivity for three landscape scenarios: reference conditions with no anthropogenic development, current conditions, and future conditions with a simulated expansion of towns and recreational trails. Our analysis used 20 years of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and gray wolf (Canis lupus) movement data collected in and around Banff National Park, Canada. Results: Carnivores increased their speed of travel near towns and areas of high trail and road density, presumably to avoid encounters with people. They exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development when foraging and resting compared to travelling and during the day compared to night. Wolves exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development than grizzly bears. Current development reduced the amount of high-quality habitat between two mountain towns by more than 35%. Habitat degradation constrained movement routes around towns and was most pronounced for foraging and resting behaviour. Current anthropogenic development reduced connectivity from reference conditions an average of 85%. Habitat quality and connectivity further declined under a future development scenario. Conclusions: Our results highlight the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on carnivore movement behaviour, habitat use, and connectivity. Our strong behaviour-specific responses to human activity suggest that conservation initiatives should consider how proposed developments and restoration actions would affect where animals travel and how they use the landscape. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Stream communities across a rural-urban landscape gradient
PY  - 2006
AB  - Rapid urbanization throughout the world is expected to cause extensive loss of biodiversity in the upcoming decades. Disturbances associated with urbanization frequently operate over multiple spatial scales such that local species extirpations have been attributed both to localized habitat degradation and to regional changes in land use. Urbanization also may shape stream communities by restricting species dispersal within and among stream reaches. In this patch-dynamics view, anthropogenic disturbances and isolation jointly reduce stream biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes. We evaluated predictions of stream invertebrate community composition and abundance based on variation in environmental conditions at five distinct spatial scales: stream habitats, reaches, riparian corridors and watersheds and their spatial location within the larger three-river basin. Despite strong associations between biodiversity loss and human density in this study, local stream habitat and stream reach conditions were poor predictors of community patterns. Instead, local community diversity and abundance were more accurately predicted by riparian vegetation and watershed landscape structure. Spatial coordinates associated with instream distances provided better predictions of stream communities than any of the environmental data sets. Together, results suggest that urbanization in the study region was associated with reduced stream invertebrate diversity through the alteration of landscape vegetation structure and patch connectivity. These findings suggest that maintaining and restoring watershed vegetation corridors in urban landscapes will aid efforts to conserve freshwater biodiversity. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation.

TI  - Construction and Optimization of Wetland Landscape Ecological Network in Dongying City, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to deteriorated wetland water quality, reduced biodiversity, and fragmented wetland landscapes, which seriously threaten the sustainable development of regional ecology. Based on land use data of Dongying City, Shandong Province, in 2020, this study selected the landscape disturbance degree and landscape fragility index to construct a landscape ecological risk evaluation model and to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of landscape ecological risk in Dongying City in 2020. The MSPA-Conefor-MCR model was used to extract the ecological network of wetlands in Dongying City, and the topological structure indices were quantitatively analyzed. Combined with the actual situation within the study area, the source sites to be optimized were identified by risk zoning and source importance; the ecological resistance surface was modified using landscape ecological risk, and the ecological network was optimized by simulating edge increase in order to evaluate the robustness of the ecological network before and after optimization and to verify the edge increase effect. The results show that the ecological risk in Dongying is high, mainly distributed in the central region and extending to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. A total of 131 ecological source sites (6 core and 125 resting-stone source sites) and 180 ecological corridors were extracted, and the whole ecological network was found to be less stable and to have stronger network heterogeneity using a topological analysis. By simulating 11 additional edges, the robustness of the optimized ecological network was significantly improved. Optimizing the simulated-edge increase can enhance the smoothness of ecological energy flow, which can provide a scientific basis for the construction of the ecological security pattern of wetlands in Dongying City. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Urban forestry-Linking naturalness and amenity: The case of Ljubljana, Slovenia
PY  - 2011
AB  - Urban forestry tries to connect the concept of forest ecosystem with the idea of nature preservation as well as with social needs of urban society, often living close to such a natural environment, thus being a part of it. The ability to connect the human need for the natural environment with life support system of persistent forest ecosystem should become an important contributing factor of urban forestry for well-being of urban society. In the range of 1. km walking distance around the city of Ljubljana and within urban areas of the city, forests comprise more than one quarter of the area. The most prevalent in the area are patches of forest fragments, estimated to have a shallow depth of the inner environment. The concept of urban forests in the Ljubljana Green System as a backbone of a green network has been confirmed especially by the two largest forest patches of Golovec and Rožnik, indented as a part of forest matrix up to the city centre. Based on the analysis of the continuum of these forests, it was possible to assume that in the past, more than three quarters of forest grounds were meant for no other land use. In the other quarter of the city and its Green System, forests were more significantly reduced in the past, given the fact that we can estimate its continuum only for one half of today's area. On a detailed level, it is recommended for the urban forests to contain a significant percentage of trees and other species that would naturally appear on the sites of the area. Whereas on a landscape level, it is not enough to address only such species, but also temporal stability of forest patches, corridors or even forest matrix in urban areas and its urban-rural gradient into suburban areas. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Linking ecosystem service and mspa to construct landscape ecological network of the huaiyang section of the grand canal
PY  - 2021
AB  - Rapid urbanization and drastic land-use change have led to landscape fragmentation and ecological environment deterioration in the regions along the Grand Canal. Building an ecological network is an important means to improve the connectivity of habitat patches and carry out ecological protection and restoration of territorial space, which is of great significance to ensure regional biodiversity and ecological security. In this article, we took the Huaiyang Section of the Grand Canal (Huaiyang Canal) as the study area, used the ecosystem service assessment model, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and the landscape connectivity evaluation method to identify ecological sources, then used the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and the gravity model to extract and grade ecological corridors. Based on these, the ecological network was constructed by combining the identification method of ecological nodes and ecological breakpoints. The aim of this was to provide a reference for the ecological space optimization of Huaiyang Canal and even the entire Grand Canal, the formulation of an ecological protection plan, and the implementation of territorial space ecological restoration. The results showed that the spatial distribution of the water conservation service, soil conservation service, carbon sequestration service, and biodiversity conservation service were significantly different, and the level of ecosystem services showed a trend of continuous degradation from 1990 to 2018. There were 12 ecological source patches comprehensively identified by multiple methods, with a total area of 2007.06 km2. In terms of spatial distribution, large ecological source patches were mainly distributed in the central and western areas adjacent to the Grand Canal, while small ecological source patches were scattered in the eastern and southern border regions of the study area. The total length of ecological corridors was 373.84 km, of which the number of the primary ecological corridor, secondary ecological corridor, and tertiary ecological corridor were 9, 7, and 7, respectively, and the suitable width of the ecological corridor was 200–400 m. After optimization, the proposed ecological network was composed of 3 key ecological source patches, 9 important ecological source patches, 23 terrestrial corridors, 10 aquatic corridors, and 18 ecological nodes. Twenty-nine ecological breakpoints were key areas requiring ecological restoration. The overlap rate of the integrated ecosystem service change area and land-use change area was 99%, indicating that land-use change has a significant impact on regional ecosystem services. This study is of great significance for carrying out the ecological protection and restoration of the Huaiyang Canal and adjusting local land-use policies. It also provides a typical case demonstration for identifying an ecological network and formulating ecological restoration planning for other sections of the Grand Canal and cities along the canal.

TI  - Constructing and optimizing urban ecological network in the context of rapid urbanization for improving landscape connectivity
PY  - 2021
AB  - The construction of the urban ecological network has a comprehensive effect on urban aesthetics, society and economy, and provides the driving force for urban sustainable development. However, we found few studies on constructing and optimizing urban ecological networks in cities with the highest human density. In this paper, landscape pattern indexes were applied to analyze the landscape characteristics and morphological pattern analysis (MSPA) to identify the ecological source, the landscape connectivity and the region attributes revised the ecological resistance surface, and urban ecological network was constructed by MCR model. The results show that: (1) many ecological land types mainly distributed in the tributaries of the Yangtze River, while only forest land and water areas occupied in the northwest are. (2) Compared with 1995 and 2005, the number of ecological corridors in 2015 was decreasing. Although the ecological connectivity was improved, which of the Yangtze River was limited. (3) The coordinated development and the ecological protection ecological network optimization plan would promote the connectivity of the urban ecological functioning stability. This study provides recommendations for the optimization of the urban ecological network, which are of great significance for protecting biodiversity, improving ecosystem functions, and maintaining the regional ecological security pattern. © 2021

TI  - Permeability of a heterogeneous urban landscape to the movements of forest songbirds
PY  - 2011
AB  - 1. Urbanization represents a major threat to biodiversity world-wide because it causes permanent degradation and fragmentation of biologically rich natural communities. This is particularly acute in coastal plains and river valleys, where cities are typically located. Although movement is essential to the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes, little is known about how development and transportation corridors affect the movements of wildlife in the urban context. 2. We conducted a series of translocation experiments within the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to assess the permeability of selected landscape elements for two species of forest songbirds with contrasting adaptabilities to urban development and migratory behaviours: the black-capped chickadee Poecile atricapillus, an urban-adaptable year-round resident, and the yellow warbler Dendroica petechia, an urban-sensitive Neotropical migrant. 3. Birds were caught in riparian habitats and translocated either within the riparian corridor of origin or across the urban matrix. Riparian treatments included continuous forest, one or several transportation bridges and a major river. In the urban matrix, birds were translocated across a single major road, well- or poorly-treed developed areas, or multiple gaps. 4. Using Cox regression we found that the presence of gaps in forest cover explained more variation in return time than the amount of forest cover for both species. Multiple gaps, in particular, resulted in significantly longer return times compared with continuous forest. Chickadees exhibited longer return times when translocated across linear gaps associated with bridges or roads. In contrast, yellow warbler movements appeared to be more constrained by urban development. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that improving the permeability of urban landscapes for songbirds can be achieved by preserving connectivity along riparian corridors and other major swaths of natural vegetation while minimizing gaps in vegetation throughout the urban matrix. Our study also demonstrated a cumulative effect of multiple barriers, species-specific response thresholds to canopy cover and gap width, and an important effect of distance-to-territory on movement behaviour. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of 'most forested route' as a new, animal-based approach for quantifying the permeability of heterogeneous landscapes. © 2011 The Authors.

TI  - Biogeographical approaches to nature in the city - parks, green spaces and open spaces
PY  - 2000
AB  - For several years, urban nature has become a major theme in academic litterature, especialy urban vegetation. Some authors are particularly interested in the vegetation located in industrial abandoned sites, vacant lots or train right-of-way. They have oriented their work towards the dispersal patterns of weeds, including their origin and the spatial distribution of species in the urban area. Several authors compare the green open spaces to urban islands, inspired by the island biogeographical theory. These isolated green open spaces constitute, as it were, insular spaces dispersed in the agglomeration and it is suggested that models of dispersion and biological exchanges are similar to the dispersion of vegetation on ocean islands, for example. In the perspective of conservation and restoration of open green spaces, the concept of green corridors or green links has emerged as an interesting alternative, not only to produce new urban green spaces but also to create a green urban network. This paper examines the biogeographical approaches as regards to the planning of parks and green spaces in urban habitats.

TI  - Hotspots of species diversity in large cities – Fiction or reality? Localisation and description of water habitats with particularly high species diversity in the city of rostock
PY  - 2018
AB  - Due to a presumably low biodiversity small water biotopes and adjacent lowlands in urban areas have so far been studied insufficiently. According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000) they are categorised as surface waters with no reporting obligation due to their minor drainage function and small area size. Most of them are not parts of any European protection network and thus are not investigated and maintained according to the Habitat Directive. In the context of the scientific ReWaM (regional management of water resources) project “KOGGE” small municipal water bodies in urban areas were investigated using the example of the Hanseatic City of Rostock. The results showed that some small urban water biotopes host a diverse flora and fauna and can be seen as hotspots of biodiversity despite structural limitations and multifunctional use. In the course of the project a method was developed to identify and define these habitats. In total, 10 hotspots could be identified in the municipal area. Subsequently, the structures of these sites were characterised and site-specific species were identified. The results and findings can be used to define habitat networks and refuge areas for protected species. © 2018, Verlag Eugen Ulmer. All rights reserved.

TI  - Study on spatial conservation priority pattern of key protected plants in Xiamen
PY  - 2021
AB  - Biodiversity conservation plays an important role in maintaining the function of urban ecosystem. In this study, 39 species of key protected plants in Xiamen were selected as the objects. MaxENT, a species distribution model is used to predicate the potential distribution of species. Zonation, a quantitative tool for Spatial Conservation Priority, is used to identify the areas that are suitable for the survival of key protected plants and can ensure the landscape connectivity, so as to obtain the multi species landscape protection level of local key protected plants. According to the 2020 global biodiversity target, 17% of the areas with the highest level of landscape protection will be regarded as the spatial conservation prioritization areas of multi species. Combined with the weighted extinction risk curve with landscape loss generated by zonation model, 8% of the areas with the highest level of protection are classified as primary conservation areas, and the areas with the protection level ranging from 8% to 17% are classified as secondary conservation areas. By using jackknife method in MaxENT, it is found that altitude is the most important environmental factor affecting the distribution of local key protected plants, and spatial conservation prioritization areas are concentrated in the coastal zone with lower altitude. The spatial conservation prioritization areas in this study were compared with nature reserve, the planning of ecological function zones, land use planning and urban master planning of Xiamen, it is found that the spatial conservation prioritization areas in the West and north of Xiamen are well protected; the spatial conservation prioritization areas in the coastal zone of southwest and southeast of the island and the eastern and southern of outside the Xiamen island have been occupied by construction land on a large scale. there are few areas included in the scope of nature reserves, and a large number of coastal conservation prioritization areas are vacant; although the part of the conservation prioritization areas in the southeast of outside the Xiamen island are not occupied, they are planned as reserve land for development and lack of ecological protection. In order to avoid the further reduction of conservation prioritization areas, we should focus on the ecological protection of conservation prioritization areas in the coastal zone. The conservation prioritization areas that belong to development reserve will be converted into ecological space. We should strictly control the further development and utilization of conservation prioritization areas in the coastal zone so as to protect biodiversity. For the primary and secondary conservation areas, we should implement rigid and flexible ecological conservation measures, and coordinate the relationship between protection and development in conservation prioritization areas. © 2021 Science Press.

TI  - A landscape ecological model for wildlife enhancement of stormwater management practices in urban greenways
PY  - 1995
AB  - A spatial distribution model has been developed to predict the pattern of stormwater catchment facilities in developing urban areas. The model has been validated through comparison of predicted results with historical data in Guelph, Canada, using nearest neighbour analysis. The validated model has been applied to developing urban-rural fringe lands in Guelph to illustrate land use patterns likely to occur under different scenarios. Simulations of various scenarios for incorporating stormwater catchment facilities into greenways have been tested with the model and the resultant land use patterns compared with the status quo, through measures of landscape ecological integrity such as connectivity and porosity. The model was applied to an area on the edge of Guelph scheduled for development. The predicted land use patterns of various planning scenarios were generated and analysed. The results demonstrated that landscape integrity could be increased, urban wildlife habitat enhanced, and opportunities for residential non-consumptive wildlife recreation improved through integration of the evolving 'blue-green' open space provided by urban stormwater management facilities into existing greenways. © 1995.

TI  - A multistep approach to improving connectivity and co-use of spatial ecological networks in cities
PY  - 2021
AB  - Context: Ecological networks are systems of interconnected components that support biodiversity, ecological processes and ecosystem services. Such structures play a crucial role for nature conservation and people well-being in anthropogenic landscapes. Assessing connectivity by using efficient models and metrics is a sine qua non condition to preserve and improve appropriately these ecological networks. Objectives: This study aims to present a novel methodological approach to assess and model connectivity for species conservation (Bufo calamita; the natterjack toad) and human recreation in the city. Methods: The study used a combination least cost and circuit models to identify priority corridors in the City of Liège, Belgium. Green areas, habitats and relevant movement parameters were derived based on existing studies around (i) the occurrence, ecology and biology of the natterjack toad and (ii) human behavioural studies on urban pedestrians. Combining the two models allowed the assessment of connectivity for both species via two different metrics visualised using priority corridors on maps. Results: The connectivity assessments identified lack of connectivity as the potential route to extinction of natterjack toads at one of the source sites. Conclusions: This study provides examples of how combining least cost and circuit models can contribute to the improvement of urban ecological networks and demonstrates the usefulness of such models for nature conservation and urban planning. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Construction and Optimization Strategy of an Ecological Network in Mountainous Areas: A Case Study in Southwestern Hubei Province, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - High-intensity urban development and economic exploitation have led to the fragmentation and isolation of regional habitat patches, and biodiversity is under serious threat. Scientific identification and effective optimization of ecological networks are essential for maintaining and restoring regional ecosystem connectivity and guiding sustainable socio-economic development. Taking the mountainous areas of southwest Hubei Province (MASHP) in central China as an example, this study first developed a new integrated approach to identify ecological sources based on a quantitative assessment of ecosystem services and the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method; it then used the Linkage Mapper tool to extract ecological corridors, applied the principle of hydrological analysis to identify ecological nodes, evaluated each ecological element to quantify its importance, and finally constructed the ecological network and further proposed some optimization countermeasures. The results show that the ecological network in the MASHP is dominated by ecological resources composed of forestland. Connectivity in the central region is significantly better than in other regions, including 49 ecological sources with an area of 3837.92 km<sup>2</sup>, 125 ecological corridors with a total length of 2014.61 km, and 46 ecological nodes. According to the spatial distribution of crucial ecological landscape elements, a complete and systematic ecological framework of \"two verticals, three belts, three groups, and multiple nodes\" was proposed. The internal optimization of the ecological network in mountainous areas should focus on improving ecological flow, and strategies such as enhancing the internal connectivity of ecosystems, unblocking ecological corridors, and dividing ecological functional zones can be adopted. Based on the above analyses, this study also made recommendations for ecological protection and development and construction planning in mountainous areas. This study can provide realistic paths and scientific guidelines for ecological security and high-quality development in the MASHP, and it can also have implications for the construction of ecological networks and comprehensive ecological management in other mountainous areas.

TI  - Urbanization and wetland communities: Applying metacommunity theory to understand the local and landscape effects
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urbanization is a growing threat to ecological communities and has become a leading cause of population extirpations in a wide range of taxa. Because the effects of urbanization are often multifaceted, identifying the pathways through which changes in communities occur has remained a persistent challenge. We draw upon metacommunity theory to evaluate competing explanations for the effects of urbanization, focusing on the relative importance of processes at local (e.g. abiotic and biotic characteristics) and regional (e.g. habitat connectivity and dispersal) scales. Over 4 years, we sampled 201 wetlands in the Front Range region of Colorado, which is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the USA. Wetlands embedded within urban areas exhibited significantly lower taxonomic richness and diversity compared to those in agricultural or grassland areas. Relative to grassland wetlands, urban wetlands supported a 60% lower richness of amphibians and aquatic reptiles and a 33% lower richness of aquatic insects, molluscs and crayfish. These patterns were associated with changes in biotic factors (introduced fishes and bullfrogs), abiotic factors (nutrients, conductivity and vegetation) and landscape characteristics (road density and surrounding wetland area). The use of an information-theoretic approach and structural equation modelling suggested that the effects of urbanization on richness were mainly driven by changes in road density. Analyses of community composition indicated that discrete communities formed along the urban systems gradient, such that actively dispersing predators associated more negatively with urban system relative to herbivores with passive dispersal. Synthesis and applications. These results highlight the importance of considering both local and regional factors in addressing conservation-related challenges and underscore the benefits of linking conceptual work on metacommunity theory with applied efforts to mitigate the effects of urbanization.

TI  - The spatial configuration of greenspace affects semi-aquatic turtle occupancy and species richness in a suburban landscape
PY  - 2013
AB  - Within urbanized areas, the importance of greenspaces for wildlife has been widely investigated for some animal groups, but reptiles have generally been neglected. To assess the importance of the amount, spatial distribution, and configuration of greenspaces (comprised of terrestrial and aquatic areas), we examined semi-aquatic turtle species richness in urbanized areas. In this study, we sampled turtles from 2010 to 2011 at 20 ponds, including farm (rural) ponds, ponds in urbanized environments, and golf course ponds. We used a hierarchical Bayesian species-richness model to estimate species richness and species-specific occupancy responses to three pond types (rural, golf, or urban) and four landscape measurements of greenspace (i.e., Euclidean nearest neighbor, interspersion juxtaposition, percent of landscape, and connectance), generated in FRAGSTATS. We found that probability of occupancy of four species, Kinosternon subrubrum, Trachemys scripta, Chelydra serpentina, and Pseudemys concinna increased substantially with an increase in connectance of greenspace within 500. m of each pond. When the model examining the configuration of greenspaces was analyzed, estimated species richness was greater at golf ponds as compared to either rural or urban ponds, and richness increased with increasing connectivity of greenspaces. Our results indicate that in golf course ponds can potentially support a greater diversity of semi-aquatic turtle species than rural or urban ponds and thus may be considered superior habitat in suburban environments. In addition, we suggest that maintaining connectivity of greenspaces in suburban areas is important for semi-aquatic turtles and should be considered in urban planning. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ecological connectivity research in urban areas
PY  - 2015
AB  - The successful movement of individuals is fundamental to life. Facilitating these movements by promoting ecological connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation. Urban areas contain more than half of the world's human population, and their potential to support biodiversity and to connect their citizens to nature is increasingly recognized. Promoting ecological connectivity within these areas is essential to reaching this potential. However, our current understanding of ecological connectivity within urban areas appears limited. We reviewed the published scientific literature to assess the state-of-the-art of ecological connectivity research in urban areas, summarized trends in study attributes and highlighted knowledge gaps. We found 174 papers that investigated ecological connectivity within urban areas. These papers addressed either structural (48) or functional connectivity (111), and some addressed both (15), but contained substantial geographic and taxonomic biases. These papers rarely defined the aspect of connectivity they were investigating and objective descriptions of the local urban context were uncommon. Formulated hypotheses or a priori predictions were typically unstated and many papers used suboptimal study designs and methods. We suggest future studies explicitly consider and quantify the landscape within their analyses and make greater use of available and rapidly developing tools and methods for measuring functional connectivity (e.g. biotelemetry or landscape genetics). We also highlight the need for studies to clearly define how the terms 'urban' and 'connectivity' have been applied. Knowledge gaps in ecological connectivity in urban areas remain, partly because the field is still in its infancy and partly because we must better capitalize on the state-of-the-art technological and analytical techniques that are increasingly available. Well-designed studies that employed high-resolution data and powerful analytical techniques highlight our abilities to quantify ecological connectivity in urban areas. These studies are exemplary, setting the standards for future research to facilitate data-driven and evidence-based biodiversity-friendly infrastructure planning in urban areas. © 2015 British Ecological Society.

TI  - The effects of habitat network construction and urban block unit structure on biodiversity in semiarid green spaces
PY  - 2020
AB  - The promotion of urban biodiversity mainly relies on all kinds of urban green land, especially the green land affiliated with fragmentation and smaller dimensions that receives less attention. Based on small-scale connected urban green spaces, the construction of habitat networks is very important for biodiversity protection. Considering the importance of the habitat networks constructed by the affiliated green land with smaller dimensions to biodiversity protection, this research attempted to apply a new technique to construct a habitat network and an urban block unit structure for ecological restoration and green space biodiversity at the city-block scale. By analyzing the related ecological principles, this research extracted four design approaches: the green land habitat patch-companion method; the corresponding shape and function method; the newly increased and protective patch location method; the bunching patch substitution method; and the approaches for designing campus habitat galleries, such as the 3D greening method of narrow and long campus galleries, the method of designing a campus main road green belt, the method of designing a relaxed campus landscape green belt, the method of designing a core campus landscape green belt, the method of connecting the habitat patch node, and the method of covering habitat diversity. By comparing the network pattern indexes, determining the key habitat patches, constructing the habitat network frameworks, and improving the habitat aggregation quality, this research constructed three ideal network models for urban university campus habitats and explained the butterfly biodiversity model graphic representation, application conditions, and features. The “crosswise radiation” network was effective for ecological restoration, and the “dendritic zoning” network significantly enhanced butterfly biodiversity.

TI  - Differential processes underlying the roadside distributions of native and alien plant assemblages
PY  - 2016
AB  - Although biological invasion often alters ecosystem properties and community composition at different scales, considerable uncertainty still exists regarding the underlying mechanisms that regulate the spread of alien species into new habitats. An alien invasion is generally achieved through multiple processes from multiple sources; this type of invasion often prevents us from understanding of the dispersal mechanisms. Here, we aim to disentangle the processes of alien invasion by focusing on a single migration source. We surveyed the distribution of alien and native plant species in Shiretoko National Park, located in northern Japan. We measured the coverage of each species and the environmental and spatial factors in 362 quadrats established along roadsides. We found 101 native species and 35 alien species (γ-diversity) throughout the quadrats. The local species richness (α-diversity) was higher for the alien species (6.1 species) than for the native species (3.2 species). There was a significant negative correlation in α-diversity between native and alien species. Moreover, the α-diversity and distance from the nearest town (migration source) showed a negative relationship for alien assemblages while the native assemblages showed the opposite trend. These results suggest that the alien species are expanding their distribution outward from the town, resulting in a decrease in the α-diversity of native species in localities close to the migration source. Overall, our results emphasize that roadsides could unintentionally act as corridors for alien species, even in protected areas. Careful consideration is thus needed for utilizing these human-created habitats even though they were designed for conservation and management purposes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Spatial contagion: Gardening along the street in residential neighborhoods
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urban nature, including residential gardens, can promote biodiversity and increase human wellbeing. Understanding factors that encourage the spread of gardening within cities may help planners facilitate healthier and more biodiverse urban communities. This study characterizes the spatial distribution and attributes of gardens found in easement areas of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Spatial analyses of these privately managed public spaces provide evidence of clustering for both presence of gardens and their esthetic quality. Data collected on the location and attributes of easements from 22,562 properties during summer of 2009, show that 11% of these properties held an easement garden. Results of multiple spatial analyses, each targeting a different aspect of garden distribution, show that (a) the most intense easement garden clustering occurs among neighbors with direct visual access to nearest neighbors easement areas; (b) it is 2.4 times as likely that a property holds an easement garden if a property within 30. m holds one; (c) although clustering is measureable for all neighborhood sizes up to 610. m from home, peak clustering happens within 91. m of home; and (d) clustering of easement gardens are clustered in terms of quality (appeal), and greatest clustering occurs between pairs of adjacent neighbors. While larger scale factors may play a role in where a garden cluster is initiated, the dominant occurrence of relatively small cluster sizes indicates that social contagion is in play. The potential value of social contagion is discussed as a mechanism for spread sustainable behaviors that support ecological resilience in urban areas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Permeability of roads to movement of scrubland lizards and small mammals
PY  - 2013
AB  - A primary objective of road ecology is to understand and predict how roads affect connectivity of wildlife populations. Road avoidance behavior can fragment populations, whereas lack of road avoidance can result in high mortality due to wildlife-vehicle collisions. Many small animal species focus their activities to particular microhabitats within their larger habitat. We sought to assess how different types of roads affect the movement of small vertebrates and to explore whether responses to roads may be predictable on the basis of animal life history or microhabitat preferences preferences. We tracked the movements of fluorescently marked animals at 24 sites distributed among 3 road types: low-use dirt, low-use secondary paved, and rural 2-lane highway. Most data we collected were on the San Diego pocket mouse (Chaetodipus fallax), cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus), western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra), Dulzura kangaroo rat (Dipodomys simulans) (dirt, secondary paved), and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) (highway only). San Diego pocket mice and cactus mice moved onto dirt roads but not onto a low-use paved road of similar width or onto the highway, indicating they avoid paved road substrate. Both lizard species moved onto the dirt and secondary paved roads but avoided the rural 2-lane rural highway, indicating they may avoid noise, vibration, or visual disturbance from a steady flow of traffic. Kangaroo rats did not avoid the dirt or secondary paved roads. Overall, dirt and secondary roads were more permeable to species that prefer to forage or bask in open areas of their habitat, rather than under the cover of rocks or shrubs. However, all study species avoided the rural 2-lane highway. Our results suggest that microhabitat use preferences and road substrate help predict species responses to low-use roads, but roads with heavy traffic may deter movement of a much wider range of small animal species. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.

TI  - Quantifying the effects of projected urban growth on connectivity among wetlands in the Great Plains (USA)
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban wetlands often have prolonged hydroperiods relative to non-urban ones, so they may play an outsized, positive role for wildlife. Ecological studies of urban wetlands have typically focused on large metropolitan areas, but non-traditional urbanizing areas such as the towns of the Great Plains of North America are projected to experience land-use and climate changes that will alter connectivity among the freshwater wetlands along a continental-scale migratory wildlife corridor. We used seven graph theory metrics to quantify connectivity among 89,798 of these wetlands under landscape-change forecasts from two models built for three climate-change and development scenarios, projected to the year 2050. We compared outcomes from models that differed in focal variable (impervious surface or developed land use). Overall, models with impervious surface projections resulted in the most wetlands affected, whereas models featuring developed land use projections resulted in the largest spatial distribution of effect. There were differences in how many and which wetlands were forecast to become urbanized by model and scenario, resulting in different wetland network topologies and differences in the connectivity roles of individual wetlands. A consensus network was therefore developed based on the wetlands that were projected to increase in impervious surface and exist within developed land use by 2050. These 126 wetlands can be prioritized for urban ecological studies or management because they are highly likely to be affected regardless of model or scenario. Lastly, our study highlights the utility of considering a range of developmental futures when planning urban wetland management in non-traditional urbanizing areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Stream corridor encroachment and its consequences: the case of Pinga Oya tributary in the upper Mahaweli River in Sri Lanka
PY  - 2021
AB  - The expanding human interference with stream corridors creates many undesirable impacts on the riverine ecosystem at different scales. Population growth and demand on land due to suitability of location for economic activities are pushing factors for encroachment in stream corridors. This issue is critical in the context of all headwater stream corridors in Sri Lanka. The objective of this study is to identify and highlight the nature and intensity of the encroachment and its consequences. Within the context of this concern, the Pinga Oya catchment located within the upper Mahaweli stream corridor, was selected as the study site. Relevant literature sources, legal documents, image classifications, chain survey, stream cross-sectional survey, field observation, questionnaire survey and stakeholder interviews were used to conduct the study. Encroachment in the stream corridor resulted in changing natural functions of the stream corridor ecosystem in many ways. Given that, artificial constructions conceal 100% area within 40 m distance from the stream’s left bank and 90% area within 40 m distance from the stream’s right bank within the stream’s highly populated reach. The average populated reach within the area of 40 m distance from the stream’s left and right banks is covered with 80% of artificial constructions. The less populated reach within the area of 40 m distance from the stream’s left bank is covered 45% by roads and 55% with natural area s. The right bank is totally natural, with 95% of vegetation and 5% of rock and no artificial constructions. There is less species density and diversity in the highly populated segment of the Pinga Oya stream corridor. The trend has begun since the 1980s after the transformation of Akurana as a trade centre. Stream water quality in terms of turbidity, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and nitrate concentrations has exceed the tolerance limits. The recorded nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) is 18.5 in highly populated reaches and 12.4 NTU in less populated reaches during the rainy season. BOD levels are 14, 10.3 and 9.2 mg L−1 respectively, showing decreasing pattern from highly populated to less populated reaches. In the less populated reach both seasons represent high (Nitrate) N levels, with 27.5 mg L−1 in the rainy season. This is particularly due to agriculture-related waste leachate containing nitrate. To overcome the major problems, the government should give more power to relevant authorities to take legal actions to demarcate the stream corridors, at least streams in urban premises. Awareness programmes for stream dwellers to maintain the stream corridors and strict rules and regulations are essential for restoration of the Pinga Oya stream corridor to make it sustainable.

PY  - 2011
AB  - In this paper, we promote the use of vegetation and land cover data as biodiversity indicators of pressure, state and impact for ecosystem goods and services in urban and periurban landscapes. In the case study of the Municipality of Rome, a Mediterranean metropolis with a long history of care for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, recent landscape researches have been addressed towards typification of plant communities, modelling of vegetation series, ecological land classification, design of land ecological network and analysis of land cover change. The results of these investigations have been employed for the identification and ecological evaluation of some locally relevant ecosystem services - such as habitat provision, conservation of species diversity, urban climate regulation, and educational values - and provide experimental evidence of the bioindication potential of plant communities and vegetation series.

TI  - Influence of forest corridor on avifauna of the Atlantic Forest
PY  - 2000
AB  - The study was carried out in an area located at Serra do Mar, belonging to Mata Atlântica formation, also known as Atlantic Rain Forest, near the town of Paraibuna, State of São Paulo, Brazil (located at latitude 23 ° 31'S to 23 ° 33'S, longitude 45 ° 39'W to 45 ° 42'W and altitude of 944 to 1.136 m). Three fragments of natural vegetation (sizes of 46.92 ha, 4.28 ha and 26.38 ha) and an adjacent area of eucalypts plantation (42.15 ha), were utilized for the surveys. In all situations the understorey was quite prominent and the vegetation of the gallery forest fragments were in a medium stage of secondary regeneration. The fragment of smaller size was formed by a corridor of natural vegetation, connecting the two larger fragments. The objectives of the study were to analyze the groups of birds that were affected by the forest fragmentation and, additionally, to evaluate the impacts caused by the fragmentation and the isolation degree of these areas, using birds as ecological indicator to analyze the corridor's effectiveness to the passage of genetic material among fragments. The method used to register the avifauna specimens was the captures and recaptures supported by mist nets installed within the fragments understorey and within an eucalypts plantation. Taking into account 2.502 hours of mist net in all studied areas, it was possible to register a total of 54 species of birds, distributed over a range of 14 families and 6 orders. The main species were characterized as insect-eating and omnivorous. The species composition was affected by the fragmentation and also by the reduction of the natural vegetation. The quantity and diversity of birds showed a direct relationship with the size of the fragment and structure of the vegetation and an inverse relationship with the isolation degree of the area. There was no evidence of passage of any typical forest avifauna individuals by the corridor. The registration of great quantity of common species to both fragments and corridor, of several trophic groups and distribution in the different strata of the vegetation, demonstrates the dynamics among these environments. The corridor is working as an effective habitat area, complementing the network of existent reserve. The width is directly attached to the corridor effectiveness, however, the ideal width is an empiric measure, because several variables can affect the species flux to the corridor, as area, isolation degree, structure and vegetation composition, edge effect, neighborhood type and anthropic pressures. The eucalypts plantations, even containing the understorey level quite prominent, form an effective barrier to different avifauna species, mainly over those ones that live in the core zone of the forest.

TI  - Beyond masking: Endangered Stephen's kangaroo rats respond to traffic noise with footdrumming
PY  - 2012
AB  - On-road vehicles have become a pervasive source of low frequency noise in both urban environments and natural protected areas. Because many species rely on low-frequency signals to communicate with conspecifics, they are likely to be especially vulnerable to signal masking and the concomitant biological effects associated with exposure to traffic noise. Here, we show that the spectral characteristics of traffic noise overlap extensively with footdrumming signals of the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi; SKR). Playbacks of footdrumming overlaid with experimental and control background noises indicate that traffic noise masks and may mimic footdrumming signals. SKR showed no response to footdrumming playbacks overlaid with traffic noise. Yet, traffic noise itself may mimic footdrumming and prompt a false response in SKR - playbacks of traffic noise alone and footdrumming overlaid with control sounds elicited similar behavioral responses. These results provide the first evidence that anthropogenic noise may function as a deceptive signal to wildlife, causing animals to engage in false responses that may be energetically and biologically costly. More broadly, these results indicate that anthropogenic noise can have multiple, concurrent effects. For SKR, the combined effects of communication disruption and signal deception may further tax already endangered populations. Roads and road margins on and off reserves serve as dispersal corridors and refugia for SKR and other semifossorial taxa; these areas may therefore function as ecological traps if anthropogenic roadway noise negatively affects population persistence. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Suburban habitats and their role for birds in the urban-rural habitat network: Points of local invasion and extinction?
PY  - 2008
AB  - Suburban habitats in naturally forested areas present a conundrum in the urban-rural habitat network. Typically, these habitats contain less than half of the native woodland bird species that would exist at these sites if they were not developed. They also contain more total bird species than if these sites were left in a natural state. This apparent contradiction raises the question of \"How do suburban habitats function in the urban-rural habitat network?\" In this study, we analyze bird distributions on three rural-to-urban gradients in different ecoregions of the United States: Oxford, Ohio; Saint Paul, Minnesota; and Palo Alto, California. All three gradients exhibit similar patterns of extinction of native species followed by invasion of common species and subsequent biotic homogenization with urbanization. This patterning suggests that suburban land uses, those represented by the intermediate levels of development on the gradients, are a point of extirpation for woodland birds as well as an entry point for invasive species into urban systems. Furthermore, there are consistent patterns in the functional characteristics of the bird communities that also shift with intensifying urbanization, providing insight on the possible mechanisms of homogenization and community structure in urban ecosystems including an increase in the number of broods per year, a shift in nesting strategies, a decrease in insectivorous individuals, an increase in granivorous individuals, and a decrease in territoriality. Consequently, it appears that there are specific traits that drive the shift in community composition in response to urban and suburban land use. These results have significant implications for improving understanding of the mechanisms of suburban community ecology and conserving birds in urban habitat networks. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Planning an ecological network using the predicted movement paths of urban birds
PY  - 2013
AB  - In this study, we propose a new method for planning ecological networks in Gangdong-gu, Seoul, Korea. The basic idea of this method is that, in urban areas where the price of land is high, it is most cost-effective to protect linear green areas that act as ecological corridors for potential movement paths (PMPs) of wild animals. PMPs were identified by a path-finding algorithm (PFA) that selected the optimum routes with minimum travel costs between pairs of locations where individuals of the indicator species-great tits (Parus major)-were found during field surveys. The PFA created an imaginary line segment network that connects nodes separated by 30 m across the entire study area, and estimated the total travel cost of a route from one P. major location to another by summing the travel costs associated with all of the segments comprising that route. We assumed that the travel cost of each segment is the average of the inverses of the bird densities at the two end nodes. For each node, the bird density was estimated from the linear relationship between percentage vegetation cover and bird density, as observed during field surveys. The predicted PMPs showed a pattern that was highly concentrated on patches with relatively high vegetation cover. The preference of P. major for a few specific routes allowed us to easily identify ecological corridors in the study area. An ecological network plan that protects and/or restores areas along ecological corridors would greatly improve the ecological connectivity of fragmented habitats in highly urbanized areas. © 2012 International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering and Springer.

TI  - Identification of urban flight corridors for migratory birds in the coastal regions of Shenzhen city based on three-dimensional landscapes
PY  - 2021
AB  - Context: The rapid urban expansion in southern coastal regions of China can endanger the quality and connectivity of bird habits and thus challenge our capacity for protecting bird species in urban areas. Identifying the ecological corridors that allow migratory birds to and from urban green landscapes is therefore essential for conserving biodiversity in urban areas. Objectives: This study aimed to explore how urban expansion in vertical direction affects the flying paths of migratory birds and seek measurements to enhance bird migration to and from urban areas. Methods: The ecological security pattern (ESP) for migratory birds in a coastal region near the Shenzhen city of China was determined based on three-dimensional landscape data and results were evaluated against historical eBird record abundance data. Results: The positive agreement with historical bird abundance demonstrated that the consideration of three-dimensional landscape in parameterizing the resistance for ESPs can help identify the flight corridors for migratory birds in urban areas and the consequent sixteen key flight corridors with a total length of 454.78 km were identified in and around the Shenzhen city. Conclusions: The three-dimensional landscape data are essential for identifying flight corridors for migratory birds to and from urban landscapes. The extracted flight corridors in and around the Shenzhen city connected natural reserves with urban parks, thereby enlarging bird habitats and its conservation inside the Shenzhen city. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Quantitative evaluation of the rebuilding costs of ecological corridors in a highly urbanized city: The perspective of land use adjustment
PY  - 2022
AB  - Well-functioning ecological corridors are critical for conserving biodiversity in areas undergoing increasing habitat losses and ecosystem fragmentation. Although it is essential to rebuild broken corridors by land use adjustments, related discussions of spatially explicit delineations of to-be-adjusted lands and quantitative adjustment costs are rare. Based on a widely adopted minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, we simulated the potential ecological processes and identified ecological corridors in a rapidly urbanized city, namely, Nanjing, in eastern China. We then analysed the corresponding land use and cover changes (LUCCs) from 2000 to 2015 and quantitatively calculated the costs of rebuilding the indicated corridors based on the indication of the amount/spatial distribution of to-be-adjusted lands and their different standards of related adjustment. The results indicated that most obtained corridors were along continuous waters, but LUCCs still occurred within them; the spatial expansion of urban lands dominated, especially in the suburban areas and outer buffers of the ecological corridors. The rebuilding costs increased significantly, and urban land adjustments dominated these increases. Spatially, most costs were associated with suburban areas, and the costs increased obviously as the corridor width increased. Based on the comprehensive consideration of ecological suitability and economic rationality, we found that 200 m was the most appropriate width for rebuilding ecological corridors, as it can both meet the demands of local species and balance the local public budget. We explored methodologies used to identify potential ecological corridors and quantitatively evaluate the costs of rebuilding them, thus providing a basis for implementing practical and feasible land use adjustments addressing ecological suitability and economic rationality. © 2022

TI  - Bird communities in urban riparian areas: Response to the local- and landscape-scale environmental variables
PY  - 2019
AB  - Understanding how environmental changes driven by urbanization impact the biodiversity in urban riparian areas has great importance for landscape planning and river ecosystem conservation. There have been many studies on the response of bird communities to different environmental variables in urban parks; however, although supporting some of the highest bird diversities, case studies in urban riparian areas remain limited. In existing research, few studies have considered the impact of both local waterfront characteristics and surrounding environmental variables at a larger scale. In this study, we selected birds as the indicator to clarify their response to both localand landscape-scale environmental variables in riparian areas of Tsing river, Beijing, in terms of (a) vegetation composition, (b) human disturbance, (c) land cover, and (d) landscape connectivity. We hypothesized that birds with different biological characteristics may respond differently to environmental variables. Birds were then further grouped according to the habitat type, residential type, and feeding type. It turned out that the coverage of grass and the disturbance of pedestrians are the most influential variables. Besides, compared with the land cover and landscape connectivity, the total contribution of vegetation characteristics and human disturbance accounts for the main proportion of explained variance. Information pertaining to these environmental variables can provide evidence to support bird conservation efforts in urban areas, and the identified distance threshold provides a basis for future landscape connectivity assessments. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Evaluation and optimization of woodland ecological patterns for qingdao based on the agent-based model
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urban socio-economic development and urban spatial expansion has led to the loss and fragmentation of habitat. Global climate change adds to the gravity of these effects. The survival of wildlife species is subjected to enormous pressure due to natural environmental changes and human activities. Agent-based models (ABMs) are computer simulation models analyzing and simulating human or animal behavior through the integration of learning, adaptation, evolution and logical analysis. ABMs study the overall system characteristics by analyzing internal elements of the system (such as the interaction among individual agents, and agents with the environment) with a bottom-up approach. The agents in ABMs can complete given objectives, perceive and respond to changes of the external environment through the default logic control, and respond to stimuli from other agents and the external environment through learning and adaptation functions. This paper designed an agent-based evaluation model of an ecological pattern, which was used to analyze the impact of different woodland patterns on species survival and dispersal. The model focused on the logic control of survival and dispersal of agents, and used the dispersal strategy integrating CRW and LW models, which combines the advantages of these two models. The survival of the agent is control by the age-specified U-shaped survival curve and determination function considering their own energy and environmental risks. The model was developed on the GIS platform, realizing the seamless integration of the agent model and GIS, which could then be applied to real geographical environment simulation. Qingdao is a city located in the eastern coastal region of China where the economy is relatively well-developed. The region is also where marine and terrestrial ecosystems meet. Woodland is mainly distributed in the Laoshan Mountains in the east, the Daze Mountains in the north, and the Dazhu, Xiaozhu and Tiejue Mountains in the south. In the study area, the ecological environment is deteriorating, and various wildlife species are being impacted, with some species being endangered or facing extinction. This paper selected the woodlands in the Qingdao district as the study object, analyzing the effect of different spatial patterns on the survival and spread of woodland species. Simulation results showed that, compared with the original state, species populations and migration have improved significantly under different levels of ecological network framework, and the higher the level of ecological network framework, the more obvious the improvement. The distance between patches had a large influence on the dispersal of simulated species because they were not able to arrive at patches that were far away from the original patch. Therefore, this paper makes the suggestion that an approach integrating wetland and woodland systems could strengthen woodland system functional contact in the study area. It is suggested that the region around Jiaozhou Bay and the mainstream of Dagu River be used to increase the spatial distribution of woodland. Based on the simulation results, suggestions for the woodland ecological pattern construction are given below: (1) ensure that the large woodland can not be destroyed; (2) the wetland system district in the middle of Qingdao is an ideal place for a new woodland construction; (3) the ecological network framework can be used as a spatial reference for an ecological barrier to prevent the spread of urban land into woodland.

TI  - Landscape ecological risk assessment and ecological security pattern construction in landscape resource-based city: A case study of Zhangjiajie City
PY  - 2022
AB  - Regional ecological security is an important part of the healthy development of modern cities. Scientific understanding and evaluation of regional ecological risks and construction of ecological security pattern are conducive to comprehensively improving the level of regional ecological security. Based on the remote sensing interpretation data onto Gaofen-2 of Zhangjiajie City in 2019, this paper used GIS spatial analysis and Fragstats software to construct landscape ecological risk index, and analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of landscape ecological risk. And the minimum cumulative resistance model is used to construct resistance surface. At the same time, in order to intuitively reflect the magnitude of resistance encountered during species migration, this paper uses 9 natural protected areas as ecological sources, and selects six resistance factors including landscape ecological index, vegetation coverage, elevation, slope, distance from roads, and distance from waters calculate the resistance value. Combining the ecological source area and the minimum cumulative resistance value, Then we identified ecological corridors and ecological nodes, and finally built an ecological security pattern and proposed ecological security protection strategies. This paper takes Zhangjiajie city as an example to verify the function and effectiveness of the method. The results show that: (1) there are obviously spatial differences in landscape ecological risk in the study area, and the ecological risk presents a spatial distribution pattern of “the middle and surrounding areas are low, and the high value area generally extends along the Lishui River in a strip”; (2) Low, relatively low, medium, relatively high, and high ecological risks area account for 21.59%, 41.79%, 22.57%, 12.08%, and 1.98%, respectively, among which the relatively low ecological risk area account for the highest proportion and the high ecological risk area account for the lowest proportion. The order of high ecological risk area pressure is: Yongding District>Cili County>Sangzhi County>Wulingyuan District; (3) The research identifies 24 ecological corridors and 47 ecological nodes. The cumulative length of ecological corridors is 872. 35 km. And the spatial distribution characteristics of ecological corridors and ecological nodes are “three horizontal and four vertical” and “they are mainly distributed in the central and southern regions, and relatively few in the western and northern regions”; (4) The study area has formed an ecological security pattern consisting of 9 ecological sources, 47 ecological nodes, 24 ecological corridors and 3 ecological safety areas. On this basis, the protection strategy of ecological security is proposed to provide scientific guidance for the ecological environment construction of Zhangjiajie city. © 2022 Science Press.

TI  - Ant biodiversity and functional roles in fragmented forest and grassland ecosystems of the agricultural midwest, North America
PY  - 2017
AB  - Regional Ant Biodiversity of the Midwest The native grassland and forest ecosystems of the north-central United States – a region that is historically and culturally called “the Midwest” or “Midwestern United States” – are highly modified by agricultural and urban development (Figure 1.1). Most of the native grasslands in the western Great Plains were replaced by cultivation or are now managed as grazing lands (Samson & Knopf, 1994). In the Allegheny Plateau to the east, over a century of logging and mining in mixed oak and mesophytic forests continues until present despite gradual increases in second-growth forest (Strittholt & Boerner, 1995). The native beech-maple forests of the northern Till Plain are now dominated by intensive agriculture – largely corn and soybeans – with smaller areas of riparian forest, scattered woodlots, remnant prairies, or reconstructed grasslands (Medley et al., 1995; Renwick et al., 2008). Exurban expansion around the industrial cities of the Midwest continues to modify landscapes along urban corridors and the urban-rural fringe (Grimm et al., 2008). The resulting landscape mosaics of agricultural, natural, and urban ecosystems have sharp habitat gradients in vegetation structure and soil disturbance, resulting in ant species assemblages that are admixtures of habitat specialists and cosmopolitan generalists. The ants of the Midwest are well-described and comprise about 200 species, a relatively small fauna compared to those in the highly diverse tropics. Two valuable keys to the ants of Ohio (Coovert, 2005) and New England (Ellison et al., 2012) and a checklist of the Michigan ant fauna (Wheeler et al., 1994) provide estimates for species richness of the Midwest and neighboring regions. Ellison et al. (2012) recorded 132 species (32 genera) and estimates 153 species for the New England states. Similarly, Coovert (2005) documented 118 species (36 genera) in Ohio, with an estimated 178 species. Wheeler et al. (1994) noted 113 species (27 genera), 87 of which could be found in one large nature reserve (Talbot, 1975). The majority of the ant species of the Midwest fall into two subfamilies, Myrmicinae and Formicinae, with only a few species in subfamilies Dolichoderinae, Ponerinae, Amblyoponinae, Proceratiinae, and Dorylinae. Although we focus on the Midwest region, we draw upon studies from surrounding regions that have overlapping ant faunas. © Cambridge University Press 2017.

TI  - Grassland communites of urban open spaces in Bloemfontein, Free state, South Africa
PY  - 2013
AB  - Natural vegetation in urban environments is greatly impacted by human activities and it is in constant threat of degradation and destruction as a result of urbanization. This vegetation, although fragmented, serves an important ecological function and needs to be properly managed and conserved. Studies on urban vegetation are lacking in South Africa, with only a handful having been carried out since the end of the last century. This study was initiated to identify, classify and describe the grassland communities of the urban open spaces in Bloemfontein. Relevés were compiled in 61 sample plots, where species present and habitat information were recorded. Care was taken to restrict sample plots to vegetation in pristine condition, wherever possible, and severely degraded stands were avoided. A two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed two distinct major communities, seven communities and four sub-communities. Both detrended and canonical correspondence analyses indicated the vegetation units to be associated with soil texture and pH, although biotic factors such as overgrazing, burning and mowing also influence the composition of the vegetation. The proper management and conservation of urban open spaces requires in-depth knowledge of the spatial distribution, foristic, structural and functional compositions within the major vegetation types in this environment. The present study further contributed towards formulating ways for the proper management, utilization and functioning of the open spaces within the Bloemfontein area. Conservation implications: The Grassland Biome of South Africa is poorly conserved, mainly because of its status as an agricultural hub of the country. The preservation of natural and semi-natural forms of urban vegetation is important because such vegetation, although often disturbed and degraded, could form dispersal corridors between peri-urban and rural vegetation. © 2013.

TI  - Using the ecosystem services approach for better planning and conservation of urban green spaces: A Finland case study
PY  - 2010
AB  - Ecosystem services are vital for humans in urban regions. However, urban development poses a great risk for the ability of ecosystems to provide these services. In this paper we first address the most important ecosystem services in functional urban regions in Finland. Well accessible and good quality recreational ecosystem services, for example, provided by urban nature, are an important part of a high-quality living environment and important for public health. Vegetation of urban regions can have a role in carbon dioxide sequestration and thus in climate change mitigation. For instance, estimates of carbon sinks can be compared to total CO2 emissions of an urban region, and the municipality can aim at both increasing carbon sinks and decreasing CO2 emissions with proper land-use planning. Large and contiguous core nature areas, smaller green areas and ecological connections between them are the essence of regional ecological networks and are essential for maintaining interconnected habitats for species and thus biological diversity. Thus, both local and regional level ecological networks are vital for maintaining ecosystem services in urban regions. The impacts of climate change coupled with land-use and land cover change will bring serious challenges for maintaining ecosystem services in urban areas. Although not yet widely used in planning practices, the ecosystem services approach can provide an opportunity for land-use planning to develop ecologically sustainable urban regions. Currently, information on ecosystem services of urban regions is lacking and there is a need to improve the knowledge base for land-use planning. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Do levees support diversity and affect spatial turnover of communities in plant-herbivore systems in an urban landscape?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Valuable habitats in various spatial configurations are essential for maintaining biodiversity across highly fragmented urban landscapes. In a large-scale study, we explored the value of human-made structures – river levees – as valuable habitats that support large populations of plants and butterflies and affects the spatial turnover of species within an urban landscape. The most significant environmental variables affecting plant and butterfly populations on levees were also examined. The richness of native plant species was about 25% greater on levee transects than on control grassland transects. However, the richness and abundance of butterflies on levees were the same as on grassland sites. Among environmental factors, urban area cover negatively affected the richness of native plant species. Shrub cover decreases the richness and abundance of butterfly species. In addition, high mowing intensity had a negative influence on abundance. Community dissimilarity of plants on levees was affected by spatial variables. Our study is the first to highlight levees as significant habitats for plant and herbivorous insect persistence, and their potential function for plant dispersal. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Appraising Agroecological Urbanism: A Vision for the Future of Sustainable Cities
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>By the mid-century, urban areas are expected to house two-thirds of the world’s population of approximately 10 billion people. The key challenge will be to provide food for all with fewer farmers in rural areas and limited options for expanding cultivated fields in urban areas, with sustainable soil management being a fundamental criterion for achieving sustainability goals. Understanding how nature works in a fast changing world and fostering nature-based agriculture (such as low-input farming) are crucial for sustaining food systems in the face of worsening urban heat island (UHI) effects and other climatic variables. The best fit for the context is transformative agroecology, which connects ecological networks, sustainable farming approaches, and social movements through change-oriented research and action. Even though agroecology has been practiced for over a century, its potential to address the socioeconomic impact of the food system remained largely unexplored until recently. Agroecological approaches, which involve effective interactions between researchers, policy makers, farmers, and consumers, can improve social cohesion and socioeconomic synergies while reducing the use of various agricultural inputs. This review presents a timeline of agroecology transformation from the past to the present and discusses the possibilities, prospects, and challenges of agroecological urbanism toward a resilient urban future.</jats:p>

TI  - Road verges as invasion corridors? A spatial hierarchical test in an arid ecosystem
PY  - 2008
AB  - Disturbed habitats are often swiftly colonized by alien plant species. Human inhabited areas may act as sources from which such aliens disperse, while road verges have been suggested as corridors facilitating their dispersal. We therefore hypothesized that (i) houses and urban areas are propagule sources from which aliens disperse, and that (ii) road verges act as corridors for their dispersal. We sampled presence and cover of aliens in 20 plots (6 × 25 m) per road at 5-km intervals for four roads, nested within three localities around cities (n = 240). Plots consisted of three adjacent nested transects. Houses (n = 3,349) were mapped within a 5-km radius from plots using topographical maps. Environmental processes as predictors of alien composition differed across spatial levels. At the broadest scale road-surface type, soil type, and competition from indigenous plants were the strongest predictors of alien composition. Within localities disturbance-related variables such as distance from dwellings and urban areas were associated with alien composition, but their effect differed between localities. Within roads, density and proximity of houses was related to higher alien species richness. Plot distance from urban areas, however, was not a significant predictor of alien richness or cover at any of the spatial levels, refuting the corridor hypothesis. Verges hosted but did not facilitate the spread of alien species. The scale dependence and multiplicity of mechanisms explaining alien plant communities found here highlight the importance of considering regional climatic gradients, landscape context and road-verge properties themselves when managing verges. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Habitat resources, remnant vegetation condition and area determine distribution patterns and abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths in a fragmented urban landscape, south-west Western Australia
PY  - 2011
AB  - The creation of cities, towns and farms following European settlement of Australia has fragmented the original vegetation. Many native species that were previously widespread are now found only within isolated remnants of their original habitat. These relictual populations are at increased risk of decline and local extinction, so identifying the factors that determine their persistence is important for ongoing management and conservation. I compared the effects of site area, connectivity, vegetation condition and habitat resources on the presence, abundance and total number of species of butterflies and day-flying moths within 46 urban fragments of remnant vegetation in south-west Western Australia. Site area and vegetation condition were the dominant determinants of species presence: large sites with more undisturbed vegetation favoured 16 of 20 native species and only one (Geitoneura minyas) benefited from disturbance. Another nine species that were not sufficiently widespread or abundant to enable individual analysis were collectively more prevalent in larger sites. Resource quality and quantity dominated the patterns of site occupancy, consistent with habitat resources, not metapopulation effects, determining current distribution patterns. The total number of species at each site reflected the collective responses of the individual species: increasing with area and declining with vegetation disturbance. The effects of area and vegetation condition were not simply additive: disturbance had a far greater impact on small remnants. Restoration or maintenance of high vegetation condition will be essential to maintain regional species diversity and to prevent local extinctions of butterflies and day-flying moths, especially in small remnants. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Preservation of Nutmeg Tree (Myristica fragrans Houtt) used as Bogor's Local Culinary Ingredient for the Strengtheness of Urban Landscape Identity
PY  - 2020
AB  - Nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) is Indonesian native tree species originating from Maluku Island, especially Ambon and Banda. The spread of nutmeg in Bogor area can be traced back to the Dutch colonial period when different kinds of spices were traded across the Indonesian archipelago and beyond. Having this long history, nutmeg is now widely used in Bogor's culinary. At the national level, it has high economic value and become one of Indonesia's main export products. However, there is little research on nutmeg tree spatial distribution. The objectives of the study were : (1) identify the nutmeg trees spatial distribution in Bogor city (2) mapping the existence and identification of nutmeg trees conditions and growing environment. This research was conducted Bogor City from February - May 2018. The data was obtained through direct interview, study field, and study literature. Data collection is determined based on the distribution of nutmeg trees in Bogor City, and extinct status based on study literature. Furtehermore, the existence of nutmeg trees in Bogor collected used purposive and snowball technique. The results showed that a total of 108 nutmeg trees were found in all sub-districts of Bogor city. These trees grow in a variety of areas such as green corridor, public park, agriculture farm, riverbanks, yard, office park, and cemetery. The results of this study can be used as the basis for determining the preservation strategy and area for nutmeg conservation in Bogor city. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Landscape ecological assessment: A tool for integrating biodiversity issues in strategic environmental assessment and planning
PY  - 2007
AB  - To achieve a sustainable development, impacts on biodiversity of urbanisation, new infrastructure projects and other land use changes must be considered on landscape and regional scales. This requires that important decisions are made after a systematic evaluation of environmental impacts. Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity components, and for evaluating and visualising the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this paper was to develop methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and strategic environmental assessment in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional levels. In order to test developed methods, a case study was conducted in the region of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and the study area embraced the city centre, suburbs and peri-urban areas. Focal species were tested as indicators of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity in the landscape. Predictive modelling of habitat distribution in geographic information systems involved the modelling of focal species occurrences based on empirical data, incorporated in a landscape ecological decision support system. When habitat models were retrieved, they were applied on future planning scenarios in order to predict and assess the impacts on focal species. The scenario involving a diffuse exploitation pattern had the greatest negative impacts on the habitat networks of focal species. The scenarios with concentrated exploitation also had negative impacts, although they were possible to mitigate quite easily. The predictions of the impacts on habitats networks of focal species made it possible to quantify, integrate and visualise the effects of urbanisation scenarios on aspects of biodiversity on a landscape level. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Spatial distribution and environmental factors associated to phlebotomine fauna in a border area of transmission of visceral leishmaniasis in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: Mato Grosso do Sul has been undergoing a process of urbanization which results in loss of native vegetation. This withdrawal makes vectors of man and domestic animals closer, causing changes in the epidemiology of diseases such as American Visceral Leishmaniasis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the phlebotomine fauna and environmental issues related to the transmission of AVL in Ponta Porã, Mato Grosso do Sul, between 2009 and 2010. Methods. Vegetation of the urban area was evaluated by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). Results: The results showed that the phlebotomine fauna of the city consists of five species, especially Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz and Neiva, 1912), the vector of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. Predominance of males was observed. The insects were captured in greater quantity in the intradomicile. Lu. longipalpis was the most frequent and abundant species, present throughout the year, with a peak population after the rainy season. Vectors can be found in high amounts in forest and disturbed environments. Conclusions: The finding of Lu. longipalpis in regions with little vegetation and humidity suggests that the species is adapted to different sorts of environmental conditions, demonstrating its close association with man and the environment it inhabits. The tourist feature of Ponta Porã reinforces its epidemiological importance as a vulnerable city. The geographical location, bordering Paraguay through dry border, makes possible the existence of a corridor of vectors and infected dogs between the two countries. © 2014 de Andrade et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Assessment of urban green space based on bio-energy landscape connectivity: A case study on Tongzhou District in Beijing, China
PY  - 2019
AB  - Green infrastructure is one of the key components that provides critical ecosystems services in urban areas, such as regulating services (temperature regulation, noise reduction, air purification), and cultural services (recreation, aesthetic benefits), but due to rapid urbanization, many environmental impacts associated with the decline of green space have emerged and are rarely been evaluated integrally and promptly. The Chinese government is building a new city as the sub-center of the capital in Tongzhou District, Beijing, China. A series of policies have been implemented to increase the size of green urban areas. To support this land-use decision-making process and achieve a sustainable development strategy, accurate assessments of green space are required. In the current study, using land-use data and environmental parameters, we assessed the urban green space in the case study area. The bio-energy and its fluxes, landscape connectivity, as well as related ecosystem services were estimated using a novel approach, the PANDORA model. These results show that (1) in the highly urbanized area, green space is decreasing in reaction to urbanization, and landscape fragmentation is ubiquitous; (2) the river ecology network is a critical part for ecosystem services and landscape connectivity; and (3) the alternative non-green patches to be changed to urban, urban patches which can improve landscape quality the most by being changed to green, and conservation priority patches for biodiversity purposes of urban green were explicitly identified. Conclusively, our results depict the spatial distribution, fluxes, and evolution of bio-energy, as well as the conservation prioritization of green space. Our methods can be applied by urban planners and ecologists, which can help decision-makers achieve a sustainable development strategy in these rapidly urbanizing areas worldwide. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - The Structure and Composition of Puerto Rico's Urban Mangroves.
PY  - 2020
AB  - This study characterizes the structure and composition of mangrove forests across urban gradients in Puerto Rico. It then uses a suite of hydrologic, water chemistry, and land cover variables to test for the relative importance of urban intensity alongside flooding and water chemistry in explaining observed variability in forest structure and composition. Three separate statistical tests suggest a significant but limited influence of urbanness on forest composition and structure. In the most urban sites, the diameters of the largest trees were 27% larger, but all structural measurements were best explained by surface water chemistry, primarily nitrogen concentrations. Concentrations of ammonium and total Kjeldahl nitrogen best explained stem density, tree girth and canopy height. The most urban forests also contained 5.0 more species per hectare, on average, than the least urban forests, and simple regression suggests that urban metrics were the most powerful predictors of forest composition. The most urban forests were more dominated by Laguncularia racemosa, while both Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle were found to be less abundant in the most urban sites, a trend that may be linked to the influence of precipitation and tidal connectivity on porewater salinity across the urban gradient. In multiple regression, no statistical difference was detected in the importance of surrounding land cover, flooding, or water quality in explaining the variance in either composition or structural metrics. This suggests that while a given forest metric may be strongly linked to either land cover, water quality, or flooding, all three are likely important and should be considered when characterizing these forests. With more human dependents in urban areas, the provisioning of important ecosystem services may be influenced by land use variables in addition to the more commonly measured metrics of water chemistry and flooding. © 2020 by the authors.

PY  - 2007
AB  - We recorded the Slender-footed Tyrannulet in several urban parks and woodlots in the cities of Recife and Olinda, northeastern Brazil, between 2004 and 2006. All those areas are relatively close to Atlantic Forest fragments. We observed that the species is common in some of those places, apparently being well adapted to urban environments with abundant tree cover. This might be interpreted as an indication that such wooded places work as ecological corridors for this species, connecting forest fragments.

TI  - Butterfly biodiversity in the city is driven by the interaction of the urban landscape and species traits: a call for contextualised management
PY  - 2022
AB  - Context: Urbanisation is an environmental filter for many species that leads to community homogenisation, with a few species inhabiting isolated patches (e.g. public and private gardens and parks) embedded within the urban landscape. Promoting biodiversity in urban areas requires understanding which species traits allow species to survive the urban landscape. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess how species traits and landscape factors combine to allow species functional groups to live in the city. Methods: We used butterfly count data collected by volunteers in 24 gardens of Barcelona city, during 2018 and 2019. Species were clustered in functional groups according to their traits. We applied a multinomial choice model to test for the effect of the landscape on the different functional groups. Results: Three functional groups became prevalent in the city while a fourth, containing most sedentary specialist species, was filtered out. Although the observed groups had similar species richness, abundances varied depending on urban landscape characteristics. Specialist sedentary specialists and medium mobile species were all favoured by patch connectivity; while the presence of mobile generalist species was only enhanced by habitat quality. Our results indicate that butterfly communities are more diverse in highly connected gardens. Conclusions: Our study highlights the need of contextualised management with actions accounting for the species functional groups, rather than a management focused on general species richness. It demonstrates that urban landscape planning must focus on improving connectivity inside the city in order to diversify the community composition. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Developing and optimizing ecological networks for the towns along the three gorges reservoir: A case of Kaizhou new Town, Chongqing
PY  - 2017
AB  - Habitat fragmentation and loss have become the major threats to local biodiversity pro- tection and regional ecosystem integrity. Developing urban ecological networks and improving con- nectivity between habitats could facilitate energy and matter fluxes, species dispersal, genetic ex- change and many other ecological processes, and further relieve the ecological environmental cri- sis in cities. With rapid urbanization in the Three Gorges Reservoir region, natural area fragmen- tation and habitat loss are inevitable. Taking Kaizhou New Town as an example, our study built the urban ecological networks by least-cost path modeling and GIS technology in order to facilitate the establishment of native tree species. The best threshold for urban ecological networks was ob- tained by the verification from graph theory functioning index. Finally, the priority of habitat pro- tection and restoration was determined after evaluating the importance grades of patches/ connec- tivities. We set a native tree, Pterocarya stenoptera as a surrogate species and used the habitat suitability assessment values to build the cost surface for least-cost model by Linkage Mapper Toolist. The observed maximum seed dispersal distance (300 m) of P. stenoptera was used as the distance threshold for network analysis. 75 target patches were selected as habitat sources to de-velop networks. Under the 300 m distance threshold, 98 links were simulated for the network, and were grouped into six grades according to their importance values. We found the links with higher importance values almost all existed along the bank between the Pengxi River and Hanfeng Lake. Among these, the most important link was between Hanfeng Lake Park and Kaizhou Plan- ning Institute; the second important link was located on both sides of the highway bridge over the Pengxi River. The integral index of connectivity of the whole landscape would be reduced by 19.1% if the two links were removed. Additionally, we found that the importance of the link was not significantly correlated with the important values of the two patches that the link connected. Link importance may also relate to the shape and spatial location of patches. Based on these re- sults, we proposed some network improvement strategies. This study combined least-cost path analysis and a graph-theoretical algorithm and provided a scientific, reliable reference for plan-ning and construction of urban ecological networks. © 2017, editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

TI  - Habitat occupancy by riparian muskrats reveals tolerance to urbanization and invasive vegetation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Wildlife communities are being altered by rapid environmental change including habitat loss and fragmentation, urbanization, and spread of invasive species. To predict consequences of these anthropogenic changes to landscapes, it is necessary to identify not only species that are negatively affected, but also species that are unaffected or even thrive. We used occupancy modeling to examine the spatial distribution of muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) in riparian habitat within an agricultural region of east-central Illinois from 2007 to 2008. We examined whether site occupancy was related to local habitat conditions and anthropogenic landscape alterations including urbanization and dominance of invasive reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea). We sampled 90 study sites (200-m stream segments) for occupancy by muskrats based on presence of tracks, scat, and feeding sign. Per-survey detection probability was 0.79 (SE = 0.04) in 2007 and 0.76 (SE = 0.04) in 2008. Detection was related positively to Julian date and negatively to abundance of woody debris and emergent rocks. Site occupancy by muskrats was 0.59 (SE = 0.09) in 2007 and 0.69 (SE = 0.06) in 2008, a year with above-average precipitation. Occupancy was related positively to urban land cover surrounding sites, which could reflect higher baseflows and reduced risk from predation and trapping in urban areas. Occupancy was unrelated to site dominance by invasive reed canary grass, but muskrats occurred more often at larger, deeper streams and those with greater bank heights and less sandy bank soils. Turnover between years was driven by stream size and water availability. Muskrats exhibited tolerance to key aspects of environmental change, and muskrats might even be urban adapters when occupying riparian habitat that remains adequately connected in urbanizing landscapes. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.

TI  - Landscape heterogeneity of urban vegetation in Guangzhou
PY  - 2000
AB  - Seven indexes were used to study the landscape heterogeneity of vegetation in Guangzhou City. The results show that the patch density was 11.8 patches·km-2 and the line corridor density was 1.87km·km-2. In old urban area, the vegetation landscape was characterized by small patches, heavy fragmentation, high diversity and random distribution, showing a highly heterogeneous spatial pattern, while in new urban area, the vegetation landscape was characterized by big patches and even distribution. Therefore, when the size of vegetation area was the same, the even distribution of vegetation could improve the landscape heterogeneity and make the ecological function more effective.

TI  - Contributions of green spaces and isolated trees to landscape connectivity in an urban landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - Vegetation plays a fundamental role in conserving the biological diversity of urban areas. From isolated trees to multi-hectare patches, green spaces are critical to species conservation in urban landscapes. The abundance of green spaces can regulate the availability of habitat and resources for species’ survival. In many urban areas, the lack of vegetation inventories and ecological information at fine spatial resolutions limits conservation efforts. To evaluate the potential of very high-resolution imagery (WorldView-2, 30-cm resolution) to fill this gap, we sought to a) map contrasting urban vegetation cover types (grass, shrubs and woody vegetation) at the meter scale and with high accuracy, b) quantify the structural and functional connectivity of urban vegetation, and c) estimate the status of productive vegetation. We focused our analysis on land use and cover in the city of Xalapa in Veracruz, Mexico, and employed multiscale satellite imagery to estimate vegetation cover, connectivity, and health. We identified 38,579 patches of woody vegetation, of which 93 % corresponded to isolated trees contributing to 27 % of vegetation connectivity. Without woody vegetation, the connectivity index decrease up to 97 %; removing grass or shrubs would reduce connectivity by 38 % or 32 %, respectively. We identified 10 patches disproportionately important to connectivity, of which seven had some type of legal protection. Across vegetation types, 38 % of the vegetated area was unhealthy. Wooded element connectivity assessment at a fine spatial resolution is crucial to conserve and restore these key resources for biodiversity and human well-being in urban environments. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Multicriteria Evaluation of Transport Plan for High-Speed Rail: An Application to Beijing-Xiongan
PY  - 2019
AB  - Beijing has an enormous transportation challenge: to relieve the extreme congestion that has arisen, largely due to overpopulation. To meet this challenge, the city administration has decided to extend its territory; a new city will be planned and built. This new city, Xiongan, will reduce the burden on the capital. A new high-speed railway (HSR) line is designed to transport millions of people every day within less than an hour. This study applies the potential of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and multicriteria methods, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE II), to determine the best alternative of transportation for the new high-speed railway line between Beijing and Xiongan, comparing different ones. The methodology consists of two stages. In the first stage remote sensing datasets such as ASTER DEM and LANDSAT images and GIS software such as ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS have been used to determine settlement distribution, station location, elevation model, slope percentage, vegetation percentage, and route alignment for a new high-speed railway line for better understanding of its spatial distribution pattern over the study area. The second phase of the study focusing on assessing the various alternatives of transportation has been determined, and three approaches to choosing the best alternative have been introduced. In the paper we examine criteria associated with travel and economic criteria: travel time, the number of train stops, public satisfaction with transport, the number of seats per day, connectivity, operating costs, profit, and the payback period. Six alternatives of transportation have been studied. The stops in Guan and stations in the metro's rings have been investigated. In the second stage, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and PROMETHEE II methods have been used to select the best alternative. The first approach uses only criteria related to the trip, as the criterion to choose the best alternative is the maximum of the net outranking flows by PROMETHEE II method; the second approach applies two independent criteria: the ratio of normalized operating costs and the normalized net outranking flows, and the ratio of the normalized payback period and the normalized net outranking flows; the third approach includes all defined criteria, and the criterion of choosing the best alternative is the maximum of net outranking flows as calculated by the PROMETHEE II method. The approaches have been analyzed with the purpose of comparing the results. The result indicates that it is expedient to have a station in Guan, which will increase the connection and connectivity among the cities while providing fast mobility options for a large number of inhabitants of Guan city. Furthermore, the result from Remote Sensing and GIS analysis demonstrates that the proposed high-speed railway line will be environmentally sustainable and is economically/socially feasible and that it will certainly attract current and future passengers because of their needs. © 2019 Asim Farooq et al.

PY  - 2022
AB  - Alongside modernity, the human activity has been a key factor in global environmental risks, with worldwide anthropic modification being the cause of the emergence of diseases for wild and livestock animals, and even humans. In special, the increase in the spatial distribution and in the incidence of some emerging infectious diseases (EID) are directly associated to deforestation and global climate changes. Moreover, the arise of new EID agents, such as the SARS-COV-2 have been reported for the last 30 years. On the other hand, biodiversity has been shown to be a key indicator for ecosystem health, and to pose a role to increase the promotion of human public health. In neotropical regions, and in special, in Brazil, several infectious diseases have been demonstrated to be directly affected for the biodiversity loss, such as malaria, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, yellow fever, urban arboviruses, spotted fever, amongst other. To better understand the ecosystem capacity of regulation of infectious diseases, FAPESP BIOTA program have supported researchers and research projects to increase knowledge about Brazilian biodiversity and the ecosystems, such as diversity of bird bioagents, venomous animals biodiversity, diversity of mosquitos species in forest patches inside urban areas, propagation of the yellow fever virus over fragmented forest territories, loss of ecological corridors and occurrence of spotted fever and malaria, amongst others. It is noteworthy that FAPESP BIOTA is a successful program and must be expanded as an important tool for present and future public health promotion. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

TI  - Landscape connectivity and spatial prioritization in an urbanising world: A network analysis approach for a threatened amphibian
PY  - 2019
AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects amphibian populations worldwide. Urban expansion and associated infrastructure are a main cause of habitat degradation and loss of landscape-scale habitat connectivity. Mitigation measures such as underpasses and associated fences are implemented to reduce the impacts of development on protected species. However, such efforts focus largely on local outcomes rather than envisioning how mitigation may contribute to habitat connectivity and population persistence at the landscape scale. We used a graph-theoretic approach to model structural and functional connectivity for a widespread but declining pond-breeding amphibian, the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus). This involved assessing species movement among breeding ponds and associated landscapes with different levels of urban and rural development and linear barriers. We used recent regional pond survey data for great crested newts combined with published data on movement and habitat use to explore connectivity. Landscape connectivity was affected by factors such as habitat quality and quantity, scale of movement and different degrees of road permeability. Linear barriers to movement and differences in their permeability were critical for predicting their impact on both migratory and dispersal movements in Triturus cristatus. Incorporating landscape connectivity modelling which includes the impact of barriers such as roads would substantially improve population-level outcomes from mitigation schemes. An accurate understanding of the far-reaching consequences of road mitigation as well as immediate, local effects, combined with our methods of assessing road permeability could transform future mitigation efforts by directing action to places that not only improve individual survival but also maximise connectivity at the landscape-scale. © 2019

TI  - Regional Ecological Network Planningfor Biodiversity Conservation: A Case Studyof China’s Poyang Lake Eco-Economic Region
PY  - 2017
AB  - Ecological networks have been considered to be an effective strategy to counter habitat fragmentation, which is occurring in the urbanization context. Researchers and planners have begun to integrate ecological networks in both thematic planning and urban or regional planning for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. In this paper, we integrated the least-cost path model, network structure analysis, and gravity model to construct a regional ecological network of Poyang Lake Eco-economic Region, China. The least-cost model was improved by integrating three resistance factors, including land cover, slope, and human-induced pressure into it, presenting the landscape characteristics comprehensively in corridor simulation. The network structure analysis was employed to assess the proposed ecological network and the gravity model was used to identify the relative significance of network elements. Results indicated that the proposed hierarchical ecological network has good circuitry, complexity, and connectivity. Spatial analysis of prioritized network elements and breaking points revealed the regional connectivity condition, presenting significant reference to decision making in both land-use management and network implementation. Our study demonstrated that the integrated methodology is effective in regional ecological network planning and shows feasibility to be applied to other regions. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company.

TI  - Analysis of vegetation structure in urban land uses: Case of the city of Aydin
PY  - 2008
AB  - In urban areas, each land use type possesses its own vegetation characteristics. The purpose of this study is to determine the vegetation structure of land uses in Aydin urban area by means of vegetation cover analysis. Vegetation cover analysis is an indicator of different land uses' contribution to wildlife habitat value. In the analysis, the variables of 1) vegetation ratio, 2) vegetation cover naturalness level, and 3) vegetation cover structural diversity have been used. Results of the analysis indicated that in terms of sum of all variables, natural areas (93%) obtained the highest value followed by highways (76%), and low-density residential areas (67%). Riverbeds (45%), commercial areas (39%) and industrial areas (34%) received the lowest value. The results shows that natural areas are critical in maintaining the ecological qualities of urban environments; improvement of the open spaces in the increasing residential developments contribute to the urban open space system significantly; and ecological corridor alternatives such as roads and waterways presents opportunities in improving the urban ecosystems.

TI  - Occurrence, distribution, and risk assessment of pharmerciuticals in wastewater and open surface drains of peri-urban areas: Case study of Juja town, Kenya
PY  - 2020
AB  - The occurrence of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in the environment is becoming a major area of concern due to their undesirable effects on non-target organisms. This study investigated the occurrence and risk of contamination by five antibiotics and three antiretrovirals drugs in a fast-growing peri-urban area in Kenya, with inadequate sewer system coverage. Due to poor sewage connectivity and poorly designed decentralized systems, wastewater is directly released in open drains. Water and sediment samples were collected from open surface water drains, while wastewater samples were collected from centralized wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Solid-phase extraction and ultrasonic-assisted extraction for the aqueous and sediment samples respectively were carried out and extracts analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) using isotopically labeled internal standards. APIs were observed with the detection frequency ranging from 36% to 100%. High mean concentrations of 48.7 μg L−1, 108 μg L−1, and 532 μg L−1 were observed in surface drains for Lamivudine (3 TC), Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), Ciprofloxacin (CIP) respectively. Drain sediments also showed high concentrations of APIs ranging from 2.1 to 13,100 μg kg−1. APIs in this study exceeded those observed in existing literature studies. JKUAT WWTP removal efficiencies varied from −90.68% to 72.67%. Total APIs emission load of the study area was 3550 mg d−1 with WWTP effluent contributing higher loads (2620 mg d−1) than surface water drains (640 mg d−1). Zidovudine (ZDV), nevirapine (NVP), and trimethoprim (TMP) loads in drains, however, exceeded WWTP effluent. Low to high ecotoxicity risk of the individual APIs were observed to the aquatic environment, with high risks for the development of antibiotic resistance in microbiome as determined by the risk quotient (RQ) approach. Risk management through efficient wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment is necessary to suppress the measured concentrations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Assessing ecological interactions in urban areas using citizen science data: Insights from hummingbird–plant meta-networks in a tropical megacity
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanization is one of the most intensive threats to biodiversity worldwide. The rapid sprawl of urban settings often comprises a drastic landscape transformation due to the replacement of natural vegetation by impervious surfaces. However, cities can serve as critical refuges for some native fauna, particularly for pollinators. Here we used citizen data to contrast the structure of hummingbird-plant meta-networks across different greenspaces (natural protected areas, urban parks, urban gardens and street trees areas) in a tropical megacity. We compiled hummingbird-plant visitation records in Mexico City available in two citizen science resources: iNaturalist and eBird. We first determined whether the retrieved dataset was representative to estimate network metrics by calculating sample coverage and estimating species richness in different greenspaces. Then, we characterized network structure and plant importance for network organization according to plant origin, life form and pollination syndrome. We recorded 17 hummingbirds visiting 84 plant species, encompassing a total of 742 interactions. Natural protected areas and urban parks showed a higher richness of hummingbirds and plants. All networks had low levels of connectance, specialization, and nestedness. Modularity was significant across all networks with higher values in natural protected areas and urban gardens. Native and introduced plant species showed a similar contribution to network organization. Non-ornithophilous plants were most important in natural protected areas, while tree species were most important in street trees greenspaces. Our results provide evidence of generalization of hummingbird-plant networks in urban areas. Introduced species and non-ornithophilous plants were equally important for hummingbirds, suggesting an integration of alien plants with no specialized bird pollination traits into ecological networks in urban scenarios. Promoting conservation initiatives as pollinator gardens with key native species for hummingbirds across the city could contribute to the functional connectivity and restoration of ecological interactions in cities. © 2022

TI  - Urban greenspace composition and landscape context influence natural enemy community composition and function
PY  - 2014
AB  - Conservation research has historically been aimed at preserving high value natural habitats, but urbanization and its associated impacts have prompted broader mandates that include the preservation and promotion of biodiversity in cities. Current efforts within urban landscapes aim to support biodiversity and diverse ecosystem services such as storm water management, sustainable food production, and toxin remediation. Arthropod natural enemies provide biocontrol services important for the ecosystem management of urban greenspaces. Establishing habitat for these and other beneficial arthropods is a growing area of urban conservation. Habitat design, resource inputs, management, and abiotic conditions shape the value of greenspace habitats for arthropods. In general, larger patches with diverse plant communities support a greater abundance and diversity of natural enemies and biocontrol services, yet opposing patterns or no effects have also been documented. The surrounding landscape is likely a contributor to this variation in natural enemy response to patch-scale habitat design and management. Looking across rural-urban landscape gradients, natural enemy communities shift toward dominance by habitat generalists and disturbance tolerant species in urban areas compared to rural or natural communities. These changes have been linked to variation in habitat fragmentation, plant productivity and management intensity. In landscape-scale studies focusing solely within cities, variables such as impervious surface area and greenspace connectivity affect the community assembly of natural enemies within a patch. Given these findings, a greater mechanistic understanding of how both the composition and spatial context of urban greenspaces influence natural enemy biodiversity-biocontrol relationships is needed to advance conservation planning and implementation. © 2014.

TI  - Functional connectivity in urban landscapes promoted by Ramphastos toco (Toco Toucan) and its implications for policy making
PY  - 2018
AB  - The scarcity of green areas in urban landscapes hinders connectivity among sites reducing the flux of organisms and seed dispersal. Ramphastos toco is an effective plant disperser in tropical landscapes, playing an important role in conserving plant connectivity. In this study we combined two methods of landscape connectivity analysis, in a way not yet explored, to assess the potential contribution of Ramphastos toco to enhancing connectivity among urban vegetation patches. We used spatial modeling techniques to evaluate least cost routes, or those that facilitate bird movement through green urban areas, in Belo Horizonte, a city in Southeast Brazil. We also assessed the relative importance of forest patches for conserving both bird and seed dispersal fluxes using the integral index of connectivity. The resulting least cost route of greater accessibility for the species included in its course an important forest patch under environmental licensing for the construction of a residential condominium. The number of green urban areas covered by forest, of highest habitat quality for the species, summed to 155 patches. Of this total only 5.2% were relevant for regional connectivity, while the four most important patches are targeted by the city’s expansion plans. Ramphastos toco is an effective connector for tropical green urban areas given its adaptability, wide range of movement and seed dispersal effectiveness. We emphasize the need for incorporating ecological knowledge and the prioritization of green areas into city planning, since current expansion projects jeopardize forest patches that are crucial to the functional connectivity of the urban landscape.

TI  - Promoting wildflower biodiversity in dense and green cities: The important role of small vegetation patches
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The conservation and promotion of biodiversity in urban spaces has become a core concern in urban greening. As cities continue to densify, however, urban green spaces are becoming smaller and more isolated. Many hope that wildflowers, and with them also faunistic biodiversity, can be maintained through networks of small informal green spaces. Currently, there are little data available for city planners to answer the questions of how patch size and ecological connectivity affect the population persistence of wildflowers in small vegetation patches. To address these concerns, we surveyed all vegetation patches greater than 1 m2 in public spaces across seven 1 km2 quadrats distributed across the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Our survey focused on a list of 166 herbaceous vascular plant species. We analyzed vegetation patch topologies (frequency distributions of size and connectivity) and related it to alpha and beta species diversity. Dispersal traits of investigated species were used to interpret connectivity patterns. Over 75 % of patches were

TI  - The impact of land use change on habitat network: A case study of Egretta garzetta in Su-Xi-Chang Area
PY  - 2015
AB  - Habitat network as part of ecological networks is very important for species. Consequently, it is necessary to find out the impacts of land use change on habitat network as well as the dispersal and migration of species, especially in current rapid urbanizing condition. The research results will be a great contribution to rebuilding and optimizing regional ecological network from the perspective of species conservation and ecological process, but not only the landscape structure as most previous research did. The aim of the paper is to find out: (1) how to map out the habitat network of a certain species from TM images in a grid pattern? (2) How land use change affected the habitat network of the species, especially from the views of habitat patch and network structure? The Su-Xi-Chang Area of the Yangtze River Delta Area was selected as case study due to its rapid urban development and land use changes. In this research, the Egretta garzetta was selected as a regional representative species for the following three reasons: (1) marshland birds are the superior species among wild animals of the study area; (2) Egretta garzetta is the superior species among marshland birds which is on the list of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); (3) the data related to living and hunting habitats of Egretta garzetta in the study area are easy to get. Based on the study of the Egretta garzetta habitat, we developed a Conceptual Constraint Model of Species Habitat Patch (CCMSHP) and a method to select habitat patch properly from different land types. In CCMSHP, factors which affect the forming of species habitat were classified into three categories coarsely, which are physical, biological, and human disturbances. In each category, main specific constraints were obtained from previous results and transferred suitably from the calculation supported by the ArcGIS software. Based on the identified Egretta garzetta habitats, their habitat networks were accordingly developed. Then, landscape metrics and network structure indicators were applied to analyze the effect of land use change on the mapped-out habitat network. The results showed that: (1) the total area of patches suitable for Egretta garzetta’s living and hunting was increased during the period from 2000 to 2010; however, the quality of the habitat network was decreased seriously due to the strong negative effect of newly-built constructions, such as expressways and high-speed railways. (2) The habitat network of Egretta garzetta is only a small part of the whole area which consists of four separate fractions. They were Yixing-Liyang Part, Binhu Part, Wuzhong Part, and Yangchenghu Part and ranked down respectively, according to their conditions of 2000. During the recent ten years, these fractions have been seriously destroyed. Among of them, Yixing-Liyang Part was in the worst condition and then following by Binhu, Wuzhong and Yangchenghu Part. In a summary, during the past ten years, the condition of Egretta garzetta habitat environment was becoming worse; and the land use change has affected the survival of Egretta garzetta badly. We suggest that the protection both of high and low-level patches in hierarchy is important and it is necessary to identify and rebuilt those disappeared low-level patches to improve the quality of habitat network. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

TI  - Wildlife friendly roads: The impacts of roads on wildlife in urban areas and potential remedies
PY  - 2014
AB  - Roads are one of the most important factors affecting the ability of wildlife to live and move within an urban area. Roads physically replace wildlife habitat and often reduce habitat quality nearby, fragment the remaining habitat, and cause increased mortality through vehicle collisions. Much ecological research on roads has focused on whether animals are successfully crossing roads, or if the road is a barrier to wildlife movement, gene flow, or functional connectivity. Roads can alter survival and reproduction for wildlife, even among species such as birds that cross roads easily. Here we examine the suite of potential impacts of roads on wildlife, but we focus particularly on urban settings. We report on studies, both in the literature and from our own experience, that have addressed wildlife and roads in urban landscapes. Although road ecology is a growing field of study, relatively little of this research, and relatively few mitigation projects, have been done in urban landscapes. We also draw from the available science on road impacts in rural areas when urban case studies have not fully addressed key topics. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Bird community responses to habitat fragmentation: How consistent are they across landscapes?
PY  - 2005
AB  - Aim: The woodland ecosystems of south-eastern Australia have been extensively disturbed by agriculture and urbanization. Herein, the occurrence of birds in woodland remnants in three distinct landscapes was analysed to examine the effects of different types of landscape matrices on species richness vs. area and species richness vs. isolation relationships and individual species responses to woodland fragmentation. Location: The study system comprised three distinct woodland landscapes of the northern Australian Capital Territory and bordering areas of New South Wales. These landscapes (termed agricultural, peri-urban and urban) are located within 50 km of each other, have remnant fragments of similar age, size, isolation, woodland cover, elevation and climates. The major distinguishing feature of the three landscapes was the properties of the habitats surrounding the numerous woodland remnants. Methods: Bird surveys, using an area-search methodology, were conducted in 1999 and 2000 in 127 remnants in the three landscapes to determine bird species presence/absence. Each remnant was characterized by measures of remnant area, isolation and habitat complexity. To characterize differences between each landscape, we conducted an analysis of the amount of tree cover and human disturbance in each landscape using SPOT imagery and aerial photographs. Linear regressions of woodland-dependent species richness vs. remnant area and remnant isolation for the three different landscapes were calculated to see if there were any apparent differences. Binomial logistic regressions were used to determine the relationships between the occurrence of each species and the size and isolation of woodland habitat, in each landscape. Results: All the landscapes displayed a significant (P < 0.01) species vs. area relationship, but the slope of the urban relationship was significantly greater than those of the other landscapes. In contrast, only the agricultural landscape displayed a significant (P < 0.01) species richness vs. isolation relationship. When individual species were investigated, we found species that were: (1) apparently insensitive to reduction in remnant area and increase in isolation across all landscapes, (2) absent in small remnants in all landscapes, (3) absent in small remnants in all landscapes and also absent in isolated remnants in the agricultural landscape, (4) absent in isolated remnants in the agricultural landscape, and (5) absent in small remnants in the urban landscape. Threshold values (50% probability of occurrence) for area and isolation for individual species were highly variable across the three landscapes. Main conclusions: These results indicate that woodland bird communities have a varying response to habitat fragmentation in different landscapes. Whilst we cannot be sure how representative our chosen landscapes are of other similarly composed landscapes, these results suggest that the type of landscape matrix may have a considerable influence on how bird species are affected by woodland fragmentation in the region. For instance, the properties of a matrix may influence both the resources available in the landscape as a whole for different bird species, and the connectivity (dispersal of birds), between woodland remnants. We encourage further research that examines these hypotheses and argue that the management of the matrix should be included in conservation strategies for fragmented landscapes. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Effects of roads and adjacent areas on diversity of terrestrial isopods of Hungarian highway verges
PY  - 2017
AB  - Transportation infrastructure may be the most important driver of social and economic development, but it is a major cause of environmental change in landscapes. The main objective of this paper is to report road edge effects on isopods of Hungarian highway verges. We examined the isopod diversity along five highways (M0, M1, M3, M5, M7) while accounting for road edge proximity and the adjacent areas. Double-glass pitfall traps were set in a total of 15 sites and at three distances from the edge of the roads next to different types of adjacent areas. We found differences between ecological parameters of isopod communities in relation to adjacent areas as well as to road edge proximity. The highest diversity was observed near urban areas, while the lowest was near the arable fields. Isopod diversity increased with decreasing distance from a road. Species diversity of different types of verges based on adjacent areas varied strongly in relation to road edge proximity. A medium distance (40 m) from roads had a positive effect on species richness, while verges next to arable fields were the most species-rich habitats. The general conclusion of this study is that highway verges provided suitable environment conditions for generalist isopod species but may be a limiting factor for specialist isopods. Moreover, highway verges function as corridors for isopods. The proximity of roads and urban areas positively affected isopods, and verges close to roads and urban areas are considered as an attractive environment for isopods in heterogeneous roadside verges. © 2017 Institute of Zoology, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Resilient ecological networks: A comparative approach
PY  - 2019
AB  - Resilience is an overarching concept concerning the capacity of complex systems to react to severe crisis by self-organization, innovation and learning and to attain more robust settings than in the original condition. While the theory on resilience has exploded in the last decades, its operationalization is less practiced. A possible way out is the selection of appropriate variables able to measure the behaviour of a system, when it is subject to important stresses. Resilience has been applied to the study of socio-ecological systems, including ecological networks. Ecological networks can reconnect fragmented landscapes through a web of patches intertwined by environmental corridors. In this paper, we aim at assessing the resilience of two ecological networks designed for the towns of Nuoro and Sassari, Italy. The ecological networks are built on the ecological properties of two vegetal target species (i.e. Quercus ilex and Olea europaea) and their seed dispersal through the corresponding frugivorous animal vector species. We have studied the behaviour of the ecological networks under different types of attacks to the patches: at random or according to a deterministic choice. Our method allows to compare the dynamic pattern of resilience (i.e. along the process of elimination of patches) and to observe typical behaviour reported in other cases but also interesting peculiarities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - How peri-urban areas can strengthen animal populations within cities: A modeling approach
PY  - 2006
AB  - We explore the extent to which inner-city fauna can be enhanced by source areas in peri-urban zones as a response to a decreasing quality and size of green habitats within cities. The objectives were to get a better understanding of the interaction between animal populations of urban and peri-urban areas, and the role of urban green structures within this relationship, and to find out the extent to which peri-urban areas can contribute to urban animal populations. We illustrate the idea of peri-urban support by using a simulation model for individual animal movement, applied in a particular case-study with butterflies as model species. Results show differences in accessibility of inner-city areas between model butterfly species that differ in mobility. The impact of peri-urban individuals on populations of inner-city habitats differed among several peri-urban source-scenarios: the enlargement of the inner-city butterfly population by peri-urban individuals was determined as 7-36% for 'moderate dispersers' and 19-56% for 'good dispersers'. Results also show that well-connected habitat patches within existing urban green structures were more likely to be visited by peri-urban individuals than isolated habitat patches. We conclude that peri-urban nature areas, if large enough, can have a potentially positive influence on the presence of fauna in inner-city neighborhoods. In addition, results suggest that connectivity between inner-city and peri-urban habitat patches enhances contribution of peri-urban migrants to inner-city populations. By providing a range of different habitats, from inner-city up to peri-urban area, moderately mobile habitat specialists could better compete against the small set of successful habitat generalists that are increasing in urban environments all over the world. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Poor ecological quality of urban ponds in northern England: causes and consequences
PY  - 2015
AB  - The value of ponds in urban areas historically has been overlooked. While some recent studies have described considerable biodiversity in urban areas, it is unclear as to how far this extends to different urban habitats. The aims of this study were to determine the condition of 21 urban ponds in Bradford (northern England) and to quantify the connectivity of wetlands in the district. The study showed that macroinvertebrate and plant biodiversity was substantially lower than would be expected based on pristine reference sites. Of the 21 ponds surveyed, 15 were found to be classified as having very poor ecological quality, with 5 being classed as poor and just 1 was classed as moderate. The number of aquatic plant species found in the ponds ranged from 0 to 6 and the number of macroinvertebrate families found ranged from 4 to 13. It was suspected that the aquatic plant diversity was low due to management techniques such as the removal of emergent vegetation. The average distance to a wetland was found to be higher in urban areas (533 m) compared to rural areas (448 m) although this difference was small, which indicates that the low diversity found in urban ponds is likely due to habitat variables. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - What biodiversity for urban and periurban space ? Case of the city of Rabat
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban and peri-urban landscaped areas known as \"nature\" have long been designed as structuring amenity areas, meeting urban planning standards. Today, studies and research in the fields of landscape and urban ecology have developed new concepts for the creation, conservation and management of these spaces. The study undertaken in Rabat and its surroundings has highlighted the diversity of its ecosystems and the state of its biodiversity; it addresses the main problems related to the evolution of urban spaces and their peripheries. This study made it possible to highlight its landscape components and to establish an inventory of the habitats which characterize the urban and peri-urban space of Rabat, consisting of natural forests, artificial forestation, wetlands, meadows, parks and gardens thus forming the green corridor, support of the biodiversity of the urban environment. © 2020 Geo-Eco-Trop.

TI  - Urban expansion and its impact on the land use pattern in Xishuangbanna since the reform and opening up of China
PY  - 2017
AB  - Since the Chinese government carried out the reform and opening up policy, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture has experienced rapid urbanization and dramatic land use change. This research aims at analyzing urban expansion in Xishuangbanna and its impact on the land use pattern using combined methods, including radar graph, the gradient-direction method and landscape metrics. Seven land use maps from 1976 to 2015 were generated and analyzed, respectively. The results showed that urban and rubber expanded rapidly, while forest decreased during the last 40 years. The city proper, the county town of Menghai and the county town of Mengla showed the most significant and fastest urban expansion rates. In response to rapid urban expansion, land use types outside urban areas changed dramatically. In Jinghong and Mengla, urban areas were usually surrounded by paddy, shrub, rubber and forest in 1976, while most areas were dominated by rubber by 2015. With the development of Xishuangbanna, landscape diversity increased along urban-rural gradients, but decreased in some key urban areas. Urban expansion slightly reduced the connectivity of forest and increased agglomeration of rubber at the same time. Based on the analyses above, we moved forward to discuss the consequences of urban expansion, rubber plantations and land fragmentation. © 2017 by the authors.

TI  - Stormwater ponds promote dragonfly (Odonata) species richness and density in urban areas
PY  - 2018
AB  - The loss of global biodiversity is one of the major challenges of our time and urbanisation is seen as a main cause of this. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for Odonata in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on dragonfly species richness and density of 35 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 35 control ponds (CONTROL). Our study revealed significant differences in environmental conditions between STOPON and CONTROL. At the habitat level, STOPON were larger, had a warmer microclimate, and lower concentrations of phosphate. STOPON were predominantly situated in suburbs, while CONTROL occurred mostly in rural areas. Accordingly, at the landscape level, STOPON had greater cover of built-up area as well as a lower cover of arable land and woodland. In line with this, the dragonfly assemblages at STOPON and CONTROL differed. Overall species richness was greater at STOPON than at CONTROL, and indicator species were only identified for STOPON. Especially threatened species benefited from STOPON, having higher species richness as well as higher adult and exuviae densities than CONTROL. In conclusion, our study shows that stormwater ponds in urban areas play an important role in the conservation of dragonflies in general and threatened species in particular. At STOPON, as a result of regular management, the habitat quality was high and compensated for the low landscape quality stemming from significant urbanisation effects. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Corridors, local food resources, and climatic conditions affect the utilization of the urban environment by the Black-headed Gull Larus ridibundus in winter
PY  - 2010
AB  - Black-headed Gulls Larus ridibundus (BHGs) in urban areas are a public nuisance. The aim of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the occurrence and abundance of the BHG foraging in urban areas in winter. The study was conducted in the city of Krakow (southern Poland) in four easily identifiable urban habitats: (1) areas with blocks of flats, (2) areas with congested housing, (3) detached single-family housing and (4) green areas. In each of these four habitats, 60 small (1-ha) plots were randomly chosen, and the bird's presence and abundance were noted. Results revealed that birds occurred most frequently and in the largest numbers in plots with blocks of flats and green areas as well as plots located close to rivers and water reservoirs. This highlights the importance of ecological corridors and stepping-stones for the presence of this species in the city. Food resources had no effect on the presence of the gulls but the abundance of the species was positively correlated with the number of litter-bins. This indicates that local food resources could be more important than large landfills for this species in urban habitats during winter. No human disturbance indices had an effect on the occurrence and abundance of the BHG. Higher temperature and lack of snow cover positively affected utilization of the urban habitats by the species that indicates that global warming may speed up synurbanization of the BHG. To control the number of BHGs in urban areas, we suggest preventing access to local food resources by placing litter bins with waste baskets that are inaccessible to animals. Also, the public should behave appropriately towards gulls and refrain from feeding them intentionally. © The Ecological Society of Japan 2009.

TI  - Gap-crossing decisions by forest birds: An empirical basis for parameterizing spatially-explicit, individual-based models
PY  - 2002
AB  - Spatially-explicit, individual-based models are increasingly used to evaluate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on habitat use and population persistence. Yet, they are criticized on the basis that they rely on little empirical data, especially regarding decision rules of moving individuals. Here we report the results of an experiment measuring the gap-crossing decisions of forest birds attracted to a recording of chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) mobbing calls, and provided with options to travel to the speaker by either crossing an open area (short cut) or taking a longer route under forest cover (detour). We performed the experiment in winter and late summer near Québec City, Québec, Canada. We recorded 1078 travel paths from 6 resident and 12 migratory species in 249 experimental sites. In both seasons, birds preferred to travel under forest cover rather than cross open areas, even when the forested detour conveyed a substantially longer route than the short cut in the open. Only when the detour under forest cover. This was considerably longer than the short-cut in the open, in both relative and absolute terms, were birds more likely to take short cuts, indicating that gap-crossing decisions are scale dependent. However, birds rarely ventured > 25 m from forest edges despite having the opportunity to do so. Except for Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) which ventured further into the open, all species showed similar gap-crossing decisions. Residents remained marginally closer to forest edges in late summer as compared to in winter. Conspecific group size had no influence on gap-crossing decisions. This experiment supports the hypothesis that forest bird movements are constrained in fragmented landscapes, and provides opportunities to calibrate spatially-explicit, individual-based models addressing the influence of landscape composition and configuration on dispersal.

TI  - What shapes plant and animal diversity on urban golf courses?
PY  - 2018
AB  - Recent concern over increasing loss of biodiversity has prompted considerable interest in the role of urban green spaces as reservoirs of local biodiversity. This study assessed the diversity of three indicator taxa - plants, ants and birds - on golf courses spanning a wide range of environmental variation in terms of climate, elevation, course age, size and connectivity to native woodland. Species richness and community composition was further compared between contrasting on-course habitat types that reflect different management intensities. We identified a set of taxon-specific environmental correlates indicating an intricate interplay of landscape- and local-scale variables that affect local species diversity. Our results show that floristic diversity is positively associated with the amount of rainfall, whereas ant and bird diversity are related to local-scale factors, particularly the number of trees and the size of water features on a site. The amount of on-course native habitat was a strong predictor of plant and ant diversity and was also associated with the number of unique species at the site level; this reinforces the value of remnant habitat patches as local biodiversity reservoirs that represent mini hot-spots in an otherwise species-poor urban landscape. Community composition for all three taxa differed markedly between non-playing and playing areas, with boundary and remnant habitats generally having more diverse, species-rich communities. Our results suggest that local floral and faunal biodiversity on urban golf courses can be enhanced by creating woody non-playing areas and, especially, by preserving, restoring or expanding remnant habitats. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Town avenues as flight corridors for Long-eared Owls (Asio otus)
PY  - 2020
AB  - During winter, Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) usually roost in groups in urban areas, but their nocturnal movement patterns are less known. The aim of our study is to provide insight into the local-scale urban movement habits of Long-eared Owls. Our study was carried out between 2015 and 2019 in the autumn and winter period, by observations in the early evening and by ringing and recapture of owls in the town of Sombor (NE Serbia). We observed owls when leaving the roosting site located in the town centre following the greenery of the larger avenues towards the outskirts. Owls were sporadically observed in densely built areas of the town, narrow streets with less greenery. Ringing and recapture data suggest that owls were closely linked to the green corridors. They probably used these corridors for easier orientation and to prey on birds roosting in trees in the town, such as sparrows (Passer domesticus, P. montanus), Common Blackbirds (Turdus merula) or Fieldfares (T. pilaris) appearing in harsh winters, and sometimes also pigeons. © 2020 Thomas Oliver Méro et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

TI  - Contrasting patterns in species richness of birds, butterflies and plants along riparian corridors in an urban landscape
PY  - 2012
AB  - Aim Urbanization is a major driver of global land-use change, substantially modifying patterns of biodiversity. Managing these impacts has become a conservation priority. The creation and maintenance of greenways, such as river corridors, is frequently promoted as a strategy for mitigating habitat fragmentation in urban areas by bringing semi-natural habitat cover into city centres. However, there is little evidence to support this assertion. Here, we examine whether riparian zones maintain semi-natural habitat cover in urban areas and how species richness varies along such zones. Location Sheffield, Northern England. Methods Multiple taxonomic groups (birds, butterflies, plants) were surveyed at 105 sites spanning seven riparian corridors that transect the study system. For all groups, we model the relationships between species richness and environmental variables pertinent to an urban system. To test whether riparian zones can act to maintain semi-natural habitats within a city, we modelled the proportion of semi-natural land cover within 250m grid squares that do, and do not, contain a river. Results Species richness varied markedly in relation to distance from the urban core. Trends differed both between taxonomic groups and between rivers, reflecting the complex patterns of environmental variation associated with cities. This suggests that biodiversity surveys that focus on a single group or transect cannot reliably be used as surrogates even within the same city. Nonetheless, there were common environmental predictors of species richness. Plant, avian and butterfly richness all responded positively to Habitat Diversity and the latter two declined with increases in sealed surface. Main conclusions Multiple transects and taxonomic groups are required to describe species richness responses to urbanization as no single pattern is evident. Although riparian zones are an important component of the mosaic of urban habitats, we find that river corridors do not disproportionately support tree and Natural Surface Cover when compared to non-riverine urban areas. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Habitat connectivity shapes urban arthropod communities: the key role of green roofs
PY  - 2014
AB  - The installation of green roofs, defined here as rooftops with a shallow soil cover and extensive vegetation, has been proposed as a possible measure to mitigate the loss of green space caused by the steady growth of cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition (beta diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for specific spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of high-mobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while low-mobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more influenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping high-mobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, low-mobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of low-mobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for low-mobility species.

TI  - Bird community structure is driven by urbanization level, blue-green infrastructure configuration and precision farming in Taizhou, China
PY  - 2023
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) changes and high urbanization rates are the main drivers of avian habitat loss in developing countries. However, few studies have examined the effects of urbanization intensity on avian diversity distribution and its importance in guiding eco-friendly urban planning. We surveyed bird distribution (n = 67 species) in different seasons using local ecological knowledge (LEK) and transect line methods in Jiangyan District from July 2018 to May 2019. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the effects of urbanization levels on birds relative density and richness during spring-summer (breeding season) and autumn-winter seasons (non-breeding season). Generalized linear models (GLM) were identified for the landscape composition and configuration that drive relative density and richness in native bird communities. Using redundancy analysis (RDA), we identified the landscape composition and configuration factors affecting bird foraging and roosting at urbanization levels. The results showed high dependency of waders and granivores on paddy fields and dry arable land respectively during the breeding season. During non-breeding season, wetland abundance, land cover, connectivity and total area of BGI were important habitat factors in attracting birds. Moreover, the landscape composition and configuration factors of BGI: wetlands as well as farmland habitats, are the main environmental cues that influence bird foraging. Therefore, to increase habitat suitability over landscape matrix, we propose creation of multiple waterbodies and green corridors of variable types and sizes on natural patches to improve the connectivity of ecological network. We also recommend land management interventions in farmland ecosystems, which could contribute to natural habitat restoration and improve bird biodiversity in urban areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Habitat selection in a peri-urban area by a large mammal indicates a low potential for human-wildlife conflict
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract: Context: In Australia, various species of macropods (family Macropodidae) are known to occur within peri-urban areas, where they can be a source of human-wildlife conflict. Some species, such as the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), have received considerable research attention over the past few years following demands from land managers for evidence-based management guidelines; however, the ecology of other macropod species found in peri-urban areas, such as the eastern wallaroo (Osphranter robustus robustus), remains poorly understood. Aims: The aims were to determine the home range of male and female eastern wallaroos and assess habitat selection in order to define whether wallaroos in a peri-urban environment should be viewed as thriving ('matrix-occupying'), persisting ('matrix-sensitive') or struggling ('urban-sensitive'). Methods: Home range and habitat use of six adult male, five adult female and one subadult male eastern wallaroo were investigated using GPS telemetry between October 2017 and May 2018 in the south-west of Sydney. Key results: Home ranges (mean ± s.e.) of males (63.1 ± 10.2 ha) were significantly larger than those of females (31.1 ± 3.3 ha). Every adult wallaroo had highly overlapping monthly home ranges, indicating strong site fidelity in all individuals. Eastern wallaroos selected habitats based on vegetation composition during the night and canopy cover during the day. Grassland and open native woodlands were preferred during foraging activities at night. By contrast, human-modified habitats, including hard surfaces and lawns, were avoided at all times by all individuals. Conclusion: The results indicate that eastern wallaroos avoid human-modified features in the landscape, so they could be viewed as persisting ('matrix-sensitive') in peri-urban areas. Implications: Compared with matrix-occupying macropods, such as the eastern grey kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo is less likely to cause human-wildlife conflicts-a result of its avoidance of human-modified habitat. Land-use planning, involving green corridors linking remnant vegetation, should be implemented as part of urban planning to enable the persistence of diverse mammal populations in urban areas, particularly matrix-sensitive species. © 2020 CSIRO.

TI  - Evaluation of landscape connectivity at community level using satellite-derived NDVI
PY  - 2013
AB  - Landscape connectivity, defined as the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches, has been considered to be a key issue for biodiversity conservation. However, the use of landscape connectivity measurements has been strongly criticised due to uncertainties in the methods used and the lack of validation. Moreover, measurements are typically restricted to the population level, whereas management is generally carried out at the community level. Here, we used satellite imagery and network metrics to predict the landscape connectivity at community level for semi-natural herbaceous patches in an urban area near Paris (France). We tested different measurement methods, both taking into account and ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of matrix resistance estimated by the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), and quantifying the link strength between patches with the shortest path and flow metrics. We assessed the fit of these connectivity predictions with empirical data on plant communities embedded in an urban matrix. Our results indicate that the best fit with the empirical data is obtained when the connectivity is estimated with the flow metric and takes into account the matrix heterogeneity. Overall, our study helps to estimate the landscape connectivity of urban areas and makes recommendations for ways in which we might optimise landscape planning with respect to conservation of urban biodiversity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Evaluation and construction of wetland ecological network in Qingdao City
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urban socio-economic development and spatial urban expansion has led to the loss and fragmentation of habitat. Global climate change adds to the gravity of these effects. An ecological network describes a network of habitats and connecting corridors that is mapped using habitat suitability and land use/ land cover data. Connectivity within a habitat network ensures a flow of material, energy and information among the various patches, and allows species-movement from inappropriate to appropriate areas. This ensures the abundance of species reaches a dynamic equilibrium at the network level and also means that the disappearance of species from any particular patch does not change the function of the regional ecosystem network. Thus, management of ecological network is an effective measure to counter the loss of biodiversity caused by reductions in habitat quality and area, as well as habitat fragmentation, in the context of rapid urbanization and climate change. The least cost path method is a way to construct and analyze ecological networks based on landscape spatial structure and dynamic biological processes. Based on the understanding that the characteristic of the matrix is one of the important factors determining the movement of species between patches, the least cost path method gives different cost values to different landscape types, and generates a cost surface to substitute the Euclidean space. Therefore, the dispersal paths generated by the least cost method are similar to those of actual species movement. Qingdao city is located in the eastern coastal region of China where the economy is relatively well-developed. The region is also where marine and terrestrial ecosystems meet. In this paper, we propose a wetland ecological network in the Qingdao district based on remote sensing and geographic information systems technology. We evaluate the overall structure of the network and the importance of individual patches using the correlation length index and betweenness centrality index, and use the findings to identify optimal strategies and make recommendations. In this paper, we discuss the following five questions: (1) How to classify landscapes? (2) How to determine the cost value of each landscape type? (3) How to evaluate the importance of each core patch? (4) How to evaluate the importance of stepping stones? (5) What is optimal management strategy for the wetland systems in the study area? The result shows that the network connectivities are very different in terms of threshold levels of path cost. Core patches in Jiao Zhou bay wetlands and Da Gu river have a relatively high degree of importance. Stepping stone patches with a high degree of importance are found in two zones: one comprising Jiao Zhou bay, Jiao Lai river and Wei He river estuary, and the other comprising Jiao Zhou bay and Ding Zi bay. In this paper, we propose a wetland management plan based on an ecological network including one core area, two axes and a ring in Qingdao and its surrounding area, to provide a scientific and quantitative basis for the selection of urban development sites within Qingdao City that simultaneously achieves wetland ecosystem protection. These network construction and evaluation methods can be used for other ecological network analysis.

TI  - Temporally stable and distinct fish assemblages between stream and earthen stormwater drain reaches in an urban watershed
PY  - 2017
AB  - Streams and rivers have essential roles in landscape connectivity; however, urban watersheds are frequently modified to drain stormwater from urban areas. To determine whether an earthen stormwater drain in an urban landscape provides fish habitat temporally, we compared the fish assemblage among three reaches of a contiguous urbanized watershed in Kanata, Ontario, Canada. Watts Creek is connected to an earthen municipal surface stormwater drain (herein Kizell Drain), before discharging into the Ottawa River. We delineated transects in three reaches of the system, in Watts, in the Drain, and below their confluence (Main) and assessed the fish community using single-pass electrofishing repeated across eight months covering all seasons. Fish community composition was compared among reaches using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutated multivariate analyses of variance (perMANOVA). Sign association tests identified indicator species driving assemblage patterns among reaches. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to assess the influence of physical characteristics of the transects on fish assemblage structure. Finally, fish assemblage measures were separated by month and temporal comparisons of fish assemblage were performed with NMDS and perMANOVA. Over the year, fish assemblages were distinct among the three reaches, and appear to be significantly influenced by temperature, undercut banks, and riparian vegetation type. Biotic homogenization in the Drain can be attributed to degraded physical features associated with channel modification in stormwater drains. Despite management and jurisdictional differences between streams and stormwater drains, evidence that earthen stormwater drains can maintain fish assemblages temporally demonstrates their biological potential and need to be considered as interconnected fish habitat elements within the overall watershed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Structure optimization of circuit theory-based green infrastructure in Nanjing, China
PY  - 2018
AB  - The connectivity of urban green infrastructure (UGI) can significantly improve the biodiversity and sustainable development ability of cities, which is of great significance to maintaining the health and stability of urban ecosystems. In the present study, we used circuit theory to map the landscape connectivity of UGI in the main urban area of Nanjing and identify the important patches and corridors according to current density, and then used a search window to detect barriers and to develop a landscape connectivity optimization strategy for Nanjing. 1) Habitat fragmentation in the main urban area of Nanjing was significant. The total area of the patches was about 70.45 km2, and 40% of patches area had a low contribution to connectivity. The southern part of the study area exhibited the best landscape connectivity, followed by the middle and northern parts. In the south, numerous corridors clustered into net structure, and the network structure is complex. In the middle of the study area, the Qinhuai River mainly formed a circular corridor. Relatively few corridors were observed in the northern part of the study area, and the patches were isolated. 2)There were 155 barriers in the study area, and 84.5% of those barriers were >5 hm2, so the landscape connectivity in the main urban area of Nanjing can still improve greatly. Although many methods have been developed and used for predicting connectivity, circuit theory has rarely been used to map connectivity in urban areas. The present study demonstrates how circuit theory can be used to map connectivity in complex landscape and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning, which is an advance in mapping the landscape connectivity of UGI. The circuit theory incorporates all possible pathways and combines structural and functional corridors, which improves corridor redundancy and provides an efficient and cost-effective tool for mapping UGI landscape connectivity. The results of this study provided an important reference for Nanjing UGI networks. © 2018 Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Water and nitrogen shape winter annual plant diversity and community composition in near-urban Sonoran Desert preserves
PY  - 2021
AB  - Increased nitrogen (N) deposition threatens global biodiversity, but its effects in arid urban ecosystems are not well studied. In addition to altered N availability, urban environments also experience increases in other pollutants, decreased population connectivity, and altered biotic interactions, which can further impact biodiversity. In deserts, annual plant communities make up most of the plant diversity, support wildlife, and contribute to nutrient cycling and ecosystem processes. Functional trade-offs allowing coexistence of a diversity of annual plant species are well established, but maintenance of diversity in urban conditions and with increased availability of limiting nutrients has not been explored. We conducted a 13-yr N and phosphorus (P) addition experiment in Sonoran Desert preserves in and around Phoenix, Arizona, USA to test how nutrient availability interacts with growing season precipitation, urban location, and microhabitat to affect winter annual plant diversity. Using structural equation modeling and generalized linear mixed modeling, we found that annual plant taxonomic diversity was significantly reduced in N-enriched and urban plots. Water availability in both current and previous growing seasons impacted annual plant diversity, with significant interaction effects showing increased diversity in wetter years and greater responsiveness of the community to water following a wet year. However, there were no significant interactions between N enrichment and water availability, urban location, or microhabitat. Lowered diversity in urban preserves may be partly attributable to increased urban N deposition. Changes in biodiversity of showy species like annual wildflowers in urban preserves can have important implications for connections between urban residents and nature, and reduced diversity and community restructuring with N enrichment represents a challenge for future preservation of aridland biodiversity. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America

TI  - Diversity and distribution of anurans from mata das flores state park, espÍrito santo, southeastern brazil
PY  - 2019
AB  - The scarcity of information on anurans to many areas makes it difficult to delimit new conservation areas with higher relevance to the taxa, and therefore, knowledge of community composition and the study of ecological specialties are of fundamental importance for the conservation of the biodiversity. We studied the anuran community of Mata das Flores State Park (MFSP), located in the municipality of Castelo, Espirito Santo state, Southeastern Brazil, evaluating the richness, composition, abundance, and distribution of anurans species. We sampled the MFSP from March/2017 to January/2018, with four occasions during this time period. We performed sampling at night in six plots of 250 meters distributed along the MFSP area, three plots in flooded environments and three plots in forest environments. We sampled the anurans using the active search method, with visual and auditory sampling. During each transect, the plot was surveyed by two observers. We recorded 226 individuals from 18 species of anurans, distributed in six families. The composition and abundance of the anuran species differed between the plots located near the flooded areas and those located in forest areas of the MFSP. Our study is the first to provide data from the MFSP anuran community and our results point to a worrying scenario for the biodiversity of the area, due to the diverse anthropic impacts and presence of the exotic species Lithobates catesbeianus. The Park is an important forest fragment, being continuous to the ecological corridor Pedra Azul - Forno Grande, but it is the conservation unit that suffers the most impacts due to its proximity to urban areas. Thus, long-term studies are necessary, mainly to quantify and evaluate the effects of these impacts on local fauna. © 2019, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analysis of the distribution of forest specialists in an urban-fragmented landscape (Madrid, Spain): Implications for local and regional bird conservation
PY  - 2004
AB  - Management strategies for the regional conservation of forest birds sometimes do not consider explicitly their applicability to areas with different degrees of urbanization. I studied the spatial and temporal distribution of forest passerines in wooded parks in the city of Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons to identify factors relevant to local conservation, and compared these results to previous studies in rural-fragmented forests in central Spain to derive recommendations for local and regional management guidelines. Five independent factors were considered: park size, isolation, density of potential corridors, vegetation structure, and pedestrian rate as an indicator of human disturbance within parks. Species richness and species temporal persistence was positively influenced by park size, shrub and tree cover, number of shrub and tree species, number of thick tree trunks, and negatively by the number of thin tree trunks. Species turnover was negatively affected by park size, such that the temporal persistence of species was enhanced in large parks. The pattern of guild assembly was not random but nested (parks with few species were subsets of progressively richer parks); the accumulation of species being affected mainly by park size and human disturbance, and to a lesser degree by isolation and vegetation structure. With regard to the spatial distribution of individual species, park size and vegetation structure positively influenced five species each, whereas isolation and human disturbance negatively influenced two and one species, respectively. Fragment size and habitat structure were the most relevant factors affecting species richness of forest specialists in both rural and urban fragmented landscapes; therefore, regional conservation strategies to protect these species may also be applicable to urbanized areas in central Spain. However, some specific recommendations should be considered in urban and suburban landscapes: (1) habitat quality ought to be enhanced to meet specific habitat requirements, particularly in large parks; (2) the mechanisms and rates of dispersal of forest birds through the urban matrix should be further studied to improve the movements between regional and local populations; and (3) species-specific variations in tolerance to pedestrians and thresholds levels of human visitation within parks should be determined to minimize human disturbance effects. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effectiveness of corridor vegetation depends on urbanization tolerance of forest birds in central Tokyo, Japan
PY  - 2016
AB  - Vegetation corridors, such as street trees in urban areas, which connect patchy woodland and mitigate habitat isolation, are expected to enhance the persistence of birds in urban landscapes. However, the effectiveness of urban corridors on birds remains equivocal because vegetation corridor is often managed for human use with little consideration of wildlife. Here we compared the effects of three major corridors of varying vegetation structures (trees with a dense understory, trees with a sparse understory, and grassy areas with sparse trees) on the species richness and abundance of birds in 21 wooded patches in the center of Tokyo, Japan, during wintering and breeding seasons. Using generalized linear models and Akaike's information criterion, we found that the effectiveness of corridors depended on the tolerance of birds to urbanization. Urban avoider species, having low tolerance to urbanization, demonstrated lower species richness and abundance in patches close to the corridor with a sparsely vegetated understory as compared with patches close to the understory-richer corridors during winter, although such an effect disappeared during the breeding season. The corridors did not have a significant effect on suburban adapter species with a high tolerance to urbanization. Our results suggest that corridors with scarce understory vegetation may limit the persistence of birds avoiding urban areas. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Analysis of the contribution of linear parks in urban flood control
PY  - 2012
AB  - Historically, drainage systems designed for flood management in urban areas have been focused in conveyance structures for efficient water removal. These solutions often included channelization of water bodies and elimination of natural meandering, with little consideration of the hydrologic cycle. More recently, the intense occupation of urban areas, especially the floodplains and wetlands, has put considerable stress in the drainage systems, which have grown increasingly expensive and with limited capacity in dealing with frequent floods. Current techniques to improve urban flood management are focused on restoring the watershed storage capacity and water detention through infiltration, reduction of flow velocity and increase of evapotranspiration and interception. All these processes should contribute to hold the water for slow release, contributing to mitigate floods and maintaining the water supply for the environment. Linear parks and greenways are important elements in the urban landscape, given their role in integrating the natural environment with the built one, with important functions of floodplain maintenance, recreation and wildlife corridors. This paper analyzes the contribution of an urban linear park in reducing local floods. A small urban watershed is modeled with the SWMM rainfall-runoff model to evaluate future possible scenarios with a linear park and LID elements and their effect on the resulting flood hydrograph. Results indicate that the parks are effective elements for flood control in urban areas and their design can be improved and adapted to take advantage of local conditions of land value and use, topography and vegetation. © 2012 ASCE.

TI  - Factors influencing the spatial distribution of forest plant species in hedgerows of North-western Germany
PY  - 2008
AB  - In North-western Germany woodland fragmentation has caused a decline in many forest plant species. Hedgerows partly offer a similar environment as forests and have been identified as potential habitats for forest plants in various studies from North America and Western Europe. The objective of this study was to examine whether this applies also to Central Europe and which variables affect the spatial distribution and abundance of forest plant species in hedgerows on a local scale. Three hedgerow networks north of the city of Bremen, Germany, were selected as study areas and divided into totally 515 hedgerow segments. In each segment we recorded all vascular plants and a large number of explanatory variables relating to structure, spatial configuration, environment and management. Averaged across species there was a predominant effect of environmental factors on the occurrence of forest species in the hedgerows, followed by spatial configuration and management. Hedgerow structure was found to be less important. In general, forest species were favored by low nutrient and light availability as well as high connectivity with other hedgerows or forest; they avoided hedgerows with a west-easterly orientation and an adjacent land use in the form of fields or grasslands. Forest species found and not found in hedgerows did not differ in their environmental preferences or life history traits. The number of threatened forest species in the hedgerows, however, was lower than expected with respect to their overall proportion to the total number of forest species in the region. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Combining Measures of Dispersal to Identify Conservation Strategies in Fragmented Landscapes
PY  - 2011
AB  - Understanding the way in which habitat fragmentation disrupts animal dispersal is key to identifying effective and efficient conservation strategies. To differentiate the potential effectiveness of 2 frequently used strategies for increasing the connectivity of populations in fragmented landscapes-corridors and stepping stones-we combined 3 complimentary methods: behavioral studies at habitat edges, mark-recapture, and genetic analyses. Each of these methods addresses different steps in the dispersal process that a single intensive study could not address. We applied the 3 methods to the case study of Atrytonopsis new species 1, a rare butterfly endemic to a partially urbanized stretch of barrier islands in North Carolina (U.S.A.). Results of behavioral analyses showed the butterfly flew into urban and forested areas, but not over open beach; mark-recapture showed that the butterfly dispersed successfully through short stretches of urban areas ( 5 km) were a dispersal barrier, but shorter stretches of urban areas (≤5 km) were not. Although results from all 3 methods indicated natural features in the landscape, not urbanization, were barriers to dispersal, when we combined the results we could determine where barriers might arise: forests restricted dispersal for the butterfly only when there were long stretches with no habitat. Therefore, urban areas have the potential to become a dispersal barrier if their extent increases, a finding that may have gone unnoticed if we had used a single approach. Protection of stepping stones should be sufficient to maintain connectivity for Atrytonopsis new species 1 at current levels of urbanization. Our research highlights how the use of complementary approaches for studying animal dispersal in fragmented landscapes can help identify conservation strategies.

TI  - Movement patterns within an urban population of fire salamanders highlight the importance of conserving small habitat patches
PY  - 2022
AB  - Movement is an ecological process that affects individual fitness and population dynamics of species. Understanding movement patterns is crucial for the effective conservation of amphibian populations isolated by urban development. Here, we conducted a capture–recapture study over 6 years in a population of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) inhabiting a 7.3-ha patch of forest and disturbed land-use types in an urbanised catchment north-west of Budapest, Hungary. We investigated relationships between movement distances and environmental, spatial and demographic parameters in order to understand how this species is able to persist in a relatively small and isolated habitat patch. We found that most movement was aggregated around a permanent stream and that movement distances were generally ≤200 m, with maximum distances of 925 and 707 m for males and females, respectively. Movement patterns within the population were best modelled using a negative exponential function characterised by infrequent long-distance movement. Males had substantially larger home range sizes than females and were predicted to have larger movement distances. Mean movement distances were predicted to be larger in disturbed areas in the upper stream catchment which included residential areas, compared with smaller movements in more natural forest near the stream. There was a positive relationship between mean movement distance and body condition. Our results suggest that this local population persists in a relatively small habitat patch because it provides a stable breeding site and suitable foraging and shelter microhabitats. Conservation of the local population requires protection of the structure, connectivity and quality of forest and stream habitats, and preventing urban development in the surrounding catchment.

TI  - Biodiversity constraint indicator establishment and its optimization for urban growth: Framework and application
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization causes tremendous pressure on biodiversity and ecosystems at the global scale. China is among the countries undergoing the fastest urban expansion. For a long time, ecological environment protection has not been a priority in China's urban planning process. Current urban growth optimization research has some limitations regarding the selection of more scientific ecological constraint indicators and the interaction between urban expansion and ecological factors. This paper at first aimed to establish a reasonable comprehensive biodiversity constraint indicator based on the indicators of net primary productivity, habitat connectivity and habitat quality, and then conducted a case study in Beijing and compared biodiversity loss and urban growth patterns under different developing situations. The integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs model and GIS-related methods were used to obtain biodiversity and ecological spatial distribution layers. Then an ecological priority-oriented urban growth simulation method was proposed to search for minimum biodiversity loss. The results showed that the important biodiversity security areas were mostly distributed in the western part of the study area and that the ecological degradation in 2000 had a radial pattern and was well in line with the urban construction and ring road distribution patterns. Meanwhile, biodiversity loss with the biodiversity constraint was much less than actual urban growth in 2000-2010. Under the guidance of ecological optimization, urban growth in the research results reflects decentralized and multi-center spatial development characteristics. This type of urban growth not only provides a new model for breaking the inertia of urban sprawl but also proposes 'biodiversity security' as an applicable regulatory tool for urban planning and space governance reforming. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Native bee diversity and abundance in an urban green space in Bengaluru, India y
PY  - 2020
AB  - Aim: The aim of the present study was to estimate the diversity and abundance of native bee fauna in an urban green space in Bengaluru, India. Methodology: Native bees were sampled from ten observational plots randomly selected from a 20 ha urban green space. Bee diversity and abundance were recorded at 15-day interval and estimated using diversity indices. e Results: Nineteen species and thirteen genera under Apidae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae family were recorded. Bee species under Apidae were the most abundant, with four social, five solitary, and one kleptoparasitic species, followed by Halictidae and Megachilidae, with five and four solitary bee species, respectively. Trigona iridipennis was the dominant species followed by Apis dorsata among the social bees, and Lasioglossum sp. and Hriades sp. were dominant among the solitary bees. The number of cavity-nesting species was more that of tree-nesting or ground-nesting species. Shannon’s and Simpson’s diversity indices confirmed the species richness, species abundance, and uniform distribution of native bee species in the urban green space. Interpretation: Green patches within urban areas can support a diverse population of bees. The study area consisted of both social and solitary bees. Cavity-nesting and oligolectic generalist bees were more predominant in the urban area, thus confirming the role of urban spaces in adding to bee diversity. Green pockets within urban areas support a diverse population of bees, and urban green spaces and green corridors can help to conserve bee biodiversity and, in turn, the urban ecosystem. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)

TI  - A review on ecological connectivity in Landscape Ecology
PY  - 2009
AB  - As a hot topic in Landscape Ecology study, ecological connectivity is playing very important roles in wildlife dispersal, ecosystem energy flow and disturbance spread. Ecological connectivity is the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes the movement of ecological flows among resource patches. Ecological connectivity mainly based on percolation theory and graph theory, describes the landscape structure and function by using the quantified methods of experiments, models and indices. Ecological connectivity is applied broadly in the natural landscape and urban landscape and is meaningful to the biological conservation and open urban area planning. In the paper, the theoretical basis, research method, findings and applications, ongoing prospects of the ecological connectivity, are reviewed so as to promote the further development in this research field.

TI  - Habitat types effect on diversity, distribution and abundance of dung beetles
PY  - 2021
AB  - Dung beetles are ecologically important taxa to study the assessment of habitat modification and disturbance across the globe. This study was aimed to explore community composition, species richness and abundance of dung beetles in response to Gujrat, Punjab, Pakistan. Dung beetle assemblage were sampled from four habitat (natural rangeland, cropland, roadside and housing colonies) during 2014-2016 by placing pitfall traps baited with cattle dung. A total number of 540 specimens representing 17 species belonging to seven genera and four tribes were collected. We calculated species relative abundance in natural habitat (34.8%), cropland habitat (40.4%) and in road side areas (25.2%) was recorded, whereas no specimens were recorded in urban areas. Aphodius contaminatus (42.96%) was the most abundant species followed by Onitis castaneous (26.29%) and Onitis singhalensis (20.74%). Tunnellers (50.58%) and dwellers (49.01%) were dominant in all habitats, whereas rollers were least abundant (1.37%). The values of Shannon-Wiener (H) diversity and evenness (E) showed variations among different habitats i.e. natural habitat (H=1.20; E=0.55), cropland habitat (H=1.41, E=0.32) and roads-side (H=0.80, E=0.37). The study showed that cropland served as a major habitat for dung beetles due to its uniformity and close association with mammalian fauna. The results emphasized that natural habitats within the agro-ecosystem have become isolated and fragmented habitat with lesser stability and low resources thus resulting into less diverse habitat. Roadside areas are in close proximity with cropland and act as corridors for efficient species flow within ecosystem due to cattle movement through these areas. © 2021 PCSIR-Scientific Information Centre.

TI  - Niche use and co-occurrence patterns of zooplankton along a strong urbanization gradient
PY  - 2022
AB  - Community composition in a given landscape is a complex product of the constituent species' niche requirements, geographic connectivity, environmental properties, species interactions and drift. In this study, we examined niche use of 16 cladoceran species in 81 zooplankton communities that inhabit environmentally variable sites along a strong urbanization gradient. We tested to what extent niche shifts occurred along the urbanization gradient. We also quantified to what extent niche overlap can explain co-occurrence patterns and tested whether alternative processes such as dispersal limitation or environmental heterogeneity impact co-occurrence patterns. Niche use in the study region was size-mediated, with larger species preferring nutrient-rich environments while smaller species were more specialized on distinct niche axes. Our analyses also revealed that mainly generalist species were able to establish in urban sites. While the average niche position for most species was conserved from rural to urban sites, the niches of those species occurring in both rural and urban areas remain partly unfilled in the urban populations. We observed that a relatively small proportion (13%) of species pairs co-occurred more or less often than expected by chance, but also that niche overlap was the only predictor that was strongly and significantly associated with co-occurrence scores in our study. While most of these species pairs showed evidence for a role of environmental filtering, a few common, generalist species pairs displayed segregated co-occurrence patterns and high niche overlap, suggesting a role of limiting similarity relationships as well. Our study highlights the damaging effects on biodiversity of urbanization through biotic homogenization benefitting generalist species, as well as the difficulty species may face in occupying available niche space in urbanized habitats. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Evaluation of regional ecological carrying capacity coupling with landscape pat-tern and ecosystem services
PY  - 2019
AB  - The main basis of landscape development and planning is the evaluation of regional ecological carrying capacity. The results of this evaluation can reflect the extent to which ecological carrying capacity can remain unaffected by continuous development and planning activities of humans. Nowadays, among the existing methods for assessing ecological carrying capacity, the method based on ecosystem services value is relatively mature and widely used. However, the assessment of ecosystem services value is based on the classification of ecological land types in the region; therefore, it is difficult to apply where the land use status lacks extensibility and resilience. To fill this gap, this study coupled landscape pattern and vegetation change parameters with the ecosystem service provision capacity through a comprehensive index system with 3 criteria and 11 indicators. The landscape pattern determined the size, shape, and connectivity of various ecological patches, which in turn affected the abundance, distribution, and population viability and anti-interference ability of the landscape. Thus, landscape pattern indexes could be used to identify regional ecological protection priorities under urbanization, further improving regional environmental quality and resource utilization efficiency. The vegetation change index could spatially describe changes in breadth and depth of vegetation cover in regions, which were the result of the interaction between nature and human activities. This study applied the assessment model to Shijiazhuang City, measuring its comprehensive ecological carrying capacity at the grid, township and district scale. The results showed that the spatial distribution of the ecological carrying capacity of Shijiazhuang based on the grid analysis was relatively high in the western mountainous area and low in the east plain. Regarding the indicator layer, the distribution of ecosystem service provision capacity was relatively consistent with the comprehensive ecological carrying capacity distribution, whereas the landscape metrics presented a mosaic distribution pattern and the vegetation change index represented a circle layer distribution pattern. Meanwhile, the spatial heterogeneity of the first-level indicators was more significant. The further regional analysis results focusing on the administrative scales of districts and townships showed that the indicator distribution on smaller scale was more heterogeneous, and evaluation results in some regions were inconsistent with those assessed at higher administrative level. Therefore, local decision-makers should adjust more targeted management objectives and actions according to the jurisdiction. In general, through horizontal analysis in space and vertical contrast on scales, western Shijiazhuang City should focus on integrating the forest ecosystem conservation into urban development and construction; the eastern districts and townships should coordinate between the ecological environment and economic development, and improve the ecosystem service capacity through the optimization of ecological space patterns, thereby improving the comprehensive carrying capacity of national land space. © 2019, Science Press.

TI  - Using Landscape Connectivity to Identify Suitable Locations for Nature-Based Solutions to Reduce Flood Risk
PY  - 2022
AB  - Climate change and population growth are exacerbating environmental challenges and natural hazards. Extreme events such as flooding due to heavy precipitation are occurring more frequently and becoming more severe throughout the world. Future projections indicate increasing risks and serious threats to human societies, particularly those living in urban areas. To mitigate associated socio-economic challenges and support sustainable urban development, nature-based solutions (NBS) are being introduced in mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, NBS need to be carefully located and suitably designed to achieve their full potential in terms of flood mitigation. Landscape connectivity, addressing various landscape processes and components, can potentially be utilized for land management and biodiversity conservation. For instance, hydrological connectivity within a catchment, as part of the landscape connectivity, describes the main water flow pathways and areas where runoff tends to accumulate, and can thus be useful in identifying the best locations for NBS from a hydrological viewpoint. In this chapter, we describe use of landscape connectivity to identify suitable locations for NBS to reduce flood risk in urban areas, and exemplify the process for two distinct urban catchments, located in Sweden and Portugal. The results showed good usefulness of the method and revealed the importance of integrating connectivity mapping into future NBS planning practices and decision support systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Assessment of solar radiation reduction from urban forests on buildings along highway corridors in Sydney
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urban forests play a critical role in mitigating heat island effects and in modifying local microclimates by intercepting solar radiation and shading heat-absorbing structural materials. Solar radiation is the prime determinant of how much energy urban surfaces absorb and of temperature distribution patterns in urban areas. Understanding the impacts of urban trees on solar radiation received by buildings is an important way to assess tree shading and potential energy conservation. In this study two remote sensing technologies have been integrated, to estimate solar radiation on building roofs along two major infrastructure routes in Sydney. In particular, the relationship between the radiation received by the roofs and the surrounding tree features has been investigated. The two chosen sources of remotely sensed data are light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and airborne hyperspectral imaging. Integrating these data sets provides a means to build digital surface models (DSMs) which only include trees and permits a distinction between evergreen and deciduous species. Global solar radiation profiles of both corridors have been estimated. Then, the direct and diffuse radiation received by building roofs are modelled by incorporating the LiDAR DSM, at hourly intervals on spring/autumn equinox and summer/winter solstice dates. The very high summer radiation in comparison with winter levels is demonstrated and, by correlating reductions in solar radiation with different tree and building dimensions, this paper shows that tree canopy height is most strongly correlated to solar radiation across the whole study area. The results also demonstrate benefits of more extensive use of deciduous species in industrialised or commercial areas. For landscape planners in Sydney, the importance of having and conserving taller trees for solar radiation reduction is clear. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - A conceptual approach to modeling the geospatial impact of typical Urban threats on the habitat quality of river corridors
PY  - 2020
AB  - While for most of a landscape, urbanization leads to a significant habitat loss, rivers in urban areas are usually maintained or developed for their drainage function. Rivers are often the most important biophysical and ecological connection of cities with their surrounding ecosystems, although usually heavily altered due to urban impacts. For the conservation of urban rivers as ecological corridors, it is important to assess the impact of typical urban threats on habitat quality. In this study, we used the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Trade-offs) habitat quality model to assess the individual and combined impacts of built-up areas, first- and second-order road and water pollution from urban drainage, and wastewater discharge on habitat quality within a 200 m wide river corridor. The Pochote River in León, Nicaragua, was used as a case study. Our results show the spatial distribution and magnitude of the individual threat impacts, as well as the respective contribution of each threat to the overall impact of urbanization on the habitat quality within the river corridor. While close to the city center, all threats almost equally contributed to severe habitat degradation, while further downstream, an individual threat influence became more distinct with only water pollution having a consistent negative impact. We concluded that the InVEST habitat quality model can be used to assess the impact of typical urban threats on habitat quality in river corridors at a high spatial resolution. The results can help to improve urban planning and development to improve habitat conservation along urban rivers. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - The value of small urban greenspaces for birds in a Mexican city
PY  - 2011
AB  - We explore bird communities in different types of small urban greenspaces (<2. ha) in order to understand which birds occupy these structures, and the habitat and landscape features that affect them. In particular we analyzed how greenspace characteristics (size and vegetation structure), those of the adjacent landscape (area covered by urban structures and vegetation), and human disturbance variables (traffic of pedestrians, vehicles and noise levels) affected bird species richness, abundance and community composition (during summer and winter) in the city of Pachuca, Mexico. We selected 19 small greenspaces (ranging from 0.1 to 2. ha), including public parks, gardens and road strip corridors. We registered 39 species of birds of which 15 were migratory. In general bird species richness was higher in parks and gardens, and lower in road strip corridors, where more noise and traffic was registered. Greenspace area was the most important variable that positively influenced bird species richness, for both the summer and the winter communities. Summer bird species richness was lower in places that had a greater percentage of area covered by buildings in the adjacent landscape. Generalist and opportunistic species were favored by urbanization. Insectivorous species in winter were more abundant in larger greenspaces that had taller trees and more tree and shrub species, and in sites with more vegetative cover in the adjacent landscape. We suggest some management and urban planning actions that would benefit birds within many Latin American cities, where small greenspaces are often the only available refuges for birds. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Planning and design of ecological networks in urban areas
PY  - 2011
AB  - Urban ecological networks are defined differently in ecology, urban planning and landscape ecology, but they all have linearity and linkage in common. Early urban representations evolved from the constraints of deep ecological structure in the landscape to built elements that must work around natural linear obstacles-rivers, coastlines, dunes, cliffs, hills and valley swamps. Village commons were linked by roads. The Industrial Revolution led to accelerating urban growth, where the role of open space focussed on public health and transport. The Renaissance, Baroque and Picturesque movements accentuated networks in wooded parks, boulevards and sweeping riverine vistas. These provided a new aesthetic and sense of grandeur in the urban centres of European empires and later their colonies. Grafted onto this visual connectivity has been an awakened ecological understanding of spatial dynamics. The emergent notion of ecological corridor functionality provided support for green linear features, although initially this was based on untested theory. The idea of organisms moving along green highways seemed logical, but only recently has unequivocal empirical evidence emerged that demonstrates this functionality. Nevertheless, the main role of corridors may be to provide habitat rather than to act as connectors of nodal habitats. Most organisms can utilise stepping stones, and these may accommodate desired meta-populations while deterring pest movement. Swale drains and treatment wetlands provide riparian services and serve as biodiversity corridors. However, to most people the obvious function is visual-providing green fingers through what would otherwise be urban grey. The health benefits of these are have been demonstrated to be psychological as much as biophysical. © 2010 International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering and Springer.

TI  - An ecological and evolutionary perspective of the historical US nursery flora
PY  - 2023
AB  - Societal Impact Statement: The plants sold in nurseries directly influence urban landscapes by providing habitat that supports humans and other organisms and indirectly influence the natural landscape by acting as a major source of invasive species. We analyzed the ornamental plants sold in US nurseries from 1719 to 1946 and found broad patterns of increasing diversity occurring in step with an increase in species relatedness, a switch from native to alien species, and a decrease in regional distinctness. Patterns like these, which have been observed recently in urban areas, thus have a basis in cultivation/horticultural history. Summary: Cultivated plants are foundational species in urban areas, where they simultaneously provide essential ecosystem services while posing a risk of invasion into natural communities. We sought to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of cultivated plants using historical data to better understand the origins of the patterns of diversity observed in present-day human-dominated landscapes. Using records of 5098 ornamental vascular plant species available in 319 US nursery catalogs published from 1719 to 1946, we quantified the taxonomic and phylogenetic (Formula presented.) -diversity, phylogenetic structure, and (Formula presented.) -diversity of the historical US nursery flora in cultural regions, biomes, latitudinal bands, and longitudinal zones. We showed a peaked increase in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the US nursery flora over time, concurrent with the proliferation of nurseries and the addition of new species to nursery offerings. However, standardized phylogenetic diversity showed a convex pattern, with a trough during a time of peak growth and connectivity in the nursery industry, and diversity actually decreased at the end of the time series. We also showed a pattern of increasing homogenization of regional nursery floras, as well as a shift from offering predominately native to predominately alien species. Echos of the history of the US nursery industry can be found today in patterns with great ecological relevance. Previous reports of high alien plant diversity in urban areas, phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion among naturalized alien plants, and homogenization of urban plant communities are all consistent with the historical availability of these plants in the nursery flora. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Urbanization and biodiversity in semiarid landscapes under strong environmental and anthropogenic stress
PY  - 2012
AB  - The Mediterranean Basin (MB) is a representative test region for research on the effects of urbanization on biodiversity, being one of the world's most impacted areas as a result of its early human occupation. Semiarid areas within the MB are key places for the study of such impacts, since they experience strong anthropogenic pressures on a naturally stressed environment. Southeastern Spain, a predominantly semiarid Mediterranean area, has undergone a process of recent urban sprawl with increases over 60% of land devoted to urbanization with respect to previously built area. In its interaction with natural-mainly forest-habitat, urbanization is superimposed on natural climatic fragmentation and on cultural fragmentation caused by agriculture and livestock. This has led to a pattern of relatively large core natural areas within an ample transformed matrix with sparse forest islets, usually Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis) planting or remnants, which have not only intrinsic biological value but an important functional role (as a part of the connectivity network). Their closeness to urban areas also confers them a relevant social role as places favouring man's contact with Nature. In the demanding and dynamic environmental context of the semiarid MB, there is scarce research focused at studying the response of biodiversity to urban development, and to devising management strategies for its preservation under a global change scenario. To fill this gap, between 2006-2010 a survey was made of 19 remnant forest patches embedded in the anthropogenic matrix (urban and agricultural) inside the 885,9 km2 of Murcia municipality (SE Spain). Biodiversity descriptors and indicators chosen were woody species (trees, shrubs and chamaephytes) among plants, birds among vertebrates and ground spiders among invertebrates. The urbanization process was characterized by two variables related with urbanization, indicative of habitat fragmentation and direct urban influence. Through this multispecific and multiscale approach, we have evaluated the effects of urbanization on the selected taxocenoses, emphasizing the influence of edge effects on invertebrates, and the landscape and habitat influences on birds and flora. The results of ongoing studies suggest different effects of urbanization on fragmented forest landscapes, depending on the biodiversity indicator considered. Vegetation appears as the most vulnerable component due to its higher sensitivity to fragmentation (low mobility and barriers to dispersal). In the case of birds and spiders, changes in community composition and diversity occur as a result of edge effects and numerous intrinsic characteristics of each islet (patch size, urban influence...). A landscape-patch-microhabitat approach allows the identification of management measures to mitigate the impact of urbanization, and the establishment of guidelines to preserve biodiversity when new urban areas are created. Urban planning and the management of \"urban forest\" remnants should take into account these guidelines to allow natural islets to reach their full social and ecological potential. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Urban Landscape Fragmentation as an Indicator of Urban Expansion Using Sentinel-2 Imageries
PY  - 2022
AB  - Rapid urbanization in some cities has led to the emergence of numerous subsidiary settlements around their primary cities. Due to this rapid urbanization and growth, there is a great demand for urban land, mostly for commercial, industrial, and residential uses. Urban green spaces and vegetation are at risk due to a large amount of urban land, as seen by a decline in connectivity and increased fragmentation, especially due to land conversion. However, the identification of the spatial and momentary variability in the clustering and fragmentation of vegetation patterns in urban settings has not made full use of local indicators of spatial distribution measurements, such as Baqubah, a city in Iraq. Since it is essential to measure the degree of fragmentation and evaluate urban expansion trajectories consistently, this study proposes a new approach to assessing the anticipated direction of urban extension, using the fragmentation indicator of built-up patterns in urban areas. Sentinel-2 data was used to map the fragmented urban centres and their future extent in the city at a single time point. The proposed method employs indices to capture the initial distribution of spatial patterns of vegetation cover and built-up areas. The main extracted land cover classes, landscape fragmentation performance, and surface density analysis were accomplished in ArcGIS. The results indicate that the entire built-up area in Baqubah has a high degree of fragmentation at 75%, and about 23% of the open space within the urban extent of the city. Two predicted trajectories of urban expansion were also revealed: one may follow the external road direction, while the other is multi-directional, commencing from the edges of the built-up area. The study concludes that the new method is useful for comprehending and assessing urban landscape fragmentation, as well as anticipating its path. This integrated approach to remote sensing and GIS can sufficiently and effectively determine priority urban regions for successful planning and management. In addition, our study's findings highlight the potential of the suggested strategy as a useful spatially explicit method for determining the spatial clustering and fragmentation of urban landscape patterns. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Land-use planning and distribution of threatened wildlife in a city of Japan
PY  - 2001
AB  - The relationships between the distribution patterns of threatened wildlife species and current land-use planning were investigated in a city of Japan to design a sustainable and land-use plan. Spatial distributions of 165 species of threatened wildlife (99 plants and 66 animals) were obtained by surveying most of the Chiba City, located in northeastern part of the Tokyo Bay area. Distribution maps were created within 334 rectangular cells, each measuring 1.1 km × 0.9 km, oriented in the cardinal directions. Four land-use zones, i.e., urbanization promotion, parkland, agricultural and urbanization control, and agricultural promotion zones were identified. The distribution of these threatened species was analyzed in terms of green cover and zoning categories. Few threatened wildlife species were found in the urbanization promotion or parkland zone. Most were concentrated in the surrounding arable areas with green covers of more than 50%. Areas other than those set aside for intensive agricultural development in the agricultural promotion development zone contained the greatest number of species. These areas belonged to the agricultural and urbanization control zone, where the traditional agricultural landscape still remains in and around narrow valleys called \"yatsu\". The results suggest that the regional biodiversity depends heavily on areas in which the traditional landscape remains relatively intact. Based on these results, a series of recommendations, including conservation and restoration of habitats, establishments of wildlife networks and corridors, and citizen involvement in conservation, were presented to the city studied. The data and recommendations will hopefully help the city, as well as many other areas faced with similar issues, devise future land-use plans that combine sustainable development with conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of high quality living environments. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Changes in water quality and macroinvertebrate communities resulting from urban stormflows in the Provo River, Utah, U.S.A
PY  - 2004
AB  - Short-term changes in water quality from 7 summer stormflows and long-term changes in substrates and macroinvertebrate communities resulting from urban runoff from the city of Provo, Utah, were examined from 1999-2002 in the lower Provo River. Stormflows resulted in increased total suspended solids and concentrations of dissolved copper, lead and zinc, and decreased conductivity and dissolved oxygen. The degree of change was generally in proportion to the magnitude of the storm. However, changes were temporary with water quality parameters returning to pre-storm levels within 12 hours. River substrates showed a trend of increased compaction and decreased debris dam area downstream through the urban corridor. Macroinvertebrate communities showed trends of decreased abundance and total species diversity with increasing urbanization. Compared to non-urban reaches, communities in urban reaches had few 'sensitive' species and were dominated by tolerant species, particularly snails and leeches. Comparisons with previous studies show that changes in macroinvertebrate community composition in the urban reaches reflected shifts in land use during the past 15-25 years and corresponded to expected threshold levels of impact for amount of impervious surface cover.

TI  - Monitoring urban green infrastructure changes and impact on habitat connectivity using high-resolution satellite data
PY  - 2020
AB  - In recent decades, the City of Stockholm, Sweden, has grown substantially and is now the largest city in Scandinavia. Recent urban growth is placing pressure on green areas within and around the city. In order to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services, green infrastructure is part of Stockholm municipal planning. This research quantifies land-cover change in the City of Stockholm between 2003 and 2018 and examines what impact urban growth has had on its green infrastructure. Two 2018 WorldView-2 images and three 2003 QuickBird-2 images were used to produce classifications of 11 land-cover types using object-based image analysis and a support vector machine algorithm with spectral, geometric and texture features. The classification accuracies reached over 90% and the results were used in calculations and comparisons to determine the impact of urban growth in Stockholm between 2003 and 2018, including the generation of land-cover change statistics in relation to administrative boundaries and green infrastructure. For components of the green infrastructure, i.e., habitat networks for selected sensitive species, habitat network analysis for the European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus) and common toad (Bufo bufo) was performed. Between 2003 and 2018, urban areas increased by approximately 4% while green areas decreased by 2% in comparison with their 2003 areal amounts. The most significant urban growth occurred through expansion of the transport network, paved surfaces and construction areas which increased by 12%, mainly at the expense of grassland and coniferous forest. Examination of urban growth within the green infrastructure indicated that most land area was lost in dispersal zones (28 ha) while the highest percent change was within habitat for species of conservation concern (14%). The habitat network analysis revealed that overall connectivity decreased slightly through patch fragmentation and areal loss mainly caused by road expansion on the outskirts of the city. The habitat network analysis also revealed which habitat areas are well-connected and which are most vulnerable. These results can assist policymakers and planners in their efforts to ensure sustainable urban development including sustaining biodiversity in the City of Stockholm. © 2020 by the authors.

PY  - 2013
AB  - Life for human populations in high-density urban areas can be considerably enriched by being in closer contact with nature, leading to many benefits for psychological well-being. The movement, colours and sounds of birds can be particularly attractive and the steps taken to create suitable and sustainable habitats for them in urban landscapes can make city-life much more attractive for a significant part of the human population. The challenges set by the ecology of a humid tropical environment are examined. Based on fundamental ecological principles guidance is provided for the and scaping design and species planting for cities in SE Asia. The conservation of wild refuges, wise park planting, and well-laid out ecological corridors are all critical components which need to play together. Advice is provided on the types of species, both indigenous and exotic, which can be used and how these interact with particular bird species in the Malay Peninsula. As the ecosystems of tropical SE Asia rapidly change in the face of large-scale resource exploitation such activities in cities are increasingly important in keeping alive a public awareness of the dependence of economic development upon environmental sustainability.© National University of Singapore.

TI  - The importance of functional connectivity in the conservation of a ground-dwelling mammal in an urban Australian landscape
PY  - 2007
AB  - The distribution of the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), a medium-sized ground-dwelling marsupial, was examined in habitat fragments within the urban landscape of the city of Brisbane, Australia. From surveys conducted in 68 fragments, bandicoots were found to be present in 33 (49%) despite widespread habitat loss and fragmentation. Logistic regression analysis revealed that of 13 measured independent variables, functional connectivity was the only factor that significantly predicted the presence of bandicoots within fragments, with connectivity positively correlated with the likelihood of occupation. Functional connectivity was equated to the likelihood of bandicoot immigration into the focal fragment from the nearest occupied fragment, based on the estimated resistance to movement offered by the intervening matrix. Within Brisbane, riparian habitat fragments typically have a relatively high level of functional connectivity, as thin strips of vegetation fringing waterways serve as corridors between larger riparian areas and facilitate the movement of bandicoots between patches. Analyses based on the Akaike Information Criterion revealed that the optimal model based on landscape context variables was convincingly better supported by the data than the optimal model produced from fragment characteristics. However, it is important to examine both internal attributes of habitat fragments and external features of the surrounding landscape when modelling the distribution of ground-dwelling fauna in urban environments, or other landscapes with a highly variable matrix. As urban centres throughout the world expand, it is crucial that the ecology of local wildlife be considered to ensure functional connection is maintained between habitat patches, especially for the conservation of species that are highly susceptible to fragmentation. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Models of coupled settlement and habitat networks for biodiversity conservation: Conceptual framework, implementation and potential applications
PY  - 2018
AB  - Worldwide, the expansion of settlement and transport infrastructure is one of the most important proximate as well as ultimate causes of biodiversity loss. As much as every modern human society depends on a network of settlements that is well-connected by transport infrastructure (i.e., settlement network), animal and plant species depend on networks of habitats between which they can move (i.e., habitat networks). However, changes to a settlement network in a region often threaten the integrity of the region's habitat networks. Determining plans and policy to prevent these threats is made difficult by the numerous interactions and feedbacks that exist between and within the settlement and habitat networks. Mathematical models of coupled settlement and habitat networks can help us understand the dynamics of this social-ecological system. Yet, few attempts have been made to develop such mathematical models. In this paper, we promote the development of models of coupled settlement and habitat networks for biodiversity conservation. First, we present a conceptual framework of key variables that are ideally considered when operationalizing the coupling of settlement and habitat networks. In this framework, we first describe important network-internal interactions by differentiating between the structural (i.e., relating to purely physical conditions determining the suitability of a location for living or movement) and functional (i.e., relating to the actual presence, abundance or movement of people or other organisms) properties of either network. We then describe the main one-way influences that a settlement network can exert on the habitat networks and vice versa. Second, we give several recommendations for the mathematical modeling of coupled settlement and habitat networks and present several existing modeling approaches (e.g., habitat network models and land-use transport interaction models) that could be used for this purpose. Lastly, we elaborate on potential applications of models of coupled settlement and habitat networks in the development of complex network theory, in the assessment of system resilience and in conservation, transport and urban planning. The development of coupled settlement and habitat network models is important to gain a better system-level understanding of biodiversity conservation under a rapidly urbanizing and growing human population. © 2018 van Strien, Axhausen, Dubernet, Guisan, Grêt-Regamey, Khiali-Miab, Ortiz-Rodríguez and Holderegger.

TI  - Do cities represent sources, sinks or isolated islands for urban wild boar population structure?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary
Urban sprawl has resulted in the permanent presence of large mammal species in urban areas, leading to human–wildlife conflicts. Wild boar Sus scrofa are establishing a permanent presence in many cities in Europe, with the largest German urban population occurring in Berlin. Despite their relatively long-term presence, there is little knowledge of colonization processes, dispersal patterns or connectivity of Berlin's populations, hampering the development of effective management plans.
We used 13 microsatellite loci to genotype 387 adult and subadult wild boar from four urban forests, adjacent built-up areas and the surrounding rural forests. We applied genetic clustering algorithms to analyse the population genetic structure of the urban boar. We used approximate Bayesian computation to infer the boar's colonization history of the city. Finally, we used assignment tests to determine the origin of wild boar hunted in the urban built-up areas.
The animals in three urban forests formed distinct genetic clusters, with the remaining samples all being assigned to one rural population. One urban cluster was founded by individuals from another urban cluster rather than by rural immigrants.
The wild boar that had been harvested within urban built-up areas was predominantly assigned to the rural cluster surrounding the urban area, rather than to one of the urban clusters.
Synthesis and applications. Our results are likely to have an immediate impact on management strategies for urban wild board populations in Berlin, because they show that there are not only distinct urban clusters, but also ongoing source–sink dynamics between urban and rural areas. It is therefore essential that the neighbouring Federal States of Berlin and Brandenburg develop common hunting plans to control the wild boar population and reduce conflicts in urban areas.

TI  - Urban waterfowl population: Ecological evaluation of management and planning
PY  - 1982
AB  - An urban population of ducks in Puyallup, Washington, USA was studied for 14 consecutive months beginning in November 1978. Observations were made weekly from four study sites where ducks would congregate at early morning hours. Factors contributing to the presence of waterfowl in Puyallyup included abundant food supplies and a creek corridor that connected fragmented habitats in the urban area to the larger rural populations of waterfowl. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were the most abundant of the 13 species observed and were the only ducks remaining during the nesting season. Habitat size and complexity were important factors influencing the species diversity of a particular site. Nesting success of mallards was poor due to limited distribution of nesting habitat, intraspecific aggression, and human disturbance. Both site-specific and more broad-based strategies are suggested for managing and planning for duck populations in urban areas. © 1982 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

TI  - Floristic and structural patterns of a forest fragment in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil
PY  - 2011
AB  - Urban areas result in fragmentation, species loss and ecosystem changes. However, natural ecosystem remnants in urban zones may be refuges or corridors for many species. This study presents floristic and structural features of the tree and understory strata of an urban forest fragment in Cachoeirinha, Rio Grande do Sul. Ninety tree and 15 shrub species were recorded, of which two were endangered, two protected, and nine exotic. In the quantitative sample, 54 species were contemplated in the tree stratum and 45 in the understory. The fragment is characterized as a Semideciduous Seasonal Forest and presents high tree species diversity, reflecting density evenness. Structurally, there are no features of a more conserved core area, although some species tend to occur close to the edges. We believe that conserving semi-natural urban areas like this contributes to maintaining habitats, species diversity, and connectivity among forest remnants in the regional extent, because it maintains the features of the regional forests, including the flora.

TI  - Local contributions to beta diversity in urban pond networks: Implications for biodiversity conservation and management
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aim:- 

An understanding of how biotic communities are spatially organized is necessary to identify and prioritize habitats within landscape‐scale biodiversity conservation. Local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) identifies individual habitats that make a significant contribution to beta diversity and may have important practical implications, particularly for conservation of habitat networks. In this study, we develop and apply a conservation prioritization approach based on LCBD in aquatic invertebrate communities from 132 ponds.
Location:- 

Five urban settlements in the UK: Halton, Loughborough, Stockport, Birmingham and Huddersfield.
Methods:- 

We partition LCBD into richness difference (nestedness: RichDiffLCBD) and species replacement (turnover: ReplLCBD) and identify key environmental variables driving LCBD. We examine LCBD at two scales relevant to conservation planning: within urban settlements and nationally across the UK.
Results:- 

Significant differences in LCBD values were recorded among the five settlements. In four of the five urban settlements studied, pond sites with the greatest LCBD values typically showed high replacement values. Significant LCBD sites and sites with high taxonomic diversity together supported more of the regional species pool (70%–97%) than sites with high taxonomic diversity alone (54%–94%) or what could be protected by the random selection of sites. LCBD was significantly associated with vegetation shading, surface area, altitude and macrophyte cover.
Main conclusions:- 

Conservation prioritization that incorporates LCBD and sites with high taxonomic diversity improves the effectiveness of conservation actions within pond habitat networks, ensures sites supporting high biodiversity are protected and provides a method to define a spatial network of protected sites. Identifying new, effective conservation approaches, particularly in urban areas where resources may be scarce and conflicts regarding land use exist, is essential to ensure biodiversity is fully supported, and detrimental anthropogenic effects are reduced.

TI  - The role of green corridors for wildlife conservation in urban landscape: A literature review
PY  - 2014
AB  - Green corridors are an attempt to mitigate negative effects of the built environment of cities and towns. The corridors act as conservation for rapidly extreme intervention and development of the urban environment. Most importantly, it enables dispersal movement of animals within city areas. Issues relate to wildlife conservation in urban areas has been studied for many years and thus, the research makes a review for how the green corridors contribute to the conservation of urban wildlife. This study reviews groups of articles in disciplines of urban landscape planning and biology conservation to discuss the relationship between elements of green corridors and urban wildlife dispersal movement behaviour in Malaysian context. Accordingly, this research is purposely studied to give understanding on how green corridors contribute to the animals' ability of moving and dispersing within the built-up areas. In advance, it is found that there are three factors contribute to the capability of colonization among urban wildlife which are individual, physical and social factor. Green corridor has been defined as one of the physical factor that influence urban wildlife behaviour movement. Consequently, safety area indicating to animals species for traversing in any time such as at night can be defined as the primary potential corridor. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Risk of tick-borne zoonoses in urban green areas: A case study from Turin, northwestern Italy
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ticks are increasingly reported in urban and peri-urban areas, such as city parks or peri-urban forests, across Europe. Land use changes, like the transformation of natural ecosystems into residential or recreational areas, and the restoration of natural areas connectivity for biodiversity purposes, facilitate human contact with these vectors. We evaluated the infestation by Ixodid ticks and their infection by zoonotic agents in two natural reserves (La Mandria and Stupinigi) in the urban area of Turin, northwestern Italy, near to densely inhabited suburbs and consistently frequented by people. We monthly performed dragging in 15 sites during a three-year period (2012–2014). Over 4000 ticks were collected, belonging to the species: Ixodes ricinus, I. acuminatus, Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, and Haemaphysalis concinna. The tick burden in La Mandria, a park very rich in wildlife, was higher than in Stupinigi, which is surrounded by a grid of roads and cultivated fields. The occurrence of I. ricinus nymphs was mainly related to habitat diversity and seasonal variation but weakly influenced by wildlife presence. Conversely, the density of I. ricinus nymphs were effectively estimated by vegetation coverage, micro-climatic conditions, and the presence of large wildlife. Molecular analyses showed the infections by Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (24.1 %), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (2.9 %), and Spotted Fever Group rickettsiae (30.4 %) in I. ricinus. Tick-borne encephalitis virus, that is considered so far absent in northwestern Italy, was not detected. In La Mandria, the risk of encountering one I. ricinus nymph infected by Borrelia burgorferi s.l. in 100 m2 was 59.1 % (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 36.3–83.0), and 71.3 % (95%CI: 44.5–93.0) for Rickettsia spp. Educational programs on personal protection and surveillance on tick-borne diseases should be enhanced to face the threat posed by tick vectors in green urban landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Climate, soils, and connectivity predict plague epizootics in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus)
PY  - 2011
AB  - Outbreaks of plague in wildlife are sporadic and spatially dispersed, and they depend on coincidence of susceptible hosts, flea vectors, the plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis), and environmental factors that support pathogen transmission. We fit spatial models of plague outbreaks to a long-term data set (1981-2005) of towns of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) on the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. We investigated the effects of spatial distribution (town area and connectivity to other prairie dog towns), climate (spring and summer precipitation and temperature), and soil moisture-holding capacity. In logistic regression models, plague epizootics were predicted by connectivity to other towns experiencing plague during periods with relatively low temperatures, in soils with high moisture-holding capacity. After accounting for connectivity between prairie dog towns and current-year climatic conditions, little additional spatial or temporal autocorrelation was detected. Spatial logit association models provided evidence for localized epizootic hotspots and that greater summer rainfall predicted plague events. Plague outbreaks were not predicted by precipitation in the previous year. As such, no evidence was found to support an indirect cascade model of plague outbreaks for black-tailed prairie dogs on the shortgrass steppe in Colorado. Instead, the models suggest that plague occurrence depends upon direct climatic effects on flea vectors and the plague pathogen. ©2011 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Amphibian decline, pond loss and reduced population connectivity under agricultural intensification over a 38 year period
PY  - 2017
AB  - Habitat loss, together with less obvious land-use changes such as intensified farming practice, can have significant adverse impacts on biodiversity. An important factor in determining the ability of species to cope with such changes is their potential to sustain a populations network by dispersal across the landscape. Habitat quality and structure are particularly important for surface-dwelling species with low dispersal abilities, such as amphibians. To assess this ecological function, ponds in a coastal and typically rural area of northern France were surveyed for amphibians in 1974, 1992 and 2011. These repeated surveys yielded different outcomes for different species groups. Three rare species persisted in more or less specialized habitat types. Two moderately common species declined, but kept strongholds in coastal dunes and associated marshes. Five common species with broad ecological niches remained equally widespread. The Northern crested newt declined markedly and the Midwife toad declined dramatically, as did their breeding habitats in vegetated ponds and cattle drinking troughs. One species, the Moor frog, may have gone locally extinct. A model of relative resistance to amphibian dispersal was created for different landscape types, on a scale from 0 (low resistance) to 1 (high resistance). This generated values of 0.23 for pasture, 0.72 for arable and 0.98 for urban and transport. As pasture declined in the study area, while arable and urban/transport infrastructure increased, amphibian dispersal became more difficult. However, dispersal paths proved difficult to evaluate in a patchy landscape like the one surveyed, due to a paucity of spatial signal. Pond loss is a more tractable reason for the observed amphibian species decline than is the quality of intervening terrestrial habitat matrix. In 2011, 22 newly created ponds had species richness in line with pre-existing ponds and this will have counteracted a dwindling metapopulation structure, indicating that habitat creation/restoration can play a valuable role in conservation. The colonization of new ponds may also prove more informative for gauging the potential for amphibian dispersal in the landscape than the preceding decline. © 2017, The Author(s).

TI  - The impacts of urban sprawl on ecological connectivity in the Montreal Metropolitan Region
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urban sprawl is a widely recognized phenomenon in many major cities worldwide and is a significant land use planning and management issue. This process has many impacts on the ecological function and structure of the landscape. In this article, we analyze the effects of urban sprawl on the ecological patterns and processes in the Montreal Metropolitan Region (MMR) between 1966 and 2010. The dispersed sprawl of low-density urban areas within the territory during this period sharply increased the fragmentation of the territory, isolating the few remaining natural spaces and decreasing their ecological connectivity and, ultimately, biodiversity. The results obtained clearly show that land-use changes that occurred in the MMR have caused profound changes in landscape properties, both structurally and functionally, and especially from 1981 to 2010. In 1966, around 45% of the land had a high or very high level of connectivity, and almost 38% in 1981. By 2010 only 6.5% of the landscape was connected and 73% of the territory possessed no or low connectivity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Measuring landscape connectivity in a urban area for biological conservation
PY  - 2015
AB  - Biodiversity conservation in urbanized area is an increasing challenge worldwide. A quantitative tool is needed to provide a spatially explicit representation of habitat mosaics and thus afford insight into the ecological consequences of landscape changes. We developed a method for identifying core habitats and generating a cost surface that was used to identify both the permeability of the landscape matrix and the quality of core habitats and then we developed a least-cost model to delimit the links between pairs of core habitats. We defined a graph-theoretic dispersal flow index to measure the dispersal potential of certain ecological processes, i.e. functional connectivity. A network consisting of core habitats and links was assembled in the rapid urbanized Shenzhen City of China. The results showed that the cell-based least-cost distance calculation between the core habitats can avoid the subjectivity of land cover-based approaches that rely on expert experience. A highly connected network can facilitate DF and reduce the ecological risk of extinction due to habitat fragmentation. For saving construction cost in the urban environment, urban planner can efficiently design ecological corridors along the least-cost paths to connect isolated core habitats and promote appropriate animal behaviors. The methodology described here will be useful in making better conservation decisions and predictions regarding the consequences of human activity and thereby promote sustainable development. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TI  - Research on the ecological network reconstruction of traditional mining city in East China
PY  - 2020
AB  - The ecological habitation fragments in the traditional mining city is severely fragmented. Reconstructing the ecological networks is greatly critical to the improvement of the regional ecosystem services, as well as the maintaining of biodiversity and landscape diversity. For the reconstruction of the ecological safety network of Xuzhou City, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and landscape index were used to extract the ecological sources with great value for the maintenance of urban ecosystems health. Then, the minimum cumulative resistance model (MCR) was used to build ecological resistance surfaces and extract the potential ecological corridors. Circuit theory combined with the graph theory and network structure analysis were used to quantitatively evaluate and optimize the ecological network. The results show that there are 237 ecological sources, mainly distributed in the southwest part of Xuzhou City, with a total area of 6 421. 49 hm2. However, additional 70 small ecological habitats and 192 ecological corridors should be added to make up the deficiencies of current ecological network. The reconstruction of ecological network could obviously reduce the landscape fragmentation and patch separation, and increase the patch connectivity and adhesion degree, and as a result the regional landscape pattern and ecological security will be improved. This research could provide scientific reference for the transformation of the traditional mining cities, and redevelopment of inefficient land, as well as land space planning. © 2020, China Environmental Science Press.

TI  - Effects of urbanization on plant-pollinator interactions in the tropics: An experimental approach using exotic plants
PY  - 2020
AB  - Land-use changes through urbanization and biological invasions both threaten plant-pollinator networks. Urban areas host modified bee communities and are characterized by high proportions of exotic plants. Exotic species, either animals or plants, may compete with native species and disrupt plant-pollinator interactions. These threats are heightened in insular systems of the Southwest Pacific, where the bee fauna is generally poor and ecological networks are simplified. However, the impacts of these factors have seldom been studied in tropical contexts. To explore those questions, we installed experimental exotic plant communities in urban and natural contexts in New Caledonia, a plant diversity hotspot. For four weeks, we observed plant-pollinator interactions between local pollinators and our experimental exotic plant communities. We found a significantly higher foraging activity of exotic wild bees within the city, together with a strong plant-pollinator association between two exotic species. However, contrary to our expectations, the landscape context (urban vs. natural) had no effect on the activity of native bees. These results raise issues concerning how species introduced in plant-pollinator networks will impact the reproductive success of both native and exotic plants. Furthermore, the urban system could act as a springboard for alien species to disperse in natural systems and even invade them, leading to conservation concerns. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Landslide mapping and analysis along the China-Pakistan Karakoram Highway based on SBAS-InSAR detection in 2017
PY  - 2021
AB  - The Karakoram Highway (KKH), a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), is a major highway connecting northern Pakistan to China. The inventorying and analysis of landslides along KKH are challenging because of poor accessibility, vast study area, limited availability of ground-based datasets, and the complexity of landslide processes in the region. In order to preserve life, property, and infrastructure, and to enable the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the KKH, it is essential to strengthen measures for the prevention and control of geological disasters. In the present study, SBAS-InSAR (Small Baseline Subsets-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) was used to process 150 scenes of Sentinel 1-A images in the year 2017 along the Karakoram Highway. A total of 762 landslides, including 57 complex landslides, 126 rock falls, 167 debris slides, and 412 unstable slopes, ranging in size between 0.0017 and 10.63 km2 were identified. Moreover, this study also gains an inventory of 40 active glacier movements in this region. Landslide categorization, displacements characteristics, spatial distribution, and their relationship with various contributing factors have been successfully investigated along the entire KKH using image interpretation and frequency-area statistics. The criteria adopted for landslides categorization is presented in the study. The results showed that the 2-D ground deformation derived in Hunza valley echoes well with the general regional landslides characteristics. The spatial distribution analysis revealed that there are clumped distributions of landslides in the Gaizi, Tashkurgan, and Khunjerab in China, as well as in Hunza valley, and north of Chilas city in Pakistan. Statistical results indicated that these landslides mainly occur on south-facing slopes with a slope angle of 20°–45° and elevation relief of 550–2,100 m. Landslide development is also related to low vegetation cover and weathering effects in mountain gullies. Overall, our study provides scientific data support and theoretical references for prevention, control, and mitigation of geological disasters in the Karakoram region.

TI  - A perspective on inhabited urban space: Land use and occupation, heat islands, and precarious urbanization as determinants of territorial receptivity to dengue in the city of Rio de Janeiro
PY  - 2020
AB  - Introduction: Rio de Janeiro is the second-largest city in Brazil, with strong socio-spatial
segregation, and diverse and heterogeneous land use, occupation, and landscapes. The complexity
of dengue requires the construction of surveillance and control tools that take into account the
historical, social, economic, and environmental processes mediated in the territory as a central axis of
public policy. In this context, this study aimed to stratify the city into areas of receptivity to dengue,
using innovative “territorial indicators” because they are built based on the actual occupation of
the territory. Methods: We designed and constructed 17 indicators that sought to characterize the
transformed and inhabited space according to receptivity to dengue. We used data on land use and
occupation, connectivity, climate, and landscape. We developed the dengue receptivity through
principal component analysis (PCA), using multiple criteria analysis and map algebra integrated in a
GIS platform. Results: The most receptive areas were concentrated in the transition between the north
and west zones of the city, a region of unconsolidated urban sprawl. The areas of greatest receptivity
had the highest incidence and density of Aedes eggs during the study period. The correlation between
receptivity index and incidence rate was positive in the epidemic years. Conclusion: The proposed
set of indicators was able to identify areas of greater receptivity, such as regions of disorderly urban
sprawl, with a concentration of social and environmental processes that are related to the occurrence
of dengue outbreaks and high vector density. On the other hand, population immunity plays an
important role in the spatial distribution of dengue during non-epidemic years.

TI  - Evaluation of vegetation patch connectivity using remote sensing and GIS
PY  - 2000
AB  - The UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) Agenda 21 issue for sustainable development emphasizes on an integrated approach for the maintenance and management of land resources. Conservation of biodiversity has become an important environmental issue after the UNCED. Habitat fragmentation caused by the sprawl of urban development is becoming one of the major environmental problems in the Metropolitan suburbs in Japan. The conservation of vegetation areas from urban development as well as creating more such areas has become an essential thought for today for preserving the biodiversity since vegetation area is the remaining habitat for wild-animals and wild-plants. In landscape ecological point of view, the size and distribution pattern of the vegetation patches that has become wildlife habitat and especially the strength of connectivity between such patches are important factors. Study of connectivity was preformed for remaining vegetation patches and their network within central Tokyo region. This research was carried out by applying the techniques of remote sensing to extract the vegetation patches for the study area where as evaluation of the network connectivity was done using GIS. The ranking map for the vegetation patch was generated by considering the relationship between vegetation patches and number of networks. The condition of the vegetation distribution was established based on source and sink habitat in landscape ecology. The quantitative analysis for vegetation distribution patches became possible due to generated networks of the extracted vegetation patches from the satellite data. © 2000 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

TI  - Managing yards for mammals: Mammal species richness peaks in the suburbs
PY  - 2022
AB  - Increased urbanization drives habitat loss, yet residential land-use represents significant habitat potential for mammals and could provide connectivity between patches of green spaces. Diverse mammal communities exist across urban gradients, but it is unclear how mammal community composition varies within residential lands. We conducted a camera trapping study in 36 residential yards across an urban gradient to assess the relative contributions of the degree of urbanization in the land-use context versus parcel habitat features, such as vegetation structure, on mammal community diversity and composition. We hypothesized that land-use context would more strongly influence mammal community metrics than parcel features, and that there would be species-specific differences in response. We detected 14 non-domesticated mammal species and found that species richness peaked in the suburbs and tapered off at the rural and urban ends of the gradient in accordance with patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, yet rarely quantified in mammals. Large-bodied interior forest species were associated with rural sites, urban-dwelling species were associated with urban sites, and suburban sites had an overlap of species types. Although composition of mammal species in residential yards appears to be strongly related to land-use context, which is often outside of residents’ control, management of parcel habitat features such as retention of large mature trees may facilitate connectivity between patches of habitat across urbanizing landscapes. Informed residential yard management remains an important tool for urban wildlife management in an era of global change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Using electric network theory to model the spread of oak processionary moth, Thaumetopoea processionea, in urban woodland patches
PY  - 2015
AB  - Context Habitat fragmentation is increasing as a result of anthropogenic activities, especially in urban areas. Dispersal through fragmented habitats is key for species to spread, persist in metapopulations and shift range in response to climate change. However, high habitat connectivity may also hasten the spread of invasive species. Objective To develop a model of spread in fragmented landscapes and apply it to the spread of an invasive insect in urban woodland. Methods We applied a patch-based model, based on electric network theory, to model the current and predicted future spread of oak processionary moth (OPM: Thaumetopoea processionea) from its source in west London. We compared the pattern of ‘effective distance’ from the source (i.e. the patch ‘voltage’ in the model) with the observed spread of the moth from 2006 to 2012. Results We showed that ‘effective distance’ fitted current spread of OPM. Patches varied considerably in their ‘current’ and ‘power’ (metrics from the model), which is an indication of their importance in the future spread of OPM. Conclusions Patches identified as ‘important’ are potential ‘pinch points’ and regions of high ‘flow’, where resources for detection and management will be most cost-effectively deployed. However, data on OPM dispersal and the distribution of oak trees limited the strength of our conclusions, so should be priorities for further data collection. This application of electric network theory can be used to inform landscape-scale conservation initiatives both to reduce the spread of invasives and to facilitate large-scale species’ range shifts in response to climate change.

TI  - The importance of fragmentation and habitat quality of urban grasslands for butterfly diversity
PY  - 2009
AB  - Parks, remnants of natural habitats and other green areas are important for preserving biodiversity in urban areas. Here, we investigate the relative importance of habitat type and connectivity for butterfly species richness in the city of Malmö, Sweden. Further, we compare species richness and composition in the urban habitats with that in the surrounding agricultural landscape using previously published data. Both butterfly species richness and density increased with decreasing connectivity, measured as the proportion of urban green areas within 1 km, and were higher in ruderal sites than in traditional and semi-natural parks. Species richness was only slightly lower in the urban habitats than in semi-natural grassland remnants in the agricultural landscape surrounding the city and there was only a small difference in β (between site) diversity between urban and semi-natural landscapes. This study highlights the importance of \"townscape\" composition for species richness in urban habitats, but also demonstrates clearly that urban habitats, especially those characterized by an early-successional stage, can be of relatively high conservation value in regions dominated by intensive human land use. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Challenges and tasks of ecobridges in Seoul based on the ecobridge-use behavior survey: In the case of ecobridges in Dongjak-gu and Gwanak-gu
PY  - 2015
AB  - During the past 50 years, there have been strong demands for establishing the North and South Green Network and its eco-corridors to resolve problems of urbanization in Seoul. Following this, from 1994, the Seoul City Government began building ecological paths to re-establish ecological networks. 25 ecocorridors were created between 1994 and 2013 in Seoul, however, the designed eco-corridors presented some problems with biased functions, losing a major objective of eco-corridors which are required to perform as both a citizens' moving route as well as wildlife passage. In addition, eco-corridors in Seoul, a heavily populated city, are not likely to serve the originally intended functions as well as those in natural areas. Accordingly, to appropriately perform its own function as a moving route for humans and wildlife, ecocorridors in urban areas are required to be comprehensively analysed with consideration of both ecological and pedestrian aspects. Study sites have been selected from the green zone of the Gangnam area. Specifically, it includes Seodal-ro, Sadang-ro, Solbat-ro, and Nambusoonhwan-ro, which form a linking footpath between Seodal mountain neighborhood park, Gachi mountain and Gwanak mountain. This study is to examine some issues of the selected urban eco-corridors, which are supposed to act as moving routes for both humans and animals through analysis of the current situation and usebehavior survey of eco-bridges in Seoul, and to interpret the meaning of ecocorridors in urban areas. Through the results of user behavior analysis of four eco-bridges, on one hand, it is found that the appearance frequency of wild animals is very low and species diversity is quite limited. On the other hand, the frequency of human utilization is very high and the purposes of utilization are varied. As known from these results, eco-bridges in Seoul could have more functions and meanings, not only concentrating on the function as a wildlife passage. This study offers the insight that eco-bridges in Seoul could be considered in a broader sense, focusing on human use rather than focusing on their ecological function in a narrow sense. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.

TI  - Urban Patterns and Biological Diversity: A Review
PY  - 2010
AB  - Although many studies have been undertaken and papers published, the understanding of the links between biological diversity and urban areas remains fragmentary and requires a systematic effort to produce a complete picture. The present chapter is a review of the literature, focused almost exclusively on recent publications (published since 2000) of species diversity in urban areas with respect to urban patterns. A variety of perspectives are considered, including the occurrence and distribution of plants and animals in relation to the landscape setting, urban matrix and gradients and the structure, size, age and connectivity of the habitats.Our review reveals that the information is heterogeneous - it differs between taxonomic groups, chosen approaches, scales and methods, and from city to city especially in various geographic regions. In particular, the effect of the landscape setting, urban matrix and habitat connectivity on the biodiversity of urban areas has not been considered insufficiently. The problem is not, as some scientists suggest, a lack of documentation or an inadequate understanding of the distribution of individual taxa in specific cities but the complexity of the determinants and the spatial and temporal dynamic of cities precluding simple answers to explain causal linkages between biological diversity and urban patterns. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The importance of blue and green landscape connectivity for biodiversity in urban ponds
PY  - 2021
AB  - The negative impact of urbanization on biodiversity can be buffered by blue (e.g., rivers, ponds) and green (e.g., parks, forests) spaces. However, to prevent biodiversity loss and reduce the risk of local extinctions, blue and green spaces need to be connected by corridors, so that organisms may disperse between sites. Landscape connectivity affects local community composition and metacommunity dynamics by facilitating dispersal. The goal of this study was to test the relative roles of pond environmental properties, spatial structure, and functional landscape connectivity on differentiation of invertebrate metacommunities in urban ponds in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. We characterized functional connectivity as blue connectivity (distance to water bodies), green connectivity (land use), and combined blue-green connectivity. We estimated functional connectivity by using electrical circuit theory to identify dispersal corridors. Interestingly, while circuit theory is often used in single-taxon studies, this method has rarely been applied to multiple taxa forming a metacommunity, as we have done in this study. Indeed, our study contributes toward an increased focus on the role of dispersal at the metacommunity level. We determined that functional connectivity was the most important factor in explaining community differentiation, with the local environment contributing comparatively little, and spatial structure the least. Combined blue-green functional connectivity had a major influence on structuring urban pond communities, explaining 7.8% of the variance in community composition across ponds. Furthermore, we found that increased functional connectivity was associated with an increase in the number of species. In summary, our results suggest that to preserve biodiversity in urban ponds, it is important to enhance functional connectivity, and that open green spaces could augment blue corridors in maintaining functional connectivity in urban pond metacommunities. To generalize these findings, future urban biodiversity studies should compare how functional connectivity affects metacommunities across multiple major cities. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Remote sensing-based comparative study on the urban ecological quality between chinese and foreign megaci-ties
PY  - 2021
AB  - Megacities are likely to have more significant impacts on regional ecological quality than smaller cities and country areas. Owing to the complex, potentially nonlinear relationship between urban ecological systems and biophysical surface components in megacities, selecting the right quantitative models to evaluate their urban ecological quality is not always clear. Six typical megacities inside and outside China (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, London, New York, and Tokyo) were taken as examples. 7 ecological indicators, including Air Quality Index (AQI), Road Density (RD), Ecological Connectivity Index (ECI), Wetness, Greenness, Dryness, and Heat, were integrated to a new model named as urban remote sensing ecological index (URSEI) using principal component analysis. The URSEI was used to quantitatively evaluate the ecological quality of Chinese and foreign megacities. Results show that London had the best ecological quality (0.542), followed by Guangzhou (0.533), Beijing (0.517), New York (0.511) and Shanghai (0.495). Tokyo had the lowest ecological quality (0. 445). Comparing the 7 indices within the URSEI, the ECI, Wetness and Greenness indices had positive effects on the ecology, while the AQI, RD, Dryness and Heat indices had negative effects. London and Guangzhou had high ECI and Greenness values and low AQI, RD, Dryness and Heat values. Hence, they had better ecological quality than those of the other four megacities. According to the spatial distribution of the URSEI, urban centers that were covered by high ratio of impervious surfaces and low ratio of vegetation had low ecological connectivity between the ecological land patches and had severe heat island effects and air pollution, which resulted in poor ecological quality. Areas covered by large amounts of vegetation had high Greenness and ECI values, and low Dryness, Heat and AQI values, which helped to improve the ecological quality. The URSEI can be used both as a quantitative indicator to describe the re-gional ecological quality, and to describe the spatial difference in the ecological quality of megacities. © 2021, China Environmental Science Press.

TI  - Demographic consequences of terrestrial habitat loss for pool-breeding amphibians: Predicting extinction risks associated with inadequate size of buffer zones
PY  - 2008
AB  - Much of the biodiversity associated with isolated wetlands requires aquatic and terrestrial habitat to maintain viable populations. Current federal wetland regulations in the United States do not protect isolated wetlands or extend protection to surrounding terrestrial habitat. Consequently, some land managers, city planners, and policy makers at the state and local levels are making an effort to protect these wetland and neighboring upland habitats. Balancing human land-use and habitat conservation is challenging, and well-informed land-use policy is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the specific risks of varying amounts of habitat loss. Using projections of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) populations, we related the amount of high-quality terrestrial habitat surrounding isolated wetlands to the decline and risk of extinction of local amphibian populations. These simulations showed that current state-level wetland regulations protecting 30 m or less of surrounding terrestrial habitat are inadequate to support viable populations of pool-breeding amphibians. We also found that species with different life-history strategies responded differently to the loss and degradation of terrestrial habitat. The wood frog, with a short life span and high fecundity, was most sensitive to habitat loss and isolation, whereas the longer-lived spotted salamander with lower fecundity was most sensitive to habitat degradation that lowered adult survival rates. Our model results demonstrate that a high probability of local amphibian population persistence requires sufficient terrestrial habitat, the maintenance of habitat quality, and connectivity among local populations. Our results emphasize the essential role of adequate terrestrial habitat to the maintenance of wetland biodiversity and ecosystem function and offer a means of quantifying the risks associated with terrestrial habitat loss and degradation. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.

TI  - Effects of Prevention and Control Measures of Soil Erosion on Molecular Ecological Network of Soil Microbial Community in Pinus massoniana Plantation
PY  - 2022
AB  - 【Objective】 Prevention and control measures of soil erosion can restore forest vegetation and improve soil quality, and hence affect the soil microbial community structure. Soil microbes play an important role in soil substance recycling. Thus, it is of great significance to explore changes in soil biochemical processes and to study the effects of typical prevention and control measures of soil erosion on the interactions between soil microbial community. Ecological network analysis can be used to reveal microbial interactions and microbial network structure. However, it is still unclear how prevention and control measures of soil erosion affect the microbial interaction network in Pinus massoniana plantation. There are few researches exploring soil microbial interactions and the changes in environmental factors caused by agricultural engineering measures and vegetation planting. 【Method】 In this paper, a one-year field experiment was carried out in Pinus massoniana plantation of the Institute of Soil and Water Conservation of Shaoyang City (111°22′E, 27°03′N), Hunan Province, China. The experiment was designed to have three treatments, one for digging fish-scale pits and planting grass, one for digging fish-scale pits and planting grass and shrubs and another for a control check without any measure; three replicates were conducted for each treatment. One year later, soil samples were collected from the three treatments, separately, for analysis of soil physicochemical properties and DNAs. The 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology was used to determine the soil microbial community structure under different treatments, and the random matrix method was used to construct the microbial network. 【Result】After implementation of prevention and control measures of soil erosion, soil microbial community composition changed as the relative abundance of Chloroflexi significantly decreased and that of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria significantly increased. Ecological network analysis showed that the total nodes, total links, average connective degree, and the modularity of the microbial network increased. This indicated an increase in the microbial network scale and complicated microbial interactions. Three microbial networks were dominated by negative interactions (60.59%～67.49%), and the competition between species was strengthened after the implementation of the two measures. Parts of the microbial communities of Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria played an important connecting role in the microbial network of the study area. Also, some key microbial communities with low relative abundance (&lt; 1%) played a key role in the establishment of the microbial network. The average path distance of microbial networks became longer after the implementation of the measures. This means that the response rate of microbial action slowed down and the stability of the community structure was improved. Additionally, the measure of digging fish-scale pits and planting grass and shrubs was more effective than digging fish-scale pits and planting grass. Soil bulk density (R2 = 0.465, P &lt; 0.05), pH (R2 = 0.377, P &lt; 0.05), soil organic matter (R2 = 0.383, P &lt; 0.05), and total nitrogen (R2 = 0.545, P &lt; 0.01) had significant influence on bacterial community structure while soil water content (R2 = 0.485, P &lt; 0.05) had a significant influence on fungal community structure. 【Conclusion】After implementation of prevention and control measures of soil erosion (i) soil microbial community structure changed, (ii) the microbial network scale, interaction and stability increased, and (iii) the competition within soil microbial communities became more intensive. © 2022 Science Press.

TI  - Potential incorporation of the Morava river into the urban ecosystem of Olomouc, the Czech Republic
PY  - 2003
AB  - Urban-ecological study belongs to a complex of solutions to flood protection issues affecting urban areas in the Czech Republic. These solutions are largely a response to the destructive summer floods of 1997 and 2001. This presentation focuses on the Morava river in Olomouc (Czech Republic, Central Moravia). The study's ecological component concentrates on the construction of the river's ecological continuum throughout an urban area being situated in the river's flood-plain, providing legitimacy to the principle requirement of inhabitant's flood protection. This idea is exercised partly on the river channel (lengthwise river continuum), partly on shore, in the corridor of the newly built inundation area. Restorations arise from the river's channel onto the alluvium, thereby the transverse and upright ecological continuum is renovated. Restorations rely on extant ecological structural elements and relationships and they pay attention to the concept of preservation and the next re-enforcement of ecological structure, including ecological relationships. In this way, the principles of renewal of the river landscape's ecological continuum are exerted. The goal is to arrive at that point where the inhabitants perceive the river as a positive natural element in the urban ecosystem while providing for the free movement of wildlife.

TI  - Drivers of compositional dissimilarity for native and alien birds: the relative roles of human activity and environmental suitability
PY  - 2020
AB  - We assessed the relative importance of human activity and environmental suitability as drivers of compositional dissimilarity of alien birds for 65 of the most populous cities of the Iberian Peninsula. We examined how these drivers relate to Zeta diversity (ζ) for alien Passeriformes and Psittaciformes. We performed the analysis using multiple orders of ζ, which provides insight on the role played by rare and common species in determining levels of dissimilarity. We also ran the analyses using the community of native Passeriformes as a phylogenetically close contrasting control. Our results showed that the proportion of urban area, a variable related to colonization and propagule pressure, had a strong influence on Psittaciformes but not on alien Passeriformes. This latter group showed to be primarily influenced by environmental factors, similarly to what was found for native Passeriformes. On other hand, human connectivity, as measured by distance through roads and railways seemed to play a significant role in shaping the compositional dissimilarity of alien Passeriformes, but not Psittaciformes. Regardless of the group analysed, the relative importance of the explanatory variables was similar for both rare and common species. Our findings highlight differences between the factors driving compositional dissimilarity for distinct groups of birds. While the emerging biogeography of Psittaciformes is mainly a reflection of distinctiveness in urban areas, alien Passeriformes are more strongly affected by the natural environment and thus their biogeography may increasingly resemble the one of their native counterparts. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Ungulates in the city: light pollution and open habitats predict the probability of roe deer occurring in an urban environment
PY  - 2019
AB  - Although large and medium-sized herbivorous mammals avoid urbanized areas, they have recently begun to colonize towns and cities. In general, ungulates continue to avoid the centres of urban areas, and utilize mainly their thinly built-up outskirts. While extension of urban development is preventing ungulates from penetrating the urban landscape, the influence of noise and light pollution on the occurrence of mammalian herbivores is still poorly understood. Hence, we investigated the hypothesis that habitat availability shapes the distribution of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and artificial lightening discourages them from penetrating the urban landscape. Roe deer was recorded on 37% of randomly selected sample plots (N = 60) located within the city of Kraków (S Poland). The occupied plots contained significantly more open habitats, woodland patches were larger in them, but proximity to rivers, and noise and light pollution were significantly lower. The logistic regression model revealed that an increasing area of open habitats was positively correlated with the probability of roe deer occurring. However, the artificial lighting at night was negatively correlated with the probability of the species occurring: the negative effect of light pollution was mitigated by the greater area of open habitats. Our study highlights the very considerable potential of light pollution as a predictor of the occurrence of large mammals in the urban landscape. We argue that urbanization and the related artificial lighting at night may be a factor preventing ungulates from penetrating potentially suitable habitats in urban areas. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Effects of urban greenspace configuration and native vegetation on bee and wasp reproduction
PY  - 2021
AB  - Pollinator welfare is a recognized research and policy target, and urban greenspaces have been identified as important habitats. Yet, landscape-scale habitat fragmentation and greenspace management practices may limit a city's conservation potential. We examined how landscape configuration, composition, and local patch quality influenced insect nesting success across inner-city Cleveland, Ohio (U.S.A.), a postindustrial legacy city containing a high abundance of vacant land (over 1600 ha). Here, 40 vacant lots were assigned 1 of 5 habitat treatments (T1, vacant lot; T2, grass lawn; T3, flowering lawn; T4, grass prairie; and T5, flowering prairie), and we evaluated how seeded vegetation, greenspace size, and landscape connectivity influenced cavity-nesting bee and wasp reproduction. Native bee and wasp larvae were more abundant in landscapes that contained a large patch (i.e., >6 ha) of contiguous greenspace, in habitats with low plant biomass, and in vacant lots seeded with a native wildflower seed mix or with fine-fescue grass, suggesting that fitness was influenced by urban landscape features and habitat management. Our results can guide urban planning by demonstrating that actions that maintain large contiguous greenspace in the landscape and establish native plants would support the conservation of bees and wasps. Moreover, our study highlights that the world's estimated 350 legacy cities are promising urban conservation targets due to their high abundance of vacant greenspace that could accommodate taxa's habitat needs in urban areas. © 2021 Society for Conservation Biology

TI  - Soil microbial communities shift along an urban gradient in Berlin, Germany
PY  - 2022
AB  - The microbial communities inhabiting urban soils determine the functioning of these soils, in regards to their ability to cycle nutrients and support plant communities. In an increasingly urbanized world these properties are of the utmost importance, and the microbial communities responsible are worthy of exploration. We used 53 grassland sites spread across Berlin to describe and explain the impacts of urbanity and other environmental parameters upon the diversity and community composition of four microbial groups. These groups were (i) the Fungi, with a separate dataset for (ii) the Glomeromycota, (iii) the Bacteria, and (iv) the protist phylum Cercozoa. We found that urbanity had distinct impacts on fungal richness, which tended to increase. Geographic distance between sites and soil chemistry, in addition to urbanity, drove microbial community composition, with site connectivity being important for Glomeromycotan communities, potentially due to plant host communities. Our findings suggest that many microbial species are well adapted to urban soils, as supported by an increase in diversity being a far more common result of urbanity than the reverse. However, we also found distinctly separate distributions of operational taxonomic unit (OTU)s from the same species, shedding doubt of the reliability of indicator species, and the use of taxonomy to draw conclusion on functionality. Our observational study employed an extensive set of sites across an urbanity gradient, in the region of the German capital, to produce a rich microbial dataset; as such it can serve as a blueprint for other such investigations.

TI  - Determination of runoff response to variation in overland flow area by flow routes using UAV imagery
PY  - 2020
AB  - Surface runoff can be routed to both pervious areas (PAs) and drainage systems during an overland flow. Excessive runoff from an impervious area (IA) flowing into a drainage system causes an overload, which can be relieved by diverting runoff to PAs. However, the hydrological link between IAs and PAs, especially the runoff response to variation in overland flow areas (OFAs), has not well been considered in runoff simulations due to the complexity of routing. To understand how the OFA within an IA contributes to runoff generation, a novel classification approach was applied to categorize the IA in a study area in Nanjing University, Xianlin campus, China into directly connected impervious area (DCIA) and indirectly connected impervious area (ICIA) by flow routes using high-resolution ground-based images (0.5 m) from an unmanned aerial vehicle. The OFAs then include DCIA and the total impervious area (TIA), which is the sum of DCIA and ICIA. The runoff simulations were supported by Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) calibrated with observed rainfall and runoff data. The resulting proportions of DCIA and ICIA of the study area were 34.13% and 10.99%, respectively. The spatial distributions of DCIA and ICIA are characterized by the subcatchment landscape heterogeneity resulting from vegetation, imperviousness, and slope. The observed runoff coefficients and peak flows were positively correlated with the percentages of DCIA and TIA. The runoff coefficient was significantly correlated with the DCIA in a light rainfall event of 18.4 mm (R2 =0.82) and with the TIA in a heavy rainfall event of 119 mm (R2 =0.92). Runoff generation is affected by both the characteristics of the rainfall event and the accompaning variations in OFAs. Results indicate that increasing of the flow connectivity from IAs to PAs and increasing the water retention capacity of PAs may be effective strategies for optimizing landscape patterns for stormwater management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Connectivity as a tool in the prioritization and protection of sub-urban forest patches in landscape conservation planning
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanisation development influences surrounding landscape processes, which are reflected by landscape structural patterns. Forest areas are often regarded as a spatial reserve for present and future urbanisation needs, while at the same time they often represent the last remnant of natural environment. In the present research we analysed (1) the change in forest cover in the area of suburban forests of Ljubljana between 1975 and 2012, (2) the connectivity and conservation buffers as one of the foundations for the assessment of biodiversity functions. Between 1975 and 2012, all the forests with important cores were subject to clearings for settlement- and agricultural purposes, but clearing usually did not extend beyond forest edges. The real fragmentation occurred during the construction of the highway beltline. In the area of Ljubljana, connectivity changes and connectivity loss in two different time periods are presented by a spatial model based on the Graph Theory which can also be used in spatial planning.Due to the high percentage of forest cover and the favourable distribution of forest patches and cores around the city of Ljubljana, no connection is currently in danger; the weakest link is stretching from the centre of Ljubljana towards the southeast. In the process of evaluating the biodiversity of urban forests, it will be necessary to add connectivity among forest cores as an important index while evaluating the favourable conditions of different habitat types. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Urban specialization reduces habitat connectivity by a highly mobile wading bird
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background: Mobile animals transport nutrients and propagules across habitats, and are crucial for the functioning of food webs and for ecosystem services. Human activities such as urbanization can alter animal movement behavior, including site fidelity and resource use. Because many urban areas are adjacent to natural sites, mobile animals might connect natural and urban habitats. More generally, understanding animal movement patterns in urban areas can help predict how urban expansion will affect the roles of highly mobile animals in ecological processes. Methods: Here, we examined movements by a seasonally nomadic wading bird, the American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), in South Florida, USA. White ibis are colonial wading birds that forage on aquatic prey; in recent years, some ibis have shifted their behavior to forage in urban parks, where they are fed by people. We used a spatial network approach to investigate how individual movement patterns influence connectivity between urban and non-urban sites. We built a network of habitat connectivity using GPS tracking data from ibis during their non-breeding season and compared this network to simulated networks that assumed individuals moved indiscriminately with respect to habitat type. Results: We found that the observed network was less connected than the simulated networks, that urban-urban and natural-natural connections were strong, and that individuals using urban sites had the least-variable habitat use. Importantly, the few ibis that used both urban and natural habitats contributed the most to connectivity. Conclusions: Habitat specialization in urban-acclimated wildlife could reduce the exchange of propagules and nutrients between urban and natural areas, which has consequences both for beneficial effects of connectivity such as gene flow and for detrimental effects such as the spread of contaminants or pathogens. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Fine-scale variation within urban landscapes affects marking patterns and gastrointestinal parasite diversity in red foxes
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban areas are often considered to be a hostile environment for wildlife as they are highly fragmented and frequently disturbed. However, these same habitats can contain abundant resources, while lacking many common competitors and predators. The urban environment can have a direct impact on the species living there but can also have indirect effects on their parasites and pathogens. To date, relatively few studies have measured how fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within urban landscapes can affect parasite transmission and persistence. Here, we surveyed 237 greenspaces across the urban environment of Edinburgh (UK) to investigate how fine-scale variation in socio-economic and ecological variables can affect red fox (Vulpes vulpes) marking behavior, gastrointestinal (GI) parasite prevalence, and parasite community diversity. We found that the presence and abundance of red fox fecal markings were nonuniformly distributed across greenspaces and instead were dependent on the ecological characteristics of a site. Specifically, common foraging areas were left largely unmarked, which indicates that suitable resting and denning sites may be limiting factor in urban environments. In addition, the amount of greenspace around each site was positively correlated with overall GI parasite prevalence, species richness, and diversity, highlighting the importance of greenspace (a commonly used measure of landscape connectivity) in determining the composition of the parasite community in urban areas. Our results suggest that fine-scale variation within urban environments can be important for understanding the ecology of infectious diseases in urban wildlife and could have wider implication for the management of urban carnivores. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Natural, not urban, barriers define population structure for a coastal endemic butterfly
PY  - 2010
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are the major causes of biodiversity loss, and, increasingly, habitat is fragmented by urbanization. Yet, the degree to which urbanization creates barriers to animal dispersal remains poorly understood. We used population genetic techniques to determine whether urbanization and/or natural landscape features are dispersal barriers to a butterfly, Atrytonopsis new species 1, throughout its range on coastal sand dunes that are increasingly threatened by development. Using AFLP markers that produced 89 polymorphic loci, we found significant population structure across the range of Atrytonopsis sp1. We found no indication that existing levels of urbanization were barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 dispersal. Rather, two natural barriers, an ocean inlet and maritime forest, explained the genetic structure. Even in areas with long histories of urbanization, we found no significant isolation-by-distance relationship, and there was very low genetic differentiation between sampling locations. Consequently, conservation strategies for Atrytonopsis sp1, and potentially for other mobile insects that use open-structured habitats, should not focus explicitly on habitat corridors through urban areas, but rather should seek to preserve and restore as much habitat as possible across the butterfly's range. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Can habitat quality index measured using the invest model explain variations in bird diversity in an urban area?
PY  - 2021
AB  - Biodiversity maintenance is a crucial ecosystem service. Due to time limits and data availability, assessing biodiversity using indicators or models has become a hot topic in recent decades. However, whether some proposed indicators can explain biodiversity well at the local scale is still unclear. This study attempted to test whether the habitat quality index (HQI) as measured using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs (InVEST) model could explain variations in bird diversity in New Jiangwan Town, a rapidly urbanized region of Shanghai, China. The relationships from 2002 to 2013 among HQI and the two diversity indices, species richness and species abundance, were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test and gray correlation analysis. No significant association was found. Habitat connectivity was then integrated to develop a new combined indicator of habitat quality and connectivity index (HQCI). The associations between HQCI and the two diversity indices were improved significantly. The results indicated that connectivity may be an important factor explaining the diversity of certain species at a local scale. More empirical studies should be conducted to provide scientific evidence relating habitat quality to biodiversity.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors related to the invasion of Hypochaeris radicata in South Korea
PY  - 2022
AB  - Early detection of the spatial expansion pattern of alien plants and the associated environmental factors are essential for their management. In this study, we applied regression kriging and geographically weighted regression, which can incorporate spatial autocorrelation into the model, to estimate the critical environmental factors related to the invasion of Hypochaeris radicata into new habitats. We spatially interpolated the occurrence probabilities of H. radicata based on field survey data from 2000–2001 and 2018–2020 to compare the distribution pattern of this species over 20 years. Further, we evaluated the relative importance of environmental variables for the invasion of H. radicata using geographically weighted regression. Based on the results of our model, the expansion of H. radicata was found to be significantly associated with anthropogenic activities, such as human footprinting (HFP) and residential area, and the transportation system area. These results suggest that the primary dispersal forces of H. radicata are human activities, and that roads may be the main corridor of its expansion. Additionally, H. radicata did not invade the forest area over the 20 years. We can predict that this plant may flourish better around big cities because of human activities. Furthermore, deforestation and sporadic mowing can accelerate the expansion of H. radicata because of its preference for sunny spots. © 2022

TI  - Wetland landscape pattern change and its driving forces in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in recent 30 years
PY  - 2018
AB  - Wetlands, which are among the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, are areas where aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems converge. Wetland environments are threatened by the rapid urbanization and socio-economic development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the wetland landscape and its driving forces in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region following GIS and principal component analysis methods. The results are as follows: (1) From the late 1980s to 2015, the wetland area slightly increased and then rapidly decreased, however this decreasing trend slowed slightly over the last ten years. The wetland area of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region decreased by 2695.05 km2, a reduction of 20.08%. The largest reduction occurred in Hebei Province, which is dominated by natural wetlands, followed by Tianjin and Beijing City. (2) Wetland areas were mainly lost in Bohai Bay, Beijing City, and the Zhangjiakou and Tangshan Cities of Hebei Province. (3) Paddy, reservoir, and pond wetlands are the dominant landscape types. Fragmentation is serious and the degree of aggregation is low in lake, river and canal, and beach landscapes, indicating that the spatial distribution of wetlands is discrete with poor connectivity. (4) The driving forces were analyzed using nine indicators following the principal component analysis method. The result showed that human activities were the main driving forces, and urban expansion and agricultural development were the main pathways of degradation. Additionally, the wetland landscape is also influenced by policy and the climate. © 2018 Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Urban stream rehabilitation - Lessons (to be) learned from URBEM project
PY  - 2005
AB  - One of the most important aspects in the development of the modern world is the rapid movement of people from rural places to urban centres. The environment of urban areas extends far beyond their boundaries; in the context of rivers, these are modified to meet the needs of the urban population and often act as conduits for wastewaters. Historically, development of watercourses has been undertaken for a variety of reasons such as water supply, navigation or flood control. Throughout historic development urban watercourses have gradually been converted from natural rive beds to confined narrow river corridors with the channels canalised in concrete and other man-made materials forming both the bed and banks of the river. In many cases they have been culverted and converts into covered combined sewers. Within urban areas, management and control of a watercourse are used to prevent or reduce bank erosion, flooding and increased pollutant loads, but may also be used for the protection of the natural hydraulic conditions and urban aquatic habitats. The urban communities expect protection from floods, and there are public health and safety issues from water quality and the proximity of running water. Resolving the conflicts over watercourse functions is particularly complex in urban areas, and urban watercourses are seen as an important element in an integrated urban water management cycle (Maksimović & Tejada-Guibert, 2001). Many urban streams have been converted into closed conduit sewers, and now receive both storm drainage and raw or dilute sewage from the surrounding area. The pollutant loading also frequently leads to poor water quality, indeed this adverse impact of urbanisation often extends to the watercourses downstream of the urban area. In some cases the bacteriological or chemical quality of urban streams may present a severe threat to public health. The result is that many urban watercourses have virtually no aesthetic or amenity value, support a limited range of ecosystems, and do not meet the water quality objectives prescribed by the EC Water Framework Directive (WFD). Modification of watercourses is recognised in European legislation through the Water Framework Directive, which defines a “heavily modified water body” as a “body of surface water, which as a result of physical alterations by human activity is substantially changed in character”. The WFD provides the basis for long-term, sustainable development, enhancement and planning of European rivers with an emphasis on natural ecosystems, and intrinsic wildlife value. The pressure on European urban centres has increased significantly over the past century, with higher population densities, together with expectations of many for an improved quality of life. Improvement of the river systems through urban areas in terms of quality, ecology, aesthetics and amenity values is vital in the movement towards an environmentally sustainable future for cities in Europe. The URBEM project (http://www.urbem.net/theproject.html) investigated various aspects of new techniques and materials for bringing file back to urban streams in order to provide long term sustainable solutions and to enhance the visual and ecological values. The approach of URBEM is based on the belief that the whole river corridor and its interactions with the urban environment are an integral part of the system (Gardiner, 1992). This paper (and the lecture that follows) presents the educational - capacity building component of the project. The educational tool that will be developed at the end of the project is an overarching framework which integrates the educational elements of the other 10 work packages and presents them in the form suitable for running various forms of training - capacity building of the defined target groups. © 31st IAHR Congress 2005: Water Engineering for the Future, Choices and Challenges.

TI  - The effect of habitat changes along the urbanization gradient for breeding birds: an example from the Xiong'an New Area.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background Because of its status as an ecocivilization pilot city, fundamental research on spatial distribution patterns and impact factors of the avian community within the Xiong'an New Area is necessary for future ecological planning and mitigation of negative impacts from future urbanization. Gradient research within small cities can provide important information for the development of urbanization gradient patterns of avian communities. Methods A total of 30 sample points within the urbanization gradient were selected, and avian communities and environmental variables were measured within a 50 m radius sample circle. Principal component regression analysis was used to analyze bird-environment relationships. The Sorensen dissimilarity index was used to calculate the beta-diversity. Results Our results showed that there was a significant urban-rural pattern with a gradient phenomenon in avian communities. Results of this study showed more resident, passenger and insectivore species, and a higher density of breeding insectivore and omnivore individuals appear in the urban fringe than in the other areas. A relatively high value of overall beta-diversity and spatial isolation probably exists among the three disjunct constructed regions. Both species richness and individual abundance were significantly influenced by the species diversity of the trees and foliage height diversity (FHD). Discussion Based on our results and our goal of avian species diversity conservation, we first suggest that urban green spaces be established and ensure a high complexity of vegetation structure as this is critically needed to increase avian species α-diversity within habitat patches. Second, different habitat types within and around the three constructed areas should be developed based on the important existing bird habitats to increase avian diversity in each city, especially in the areas within Xiongxian and Rongcheng that are well protected, and to elevate the beta-diversity of the total region. Finally, based on the biodiversity hotspots identified by this research, ecological corridors should be carefully planned to improve the stability of regional bird communities.

TI  - Importance of matrix permeability and quantity of core habitat for persistence of a threatened saltmarsh bird
PY  - 2013
AB  - Species habitat preferences can be obscured when individuals have been recorded in non-core habitats because of dispersal, spillover effects or spatial errors in observation locations. Disentangling the direct effects of the habitats species are observed in from the effects of proximity to other nearby habitats is especially challenging in fragmented landscapes, as many fragmentation metrics are correlated and it is difficult to prove independent effects. In this paper we addressed this issue by comparing a number of models based on predefined ecological theories. We compared models based on quantity of core habitat surrounding observations, proximity to core habitat, or a combination of the two to explain the observed distribution of the saltmarsh inhabiting white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) in coastal New South Wales, Australia. Proximity to core habitat was considered as either Euclidean distance or cost distance, and models were assessed using Akaike's information criterion and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve on 10 random subsets of the data. We found that all models performed similarly, with the combination of cost distance and the quantity of saltmarsh performing better, but not significantly so. We compared the advantages and disadvantages of different models and also present a model averaged result. Our models suggested that the majority of saltmarshes in New South Wales were too small to have a large effect on probability of occurrence. As climate change is expected to further reduce the amount of available saltmarsh through continued mangrove incursion, coastal populations of the white-fronted chat are expected to come under increasing threat. The conversion of grasslands to urban areas may also increase the effective distance between different populations of the species and reduce gene flow and rescue effects. © 2012 Ecological Society of Australia.

TI  - The influence of forest definition on landscape fragmentation assessment in Rondônia, Brazil
PY  - 2009
AB  - Estimates of tropical deforestation and forest degradation are misleading, partly because different studies make use of different forest definitions. This paper investigates the influence of this confusion on the assessment of forest extent and its spatial distribution, by means of fine-scaled land cover maps and landscape metrics. The state of Rondônia, Brazil, located in the southwestern part of the Amazon basin and known for its fishbone-like pattern of deforestation, is used as a study area. A 1:250 000 vector data product from the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE), describing the land cover type in a three-step hierarchy specifying canopy density, topography, and dominant life forms, was rasterized and analyzed. Forest subcategories were aggregated into a seven level gradient, ranging from a level that is very specific and only includes dense multi-layered rain forest, to less strict levels containing open forest systems, secondary vegetation, and tree savannas. We show that there is a consistent difference between the initial class aggregation level, and all other levels, which gradually broaden the forest definition and are characterized by very distinct ecological parameters, such as a higher mean patch size, increased levels of landscape connectivity and slightly more irregularly shaped patches. We recommend a harmonization of the major forest definitions in use today, while taking care not to lose the relevant ecological information that can be extracted from its most detailed classification level. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The search for fragmentation thresholds in a Southern Sydney Suburb
PY  - 2005
AB  - Fragmentation of habitat is recognised as the number one threat to biodiversity and as such has attracted considerable research. However, much of this research has been conducted in forestry and agricultural environments, with little research in urban areas. In this study, field surveys were conducted measuring the impact of fragmentation on bird, frog, plant and fungi species richness, within the fragmented urban landscape of southern Sydney. Of all fragmentation parameters examined, remnant area was the best and most significant predictor of species richness for all taxa studied. Remnant size thresholds, below which biodiversity declined rapidly, were observed at approximately 4 ha for bird and frog species richness and approximately 2 ha for plant and fungal species richness. A further threshold appears to exist at approximately 50 ha for the dominance of forest interior species. Further relationships were also observed for perimeter:area ratio, indicating the influence of various edge effects on all taxa. Isolation effects were observed in the form of an inverse linear relationship between distance to other large reserves and species richness for fungi, birds and frogs. Corridor connectivity also produced an overall positive relationship for birds, frogs and plants. It is concluded that the identification of fragmentation thresholds and relationships provides an important management tool for the design of networks aimed at conserving biodiversity in fragmented urban environments. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Construction of urban and rural ecological network in Yanqing District of Beijing based on MSPA model
PY  - 2020
AB  - Objective: With the rapid development of Beijing's urbanization, Beijing's ecological environment tends to deteriorate and urban ecological security faces enormous challenges. The construction of ecological network can mitigate the damage caused by the rapid urbanization and the fragmentation of urban and rural landscapes and is of great significance for the protection of urban biodiversity.Method: This paper selects Yanqing District of Beijing as the research area. Based on the ArcGIS software platform, the remote sensing image of Yanqing District of Beijing was interpreted to obtain the land cover type. The land cover type was divided into foreground and background by the ArcGIS. The analysis method (MSPA) obtained seven types of landscape types and identified the core area as an important ecological source. The accumulative cost distance model and the network analysis were used to obtain the ecological network under the best threshold. Based on this, the ecological network optimization proposal of Yanqing District was proposed.Result: (1) The overall fragmentation degree in Yanqing District was low, the material and energy migration among different types were relatively smooth and the overall landscape diversity was higher, but the number of habitat patches in the city was less and the corridor was scarce; (2) the distance threshold, which was most suitable for the current structure of the ecological network in Yanqing District was 20 000 m and the network closure degree α was 0.73; (3) woodland and cultivated land were important landscape types of potential ecological corridors in the study area and forest area was the largest, it was 17 452.9 ha, accounting for 81.1% of the total corridor area.Conclusion: The MSPA method has the advantages of accurate and detailed evaluation of geometric connectivity, small amount of data required and visualization of analysis results. The network analysis method could optimize the ecological network. Therefore, based on the MSPA method and network analysis method, the accuracy of the ecological network construction in Yanqing District is more detailed and accurate. The research results have important guiding and practical value for the construction of ecological network and biodiversity protection in Yanqing District. The ecological network construction in Yanqing District could provide a reference for the other areas. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Forestry University. All right reserved.

TI  - A bird’s eye view: using circuit theory to study urban landscape connectivity for birds
PY  - 2017
AB  - Connectivity is fundamental to understanding how landscape form influences ecological function. However, uncertainties persist due to the difficulty and expense of gathering empirical data to drive or to validate connectivity models, especially in urban areas, where relationships are multifaceted and the habitat matrix cannot be considered to be binary. This research used circuit theory to model urban bird flows (i.e. ‘current’), and compared results to observed abundance. The aims were to explore the ability of this approach to predict wildlife flows and to test relationships between modelled connectivity and variation in abundance. Circuitscape was used to model functional connectivity in Bedford, Luton/Dunstable, and Milton Keynes, UK, for great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), drawing parameters from published studies of woodland bird flows in urban environments. Model performance was then tested against observed abundance data. Modelled current showed a weak yet positive agreement with combined abundance for P. major and C. caeruleus. Weaker correlations were found for other woodland species, suggesting the approach may be expandable if re-parameterised. Trees provide suitable habitat for urban woodland bird species, but their location in large, contiguous patches and corridors along barriers also facilitates connectivity networks throughout the urban matrix. Urban connectivity studies are well-served by the advantages of circuit theory approaches, and benefit from the empirical study of wildlife flows in these landscapes to parameterise this type of modelling more explicitly. Such results can prove informative and beneficial in designing urban green space and new developments.

TI  - Breeding bird community of a suburban habitat Island: Historic Bethabara Park, Winston-Salem, NC
PY  - 2014
AB  - Habitat islands, corridors, and patches within the urban-rural mosaic provide important resources for migratory and resident species and may be crucial for breeding success and survival. In suburban areas, corridor width and patch size are strongly correlated with community composition. We assessed the breeding bird community in the Historic Bethabara Park Complex (HBPC) by territory mapping during April-July 2009 and 2010. HBPC is a 77-ha habitat island in Winston-Salem (Forsyth County), NC. We detected 109 bird species in HBPC, including 60 for which we documented at least 1 breeding territory in either year. Each year we found territories of 58 species; 57 species were the same between years. The majority of birds encountered in this study nest in the canopy, in shrubs, or in cavities. The breeding community was roughly split between migrants (32) and residents (34) and included 3 exotic species. We documented territories for 10 woodland interior specialists including Hylocichla mustelina (Wood Thrush), Seiurus aurocapilla (Ovenbird), and Piranga olivacea (Scarlet Tanager). Two of these observed bird species-Wood Thrush and Sitta pusilla (Brown-headed Nuthatch)-are designated as US birds of conservation concern by Partners in Flight (PIF). Eight of the species we documented are considered by PIF to be species of conservation concern in the Piedmont Region during the breeding season and and 3 of these are common species in steep decline: Chaetura pelagica (Chimney Swift), Megaceryle alcyon (Belted Kingfisher), and Colaptes auratus (Northern Flicker). HBPC is historically and currently species-rich and has a community composition similar to that seen in other NC Piedmont studies. We recommend periodic monitoring as the local landscape and climate change. Further research is needed to determine to what degree the park complex functions as an oasis or population sink for the bird community, especially for forest-interior obligates, Neotropical migrants, and species of concern.

TI  - The contribution of motorway stormwater retention ponds to the biodiversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates
PY  - 2009
AB  - Biodiversity conservation does predominantly focus on protected natural areas, but has to consider also the usually Human-dominated matrix in which these natural areas are embedded. Here we study highway stormwater retention ponds, which may act as refuges for native flora and fauna and contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in Human-dominated landscapes. However, the biodiversity supported by such artificial ponds has received little attention so far. Using standardised methods, we addressed the potential role of highway stormwater ponds as refuges by comparing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Gastropoda) in highway stormwater ponds with ponds in the wider landscape. As expected from their pollutant retention function, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. However, they supported aquatic macroinvertebrate communities at least as rich and diverse at the family level as surrounding ponds and exhibited similar variability in family community composition and structure. The main difference we observed was a higher abundance of small and/or short-lived invertebrates in the highway ponds. These similar community compositions and structures suggest that highway ponds contribute to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Thus, road practitioners should consider highway ponds not only for their hydrological and pollutant retaining purposes but also as a possibility to increase the role of highway verges as a refuge and, consequently, landscape connectivity. The management of these water bodies should recognise their potential for biodiversity especially in Human-dominated landscapes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Role of urban green spaces for saproxylic beetle conservation: a case study of tenebrionids in Rome, Italy
PY  - 2016
AB  - Forested urban areas provide many important ecosystem services and their preservation is considered of paramount importance. Although urban forest are known to host a high diversity of saproxylic beetles (i.e. those associated with dead wood), contributions dealing with the role of urban green spaces for their conservation are lacking. We investigated the importance of urban green spaces for saproxylic and non-saproxylic tenebrionid beetles in urban Rome. Based on species vulnerability scores we calculated two indices of area prioritisation, the Biodiversity Conservation Concern (BCC) and the Biodiversity Conservation Weight (BCW) for saproxylic and non-saproxylic species. Site area and forest surface correlated positively with saproxylic richness, whereas site isolation correlated negatively with non-saproxylic richness. BCC and BCW values for saproxylic species were positively correlated with distance from the city centre. For non-saproxylic species, BCW values were negatively correlated with distance from adjacent areas. These results suggest that saproxylic beetles require large areas covered by forest, but are not strongly influenced by isolation, which is important for non-saproxylic species. Non-saproxylic tenebrionids have limited dispersal capabilities, which explains their sensitivity to isolation, but are generally eurytopic species frequently found even in the city centre. By contrast, most saproxylic species are able to fly, but are mainly found in peripheral areas with large and relatively well preserved forest fragments. Maintaining and possibly enhancing connectivity among green spaces is important for the conservation of non-saproxylic species, whereas preserving large forest surfaces, especially in peripheral areas, is needed for the conservation of saproxylic species. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Spatial ecology of an urban eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) population: Local decline driven by kangaroo-vehicle collisions
PY  - 2018
AB  - Context: As urban landscapes proliferate globally, the need for research into urban wildlife interactions is magnified. The eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) is a widespread species commonly involved in wildlife-vehicle collisions in urban areas in Australia. Despite the many urban kangaroo populations and associated conflicts with human activities, few studies have examined how eastern grey kangaroos interact with, and are affected by, the urban matrix. Aims: The present study aimed to quantify kangaroo demography, movements, habitat utilisation and exposure to risks during a period of intensive urban development in a rapidly changing suburb located in a region undergoing high urban growth rates. Methods: We utilised foot-based census surveys, global positioning system (GPS) collars, direct observations and reports of wildlife mortality between 2014 and 2016. Geographical information systems (GIS) were used to integrate GPS-tracking data with spatial layers, to quantify kangaroo movements and habitat utilisation. Key results: The kangaroo population underwent a steep decline and kangaroo-vehicle collisions were the main source of mortality (73%) during the study period. Kangaroos were regularly exposed to the risk of injury, with roads intersecting many parts of their home range. Kangaroos showed positive habitat selection both for lawn and forest habitats and kangaroo movement and presence at the study site were influenced by high-quality forage and cover. Conclusions: The present research has highlighted that despite areas of suitable habitat remaining, road-kill was a major contributor to localised kangaroo-population decline. We showed that habitat preferences of eastern grey kangaroos in this urban area were consistent with those in natural landscapes. Implications: The present study is the first to implicate kangaroo-vehicle collisions as the major factor in population decline in kangaroos. These findings can be utilised to guide design and placement of kangaroo-vehicle collision mitigation and assist in planning of urban areas, particularly where kangaroo populations are in decline. Local extirpation of urban kangaroo populations would be greatly reduced by incorporating site-specific kangaroo habitat preferences and existing patterns of kangaroo habitat use in infrastructure planning. The study has contributed to our understanding of the effects of roads on urban wildlife in general and highlighted the importance of landscape permeability. © 2018 CSIRO.

TI  - Connectivity, landscape structure, and plant diversity across agricultural landscapes: novel insight into effective ecological network planning
PY  - 2022
AB  - Natural habitats in rural and urban areas are increasingly fragmented and altered by human impacts that are limiting the animal and plant dispersal process. Fragmentation and isolation can be reversed by restoring landscape connectivity through effective Ecological Network (EN) planning. However, most of the studies analyzing the influence of connectivity and landscape structure on biodiversity are focused on animals, while the understanding of their interplaying role on plant diversity remains limited. We studied the relationships between α and β diversity pattern and landscape structure and connectivity in the nodes of an EN developed in agricultural landscapes, as a part of regional landscape planning framework in Friuli Venezia Giulia region (North-East of Italy). As an innovation, the study aims at parsing the interacting effect of landscape structure, surrounding habitats and nodes, and structural connectivity on EN plant diversity at two specific scales of investigation i.e., the habitat and the node scale. The habitat was the basic ecological unit, while the node was the basic cartographical unit for the EN mapping (multi-habitat or mono-habitat nodes). A total of 443 plant species were collected across 219 sample plots, in 14 different habitats and 87 nodes of the EN. We found that high node connectivity leads to higher species richness (α-diversity) but also increases plant community similarity (i.e., low β-diversity) at both scales. The effect of landscape structure showed differing trends depending on the habitat. In general, landscape composition of semi-natural land cover (i.e., hedgerows, watercourses) showed a positive effect on species diversity as opposed to that of the configuration of anthropogenic elements on both scales. Our results provided crucial information on the landscape processes useful to improving biodiversity conservation by EN. Our findings suggest that i) improving connectivity within ENs favors α plant diversity ii) different habitats have different sensibility to landscape structure iii) semi-natural land cover around nodes improve plant diversity; iv) planning both mono-habitat and multi-habitats nodes, increases the biodiversity conserved therein; v) nodes with more compact shapes are to be preferred. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Stochastic and deterministic processes shaping the testate amoeba communities across different biotopes of urban parks in Moscow and Xiamen cities
PY  - 2022
AB  - Global urbanization has resulted in local habitat fragmentation, influencing ecological processes and biodiversity conservation. However, little is known about the diversity and distribution of microbial communities across urban biotopes. Here, we compared testate amoeba communities in Moscow (63 samples from five urban parks) and Xiamen (69 samples from six urban parks) across four biotopes (tree hole, moss, soil, and sediment) to better understand microbial diversity and ecological processes shaping microbial communities. A total of 116 morphospecies (31 genera), corresponding to 90 in Moscow and 84 in Xiamen, were identified using light microscopy. The species richness per sample (mean ± standard error) was higher in Moscow parks (14 ± 1 species, n = 63) than Xiamen parks. The mean species richness per biotope was highest in the mosses (13 ± 1 species, n = 33). 13–26% of the total species richness was shared by all biotopes, indicating the ubiquitous distribution of testate amoeba morphospecies. The community composition in different biotopes markedly differed in both Moscow and Xiamen regions. Community connectivity varied among biotopes, and community complexity and dynamics were substantially stronger in soil and sediment. The stochastic processes explained a significantly high percentage of community composition in all biotopes (57–81%) in 11 parks. The standardized effect size for C-score in all biotopes changed from 1.48 to 6.92, indicating the enhanced significance of deterministic processes for the testate amoeba communities. The different relative importance of stochastic or deterministic processes in four studied biotopes suggests that factors influencing the testate amoeba communities greatly vary across heterogeneous urban environments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Designing suburban greenways to provide habitat for forest-breeding birds
PY  - 2007
AB  - Appropriately designed, greenways may provide habitat for neotropical migrants, insectivores, and forest-interior specialist birds that decrease in diversity and abundance as a result of suburban development. We investigated the effects of width of the forested corridor containing a greenway, adjacent land use and cover, and the composition and vegetation structure within the greenway on breeding bird abundance and community composition in suburban greenways in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Using 50 m fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed breeding bird communities for 2 years at 34 study sites, located at the center of 300-m-long greenway segments. Percent coverage of managed area within the greenway, such as trail and other mowed or maintained surfaces, was a predictor for all development-sensitive bird groupings. Abundance and richness of development-sensitive species were lowest in greenway segments containing more managed area. Richness and abundance of development-sensitive species also decreased as percent cover of pavement and bare earth adjacent to greenways increased. Urban adaptors and edge-dwelling birds, such as Mourning Dove, House Wren, House Finch, and European Starling, were most common in greenways less than 100 m wide. Conversely, forest-interior species were not recorded in greenways narrower than 50 m. Some forest-interior species, such as Acadian Flycatcher, Hairy Woodpecker, and Wood Thrush, were recorded primarily in greenways wider than 100 m. Others, including ground nesters such as Black-and-white Warbler, Louisiana Waterthrush, and Ovenbird, were recorded only in greenways wider than 300 m. Landscape and urban planners can facilitate conservation of development-sensitive birds in greenways by minimizing the width of the trail and associated mowed and landscaped surfaces adjacent to the trail, locating trails near the edge of greenway forest corridors, and giving priority to the protection of greenway corridors at least 100 m wide with low levels of impervious surface (pavement, buildings) and bare earth in the adjacent landscape. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The ecological impact of city lighting scenarios: Exploring gap crossing thresholds for urban bats
PY  - 2015
AB  - As the global population urbanizes, dramatic changes are expected in city lighting and the urban form, which may threaten the functioning of urban ecosystems and the services they deliver. However, little is known about the ecological impact of lighting in different urban contexts. Movement is an important ecological process that can be disrupted by artificial lighting. We explored the impact of lighting on gap crossing for Pipistrellus pipistrellus, a species of bat (Chiroptera) common within UK cities. We aimed to determine whether the probability of crossing gaps in tree cover varied with crossing distance and lighting level, through stratified field surveys. We then used the resulting data on barrier thresholds to model the landscape resistance due to lighting across an entire city and explored the potential impact of scenarios for future changes to street lighting. The level of illumination required to create a barrier effect reduced as crossing distance increased. For those gaps where crossing was recorded, bats selected the darker parts of gaps. Heavily built parts of the case study city were associated with large and brightly lit gaps, and spatial models indicate movement would be highly restricted in these areas. Under a scenario for brighter street lighting, the area of accessible land cover was further reduced in heavily built parts of the city. We believe that this is the first study to demonstrate how lighting may create resistance to species movement throughout an entire city. That connectivity in urban areas is being disrupted for a relatively common species raises questions about the impacts on less tolerant groups and the resilience of bat communities in urban centres. However, this mechanistic approach raises the possibility that some ecological function could be restored in these areas through the strategic dimming of lighting and narrowing of gaps. © 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Urban permeability for birds: An approach combining mobbing-call experiments and circuit theory
PY  - 2016
AB  - The urban matrix was recently shown to be a mosaic of heterogeneous dispersal habitats. We conducted a playback experiment of mobbing calls to examine the probabilities of forest birds to cross a distance of 50 m over urban matrix with different land-cover types in an urban area. We treated the reciprocal of the crossing probabilities as a movement resistance for forest birds. We drew resistance surfaces based on the land-cover maps of urban Sapporo. We applied a circuit theory to examine the relative role of a detour route consisting of a riparian corridor and urban matrix for dispersing forest bird individuals from continuous forest to an isolated green space in the midst of an urban area. Our results showed that wood cover had the highest crossing probability, while open land (grassland and pavement) had the lowest probabilities. Buildings and water surface displayed an intermediate probability. Resistance surfaces and flow maps at 25- and 50-m resolutions were very similar and suggested that dispersing individuals are likely to use the intervening building areas that dominate the urban matrix rather than detour through riparian corridors. Our results showed the useful combination of experimental approaches and circuit theory, and the importance of the spatial configuration of corridors, as well as the composition and management of dispersal habitats, to landscape connectivity. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - A review of the opportunities to support pollinator populations in South African cities
PY  - 2022
AB  - Globally insects are declining, but some guilds of pollinators are finding refuge in urban landscapes. The body of knowledge on urban pollinators is relatively mature, which means it is now possible to begin to make generalization. Unfortunately, studies do not represent climatic regions evenly and there is a gap in research from the African continent. This study aimed to address some of the gaps on urban pollination knowledge in South Africa and to identify opportunities to improve urban habitats for pollinators. We reviewed the international literature on urban pollinators and the South African literature on pollinators with a landscape ecology focus, drawing on literature with an emphasis on agricultural and ecosystem services. The findings show that some taxa (e.g. large-bodied, cavity nesting bees) will exploit urban environments increasing in abundance with urban intensity. Moderately sensitive taxa (such as small-bodied, ground-nesting bees) take advantage of urban environments only if local habitats are supportive of their needs for resource provision and habitat connectivity. The South African urban poor rely on pollination services for subsistence agriculture and the reproduction of wild-foraged medicines and food. Potential interventions to improve habitat quality include strategic mowing practices, conversion of turf-grass to floral rich habitats, scientific confirmation of lists of highly attractive flowers, and inclusion of small-scale flower patches throughout the urban matrix. Further research is needed to fill the Africa gap for both specialized and generalized pollinators (Diptera, Halictids, Lepidoptera and Hopliini) in urban areas where ornamental and indigenous flowering plants are valued. © 2022 Brom et al.

TI  - Vegetation-landform assemblages along selected rivers in the czech republic, a decade after a 500-year flood event
PY  - 2012
AB  - Rivers with a natural flow regime strongly influence the dynamics of riparian plant communities through hydrological and geomorphological processes. In this study, associations between fluvial landforms and vegetation are investigated on three near-natural rivers in the Czech Republic a decade after a 500-year return period flood in July 1997. This extreme disturbance destroyed the anthropogenically modified river channels and created suitable conditions for a range of ecosystems with high diversity and ecological stability. Field surveys were conducted on fluvial landforms (bars, islands, banks, floodplains and terraces) along three 'renaturalized' rivers, where no technical modifications had subsequently been made to their channels outside urban areas and the floodplains had been left in a post-flood state. Vegetation species abundance and 13 environmental variables (topographical, hydrological and soil) were investigated in summer 2007, 10years after the extreme flood disturbance. The results suggest that the recently created fluvial geomorphic forms are key environmental determinants of riparian vegetation distribution patterns. A range of statistical analyses illustrate that some plant species show predictable patterns of occurrence that correspond with the fluvial forms, supporting a fourfold grouping of herbaceous and woody species and the identification of typical plant communities associated with gravel bars, islands, banks, floodplains and terraces. An investigation of the species richness found on different fluvial landforms showed that the highest number of species occurred on the floodplain and decreased gradually towards the channel bed and towards terraces. Investigation of existing conditions in reaches of rivers with natural dynamics of fluvial processes provides valuable information that can be used as an effective tool for planning restoration strategies and precise management. However, the most important finding of this study is the remarkable establishment of complex river corridor vegetation-landform associations within 10years of a 500-year flood that removed the heavily cultivated landscape that had existed before the event. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Spatial patterns of road mortality of medium-large mammals in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil
PY  - 2017
AB  - Context Brazil has one of the richest biodiversity and one of the most extensive road networks in the world. Several negative impacts emerge from this interaction, including wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC), which may represent a significant source of non-natural mortality in several species. The understanding of the main drivers of WVC is, therefore, crucial to improve the safe coexistence between human needs (transportation of goods and people) and animal populations. Aims We aimed to (1) evaluate the relative influence of land-cover patterns on the distribution of WVC, (2) assess whether WVCs are clustered forming hotspots of mortality, and, if so, (3) evaluate the benefits of mitigating only hotspot sections. Methods We collected WVC data involving medium-large mammals (4-260kg) along three road transects (920km), fortnightly over 1 year (n≤1006 records). We used boosted regression trees to relate the WVC locations with a set of environmental variables including a roadkill index, reflecting overall habitat suitability and landscape connectivity, while accounting for spatial autocorrelation effects. We identified hotspots of mortality using Ripley's K statistic and testing whether data follow a random Poisson distribution correcting for Type I error. Key results We found a strong association between WVC probability and roadkill index for all focal species. Distance to riparian areas, tree cover, terrain ruggedness and distance to urban areas were also important predictors, although to a lesser extent. We detected 21 hotspots of mortality, yet with little spatial overlapping as only four road sections (2%) were classified as hotspot for more than one species. Conclusions Our results supported that WVC mainly occur in road sections traversing areas with more abundant and diverse mammal communities. Hotspots of mortality may provide important information to prioritise road sections for mitigation, but this should be used in complement with roadkill indexes accounting for overall mortality. Implications The results support focusing on hotspots and habitat quality and landscape connectivity for a better assessment of road mortality. At the local scale, a larger number and improved road passages with exclusionary fencing of appropriate mesh size in riparian areas may provide safe crossings for many species and constitute a promising mitigation measure. © CSIRO 2017.

TI  - Impact of upstream urbanization on the urban heat island effects along the Washington-Baltimore Corridor
PY  - 2011
AB  - Although there has been considerable research on urban heat island (UHI) effects, most of the previous studies have attributed UHI effects to localized, surface processes. In this study, the impact of upstream urbanization on enhanced UHI effects is examined using surface observations and numerical simulations of an extreme UHI event that occurred on 9 July 2007 over Baltimore, Maryland. Under southwesterly wind, Baltimore experienced higher peak surface temperatures and higher pollution concentrations than did the larger urban area of Washington, D.C. Results from a coupled ultrahigh-resolution mesoscale-urban canopy model with 2001 National Land Cover Data showan advective contribution from upstream urbanization to the UHI event. This dynamical process is demonstrated by replacing Baltimore or its upstream urban areas by natural vegetation (in the model), indicating that the UHI effects could be reduced by as much as 25%. An analysis of the urban-bay interaction reveals the importance of horizontal wind direction in determining the intensity of bay breezes and the urban boundary layer structures. In addition, the vertical growth and structures of UHI effects are shown as layered \"hot plumes\" in the mixed layer with pronounced rising motions, and these plumes can be advected many kilometers downstream. These findings suggest that judicious land use and urban planning, especially in rapidly developing countries, could help to alleviate UHI consequences, including heat stress and smog. They also have important implications for improving the prediction of urban weather, including the initiation of moist convection, air quality, and other environment-related problems. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.

TI  - Mapping the potential extinction debt of butterflies in a modern city: Implications for conservation priorities in urban landscapes

AB  - Cities are expanding rapidly worldwide. Modern cities are expected to carry heavy extinction debts owing to their recent and drastic fragmentation histories. Therefore, detecting extinction debt and identifying species threatened by it in recently created cities are necessary to prevent future biodiversity losses. Here, we studied the relationship between the life-history traits of butterfly species and the extent of their extinction debts using two different methodological approaches in Tokyo, central Japan. First, we compared the effects of current and past landscape parameters on current species richness using generalized linear models. Second, we predicted species richness in unstable (i.e. high loss) habitats using a model developed for stable (i.e. low loss) habitats. The difference between predicted and observed species richness was used to estimate the extinction debt (the number of species expected to go extinct). We classified butterfly species as seasonal specialists or generalists and as habitat specialists or generalists based on their life-history traits. With both methods, we found significant extinction debts only for specialist species. Mapping the potential extinction debts within our study area indicated that currently large patches had relatively low extinction debts, whereas small patches often had high extinction debts. These results suggested that improving patch area, connectivity and especially quality, would have more significant impacts in small patches than in large ones. Extinction debt is an important concept for setting conservation priorities in highly fragmented landscapes, especially in urban areas. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation analysis of landscape pattern response to land use change from 1985 to 2015 in Xuzhou City, China
PY  - 2018
AB  - Rapid urbanization has dramatically spurred economic development since the 1980s, especially in China, but has had negative impacts on natural resources since it is an irreversible process. Thus, timely monitoring and quantitative analysis of the changes in land use over time and identification of landscape pattern variation related to growth modes in different periods are essential. This study aimed to inspect spatiotemporal characteristics of landscape pattern responses to land use changes in Xuzhou, China durfing the period of 1985-2015. In this context, we propose a new spectral index, called the Normalized Difference Enhanced Urban Index (NDEUI), which combines Nighttime light from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System with annual maximum Enhanced Vegetation Index to reduce the detection confusion between urban areas and barren land. The NDEUI-assisted random forests algorithm was implemented to obtain the land use/land cover maps of Xuzhou in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015, respectively. Four different periods (1985-1995, 1995-2005, 2005-2015, and 1985-2015) were chosen for the change analysis of land use and landscape patterns. The results indicate that the urban area has increased by about 30.65%, 10.54%, 68.77%, and 143.75% during the four periods at the main expense of agricultural land, respectively. The spatial trend maps revealed that continuous transition from other land use types into urban land has occurred in a dual-core development mode throughout the urbanization process. We quantified the patch complexity, aggregation, connectivity, and diversity of the landscape, employing a number of landscape metrics to represent the changes in landscape patterns at both the class and landscape levels. The results show that with respect to the four aspects of landscape patterns, there were considerable differences among the four years, mainly owing to the increasing dominance of urbanized land. Spatiotemporal variation in landscape patterns was examined based on 900 × 900 m sub-grids. Combined with the land use changes and spatiotemporal variations in landscape patterns, urban growth mainly occurred in a leapfrog mode along both sides of the roads during the period of 1985 to 1995, and then shifted into edge-expansion mode during the period of 1995 to 2005, and the edge-expansion and leapfrog modes coexisted in the period from 2005 to 2015. The high value spatiotemporal information generated using remote sensing and geographic information system in this study could assist urban planners and policymakers to better understand urban dynamics and evaluate their spatiotemporal and environmental impacts at the local level to enable sustainable urban planning in the future. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - A landscape ecology approach identifies important drivers of urban biodiversity
PY  - 2015
AB  - Cities are growing rapidly worldwide, yet a mechanistic understanding of the impact of urbanization on biodiversity is lacking. We assessed the impact of urbanization on arthropod diversity (species richness and evenness) and abundance in a study of six cities and nearby intensively managed agricultural areas. Within the urban ecosystem, we disentangled the relative importance of two key landscape factors affecting biodiversity, namely the amount of vegetated area and patch isolation. To do so, we a priori selected sites that independently varied in the amount of vegetated area in the surrounding landscape at the 500-m scale and patch isolation at the 100-m scale, and we hold local patch characteristics constant. As indicator groups, we used bugs, beetles, leafhoppers, and spiders. Compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems, urban ecosystems supported a higher abundance of most indicator groups, a higher number of bug species, and a lower evenness of bug and beetle species. Within cities, a high amount of vegetated area increased species richness and abundance of most arthropod groups, whereas evenness showed no clear pattern. Patch isolation played only a limited role in urban ecosystems, which contrasts findings from agro-ecological studies. Our results show that urban areas can harbor a similar arthropod diversity and abundance compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems. Further, negative consequences of urbanization on arthropod diversity can be mitigated by providing sufficient vegetated space in the urban area, while patch connectivity is less important in an urban context. This highlights the need for applying a landscape ecological approach to understand the mechanisms shaping urban biodiversity and underlines the potential of appropriate urban planning for mitigating biodiversity loss. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Prioritizing green spaces for biodiversity conservation in Beijing based on habitat network connectivity
PY  - 2019
AB  - Rapid urbanization results in changes in land use, biogeochemical cycles, climate, hydrosystems, and biodiversity. Policy-makers have formulated ecological protection measures to facilitate sustainable development. However, traditional conservation planning mainly focuses on protecting specific green spaces, with limited consideration of the connectivity among green spaces from a habitat network perspective. Using citizen science data and occupancy modelling, we predicted habitat suitability, built habitat networks and identified key habitat patches based on their contribution to the functional connectivity of the habitat network for three focal water, forest, and open-habitat bird species. Based on the habitat requirement, small waterbodies and intermediate forest and open-habitat cover facilitate preserving water, forest and open-habitat birds. In regards to the network analysis, we found that key habitat patches with a high conservation priority were generally characterized by a relatively large patch size and/or located at critical positions in the habitat network (at central positions in the habitat network, or near large patches). We suggest that key habitat patches in restricted built-up areas are converted to protected areas or are kept as cropland under future urban planning. We emphasize the usefulness of the focal species concept in urban biodiversity conservation. Our study offers conservation recommendations from a habitat network perspective for urban planners to safeguard urban biodiversity and ecosystem health. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Dynamic evaluation on landscape connectivity of ecological land: A case study of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province of South China
PY  - 2012
AB  - Ecological land is the most crucial and sensitive land use type in rapidly urbanizing areas. Landscape connectivity can help us to better understand the interactions between landscape structure and landscape function. By using the land use data of Shenzhen from 1996 to 2008 and the graph theory-based integral index of connectivity (IIC), probability index of connectivity (PC), and importance value of patches (dPC), a dynamic evaluation on the landscape connectivity of ecological land in the City was conducted, and a spatial assessment was made to identify the most important patches for maintaining overall landscape connectivity. In combining with the basic ecological controlling line in Shenzhen, the variations of the landscape connectivity of the ecological land inside and outside the basic ecological controlling line were evaluated. From 1996 to 2008, the overall landscape connectivity of the ecological land in Shenzhen displayed a downward trend, the importance and the spatial distribution of the important patches for maintaining the overall landscape connectivity changed, and the basic ecological controlling line played definite roles in maintaining the landscape connectivity of ecological land inside the line.

TI  - Urbanization and a green corridor influence reproductive success and pollinators of common milkweed
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanization exerts many pressures on species, yet little is known about how these pressures impact species interactions. Studies of urban plant-pollinator systems provide mounting evidence that urbanization impairs pollinator movement in fragmented urban landscapes, yet the consequences for pollinator-mediated plant reproduction remains unclear. In non-urban areas, habitat corridors can facilitate the movement of organisms including pollinators, but whether these corridors facilitate plant-pollinator interactions in urban areas remains understudied. To examine how urban environments and a green corridor influence plant-pollinator interactions, we measured reproductive success in the native plant common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), and the community structure of its pollinators, for two years along two urban–rural transects in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, one of which followed a green corridor. We found that urbanization decreased male fitness (i.e., pollen removal), increased fruit set (i.e., mean no. of follicles per inflorescence), and inconsistently affected female fitness (i.e., no. of follicles) in A. syriaca. Urbanization simultaneously decreased pollinator abundance but increased pollinator richness. Proximity to a green corridor inconsistently affected male fitness but increased reproductive effort (i.e., no. of inflorescences) in A. syriaca, while pollinator diversity and richness was lower in the corridor. Notably, there were no consistent relationships between pollinator community structure and reproductive success in A. syriaca in both the presence, and absence, of a green corridor. These results demonstrate the complexity with which urbanization, a green corridor, and pollinator communities can shape the reproductive investment and fitness of native plant populations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Influence of Different Urban Structures on Metal Contamination in Two Metropolitan Cities
PY  - 2019
AB  - The influence of urban structures and land use patterns of metropolitan cities on the distribution of contaminants is not well understood. In this study, two metropolitan cities [Jeddah (a typical corridor city) and Madinah (a typical compact city)], featuring different spreading patterns and urban structures, were selected to investigate the contamination level and potential risk caused by metals (i.e., Pb, Zn, Co, Fe, Al, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Mn) associated with urban dust. The findings of this study show that a metropolitan city with a limited variety of activities and a polar center (e.g., Madinah) displays a typical distribution pattern of metals, i.e., concentrations of metals increase gradually toward the center of the city. In contrast, a metropolitan city with multiple major activities (e.g., Jeddah) displays a different distribution pattern, controlled by multiple key actors (e.g., seaports, oil refineries, and desalination/power plants) able to shift the location of highest contamination away from the city center. The above findings are supported by the results of several contamination and health indices. In Jeddah, the highest Pb contamination was found near an oil refinery based on geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF), and ecological risk (E i ) values; whereas, the highest Zn contamination was found near a seaport, based on EF, CF, and E i values. However, in Madinah, the contamination indices indicate that the most contaminated locations are near the city center. The highest non-carcinogenic health risk in Jeddah was found near an oil refinery and in the city center; whereas in Madinah, it was found mainly in the city center. Although there is no significant risk of cancer due to metals associated with dust in the two cities, Cr, representing a health risk contribution of &gt;24%, was the major contributor of non-carcinogenic health risk in the two metropolitan cities. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - This research presents the connecting method for the ecological network among the selected areas through the evaluation of the connectivity of the classified urban green space in Seoul. The study was divided into two; 1st stage of the classification of the types of greens and 2nd stage of the evaluation of connectivity. In the stage of classification of the type of the greens, the research evaluated the diversity of the vegetation and the value of the possibility of inhabitation of wild birds and then, classified the greens into a core green, which is a patch, base green, and connecting or stepping stone-type green, which is a corridor, in aspect of the landscape ecology. In the evaluation of connectivity, the research also selected and classified the areas for ecological network and suggested the connecting method by conducting the evaluation based on a gravity model with indexes such as area index, conference index, and fractal index, in order to find the relationship between the greens. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Best management practices for nutrient and sediment retention in urban stormwater runoff
PY  - 2007
AB  - Stormwater management infrastructure is utilized in urban areas to alleviate flooding caused by decreased landscape permeability from increased impervious surface cover (ISC) construction. In this study, we examined two types of stormwater detention basins, SDB-BMPs (stormwater detention basin-best management practice), and SDB-FCs (stormwater detention basin-flood control). Both are constructed to retain peak stormwater flows for flood mitigation. However, the SDB-BMPs are also designed using basin topography and wetland vegetation to provide water quality improvement (nutrient and sediment removal and retention). The objective of this study was to compare SDB (both SDB-BMP and SDB-FC) surface soil P concentrations, P saturation, and Fe chemistry with natural riparian wetlands (RWs), using sites in Fairfax County, Virginia as a model system. The SDB-BMPs had significantly greater surface soil total P (Pt) concentrations than the RWs and SDB-FCs (831.9 ± 32.5 kg ha-1, 643.3 ± 19.1 kg ha-1, and 652.1 ± 18.8 kg ha-1, respectively). The soil P sorption capacities of SDB-BMPs were similar to the RWs, and were greater than those of SDB-FCs, appearing to result in greater soil P removal and retention in SDB-BMPs compared with SDB-FCs. Increased Fe concentrations and relatively greater amounts of more crystalline forms of Fe in SDB-BMP soils suggested increased sediment deposition compared with RW and SDB-FC soils. Data suggest that SDB nutrient and sediment retention is facilitated in SDB-BMPs. When stormwater management is necessary, use of SDB-BMPs instead of SDB-FCs could foster more responsible urban development and be an appropriate mitigation action for receiving aquatic ecosystems. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.

TI  - Quantifying the spatial impact of landscape fragmentation on habitat quality: A multi-temporal dimensional comparison between the Yangtze River Economic Belt and Yellow River Basin of China
PY  - 2023
AB  - Landscape fragmentation due to urban sprawl and industrialization has caused habitat loss and threatened global biodiversity. However, the magnitude, spatial pattern, and mechanisms of how landscape fragmentation leads to habitat loss remain unclear. The Yellow River Basin (YRB) and the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YZREB) are important ecological security barriers that play a decisive role in landscape connectivity and biodiversity conservation in China. From a comparative perspective, this study analyzes the temporal-spatial changes of land cover in the YRB and the YZREB from 2005 to 2018 and simulates the land use pattern in 2031 using a patch-level simulation (PLUS) model. Then the degree and tendency of landscape fragmentation during 2005–2031 are measured based on the entire region and a 10 km grid, respectively. The habitat quality (HQ) is measured using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The temporal-spatial evolution characteristics of HQ are analyzed across multiple dimensions, including the entire region, urban agglomerations and watersheds (upstream, midstream, and downstream). Finally, spatial econometric models are applied to examine the spatial dependence of HQ and quantify the spatial impact of landscape fragmentation on HQ in the YRB and YZREB based on 10 km grids. Results show that: (1) there would be a significant trend of landscape fragmentation and habitat degradation in both the YRB and YZREB during 2005–2031. (2) HQ in the YRB and YZREB has the spatial distribution characteristics of being low in coastal areas and urban agglomerations but high in inland areas and mountainous forest areas. (3) The spatial distribution and spatial relationship of landscape fragmentation and HQ in YRB and YZREB differ significantly in multi-spatiotemporal dimensions. The findings could provide support for landscape planning and biodiversity conservation strategies in China and other developing countries. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Colonization and extinction dynamics of an annual plant metapopulation in an urban environment
PY  - 2011
AB  - The metapopulation framework considers that the spatiotemporal distribution of organisms results from a balance between the colonization and extinction of populations in a suitable and discrete habitat network. Recent spatially realistic metapopulation models have allowed patch dynamics to be investigated in natural populations but such models have rarely been applied to plants. Using a simple urban fragmented population system in which favourable habitat can be easily mapped, we studied patch dynamics in the annual plant Crepis sancta (Asteraceae). Using stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) and multi-year occupancy data we dissected extinction and colonization patterns in our system. Overall, our data were consistent with two distinct metapopulation scenarios. A metapopulation (sensu stricto) dynamic in which colonization occurs over a short distance and extinction is lowered by nearby occupied patches (rescue effect) was found in a set of patches close to the city centre, while a propagule rain model in which colonization occurs from a large external population was most consistent with data from other networks. Overall, the study highlights the importance of external seed sources in urban patch dynamics. Our analysis emphasizes the fact that plant distributions are governed not only by habitat properties but also by the intrinsic properties of colonization and dispersal of species. The metapopulation approach provides a valuable tool for understanding how colonization and extinction shape occupancy patterns in highly fragmented plant populations. Finally, this study points to the potential utility of more complex plant metapopulation models than traditionally used for analysing ecological and evolutionary processes in natural metapopulations. © 2011 The Authors.

TI  - Taking the elephant out of the room and into the corridor: Can urban corridors work?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Transfrontier wildlife corridors can be successful conservation tools, connecting protected areas and reducing the impact of habitat fragmentation on mobile species. Urban wildlife corridors have been proposed as a potential mitigation tool to facilitate the passage of elephants through towns without causing conflict with urban communities. However, because such corridors are typically narrow and close to human development, wildlife (particularly large mammals) may be less likely to use them. We used remote-sensor camera traps and global positioning system collars to identify the movement patterns of African elephants Loxondonta africana through narrow, urban corridors in Botswana. The corridors were in three types of human-dominated land-use designations with varying levels of human activity: agricultural, industrial and open-space recreational land. We found that elephants used the corridors within all three land-use designations and we identified, using a model selection approach, that season, time of day and rainfall were important factors in determining the presence of elephants in the corridors. Elephants moved more slowly through the narrow corridors compared with their movement patterns through broader, wide-ranging corridors. Our results indicate that urban wildlife corridors are useful for facilitating elephants to pass through urban areas. © Copyright 2016 Fauna & Flora International.

TI  - More than just a corridor: A suburban river catchment enhances bird functional diversity
PY  - 2017
AB  - Globally, as trends of urbanisation continue to intensify, there has been increasing concern over the impacts of urban expansion on biodiversity and greater attention towards addressing these impacts. Ecological infrastructure such as urban rivers and their catchments may enhance biodiversity, ecological functioning and ecosystem service delivery within cities. Birds are good indicators of urban habitat quality because their ecology is well-studied and they are habitat selective. This study assesses the ecological value of a small urban river catchment in Cape Town, South Africa, in terms of its effect on the taxonomic and functional diversity of birds. 178 bird counts were carried out at 89 sites and 95 species were recorded. The nine functional groups considered were present in equal proportions in the catchment and in the whole of southern Africa, making the catchment a microcosm of the region's avifauna in terms of functional composition. Using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, we showed that the river was responsible for the occurrence of certain species and functional groups that would not otherwise occur in the suburbs. Nutrient movers, insectivores, scavengers and seed dispersers responded strongly to a gradient of distance from the river and the position on the river. Contrary to the homogenised assemblage that might be expected of an urban area, the catchment contains a taxonomically and functionally diverse bird assemblage. The combination of a river, a heterogeneous urban matrix and an adjacent national park makes this catchment an exemplar of the value of ecological infrastructure for urban biodiversity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Biodiversity in Urban Areas: The Extraordinary Case of Appia Antica Regional Park (Rome, Italy)
PY  - 2022
AB  - The first inventory of the flora of Appia Antica Regional Park (Italy), one of the largest protected urban areas in Europe (4580 ha), its biological, ecological and biogeographical composition, and notes of the vegetation physiognomies and landscape are presented; physical characteristics of the territory (geomorphology, lithotypes, and phytoclimate) are also given. The landscape is defined by an agricultural matrix with natural and seminatural areas as patches, and riparian vegetation communities as corridors. The vegetation physiognomies are represented by types linked to the Mediterranean climate (mixed, Mediterranean, and riparian forests; scrubby, rocky, aquatic, and helophytic vegetation; anthropogenic communities). The floristic list includes 714 taxa (104 families and 403 genera). Therophytes prevail over hemicryptophytes; woody flora comprises about 30% of alien species. As regards chorotypes, together with a considerable number of Mediterranean species, there are many exotic species with wide distribution areas testifying to a long-lasting anthropic impact. Floristic novelties (european, national, and regional levels) for 21 taxa are reported. The extraordinary species diversity discovered (43% of flora of Rome and 20% of regional flora) is linked to the landscape heterogeneity, the characteristics of which are: (1) persistence of residual natural patches, (2) occurrence of quite well-preserved aquatic habitats and humid meadows, (3) a rich anthropogenic flora, (4) an interesting flora of archeological sites, (5) occurrence of species not common in Latium, (6) occurrence of populations of aliens in crops (which cause economic impact), (7) presence of aliens on archeological ruins (which cause economic-social impacts). The extensive set of data provided represents a general base framework for guiding future research efforts and landscape action plans consistent with environmental sustainability. © 2022 by the author.

TI  - Response of habitat quality to urban spatial morphological structure in multi-mountainous city
PY  - 2023
AB  - Revealing the relationship between urban spatial morphological structure (USMS) and habitat quality (HQ) is of great significance for high-quality urban development. In this study, the central urban area of a typical multi-mountainous city (Guiyang, China) was taken as research area. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) characteristic indicators system of USMS was constructed. The InVEST model was used to evaluate the HQ in the study area, and the spatial pattern characteristics of USMS and HQ in the multi-mountainous city were analyzed. Finally, the response relationship of HQ to USMS was revealed through Pearson correlation analysis and curve fitting. The results showed that: (1) The average level of HQ in the study area is low and the spatial aggregation effect is obvious; the spatial distribution difference between the high value area and the low value area is significant; the high value area is mainly distributed in the area where the large area of urban green space (UGS) and the urban remnant mountains (URMs) are located, while the low value area is mainly distributed in the high-intensity urban construction area. (2)The URMs have a significant impact on the USMS within the city, the intelligibility(I), spatial permeability, spatial aggregation degree, and spatial traffic attraction potential were poor; the buffer zone within 4 km of the urban center is the core area of urban development, and the buffer zone within 15 km is the rapid urban development area. (3)Among the USMS indicators, Choice(C) was significantly positively correlated with the HQ, while the Connectivity(Con), I, Average height(AVH), and Otherness(O) were significantly negatively correlated with the HQ. (4)Stepwise regression results showed that USMS could explain the difference of HQ in the study area well, and the values of fitting coefficient R2 were 0.975, 0.837 and 0.945 in 2008, 2013 and 2018, respectively. (5)There was a quadratic function relationship between HQ and USMS principal component factor f, and there was a threshold effect, and the thresholds were 0.798 in 2008, 0.905 in 2013 and 0.474 in 2018, respectively. This study confirmed the response relationship of HQ to USMS and demonstrates the existence of a threshold, which has important reference significance for urban biodiversity conservation and high-quality urban development. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - Urbanisation and the genetic structure of passer italiae (vieillot 1817) populations in the south of italy
PY  - 2000
AB  - Sparrows have colonized areas modified by humans since the onset of agriculture and seed storage. In fact, present day distributions of the sparrow populations are directly related to urban areas, farms and villages. Consequently the sedentary behaviour of sparrows, in pristine areas, with low densities of specimens, can act as a barrier to gene flow among populations. We analyzed the genetic variability and gene flow rates in four Italian sparrow populations sampled in areas affected by different levels of human activity. Population variability was analyzed by DNA fingerprinting with M13 multilocus minisatellite probe, which yielded multibanded fingerprints (the average number of bands was 25, ranging in size from 23 kb to 0.3 kb). The population located within the pristine area of the Cilento-Vallo di Diano National Park (San Marco) showed the higher value of within-population similarity (Sw = 0.73). This suggests a probable higher level of inbreeding in comparison with the other localities. The genetic isolation of the San Marco population is also imputable to the between-populations similarity values (Sb), that seem to be related with a preferential direction of gene circulation along urbanised corridors. The results show that population variability and gene flow rate in the Italian sparrow are directly related to the presence of urbanised areas. The results also show that the M13 multilocus fingerprinting probe represents a advantageous marker for the detection of genetic variability within a small geographical scale in passerine birds. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Can mammals thrive near urban areas in the Neotropics? Characterizing the community of a reclaimed tropical forest
PY  - 2021
AB  - Mammals figure prominently in tropical ecology because of their role in seed dispersal, herbivore control, and nutrient cycling. Urbanization is a conservation concern for mammals not only because of lost habitat, but also other negative impacts such as illegal hunting and pollution. Some mammals are resilient to urbanization and can persist in degraded habitats; however, this has not been studied in many tropical sites. We used camera traps to study mammals in Peperpot Nature Park (PNP), a secondary forest located 5 km from the capital of Suriname, and compared it to the large Central Suriname Nature Reserve (CSNR). We found fewer species in PNP (20) compared to CSNR (30), however, PNP included apex predators and species of conservation concern, and the two sites had a similar relative abundance of large cats and most mesocarnivores. Smaller mammal species had higher relative abundance at PNP while larger herbivores were scarce or absent, likely from poaching, as PNP is still connected to interior forests. The detection models revealed that the park, the camera trap was set in, was the most common significant factor for most species, suggesting that broader landscape level effects are important. In occupancy models, the null model was the most common top model across species, but then followed by park. Despite fewer species being detected than in large protected areas, the presence of some species in PNP which are historically absent in developed areas shows promise for small urban tropical forests to support robust mammal communities, provided they maintain some connectivity to larger source habitats. © 2021, International Society for Tropical Ecology.

TI  - The research on the ecological feature of thermal radiant in GuiYang, China using remote sensing
PY  - 2004
AB  - The ecological quality of urban is a key standard to evaluate a modern urban. So far many methods have been used to understand environment quality of urban. Some ground information can be obtained directly with the help of the Remote Sensing(RS). The ground thermal radiant is the immediate embodiment of the energy transition of the urban system, then the ground situation could be seen clearly with RS inspecting the ground thermal radiant. Employing Remote Sensing data ETM+ of Guiyang in China on Nov 1st 2000, we set up the index of thermal radiant to study the thermal codition and used interpreting mothed to obtain the information of land cover such as the vegetation status, the urban construction volume ratio and water percentage.After analyzing these data, the following results can be acquired: Firstly, ground thermal radiant reflects the character of the urban ground cover. In the urban ecological environment, ground thermal radiant mainly reflects the density of the building, the percentage of greenland and water in urban, which indicate the urban ecological environment. The thermal radiant indexes of water, Greenland, road and building are 1.19; 1.20,1.24 and1.27. So the 1.24 is reasonably regarded as a critical point of the thermal radiant change and can be used as a standard to distinguish the grade of ecological quality in Guiyang. Secondly, according to the analysis of the ground thermal radiant and urban greenland spatial distribution, there are two urban greenland ecological corridor discovered in Guiyang Urban. Besides, in order to improve the urban ecological environment and reduce the ground thermal radiant, the Greenland in eight regions in GuiYang should be advised to be built up.

TI  - Medium and large mammal conservation in the City of Cape Town: factors influencing species richness in urban nature reserves
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanisation is associated with the loss and fragmentation of natural land, the disruption of ecosystem functioning and services, and the loss of biodiversity. Cape Town is situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, with high rates of endemism, but both agricultural and housing demands are increasing pressure on remaining patches of natural land and consequently the biodiversity they support. The aims of this study were to use a standardised camera trap survey to determine which native medium and large mammal species still survive in 12 City of Cape Town (CCT) municipal reserves (range 32–8400 ha), and to understand how reserve size, area-perimeter ratio, connectivity, habitat heterogeneity and presence of permanent freshwater aquatic habitat might influence medium and large mammal (>0.5 kg) community composition. Cameras were placed at 151 locations across all reserves using a stratified placement protocol that resulted in 13,360 independent trigger events by targeted taxa. Nineteen native species (11 carnivores, 7 herbivores, 1 omnivore) were recorded, which is 49% of the 39 species believed to have been present historically. Species richness varied from 1 to 12 species (mean ± SD = 7 ± 3.6) across reserves, and linear models showed that higher species richness and the presence of large carnivores was best explained by improved connectivity to large amounts of natural habitat. It is recommended that maintaining biodiversity in urban reserves will be best achieved by preserving and establishing corridors of suitable habitat that allow for the movement of animals to and from other patches.

TI  - Multi-sensor satellite data for carbon storage mapping of green space in a fast growing development corridor in Malaysia
PY  - 2016
AB  - Disturbances such as deforestation and land use change on natural vegetation have caused carbon dioxide (CO2) emission to the atmosphere which contributes to global warming and climate change. Malaysia has started to take necessary steps to mitigate the potential impact of increased CO2 and integrating the green infrastructure into urban planning is a way to go. Green space in urban environment provides a variety of benefits to the community by sequestrating carbon, absorbing urban emissions and producing oxygen. In this study we quantified the carbon storage capacity of various green spaces, namely forests, mangroves and urban parks by biometric measurements and remote sensing techniques at a rapidly developing economy region in Iskandar Malaysia (IM) in the southern Peninsular Malaysia that covers an area of 2,217 km2. Satellite imageries such as RapidEye and Advanced Land Observing Satellite phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) were used for mapping the carbon content of different vegetation in IM. The spatial distribution of carbon storage shows that mangroves contribute the largest amount of carbon storage in IM with 0.437M t C and this is mainly due to their vast area (8382 ha). This is followed by tropical forest (0.185M t C). However, tropical forest has the highest carbon density with 161.7 tC ha-1 compared to mangroves (52.1 tC ha-1). In general, trees in urban parks have lower carbon storage (ranging between 32.63 tC ha-1 to 48.81 tC ha-1) compared to forests and mangrove. In total, these vegetation types in IM remove ∼2.29 M tCO2eq. Green space in IM was found to remove about 3% of carbon emitted to the air in IM. These results suggest that the government must make firm policies to increase more green cover in the urban areas and to preserve the existing green space for improving environmental quality for people and supporting biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Effects of management intensity, function and vegetation on the biodiversity in urban ponds
PY  - 2016
AB  - Ponds are important elements of green areas in cities that help counteract the negative consequences of urbanization, by providing important habitats for biodiversity in cities and being essential nodes in the overall landscape-scale habitat network. However, there is relatively little knowledge about the impacts of pond management intensity, function and environmental variables on urban pond biodiversity. In this study we addressed this gap by investigating which factors were correlated with the level of biodiversity in urban ponds, indicated by species richness of aquatic insects, in Stockholm, Sweden. Our study did not confirm any direct link between the perceived intensity of management or function of ponds and overall biodiversity. However, it seems that management can influence particular groups of species indirectly, since we found that Trichoptera richness (Caddisflies) was highest at intermediate management intensity. We suggest that this is caused by management of vegetation, as the amount of floating and emergent vegetation was significantly correlated with both the overall species richness and the richness of Trichoptera (Caddisflies). This relationship was non-linear, since ponds with an intermediate coverage of vegetation had the highest richness. Interestingly, the amount of vegetation in the pond was significantly affected by pond function and pond management. The overall species richness and richness of Trichoptera were also positively correlated with pond size. Since we found that the pattern of relations between species richness and environmental variables differed between the insect groups we suggest that it will be difficult to provide overall design and management recommendations for ponds in urban green areas. Therefore, it is recommended that to provide high aquatic diversity of species in urban areas one should aim at promoting high diversity of different types of ponds with differing management and environmental factors that shape them. © 2016 The Authors

TI  - Spatial Modeling for the management of green and blue infrastructure
PY  - 2019
AB  - Connecting natural habitats to allow animal and plant species to move has become a major issue in environmental policies. However, the identification and management of ecological networks raises difficulties due to the diversity of methods for analyzing connectivity and the lack of harmonized data at the country level. The aim of this study is to use graph theory to more finely integrate the functional connectivity of the landscape into the modeling of ecological networks at different spatial scales. The use of generic data and a standardized method makes it possible to identify core areas and corridors in a uniform way throughout the French metropolitan area and to overcome regional administrative boundaries. The results highlight a nationwide ecological network that can be compared to the existing green and blue infrastructure in a decision-making perspective. © 2019 Geographie-Cites.

TI  - Outstanding challenges for urban conservation research and action
PY  - 2014
AB  - Researchers, advocates and policymakers have proposed urban conservation as an emerging, integrative discipline that can contribute to sustainable cities by delivering co-benefits to human and non-human components of biodiversity. Given the recent growth in biodiversity-friendly designs and management schemes, there is an urgent need for a synthesis of this fragmented research base to inform planners and decision-makers. We conducted a systematic multidisciplinary literature review (787 papers) and found that the importance of urban areas for general conservation is not convincingly supported by empirical research. Only few studies demonstrated that cities can directly contribute to conservation efforts, by hosting viable populations of rare or endangered species, or by providing green corridors for the passage of natural populations. From a social perspective, while several studies demonstrated that green infrastructure could provide services for people (notably cultural services), only few studies explored the role of species diversity per se. Our review also shows strong geographical, location and taxonomic biases in urban biodiversity conservation research that make generalisations difficult. It is a disturbing paradox that while research in urban biodiversity conservation is rising exponentially, the main motivations for conserving urban biodiversity remain largely untested and unproven. We thus propose a framework for promoting integrative urban conservation research to bridge those gaps. Together, these findings warn against expanding cities under green planning and call for enhancing biodiversity experience by improving the quality of existing green spaces throughout the entire urban matrix. We provide a set of recommendations for practitioners and decision-makers to continue action. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An Ecological Network Perspective in Improving Reserve Design and Connectivity: A Case Study of Wuyishan Nature Reserve in China
PY  - 2015
AB  - To alter the sharply decreasing trend of biodiversity due to human disturbances, much emphasis has been placed on the ecological networks comprised of core areas with high ecological significance and corridors connecting them. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel viewpoint and method to identify, analyze and optimize the ecological network of Wuyishan City. The bidirectional least-cost distance model is applied to identify the landscape network in Wuyishan City for the year 1995 and 2005, which can incorportate digraph in ecological network modeling, overcome the limitation of failing to reflect the orientation of the species' dispersal process, and make the process of modeling more convincing by distinguishing flux orientation of \"go\" and \"return\" of two random patches. Three new metrics, i.e., network cyclicity, degree of cyclicity, and degree of connectedness, which can quantify the integrity and continuity of network and the relation between network organization and ecological process, are introduced to measure the presence and strength of cyclic pathways in a network and reflect the network's ability to transfer bio-flux. The results show that the ecological network of Wuyishan City in the year 1995 and 2005 have respectively a network size of 18 and 17, degree of connectedness of 1 and 0.7647, network cyclicity of 7.1378 and 8.2570, and degree of cyclicity of 0.3965 and 0.4857, which indicate that the network in Wuyishan City for the year 2005 has strong ability to transfer bio-flux, a high level of eco-process diversity, and a low level of integrity and continuity. It can be concluded that during the past 10 years, different areas of Wuyishan City have gone through landscape degradation and restoration. In the northeast, network components degraded severely and made several patches \"isolated islands\", while in the southwest, the network has been developed because of landscape restoration. In particular, the linkages among the patches of natural reserve and its neighborhood increased remarkably, which directly increased the interaction strength and the whole network cyclicity. Then, via scenario analysis, we also identify the patches and linkages that make great contributions to the entire cyclicity and connectedness, such as patches [1,2,3,4,5,6] (Nature reserve and its neighborhood), [12] (bridging the north and west part) and [19] (bridging the south and west part), and linkages among the central patches. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Relationships between land use and nitrogen and phosphorus in New Zealand lakes
PY  - 2011
AB  - Developing policies to address lake eutrophication requires an understanding of the relative contribution of different nutrient sources and of how lake and catchment characteristics interact to mediate the sourcereceptor pathway. We analysed total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) data for 101 New Zealand lakes and related these to land use and edaphic sources of phosphorus (P). We then analysed a sub-sample of lakes in agricultural catchments to investigate how lake and catchment variables influence the relationship between land use and in-lake nutrients. Following correction for the effect of co-variation amongst predictor variables, high producing grassland (intensive pasture) was the best predictor of TN and TP, accounting for 38.6% and 41.0% of variation, respectively. Exotic forestry and urban area accounted for a further 18.8% and 3.6% of variation in TP and TN, respectively. Soil P (representing naturally-occurring edaphic P) was negatively correlated with TP, owing to the confounding effect of pastoral land use. Lake and catchment morphology (zmax and lake:catchment area) and catchment connectivity (lake order) mediated the relationship between intensive pasture and in-lake nutrients. Mitigating eutrophication in New Zealand lakes requires action to reduce nutrient export from intensive pasture and quantifying P export from plantation forestry requires further consideration. © CSIRO 2011.

TI  - Identifying and evaluating functional connectivity for building urban ecological networks
PY  - 2015
AB  - With rapid urbanization and industrialization, habitat fragmentation and loss are inevitable. Under these circumstances, landscape connectivity and ecological networks have become a focus of applied landscape ecology. A well-connected ecological network is believed to facilitate energy and resource fluxes, species dispersal, genetic exchange and multiple other ecological processes, and to contribute to the maintenance of ecosystem stability and integrity. Identifying and evaluating functional connectivity between habitat patches is the key step in designing and building well-connected ecological networks. Based on a review of literature on linkage identification approaches, our study combined least-cost path modeling with graph-theory based network analysis to simulate, identify, evaluate, and prioritize functional linkages. We made some modifications to conventional least-cost model and network analysis in order to reduce subjectivity and to better suit the specific conditions of urban environments. Least-cost models are commonly used to determine the movement routes of wildlife to optimize conservation of meta-populations in wild environments. Ideally, least-cost models should be parameterized with field data for a specific organism (usually a small animal); however, these data are difficult and time-consuming to collect, and this has resulted in a large number of studies relying entirely or in large part on collective expert opinion. Different experts may assign different values and therefore affect the reliability of network simulation. Therefore, we adopted the Landscape Development Intensity (LDI) index, which is a measure of human disturbance of ecosystems, to quantify the relative costs of land use/cover types. In addition, we chose not to use small mammals as the individual surrogate for designing our urban ecological network. Most studies of animal movement patterns have been conducted in continuous forest landscapes, which are very different from patchy urban environments. These are characterized by much smaller and fragmented habitat patches, surrounded by a non-living concrete matrix with various threats hostile to life. Instead, we used native trees as individual surrogates and their seed dispersal pattern, based on a field survey, for devising and simulating a functional urban ecological network. Taking Christchurch, New Zealand, as an example, our study used a climax native forest tree, Dacrycarpus dacrydioides as a surrogate in establishing our urban ecological network. We used the LDI index to build the cost surface for a least-cost model in ArcGIS 10.0, and the observed maximum seed dispersal distance of D. dacrydioides (1200 m) as the threshold distance for network analysis in Conefor 2.6. Under the 1200 m threshold distance, a total of 408 links were simulated in the study area. These were grouped into 10 importance grades using Hierarchical Cluster Analysis in SPSS 21.0 combined with input from decision-makers. Among these, the three most important links were between Richmond Park and Petrie Park, Hansons Reserve and Auburn Reserve, and between Centaurus Park and King George Reserve. They were identified as the cut-links in a landscape graph, i.e. removal would disconnect critical components in the landscape. Indeed, if these links were absent, the Integral Index of Connectivity (IIC) of the whole landscape would be reduced by 31.73%. Additionally, our study found that there was no linear relationship (Pearson’s r =0.078, P =0.118) between link importance value and total area of habitat connected. That is, the links between larger habitats are not necessarily more important to the network. Further studies are needed to support this finding. Overall, our case study suggests that the combination of least-cost pathway analysis and graph-theoretical algorithms is an efficient approach for simulating and prioritizing functional connectivity in urban landscapes, and might be valuable for Chinese urban ecological network planning. Furthermore, the energy-consumption based LDI index was shown to be a reliable measurement of relative cost values of land use/cover types. However, it should be pointed out that the LDI index was calculated based on western land use/cover types, which are different from those used in China. It is recommended that when being applied in China, the LDI index should be adjusted to China’s land use/cover types. © 2015, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

TI  - Microhabitat and spatial variation at HK isozyme loci in culex pipiens: Testing isolation by distance and isolation by ecology model
PY  - 2014
AB  - Culex pipiens L. (Diptera Culicidae) is of medical and veterinary importance as vector of various bacterial, filarial and arboviral disease pathogens, and is a major pest in urban areas. Understanding the population structure and gene flow among populations is critical for public health issues such as local dispersion pattern and spread of insecticide resistance. To determine the dispersion pattern of the Cx. pipiens samples across the southern part of the Pannonian Plain of Central Europe (testing Isolation by distance model), and at fine-scale level, between ecologically different larval habitats (testing Isolation by ecology model), we studied hexokinase (HK) genes. Because the polymorphism of HK genes is independent of insecticide use, spatial variation at HK loci provided valuable information on population connectivity of Cx. pipiens. Implementing STRUCTURE statistical analysis, a lack of structuring at individual level of “urban” and “rural” samples was observed. Landscape study rejected both ecological and iso-lation models which implies that different selection regimes of larval habitats and geographic distance do not influence on genotype portioning at HK system. Observed high genetic connectivity among samples throughout urban and rural environments indicated that gene flow is an important factor underlying genetic structure. This study pointed out that control measures restricted to urban areas are unlikely to be effective due to high gene flow between treated and untreated populations. Hence, designing a sustainable vector control strategy for the species with detectable gene flow, such as Cx. pipiens, must remain a regional effort. © 2014(Publisher Name). All Rights Reserved.

TI  - The influence of riparian corridor width on ant and plant assemblages in northern Sydney, Australia
PY  - 2011
AB  - Protecting riparian corridors is a commonly applied environmental policy in urban landscapes. However, empirical data demonstrating their efficacy for biodiversity conservation outcomes is scarce. In this study we investigated whether riparian corridor width influences the diversity and community structure of ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and vascular plant assemblages therein. Eighteen corridors of differing widths were selected from within the Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area, Sydney Australia. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps positioned within rectangular vegetation transects (30 × 10 m). Both ant and plant species richness, when standardised for sampling effort, were unrelated to riparian corridor width. However, significant compositional differences between sites were evident with increased width up to ~50 m. Narrow corridors contained greater abundances of opportunistic ant species and higher proportions of exotic plants. We interpret this to be the result of the greater disturbance/edge influence derived from adjacent upland urban environments. Site beta diversity did not increase with corridor width, suggesting that the exclusion of novel upslope habitats in narrow riparian corridors is not a significant cause of community assemblage modification at these sites. To minimise the impact of deleterious edge effects on ant fauna, environmental managers should seek to retain riparian corridors wider than ~50 m. However, we observed substantial between-site variability of biotic assemblages, irrespective of corridor width. Therefore we recommend that environmental management practice needs to take a catchment-wide approach and consider other parameters that may contribute to riparian health so as to optimise the protection of riparian biodiversity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Genetic variability of Panstrongylus geniculatus (Reduviidae: Triatominae) in the Metropolitan District of Caracas, Venezuela
PY  - 2018
AB  - Panstrongylus geniculatus has become the most frequently registered vector of Chagas disease in the metropolitan area of Caracas, Venezuela. This triatomine species has invaded urban areas in recent years and has been implicated in multiple oral outbreaks of Chagas disease in the region. The study of genetic variability and spatial structure in P. geniculatus populations can provide information about possible events of domiciliation and aid intervention programs against triatomine species rapidly adapting to urban ecotopes. We sequenced a region of the cytochrome-b gene in 114 specimens of P. geniculatus from the Metropolitan District of Caracas and assessed patterns of gene flow and phylogenetic relationships among these individuals. A total of 29 haplotypes were detected in the two sampled municipalities, Sucre and Libertador. Though high genetic connectivity was observed between the municipalities (FST = 0.10796; Nm = 11.20), subtle genetic structuring was also observed in particular geographic sub regions. Based on neutrality tests and the observed allele-frequency distribution, the Panstrongylus geniculatus population appears to be expanding and adapting to different microhabitats present in the study area. Our findings affirm the capacity of this insect to adapt to different environments and emphasize its principal role in the epidemiology of Chagas disease in northern Venezuela. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Commensal ecology, urban landscapes, and their influence on the genetic characteristics of city-dwelling Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus)
PY  - 2009
AB  - Movement of individuals promotes colonization of new areas, gene flow among local populations, and has implications for the spread of infectious agents and the control of pest species. Wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are common in highly urbanized areas but surprisingly little is known of their population structure. We sampled individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas within the city. Clustering methods and a neighbour-joining tree based on pairwise genetic distances supported an east-west division in the inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent sites. Most individuals (∼95%) were assigned to their area of capture, indicating strong site fidelity. Moreover, the axial dispersal distance of rats (62 m) fell within typical alley length. Several rats were assigned to areas 2-11.5 km away, indicating some, albeit infrequent, long-distance movement within the city. Although individual movement appears to be limited (30-150 m), locations up to 1.7 km are comprised of relatives. Moderate FST, differentiation between identified clusters, and high allelic diversity indicate that regular gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented isolation. Therefore, ecology of commensal rodents in urban areas and life-history characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects of isolation or founder events. An understanding of levels of connectivity of rat populations inhabiting urban areas provides information about the spatial scale at which populations of rats may spread disease, invade new areas, or be eradicated from an existing area without reinvasion. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Planning landscape corridors in ecological infrastructure using least-cost path methods based on the value of ecosystem services
PY  - 2014
AB  - Ecosystem service values have rarely been incorporated in the process of planning ecological infrastructure for urban areas. Urban ecological infrastructure is a network system of natural lands and waters that provides ecosystem services. The purpose of this study was to design landscape corridors that maximize the value of ecosystem services in ecological infrastructure planning. We explored the optimal corridors to enhance the connectivity among landscape elements to design an ecological infrastructure for the city of Gwacheon, South Korea, as an example of a small urban area. We calculated the value of ecosystem services using standardized estimation indices based on an intensive review of the relevant literature and employed the least-cost path method to optimize the connectivity of landscape structural elements. The land use type in the city with the highest estimated value of ecosystem services was the riparian zone (i.e., 2011 US$7,312.16/ha). Given areal coverage of all land use types, the estimated value of developed area open spaces was 2011 US$899,803.25, corresponding to the highest contribution to the total value of ecosystem services. Therefore, the optimal configured dispersal corridors for wildlife were found from the riparian zones (source area) to the developed area open spaces (destination area) in the city. Several challenges remain for improving the estimation of the value of ecosystem services and incorporating these ecosystems in ecological infrastructure planning. Nonetheless, the approaches taken to estimate the value of ecosystem services and design landscape corridors in this study may be of value to future efforts in urban ecological infrastructure planning. © 2014 by the authors.

TI  - Body-size shifts in aquatic and terrestrial urban communities
PY  - 2018
AB  - Body size is intrinsically linked to metabolic rate and life-history traits, and is a crucial determinant of food webs and community dynamics 1,2 . The increased temperatures associated with the urban-heat-island effect result in increased metabolic costs and are expected to drive shifts to smaller body sizes 3 . Urban environments are, however, also characterized by substantial habitat fragmentation 4, which favours mobile species. Here, using a replicated, spatially nested sampling design across ten animal taxonomic groups, we show that urban communities generally consist of smaller species. In addition, although we show urban warming for three habitat types and associated reduced community-weighted mean body sizes for four taxa, three taxa display a shift to larger species along the urbanization gradients. Our results show that the general trend towards smaller-sized species is overruled by filtering for larger species when there is positive covariation between size and dispersal, a process that can mitigate the low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings 5 . We thus demonstrate that the urban-heat-island effect and urban habitat fragmentation are associated with contrasting community-level shifts in body size that critically depend on the association between body size and dispersal. Because body size determines the structure and dynamics of ecological networks 1, such shifts may affect urban ecosystem function. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Behavioral responses of bobcats and coyotes to habitat fragmentation and corridors in an urban environment
PY  - 2002
AB  - We examined the behavior of bobcats and coyotes in a fragmented urban area northwest of Los Angeles, California, from July 1998 to October 1999. Activity patterns of bobcats and coyotes were crepuscular with no apparent shift to nocturnality, but activity was somewhat lower during daylight hours than in an unfragmented reference area, implying some avoidance of humans. Home ranges were not significantly larger in fragmented than in unfragmented habitat, probably because unproductive development within a home range may have been balanced by availability of human-related food, such as fruit, garbage, and pets. Female bobcat home ranges were generally within a single fragment, while male bobcats and coyotes of both sexes included more than one fragment. Both species tended to cross over roads rather than use culverts. Culverts were more likely to be used earlier in the night, during heavier traffic, and if they contained less water. Bobcats and coyotes used corridors as habitat and, less often, for travel. Both species also crossed development to move between fragments, but seemed to prefer corridors when available. Our results indicate that bobcats and coyotes persisting in an urban environment adjust behaviorally to habitat fragmentation and human activities, in part through temporal and spatial avoidance. Both species appeared willing to cross well-travelled roads despite the availability of culverts; consequently, vehicular collision is an important cause of mortality (50%) and needs attention. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Analysis of the tree component and its contribution to ecosystem services in the city of Turrialba, Costa Rica
PY  - 2021
AB  - The analysis of urban ecosystems is crucial for building resilience in cities and moving towards their sustainability. One of the fundamental components of these ecosystems is the urban forest. To determine the contributions and effects of trees in cities, a sample of the urban area of the city of Turrialba in central Costa Rica was analyzed using the model iTree Eco, which allows the main ecosystem services provided by trees in cities to be valued. Although in this study it was not possible to quantify all the ecosystem services included in the model, it was possible to analyze the elements and structural context of the study area, the value of carbon sequestration and storage, as well as the structural value of the trees. Annually, in the study area, with 18 tree species identified, more than 60 000 USD are generated from these three ecosystem services alone. Of the species identified, Zygia longifolia stood out for its greater abundance and leaf area, Erythrina poeppigiana in height and greater carbon storage, Mangifera indica in greater carbon sequestration and oxygen production, and Veitchia sp with the greatest structural value. Likewise, it was evident that maintaining the riverbanks of the Turrialba River and its tributaries, in its passage through the urban area of this city, provides the greatest amount of ecosystem services derived from the trees it keeps and where there is still a significant potential to include new plantations. © 2021 Los Autores.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Background: Disentangling the relative roles of environmental filtering and spatial processes in structuring ecological communities is a central topic in metacommunity ecology. Metacommunity ecology in the temperate river ecosystems has been well developed, while less attention has been paid to subtropical urban river networks. Here, we examined the ecological factors and seasonal difference in structuring macroinvertebrates metacommunity assembly in the subtropical urban river networks in Shenzhen, South China. Results: Our results revealed that there was no significant distinction of macroinvertebrate community composition among seasons, with only the relative abundance of Mollusca and Odonata significantly differed in both wet and dry seasons. One possible explanation was that most macroinvertebrates are generally pollution-tolerant taxa characterized with nonseasonal life cycle. In addition, distance-based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning approach revealed that metacommunity was determined equally by the environmental and dispersal-related factors. Further, our results showed that, although a slight temporal variation of relative contribution, the identity and explanation power of ecological factors were different among seasons. Specifically, stronger environmental filtering structuring community dynamics was observed in the dry than wet seasons, which might be owing to higher environmental heterogeneity under a low water-flow condition. Moreover, we detected that the influence of spatial processes was stronger in the wet than dry seasons, indicating an obvious dispersal processes due to high connectivity among sites. Conclusion: Overall, our results revealed that environmental and spatial factors equally explained variations of macroinvertebrate metacommunity, implying the necessity of considering dispersal-related processes structuring ecological communities in river bioassessment programs. Moreover, degraded habitat conditions and water quality were the predominant factors that affected macroinvertebrate communities, indicating the significance and feasibility of improving local abiotic conditions to sustain local biodiversity. Further, our findings revealed the importance of seasonal dynamics of these urban river networks in structuring macroinvertebrate metacommunity. Thereby, our study improves the understanding of ecological processes governing macroinvertebrate metacommunity and underlines the idea that community ecology studies should go beyond the single snapshot survey in river networks. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Vegetation of the railways of the Kyiv urban area (Ukraine)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Phytosociological research of the vegetation of Kyiv railways has been completed. Based on the analysis of 379 relevés using modified TWINSPAN and PC-ORD algorithms, it was found that the syntaxonomical structure of the study area includes 7 classes (Artemisietea vulgaris, Festucetea vaginatae, Galio-Urticetea, Plantaginetea majoris, Polygono-Poetea annuae, Robinietea, Stellarietea mediae), 12 orders, 18 alliances, 35 associations, 13 derivate and basal communities. The development of vegetation in man-made habitats leads to its significant complexity. It is manifested by changes in plant associations, their fragmentation and the formation of overgrowth type coenoses dominated by individual plant species. A significant degree of synanthropization, and in particular adventization, of the studied phytocoenoses was established. The participation of highly invasive species reduces local plant diversity and destroys their floristical and phytocoenotic structure. On the other hand, fragmented railway landscapes can function as new habitats or distribution corridors for local natural species. Trends of anthropogenic changes in the vegetation of the railways of Kyiv are the transformation and reduction of areas of natural vegetation, a decrease in its productivity, as well as an increase in the number of derivate plant communities, which are the successive stages of ecosystem development. The ecological features of the vegetation of the railways of the Kyiv urban area are discussed in comparison with the ruderal vegetation outside the railways. Comparative ordination analysis of these phytocoenoses shows that communities on the railways develop in extreme conditions of ecotopes poor on soil moisture and nitrogen content. The results of our research can be used for effective management of biodiversity on railways, and for the monitoring and development of control measures for the spread of non-native species. They can also be useful for sustainable planning and management of urban landscapes. © 2022, Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS), Institute of Zoology, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS), Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS).

TI  - Urbanization, habitat extension and spatial pattern, threaten a costa rican endemic bird
PY  - 2021
AB  - Introduction: Migration of people from rural environments to cities has accelerated urbanization and modified the landscape as well as the ecological processes and communities in these areas. The Costa Rican endemic Cabanis´s Ground-Sparrow (Melozone cabanisi) is a species of limited distribution restricted to the “Gran Area Metropolitana”, which is the biggest urban settlement of the country. This area has experimented and still experiment an ongoing fragmentation and loss of habitat used by this species (coffee plantations, shrubs, and thickets). Objective: To determine the effects of urbanization on habitat abundance and spatial pattern for the occurrence of Melozone cabanisi. Methods: We modeled the area of potentially suitable habitat for this species in Costa Rica using occurrence and bioclimatic data. Then, we estimated the actual suitable habitat using land cover type layers. Finally, we analyzed the connectivity among the actual suitable habitat patches using single-patch and multi-patch approaches. Results: From the area of potentially suitable habitat estimated by the bioclimatic model, 74 % were urban areas that are unsuitable for Melozone cabanisi. The largest suitable patches within urban areas were coffee plantations; which also were crucial for maintaining connectivity between habitat patches along the species’ range. Conclusions: To preserve and protect the Melozone cabanisi, these areas must be taken into consideration by decision-makers in the present and future management plans. We recommend avoiding change shrubs and thickets to urban cover to preserve the occurrence of Melozone cabanisi, and imple-ment a program for the payment of environmental services to landholders, supported by the local governments, to protect those habitats in urban contexts. © 2021, Universidad de Costa Rica.

TI  - Inferring persistence of indigenous mammals in response to urbanisation
PY  - 2005
AB  - The number and extent of human settlements around the world are increasing as the human population grows and people move from rural to urban areas. The decline and ultimately the local extinction of many indigenous species from a range of taxonomic groups within urbanised areas is a recurring theme from cities around the world. However, determining whether a species has become extinct can be difficult because sufficient survey effort may be too costly and expert opinion may involve considerable subjective bias. In this study, we compared the results of four quantitative assessments of the probability of persistence of indigenous mammals within Melbourne, Australia. Our comparisons were methodological, taxonomic and spatial. Less than half (26) of the original 54 species that occurred in Melbourne prior to European settlement have a greater than 95% probability of being extant at the end of 2000. Mammals occurring in local government areas (LGAs) within 10km of the central business district of Melbourne were less likely to be extant, with 29% of species having a greater than 95% probability of persisting, compared to 48% in the outer LGAs. The group of species most negatively affected by urbanisation were the small, ground-dwelling mammals, with just two out of 15 species having a greater than 10% probability of persisting. All four methods gave broadly similar results, with the Bayesian approach consistently suggesting higher probabilities of species persistence. The decline in the number of species is likely to continue with the ongoing expansion of Melbourne. The greatest opportunity to conserve the maximum number of species of mammal within Melbourne is in the outer LGAs where they remain extant. We recommend that state and local governments design and adopt a comprehensive strategy for managing habitat networks that cross jurisdictional boundaries and encompass the greater Melbourne area to enhance prospects for the survival of mammals. © 2005 The Zoological Society of London.

TI  - Street Tree Planning to Improve Public Health and Ecosystem Resilience in Urban Areas: A Scenario Analysis Using a System Dynamics Model
PY  - 2022
AB  - Increases in particulate matter in cities threaten both public health and ecosystems. Street trees, which are a corridor-type green infrastructure capable of absorbing particulate matter, have been promoted as one possible solution to this problem. However, planting selected trees solely with the goal of reducing particulate matter may adversely affect street tree ecosystem resilience by inhibiting species diversity. This study aims to investigate urban street tree planting strategies that reduce particulate matter while maintaining ecosystem resilience. To this end, a study site in Suwon, South Korea was selected, and street tree planting scenarios were developed based on the selected site information. A scenario analysis was conducted using a system dynamics model. The model simulated the long-term trends under each scenario regarding the amount of particulate matter absorbed by the trees and the changes in species diversity. The analysis results clearly show that strategic planting of street trees while focusing on only a specific purpose-reducing particulate matter-can adversely affect ecosystem resilience. The scenario analysis also revealed that increasing the number of street trees while maintaining a balance among various species is the best option for reducing particulate matter without degrading species diversity. Additionally, the results support the need to plant evergreen species to consider the winter season.

TI  - Using Bayesian Belief Networks to assess the influence of landscape connectivity on ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies in urban landscapes in the UK
PY  - 2021
AB  - Context: Landscape connectivity is assumed to influence ecosystem service (ES) trade-offs and synergies. However, empirical studies of the effect of landscape connectivity on ES trade-offs and synergies are limited, especially in urban areas where the interactions between patterns and processes are complex. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to use a Bayesian Belief Network approach to (1) assess whether functional connectivity drives ES trade-offs and synergies in urban areas and (2) assess the influence of connectivity on the supply of ESs. Methods: We used circuit theory to model urban bird flow of P. major and C. caeruleus at a 2 m spatial resolution in Bedford, Luton and Milton Keynes, UK, and Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to assess the sensitivity of ES trade-offs and synergies model outputs to landscape and patch structural characteristics (patch area, connectivity and bird species abundance). Results: We found that functional connectivity was the most influential variable in determining two of three ES trade-offs and synergies. Patch area and connectivity exerted a strong influence on ES trade-offs and synergies. Low patch area and low to moderately low connectivity were associated with high levels of ES trade-offs and synergies. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that landscape connectivity is an influential determinant of ES trade-offs and synergies and supports the conviction that larger and better-connected habitat patches increase ES provision. A BBN approach is proposed as a feasible method of ES trade-off and synergy prediction in complex landscapes. Our findings can prove to be informative for urban ES management. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Relative Importance of Quantity, Quality and Isolation of Patches for Butterfly Diversity in Fragmented Urban Forests
PY  - 2012
AB  - The majority of forests in urban areas are small and isolated. Improving habitat quality of small forests instead of increasing habitat size and connectivity could be an effective means of conserving the biodiversity of such highly fragmented landscapes. In this study, we investigated the relative importance of habitat quantity, quality and isolation on butterfly assemblages in urban fragmented forests in Tokyo, Japan. We used four habitat geographic parameters: (1) fragment size, (2) shape index, (3) isolation (distance to the mainland), and (4) connectivity; and three habitat quality parameters: (1) herbaceous nectar plant abundance, (2) herbaceous nectar plant diversity, and (3) larval host plant diversity. We surveyed butterfly assemblages along transects in 20 forest fragments that ranged in size from 1 to 122 ha. We used generalized linear models to relate the number of species in a fragment to four habitat geographic parameters and three habitat quality parameters. The averaged models based on AIC c showed that fragment size had a strong positive effect on butterfly species richness. There was also a positive effect of herbaceous nectar plant abundance on species diversity. These findings suggest that improving the habitat quality of small and isolated forests in highly fragmented landscapes may be capable of maintaining levels of butterfly diversity comparable to those of large fragments. © 2011 The Ecological Society of Japan.

TI  - Effects of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian assemblages of urban stormwater ponds
PY  - 2017
AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most severe drivers of current global biodiversity loss and has contributed to severe declines in many amphibian species. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for amphibians in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian species richness of 46 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 46 control ponds (CONTROL). Our study revealed that environmental conditions clearly varied between STOPON and CONTROL. The most pronounced differences were that STOPON were larger, shallower, sunnier, more isolated by streets and had a greater cover of built-up area and lower cover of arable land surrounding them. Nevertheless, the amphibian assemblages of STOPON and CONTROL were very similar. All nine amphibian species (including three threatened species) detected in this study were found in both pond types. Moreover, species richness (2.8 ± 0.2 vs. 2.3 ± 0.2) and the frequency of each species did not differ between STOPON and CONTROL. The only exception was Pelophylax spp., which occurred more regularly in STOPON. Both habitat and landscape quality affected amphibian species richness; however, the explanatory power of the habitat models was about twice as high as those of the landscape models. In conclusion, stormwater ponds play an important role for amphibians in urban areas. In comparison to CONTROL, the low landscape quality in the surroundings of STOPON seemed to be compensated by a higher habitat quality due to regular management. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Roadside and riverside green – urban corridors in the city of Vantaa, Finland
PY  - 2015
AB  - The spatial distribution of biodiversity has specific patterns in urban environments. The aim of this study was to compare the ecological profiles of plants in man-made traffic corridors and natural river corridors in the city of Vantaa. The number of corridor species represented 76.3 % of Vantaa’s total flora, even though corridors covered only 2.7 % of the city area. Corridor plants are mostly generalist species with wide ecological niches, and have ruderal and competitor life-strategies, while plants without occurrences in corridors are habitat specialists and species with narrow ecological niches. The conservation value of non-corridor habitats arises from the rarity of species, and the representation of the original boreal nature, while corridors contribute to the total diversity of species. The potential of corridors in urban conservation has not been fully appreciated.

TI  - Foraging distances and habitat preferences of a recent urban coloniser: The Australian white ibis
PY  - 2011
AB  - Australian white ibis populations have increased in many urban areas while traditional inland populations have declined. In instances where conflicts have occurred land managers have been licensed to remove nests and eggs and cull adults at a site scale. With the increase in urban populations and local management of the species, there is a need to understand how ibis are using urban resources and how they move through the urban landscape to identify important resources. To gain a better understanding of the connectedness of local urban populations, we fitted 82 birds with radio transmitters at three common habitats: an urban park, a breeding colony and a landfill. Over a period of 48 weeks we found 45% of birds made movements greater than 10. km, with 13% moving greater than 30. km. Ibis were located at up to nine foraging and seven roost sites, demonstrating the connectedness of the population across the study region. Landfills were identified as a major food resource with 63% of ibis (n = 82) located therein, while parks supported local foraging with only 27% of ibis (n = 82) located therein. Our results indicate that ibis showed site fidelity but also interacted on a regional scale within approximately 40. km of their colonies. Accordingly, conservation planning for this species needs to be assessed on a regional basis, not on a localized case-by-case basis. However, further research into the limits of the 'region' is required for this highly mobile colonial species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Absence of a Luxury Effect on bird alpha diversity in a rapidly developing African city, but surrounding landscape is key
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aspiring towards cities that are sustainable and equitable, as detailed by Goal 11 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, has become increasingly relevant given the growing human population in urban areas. A key part of guaranteeing that cities meet Goal 11 is to ensure equitable access to urban green spaces, and the biodiversity that they support, for all residents. However, there is evidence from developed world cities of a Luxury Effect, where wealthier residents have greater access to urban biodiversity than poorer residents. To test for this Luxury Effect in a developing world city, we measured bird species richness and diversity in 27 urban green spaces in Johannesburg, South Africa, to examine how socio-economic and ecological drivers influence urban biodiversity. We found no evidence of a Luxury Effect with the median income of neighbourhoods surrounding the green spaces having no significant effect on bird richness or diversity. There were, however, ecological effects with surrounding natural land-cover negatively correlated to richness, and a positive influence of wetland connectivity on richness. The negative effect of natural land-cover is possibly due to the relatively low bird diversity of the natural grasslands surrounding Johannesburg. The positive effect of wetland connectivity and the lack of a Luxury Effect indicate that the use of waterbodies to historically separate populations has buffered poorer neighbourhoods from depreciated biodiversity within the selected green spaces. The effect of wetlands also further emphasises the importance of water availability on urban biodiversity. This indicates that historical land use decisions can still influence how biodiversity is distributed in urban landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Current state and problems of modernization of ecological framework of regions of the Steppe Zone of European Russia
PY  - 2019
AB  - Aim: The aim of the study is to assess the current state of the elements of the naturalecological framework of the steppe regions of European Russia and the peculiarities of its spatial distribution. Discussion: The most important component of the environmental framework of the steppe regions of European Russia is the system of relatively large zonal landscape areas of the nature reserve fund which contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, the functional integrity of landscapes and the development of ecological networks. As of January 1, 2018, the natural reserve fund of the federal level in the territory of the considered mezoregion is represented by 22 specially protected natural territories (10 reserves, 5 national parks and 7 wildlife sanctuaries) with a total area of 16.1 thousand km2. The share of the area of specially protected natural reservation is about 2% of the area of the considered mezoregion. Practically for all the regions under consideration, there is a situation where numerous natural territories with \"prospective\" status are considered for integration into the nature reserve fund; however, the efforts of the scientific community, environmental services and relevant ministries are not very active in implementing projects to give them corresponding status. Conclusion: For the territory stretching from the northern border of the Saratov region to the central part of the Krasnodar Territory, the problem of the absence of cores and key elements constituting the framework of the nature reserve fund is most acute. In six territorial subjects of the Mesoregion, there are no specially protected natural steppe reservations of the federal level. The analysis of modern territorial planning schemes of the steppe regions indicates that the environmental framework of European Russia has not yet become the basis for the adoption of urban planning decisions. At the same time, its structural elements (preserved zonal landscapes, natural and derived landscape complexes), along with autonomously functioning nature-like territorial complexes, will help create a favorable environment for the population. © 2019 Kamerton.

TI  - Simulating population variation and movement within fragmented landscapes: An application to the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus)
PY  - 2009
AB  - As the human activity footprint grows, land-use decisions play an increasing role in determining the future of plant and animal species. Studies have shown that urban and agricultural development cannot only harm species populations directly through habitat destruction, but also by destroying the corridors that connect habitat patches and populations within a metapopulation. Without these pathways, populations can encounter inbreeding depression and degeneration, which can increase death rates and lower rates of reproduction. This article describes the development and application of the FRAGGLE model, a spatial system dynamics model designed to calculate connectivity indices among populations. FRAGGLE can help planners and managers identify the relative contribution of populations associated with habitat patches to future populations in those patches, taking into account the importance of interstitial land to migration success. The model is applied to the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), a threatened species whose southeastern U.S. distribution has diminished significantly within its native range due to agricultural and urban development over the last several decades. This model is parameterized with life history and movement traits of the gopher tortoise in order to simulate population demographics and spatial distribution within an area in west-central Georgia that supports a significant tortoise population. The implications of this simulation modeling effort are demonstrated using simple landscape representations and a hypothetical on land-use management scenario. Our findings show that development resulting in even limited habitat losses (10%) may lead to significant increases in fragmentation as measured by a loss in the rate of dispersions (31%) among area subpopulations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Centipedes (Chilopoda) in urban forest habitats: the case of the metropolitan city of Rome area (Central Italy)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Three forest fragments located along a gradient from the central area of the city (an urban historical park) to increasingly peripheral areas (a suburban nature reserve, an extraurban nature reserve) were identified in the western sectors of the Metropolitan City of Capital Rome administrative district and its surroundings (Central Italy). With the aims to describe the structural parameters of Chilopod assemblages in these forest fragments for determine their status of conservation and to evaluate the effects of some environmental variables (coverage of the canopy layer, shrub layer, herb layer, litter layer) on selected species, sampling took place by pitfall traps from June 2015 to June 2016. The relevance of these kind of studies is in precisely identifying the areas of greatest conservation value; the purpose is to provide guidelines for the planning of the ecological network of the city of Rome towards the protection of the areas inhabited by more sensitive fauna and flora elements rather than protecting as many areas as possible. Chilopods are strictly forest arthropods, therefore they are considered useful biondicators of these ecosystems. The centipede assemblage of suburban forest fragment is characterized by a greater complexity and stability compared to the centipede assemblages of central and extraurban forest fragments, both apparently in a typical state of successional stages. The distribution pattern of the centipede diversity of the study area seems to deviate from the usual patterns found in other European cities for other arthropod assemblages as well as for the centipedes, as the greater biodiversity has been recorded in the suburban forest fragment, not in the extraurban one. The suburban forest fragment is moreover characterized by a higher degree of stratification and structural complexity than the other two forest fragments, with a largest number of forest species, some of these absent both in the urban and the extraurban fragments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.

TI  - Planting design and vegetation management for promoting biodiversity at a university campus - Example of butterfly
PY  - 2013
AB  - Conservation of biodiversity is an important global challenge to ensuring future sustainability. University campuses can provide valuable resources for biodiversity; however, this is not yet fully recognized and sufficiently researched. The present study was carried out to show the biodiversity value of different green spaces at the Chiba University Nishi-Chiba Campus. Butterflies were chosen as indicators at ten sites: one intensive green roof, four meadows, two roads, two open spaces and one kitchen garden. From June 2010 to November 2010, butterfly surveys were carried out by transect counts from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm every two weeks, ten times in total. We identified 705 individuals of 25 species from 5 families. The species were mainly those common to urban areas near Tokyo. The results showed that the highest number of butterfly species and the highest total number of butterflies were observed in the kitchen garden, where various medicinal herbs provided a continuous source of nectar. On the contrary, the lowest total number of butterflies was found on the intensive green roof, although the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') value was high. The meadows provided a valuable habitat for the butterflies, and the roads connecting the campus green spaces were an important passageway for the butterflies. In the open spaces, areas planted with flowerbeds attracted a high number of butterflies. In conclusion, the university campus provided favorable habitats for butterflies; however, careful planting design and management is required to maintain nectar sources and host plants to maximize the biodiversity benefits of each green space.

TI  - Assessing conservation status on coastal dunes: A multiscale approach
PY  - 2009
AB  - Coastal dune systems are particularly fragile and threatened environments, which, however, provide fundamental ecosystem services to nearby urban areas acting for example as protective buffers against erosion. Correctly assessing their conservation status is a priority in order to manage them adequately and to plan urban development in coastal regions. In this paper we propose a practical multiscale method for the assessment of the conservation status of sandy coastal environment. The proposed method is articulated in two stages, one focusing on the landscape and the other on the plant community level. In the first phase mosaic structure and composition of the coastal landscape are analyzed using a series of indicators: natural coastal surface, richness of land cover typologies, landscape diversity and eveness, number and average size of habitat patches, and mean shape index. At a detailed scale, floristic, vegetational and structural aspects of the dune plant communities are analyzed along the main environmental gradient by measuring: spatial connectivity and richness of boundaries, species diversity, eveness and chorological index. In this work we apply and test the method in an experimental area on the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy (Latium region), comparing the conservation status of two study sites. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Terrestrial ecosystem classification and its spatiotemporal changes in China during last 20 years
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ecosystem classification is fundamental for its identification of spatiotemporal changes and type-oriented management. Based on the dominant service function and human intervention intensity, this study developed an ecosystem classification system comprising 9 first-level and 25 second-level categories, identified their spatial distribution, and further analyzed the spatiotemporal changes between 2000 and 2020, by integrating multi-source data of land use, climate, topography, vegetation, soil, and settlement distribution. The results showed that urban/township ecosystem in China expanded 1.1 times, with 64.51% of the inereased area converted from the cultivated land ecosystem. Cultivated land ecosystem was shrunk by ().88xl()4 km2, its second-level ecosystems of paddyland and dry farmland decreased by 0.60xl04 km2 and 2.09xl()4 km2 , respectively, and oasis farmland expanded by 1.81xl() km\". Due to implementation of the \"Grain for Green\" project, mixed farmland/pastureland and farmland/forestland ecosystems decreased by 2.88xl04 km2 and 0.92x 10 km', respectively, while the forestland ecosystem increased by 1.61 x 10 km2. The water/wetland ecosystem increased by 0.31 xlO4 km2, of which 70% was from the expansion of marshland ecosystem. With the climate becoming warmer and wetter, the arid desert and frozen land ecosystems were shrunk by 14.98xl04 km' and 0.92xl()4 km\", respectively, while the pastureland ecosystem was expanded by 9.97xl04 km2. Associated with these changes, the landscape connectivity declined while the fragmentation and diversity, as well as the resistance of ecological processes increased. The ecological status in China improved significantly from 2000 to 2020, with 92.06% of the ecosystems showing an increase in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at the mean increase rate of 0.74%/a. Of the identified ecosystems, the mixed farmland/pastureland and farmland/forestland ecosystems showed the most evident increase in the NDVI, increased by 1.26%/a and 0.85%/a, respectively. The classification and mapping results highlight the differences in ecosystem structure, ecological environment risks and productivity, providing scientific support for macro-scale ecosystem management. © 2021 Science Press.

TI  - An approach for integrated optimization of wastewater, recycled and potable water networks
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper outlines an approach to the integrated optimization of wastewater, recycled and potable water systems in an urban area. The approach will be demonstrated through consideration of a case study of the Hume corridor in Melbourne, Australia. A total of 44,000 new residential lots are planned in this area. These houses will have their garden and toilet connected to a Class A recycled water system. The recycled network will also incorporate some industrial demands. As the recycled water system will receive its inputs from wastewater treatment plants, the three networks had to be considered in an integrated fashion. The case study considered the development of two optimisation models, one for the wastewater system and the other for the potable and recycled water systems. The interface between the two models occurred at the wastewater and recycled water treatment plants. Values were set for the capacities of these plants for each model and they were adjusted to ensure compatibility between the two models. The recycled network was designed to the same level of service as the potable water network, e.g. 25 m minimum allowable pressure head at all demand nodes. As potable water top-up of the recycled system is to be considered, it was found that the potable water network needed to carry flows greater than potable peak hour demands. The results obtained clearly indicated the value of using evolutionary algorithms in an integrated fashion to optimize potable and third pipe systems. Application of this approach to other areas is likely to make third pipe systems more attractive and to lead to significant savings in the use of limited water supplies. © 2009 ASCE.

TI  - Using multiple data sources to explore disease transmission risk between commercial poultry, backyard poultry, and wild birds in New Zealand
PY  - 2021
AB  - The movements of backyard poultry and wild bird populations are known to pose a disease risk to the commercial poultry industry. However, it is often difficult to estimate this risk due to the lack of accurate data on the numbers, locations, and movement patterns of these populations. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the use of three different data sources when investigating disease transmission risk between poultry populations in New Zealand including (1) cross-sectional survey data looking at the movement of goods and services within the commercial poultry industry, (2) backyard poultry sales data from the online auction site TradeMe®, and (3) citizen science data from the wild bird monitoring project eBird. The cross-sectional survey data and backyard poultry sales data were transformed into network graphs showing the connectivity of commercial and backyard poultry producers across different geographical regions. The backyard poultry network was also used to parameterise a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) simulation model to explore the behaviour of potential disease outbreaks. The citizen science data was used to create an additional map showing the spatial distribution of wild bird observations across New Zealand. To explore the potential for diseases to spread between each population, maps were combined into bivariate choropleth maps showing the overlap between movements within the commercial poultry industry, backyard poultry trades and, wild bird observations. Network analysis revealed that the commercial poultry network was highly connected with geographical clustering around the urban centres of Auckland, New Plymouth and Christchurch. The backyard poultry network was also a highly active trade network and displayed similar geographic clustering to the commercial network. In the disease simulation models, the high connectivity resulted in all suburbs becoming infected in 96.4 % of the SI simulations. Analysis of the eBird data included reports of over 80 species; the majority of which were identified as coastal seabirds or wading birds that showed little overlap with either backyard or commercial poultry. Overall, our study findings highlight how the spatial patterns of trading activity within the commercial poultry industry, alongside the movement of backyard poultry and wild birds, have the potential to contribute significantly to the spread of diseases between these populations. However, it is clear that in order to fully understand this risk landscape, further data integration is needed; including the use of additional datasets that have further information on critical variables such as environmental factors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The flora of urban river wallscapes
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urban river walls represent some of the most common habitat available to riparian species within heavily engineered urban river corridors, but research into the characteristics and diversity of river walls is very rare. In this study, the flora of urban river walls was surveyed at 16 sites (92 walls) along 32km of the river Thames through central London to determine the characteristics and habitat origins of species found on these walls, whether these species indicated 'an urban cliff effect' occurring on wall habitats and whether plant species richness varied between different wall types. A total of 90 species were found on the walls, with the majority of species associated with disturbed areas and riparian habitats, supporting the idea of a 'mass effect' occurring, whereby the flora is maintained by propagule pressure from remnant or introduced habitats within urban or peri-urban areas, rather than walls selecting for cliff/rock species. There was an increased incidence of plants from cliff/rock habitats found in the flora however, suggesting that an urban cliff effect does still occur. Species were organized along the river walls based on riparian/terrestrial gradients and stress tolerance, probably reflecting a gradient of wall height above river flows. Plant species richness was significantly higher on brick walls than that on sheet piling, indicating key differences between materials probably based on surface integrity. Large areas of connected river walls ('wallscapes') through heavily engineered urban rivers represent potential sites for the enactment of reconciliation ecology via habitat improvement in urban ecosystems. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Is managed recreational use compatible with effective habitat and wildlife occurrence in urban open space corridor systems?
PY  - 2001
AB  - The extent to which urban open space corridors meet recreational, habitat and wildlife needs is highly dependent on the degree to which the interactive effects of these uses are identified and incorporated into planning, design and management decisions. For managers who aim to enhance compatibility between people and wildlife, the challenge is to bridge the gap between established practice and a more multi-functional approach. Ultimately the aim should be to put in place an enlightened and sympathetic management regime that supports indigenous biodiversity maintainable at an acceptable cost and is compatible with providing sufficient access to cater for a wide range of recreational activities. Principles relating to site evaluation and corridor management are discussed in the context of a case study in Singapore.

TI  - Interaction of urban rivers and green space morphology to mitigate the urban heat island effect: Case-based comparative analysis
PY  - 2021
AB  - The spatial morphology of waterfront green spaces helps generate cooling effects to mitigate the urban heat island effect (UHI) in metropolis cities. To explore the contribution and influence of multi-dimensional spatial indices on the mitigation of UHIs, the green space of the riparian buffer along 18 river channels in Shanghai was considered as a case study. The spatial distribution data of the land surface temperature (LST) in the study area were obtained by using remote sensing images. By selecting the related spatial structure morphological factors of the waterfront green space as the quantitative description index, the growth regression tree model (BRT) was adapted to analyze the contribution of various indexes of the waterfront green space on the distribution of the LST and the marginal effect of blue-green synergistic cooling. In addition, mathematical statistical analysis and spatial analysis methods were used to study the influence of the morphological group (MG) types of riparian green spaces with different morphological characteristics on the LST. The results showed that in terms of the spatial structure variables between blue and green spaces, the contribution of river widths larger than 30 m was more notable in decreasing the LST. In the case of a larger river width, the marginal effect of synergistic cooling could be observed in farther regions. The green space that had the highest connectivity degree and was located in the leeward direction of the river exhibited the lowest LST. In terms of the spatial morphology, the fractional cover values of the vegetation (Fv) and area (A) of the green space were the main factors affecting the cooling effect of the green space. For all MG types, a large green patch that had a high green coverage and connectivity degree, as well as was distributed in the leeward direction of the river, corresponded to the lowest LST. The research presented herein can provide methods and development suggestions for optimizing spatial thermal comfort in climate adaptive cities.

TI  - Lifestyle cities, remote work and implications for urban planning
PY  - 2022
AB  - Australia’s cities and regions are the envy of the world for their natural beauty and lifestyle amenities and attractions. Not only has this sustained the tree-change and sea-change movement, with broadband connectivity and the COVID-19 pandemic so-called ‘e-changers’ and ‘flee-changers’ are part of the populus seeking to combine career aspirations with lifestyle destinations. This paper discusses the growing popularity of remote, particularly home-based work, and planning and design responses that accommodate this type of work in residential neighbourhoods. The issues are exemplified through a case study of the City of Gold Coast drawing on mixed methods including survey instruments and a design charrette facilitated by the authors. The design charrette is reported via three integrative narratives of a remote worker, the neighbourhood and the city. Findings outline preferences of remote workers towards built environment and urban design features enabling collaboration and knowledge exchange and assist in a better understanding of the socio-economic factors behind the spatial distribution of home-based work. The study’s findings offer a range of implications for appropriate urban planning and design responses. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Mapping an ecological network of green habitat patches and their role in maintaining urban biodiversity in and around Debrecen city (Eastern Hungary)
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanisation is a leading process on the Globe causing a massive loss of natural habitats. In parallel variety of habitats were created in urban environments, which may also support species diversity. Our aim was to identify urban green areas and their connections with the Regional Ecological Network surrounding the city of Debrecen (East-Hungary), and to explore the biodiversity potential of the network of these parks. We found that whilst industrial areas, airport and mixed land covered a relatively large area, parks and other functional green spaces had a relatively small extent. However the green space system of the city is well connected to the Regional Ecological Network. We also surveyed the functional and potential green spaces in the city and in the studied patches of the Regional Ecological Network in and around the city. We found that 65% of the functional green spaces are potentially connected thus there is a possibility for species typical to semi-natural open habitats to disperse between the green spaces of the city. Based on the survey of the spontaneous flora and planted ornamentals we found that the ratio of native species was high in the studied urban parks. We found that native species were the most typical (>50%) in the spontaneous flora of the studied urban parks, although the ratio of archaeophytes and neophytes were also high. Among ornamental plants, both the proportion of native species and neophytes were considerable in each park, and the proportion of archaeophytes was low. Our results suggest that the studied urban habitats have some biodiversity conservation potential; they mostly harbour species which can cope with the local environmental conditions of the city parks, such as increased temperature, drought and nutrient enrichment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Land use history and seed dispersal drive divergent plant community assembly patterns in urban vacant lots
PY  - 2018
AB  - Summary
Despite high levels of disturbance and habitat modification, urban ecosystems still host substantial levels of biodiversity. The processes that maintain existing levels of diversity, however, remain understudied. Identifying the links between urban ecological processes and patterns has, therefore, become a fundamental research goal to support urban biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
We conducted a study to determine how the diversity and composition of urban plant communities is affected by spatially and temporally variable land use legacies. We constructed a chronosequence of vacant lot properties covering a range of 3-22 years since demolition, in an urban neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland (USA). Surveys of herbaceous plant species abundance were conducted during the summers of 2012 and 2013 in sections of each vacant lot where the building previously stood (the ‘building footprint’) and sections of the lot that was previously a backyard or garden (the ‘remnant garden’).
We found divergent patterns in plant community composition between areas of vacant lots with varying land use histories. This includes significant shifts in the functional composition of biotically-vectored seed dispersal strategies, as well as an increase in seed mass and terminal velocity trait values of plant communities in building footprints over time. Additionally, we found that plant communities in different sections of the same vacant lot tended to become more functionally dissimilar in seed dispersal strategies over time. In contrast, we found no significant changes in taxonomic diversity over time for any of our measures.
Policy implications. Our study suggests that regional-scale patterns of seed dispersal interact with diverse land use legacies to structure the plant communities of urban vacant lots. Although it has been suggested that highly altered local environmental conditions and competition from introduced species limit native plant diversity in urban environments, we find seed dispersal to be a more significant driver of urban plant community assembly patterns. Implementing management strategies that focus on habitat connectivity and enhancing species pools via seeding may present an effective strategy for promoting more successful establishment of diverse plant communities in urban environments.

TI  - Gravel pits support waterbird diversity in an urban landscape
PY  - 2009
AB  - We assessed the benefit of 11 gravel pits for the settlement of waterbird communities in an urbanized area lacking natural wetlands. Gravel pits captured 57% of the regional species pool of aquatic birds. We identified 39 species, among which five were regionally rare. We used the Self-Organizing Map algorithm to calculate the probabilities of presence of species, and to bring out habitat conditions that predict assemblage patterns. The age of the pits did not correlate with assemblage composition and species richness. There was a positive influence of macrophyte cover on waterbird species richness. Larger pits did not support more species, but species richness increased with connectivity. As alternative wetland habitats, gravel pits are attractive to waterbirds, when they act as stepping stones that ensure connectivity between larger natural and/or artificial wetlands separated in space. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

TI  - Urbanization and the temporal patterns of social networks and group foraging behaviors
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization causes dramatic and rapid changes to natural environments, which can lead the animals inhabiting these habitats to adjust their behavioral responses. For social animals, urbanized environments may alter group social dynamics through modification of the external environment (e.g., resource distribution). This might lead to changes in how individuals associate or engage in group behaviors, which could alter the stability and characteristics of social groups. However, the potential impacts of urban habitat use, and of habitat characteristics in general, on the nature and stability of social associations remain poorly understood. Here, we quantify social networks and dynamics of group foraging behaviors of black-capped chickadees (N = 82, Poecile atricapillus), at four urban and four rural sites weekly throughout the nonbreeding season using feeders with radio frequency identification of individual birds. Because anthropogenic food sources in urban habitats (e.g., bird feeders) provide abundant and reliable resources, we predicted that social foraging associations may be of less value in urban groups, and thus would be less consistent than in rural groups. Additionally, decreased variability of food resources in urban habitats could lead to more predictable foraging patterns (group size, foraging duration, and the distribution of foraging events) in contrast to rural habitats. Networks were found to be highly consistent through time in both urban and rural habitats. No significant difference was found in the temporal clumping of foraging events between habitats. However, as predicted, the repeatability of the clumping of foraging events in time was significantly higher in urban than rural habitats. Our results suggest that individuals living in urban areas have more consistent foraging behaviors throughout the nonbreeding season, whereas rural individuals adjust their tactics due to less predictable foraging conditions. This first examination of habitat-related differences in the characteristics and consistency of social networks along an urbanization gradient suggests that anthropic habitat use results in subtle modifications in social foraging patterns. Future studies should examine potential implications of these differences for variation in predation risk, energy intake, and information flow. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Integrating population connectivity into pollution assessment: Overwintering mixing reveals flame retardant contamination in breeding areas in a migratory raptor
PY  - 2018
AB  - Determining the exposure and magnitude at which various pollutants are differentially assimilated at the breeding and non-breeding grounds of migratory wildlife is challenging. Here, the possibility of applying the migratory connectivity framework to understanding contamination in birds is illustrated by considering flame retardants in inviable eggs of a migratory raptor, the black kite (Milvus migrans). The occurrence and concentration of legacy and emerging compounds in eggs from the southeastern peri-urban area of Madrid city, central Spain, were compared with those from Doñana National Park in southern Spain. A much higher occurrence and concentration of multiple polybrominated diphenyl ethers and Dechlorane 602 were found in Madrid than Doñana, but the opposite patterns were found for Dechlorane Plus. Individuals from these and other breeding areas in western Europe showed a strong intermixing pattern over widespread wintering areas in Africa, as assessed by ringing recoveries and movements tracked by satellite devices. This diffuse migratory connectivity reveals breeding areas as the main contamination grounds. High contamination burdens sequestered in eggs point to rapid assimilation of these compounds before laying, associated with important emission sources in Madrid, especially landfills of partially incinerated urban refuse, and other anthropogenic operations. Diet composition regarding aquatic vs. terrestrial prey, and bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes are suggested to explain differential assimilation of some compounds, especially Dechlorane Plus in Doñana, although a local emission source polluting this area cannot be ruled out. Insight from the migratory connectivity framework can help to disentangle large-scale patterns of contaminant uptake and refocus attention on key regions and potential causes of chemical hazards in declining migratory species and human populations. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Land use planning and wildlife maintenance: Guidelines for conserving wildlife in an urban landscape
PY  - 1991
AB  - The study of plants and animals on islands, both natural and artificial, has produced a body of generalizations immediately useful to land use planners concerned with minimizing the impacts of habitat destruction on the environment. A case study of 37 isolated chaparral fragments in San Diego, California, demonstrates the consequences of habitat fragmentation, including rapid and predictable extinctions of native birds in isolated canyons. This study and others can be used to generate planning guidelines for the prevention of such disappearances. Among the most important measures that can be taken are consolidation of open space set-asides and the provision of corridors linking habitat patches. Corridors can mitigate some of the negative effects of development on wildlife, especially where they facilitate the movement of large predators. © American Planning Association Chicago, IL.

TI  - Natural enemy-herbivore networks along local management and landscape gradients in urban agroecosystems.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Ecological networks can provide insight into how biodiversity loss and changes in species interactions impact the delivery of ecosystem services. In agroecosystems that vary in management practices, quantifying changes in ecological network structure across gradients of local and landscape composition can inform both the ecology and function of productive agroecosystems. In this study, we examined natural-enemy-herbivore co-occurrence networks associated with Brassica oleracea (cole crops), a common crop in urban agricultural systems. Specifically, we investigated how local management characteristics of urban community gardens and the landscape composition around them affect (1) the abundance of B. oleracea herbivores and their natural enemies, (2) the natural-enemy : herbivore ratio, and (3) natural-enemy-herbivore co-occurrence network metrics. We sampled herbivores and natural enemies in B. oleracea plants in 24 vegetable gardens in the California, USA central coast region. We also collected information on garden characteristics and land-use cover of the surrounding landscape (2 km radius). We found that increased floral richness and B. oleracea abundance were associated with increased parasitoid abundance, non-aphid herbivore abundance, and increased network vulnerability; increased vegetation complexity suppressed parasitoid abundance, but still boosted network vulnerability. High agricultural land-use cover in the landscape surrounding urban gardens was associated with lower predator, parasitoid, and non-aphid herbivore abundance, lower natural-enemy : herbivore ratios, lower interaction richness, and higher trophic complementarity. While we did not directly measure pest control, higher interaction richness, higher vulnerability, and lower trophic complementarity are associated with higher pest control services in other agroecosystems. Thus, if gardens function similarly to other agroecosystems, our results indicate that increasing vegetation complexity, including trees, shrubs, and plant richness, especially within gardens located in intensively farmed landscapes, could potentially enhance the biodiversity and abundance of natural enemies, supporting ecological networks associated with higher pest control services.

TI  - Urban resilience and green infrastructure systems: towards a multidimensional evaluation
PY  - 2020
AB  - Multifunctional and connected green infrastructure (GI) systems have been linked to urban resilience. Although there have been significant scholarly efforts to assess resilience and to evaluate the benefits of GI, it remains unclear the degree in which GI efforts enhance resilience. Following theoretical frameworks that study coupled infrastructure systems, this paper explores the state of the art on the contribution of GI to urban resilience from multiple dimensions: (1) policy - that promotes the adoption of GI, (2) performance - assessment of GI impacts on water infrastructure systems resilience, (3) connectivity - evaluation of human and wildlife movement through GI, and (4) social - community cohesion as a result of GI efforts. We argue that beyond their individual contributions to supporting urban resilience, the interactions across the various dimensions are key to enhancing resilience. Ultimately, participatory processes are needed to assess resilience originating from GI systems and avoid injustice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A river runs through it: Land-use and the composition of vegetation along a riparian corridor in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa
PY  - 2010
AB  - Riparian zones are important for the many ecosystem services they supply. In settled areas, the vegetation of such zones is shaped by human land-use; this often creates conditions under which alien plant species thrive. Alien plants have been shown to induce large-scale changes in riparian habitats, and they pose a major threat to the continued provision of key ecosystem services. We used direct gradient analysis to assess correlations between land-use and the composition of vegetation along a riparian river corridor in the highly transformed landscape surrounding Stellenbosch in South Africa's Western Cape Province. Vegetation plots were sampled along the entire length of the river from headwaters to estuary (ca. 40 km). Plant community composition was analyzed in relation to land-use data collected in the field, and additional land-use variables computed from digital land-cover data. Patterns of plant community structure were found to be directly related to land-use, with measures of cover, richness, and diversity differing significantly among land-use types. Portions of the riparian zone adjacent to agricultural land had the greatest level of alien plant cover, while areas bordered by urban land maintained the highest alien species richness. Areas adjacent to grazing and natural lands showed intermediate and low levels of invasion, respectively. Several native species were found to persist in areas with high abundance and diversity of invasive alien plants, suggesting that they will be valuable focal species for future restoration attempts. Due to the level of human-mediated change in many areas of the riparian zone, restoration to historic conditions over most of the river is not considered feasible. These areas should be recognized as examples of novel ecosystems, and management efforts should focus on restoring or creating desirable ecosystem functions, rather than on achieving assemblages comprising only native species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Urbanization homogenizes the interactions of plant-frugivore bird networks
PY  - 2020
AB  - Anthropogenic activities are the main cause of habitat loss and fragmentation, which directly affects biodiversity. Disruption in landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization, one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species, which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits, including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of ecosystems functions. Thus, urbanization plans should consider the proportion and distribution of green areas within cities, coupling human and ecosystem wellbeing. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Beyond the landscape: Resistance modelling infers physical and behavioural gene flow barriers to a mobile carnivore across a metropolitan area
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization affects key aspects of wildlife ecology. Dispersal in urban wildlife species may be impacted by geographical barriers but also by a species' inherent behavioural variability. There are no functional connectivity analyses using continuous individual-based sampling across an urban-rural continuum that would allow a thorough assessment of the relative importance of physical and behavioural dispersal barriers. We used 16 microsatellite loci to genotype 374 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from the city of Berlin and surrounding rural regions in Brandenburg in order to study genetic structure and dispersal behaviour of a mobile carnivore across the urban-rural landscape. We assessed functional connectivity by applying an individual-based landscape genetic optimization procedure. Three commonly used genetic distance measures yielded different model selection results, with only the results of an eigenvector-based multivariate analysis reasonably explaining genetic differentiation patterns. Genetic clustering methods and landscape resistance modelling supported the presence of an urban population with reduced dispersal across the city border. Artificial structures (railways, motorways) served as main dispersal corridors within the cityscape, yet urban foxes avoided densely built-up areas. We show that despite their ubiquitous presence in urban areas, their mobility and behavioural plasticity, foxes were affected in their dispersal by anthropogenic presence. Distinguishing between man-made structures and sites of human activity, rather than between natural and artificial structures, is thus essential for better understanding urban fox dispersal. This differentiation may also help to understand dispersal of other urban wildlife and to predict how behaviour can shape population genetic structure beyond physical barriers.

TI  - Balancing diversity and connectivity in multi-level governance settings for urban transformative capacity
PY  - 2019
AB  - Transformation towards sustainable development is about findings new ways of thinking, organising and doing to navigate wicked challenges such as climate change and urbanisation. Such challenges call for new governance modes that match the complexity of the systems to be handled, where multi-level governance and collaborative approaches have been suggested to contribute to such transformative capacity building. This in-depth, trans-disciplinary study investigates how the multi-level governance context in Stockholm, Sweden, influences the transformative capacity from the perspective of local sustainability initiatives. It was found that even though the decentralized governance of the Stockholm region hosts a great potential in supporting city wide transformation, it is hampered by disconnect between actors, levels and sectors and the short-term funding structure. The suggested interventions highlight the tension between enabling collaborations, while safeguarding a high local diversity of initiatives and flexibility to ensure sustained space for innovation and learning. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Multitemporal analysis of landscape of Appia Antica Regional Park (Rome)
PY  - 2008
AB  - Vegetation and land use mapping are considered very important tools in conservation and management of semi-natural areas in urban ecosystems. I observed, by remote sensing techniques (Naturalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) and GIS applications (overlay mapping), environmental changes occurred in the period 1975/2002 in the Appia Antica Regional Park, an important corridor of the ecological network of Rome that preserves vegetal patches testifying a potential towards evolved woodland communities. The results show the benefits of multi-temporal analysis in evaluating the state of landscape and in developing appropriate management projects. Three main aspects emerged: 1) reduction of agricolural practices (that enhanced natural development of herbaceous and shrubby communities, acting as important landscape elements for the emprovment of connectivity in ecological network); 2) natural recovery of shrubby vegetation (that can help the evolution of vegetation towards more evolved successional stages); 3) development of building activities (that may have caused the naturalization of alien species, reducing the floristic quality of the Park).

TI  - Assessing method for regional ecological connectivity and its application based on GIS
PY  - 2014
AB  - Rapid urbanization has caused fragmenting and isolating ecological landscape, which may have led to biodiversity loss and threatened land ecological safety. Therefore, assessing the impact of rapid urbanization on ecological connectivity has become an inevitable choice for biodiversity protection and the maintenance of regional ecological security as well as providing decision support for land planning. Based on the second national land survey data and general land use planning data, a GIS-based iterative topological analysis method was used to identify the ecological functional areas according to the type of the land use in the Caofeidian new district. Eight categories of ecological functional areas with a total area of 142798.30 hm2 were identified, which accounted for about 72.19% of the study area. With the cost distance model, the Barrier Effect Index (BEI) and Ecological Connectivity Index (ECI) were used to assess the impact of landscape ecological connectivity on current land use scenario and land planning scenario in the Caofeidian new district to evaluate the driving mechanism of the deterioration of ecological landscape, to assess the impact on the ecological function relationship of ecological lands, and to provide recommendations. The results show that the area whose Ecological Connectivity Index was above medium level only accounts for 56.45% of the total area of the Caofeidian new district, the regional ecological function area has been distinctly fragmented and isolated, while the non-connectivity area, whose Ecological Connectivity Index equals 1, has showed stronger connectivity of spatial distribution, such regional landscape ecological deterioration was mainly caused by the expansion of construction land and insufficient attention to ecological protection in land use planning. Further analysis of overlaying the ECI index maps of future scenarios based on urban growth and the current situation was conducted. Results of impact on the Ecological Connectivity Index indicated that, of the planning new urban and industrial lands of 7714.71 hm2, 2027.25 hm2 of that has been identified to have a critical impact on ecological connectivity. It indicated that, instead of construction land, such area should be planned for ecological land, and protection measures are necessary to improve the ecological function. However, a number of areas, about 4338.63 hm2 in total, most of which are adjacent to existing urban areas, had minimum impact on the ecological connectivity. Such areas might be considered suitable for construction land, whereas the remaining 1348.83 hm2 with medium impact to ECI could be considered suitable for construction land under the premise of maintaining ecological corridors. Three effective ways were suggested to increase Caofeidian new district's ECI and improve the ecological structure: strengthen the protection of important ecological functional lands having obvious influence on the regional ecological connectivity index during the preparation of general land use plans; reconstruct the ecological landscape using residual ecological resources to improve the ecological connectivity level; and strengthen the green network construction in the build-up area.

TI  - Active citizenship for urban green infrastructure: fostering the diversity and dynamics of citizen contributions through mosaic governance
PY  - 2016
AB  - Active citizens may contribute to the environmental, social, and institutional resilience of cities. This review discusses how citizen initiatives protect biodiversity hotspots, contribute to social cohesion, institutional innovation, and diversity in urban green space management. Challenges related to social inclusiveness, ecological connectivity and continuity suggest government involvement is pertinent, but needs to be refocused. To maximise environmental outcomes of active citizenship, governments may adopt an enabling and stimulating governance style that harnesses the transformative potential of active citizenship. This paper argues for mosaic governance to work with the heterogeneous array of people, institutions, and spatial practices associated with active citizenship. Mosaic governance aims for a context-sensitive way of urban green infrastructure planning, enhancing relationships between the diversity of landscapes and communities across cities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Influence of Urban Landscape on Ants and Spiders Richness and Composition in Forests
PY  - 2021
AB  - As large amounts of natural environments are lost due to urbanization, the role of remnant native vegetation in the preservation of biodiversity has become even more significant. Remnant native forest patches are essential refugia for flora and fauna and are crucial for the maintenance of ecosystem processes in urbanized landscapes. We evaluated the influence of landscape structure on ants and spiders associated with Atlantic Forest remnants in urban landscapes. We sampled 14 forest areas in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador and tested the effect of the landscapes' proportion of forest cover, mean landscape isolation, and mean landscape shape complexity on the taxonomic and functional richness and the community composition of both groups. The species collected were classified into functional groups based on behavioral attributes and environmental preferences. Overall, there were strong adverse effects of forest loss, decreased connectivity, and an increase in edge effects associated with the mean shape complexity of the forest remnants. However, the spiders responded to all three landscape structure characteristics whereas the ants only responded to the landscape mean shape complexity. Our findings indicate that the maintenance of urban forest habitats is essential for the conservation of biodiversity in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador and the preservation of ecological functions performed by species within the forest areas.

TI  - Influence of urban landscapes on population dynamics in a short-distance migrant mosquito: Evidence for the dengue vector Aedes aegypti
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background
Dengue viruses are endemic across most tropical and subtropical regions. Because no proven vaccines are available, dengue prevention is primarily accomplished through controlling the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. While dispersal distance is generally believed to be ∼100 m, patterns of dispersion may vary in urban areas due to landscape features acting as barriers or corridors to dispersal. Anthropogenic features ultimately affect the flow of genes affecting vector competence and insecticide resistance. Therefore, a thorough understanding of what parameters impact dispersal is essential for efficient implementation of any mosquito population suppression program. Population replacement and genetic control strategies currently under consideration are also dependent upon a thorough understanding of mosquito dispersal in urban settings.

TI  - Roadsides provide refuge for orchids: characteristic of the surrounding landscape
PY  - 2020
AB  - Seminatural habitats are declining throughout the world; thus, the role of small anthropogenic habitats in the preservation of plants is becoming increasingly appreciated. Here, we surveyed the orchid flora of roadside verges in five Central European countries (Austria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia) and tested how the surrounding landscape matrix affects the overall number of species and individuals, and also different functional groups of orchids. We found more than 2,000 individuals of 27 orchid species during our surveys. According to our results, the increasing coverage of agricultural and urban areas negatively affects both the number of orchid species and individuals on roadsides. Our study further suggests that differences in the surrounding habitats affect which species are found on roadsides, since the increasing coverage of grasslands or forested areas around orchid occurrences had a significant positive effect on the number of grassland or forest-dwelling species and individuals, respectively. Most variance in orchid numerosity and diversity was explained by the cover of the suitable habitat types of the respective taxa in the surrounding landscape of the sampling points. This highlights the importance of roadsides acting as refugia for numerous species and valuable plant communities as well as in supporting biodiversity in general. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Detecting patterns of vertebrate biodiversity across the multidimensional urban landscape
PY  - 2022
AB  - Explicit characterisation of the complexity of urban landscapes is critical for understanding patterns of biodiversity and for detecting the underlying social and ecological processes that shape them. Urban environments exhibit variable heterogeneity and connectivity, influenced by different historical contingencies, that affect community assembly across scales. The multidimensional nature of urban disturbance and co-occurrence of multiple stressors can cause synergistic effects leading to nonlinear responses in populations and communities. Yet, current research design of urban ecology and evolutionary studies typically relies on simple representation of the parameter space that can be observed. Sampling approaches apply simple urban gradients such as linear transects in space or comparisons of urban sites across the urban mosaic accounting for a few variables. This rarely considers multiple dimensions and scales of biodiversity, and proves to be inadequate to explain observed patterns. We apply a multidimensional approach that integrates distinctive social, ecological and built characteristics of urban landscapes, representing variations along dimensions of heterogeneity, connectivity and historical contingency. Measuring species richness and beta diversity across 100 US metropolitan areas at the city and 1-km scales, we show that distinctive signatures of urban biodiversity can result from interactions between socioecological heterogeneity and connectivity, mediated by historical contingency. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Vertical life: impact of roof height on beetle diversity and abundance on wildflower green roofs
PY  - 2020
AB  - Despite their increasing popularity in an urban setting, we still know relatively little in how well-extensive green roofs support biodiversity in terms of vertical connectivity from terrestrial habitats. Most green roof biodiversity studies have not considered whether the roof height affects community composition and abundance of species present. This study focused on evaluating beetle diversity and abundance in relation to roof height, with emphasis on wildflower roofs. The key results of the study confirm previous studies found that extensive wildflower green roofs are capable of supporting fairly rich beetle communities, including some rare/scarce species. However, an increase of roof height was found to negatively impact both beetle abundance and richness, despite all recorded species being well adapted to active flight and thus dispersal. In addition forb cover decreased with roof height which consequently influenced beetle community structure. These results are therefore indicative that further research is required on species communities found on extensive green roofs that are less adapted to active flight and consequently vertical dispersal. This study further highlights the need for vertical and horizontal connectivity between green roofs and the surrounding natural habitats as a management tool to increase the general ecological value of urban green spaces. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

TI  - ASSESSING THE ROLE OF GRAVEYARDS IN NATIVE TREES CONSERVATION ALONG MODIFIED LANDSCAPES; A CASE STUDY FROM MANSEHRA, PAKISTAN
PY  - 2022
AB  - Remnant habitat patches can provide ideal space for conservation of native flora in agricultural and urban landscapes. Graveyards are ideals for such conservation actions if they are managed scientifically. Present study analyzed current status of the tree diversity and related issues of the graveyards from Tehsil Mansehra for their utilization in native tree conservation. Random sampling was made through 35 vegetation stands covering 35 graveyards occupying 35 Union Councils. Total 56 species including 35 trees and 21 shrubs, belonging to 46 genera and 31 families were documented from study sites including 44 naturally growing and 12 planted species. Total 2645 mature trees and 2532 regenerating trees were counted, and 14 tree species shows high rate of regeneration. Presence of noxious invasive tree Broussonetia papyrifera and Ailanthus altissima however stipulated the active management of such remnant habitats because of severe invasion threats. Involvement of the local communities can effectively result in utilization of the graveyards as steppingstones and functional corridors in rapidly intensifying urban areas and agricultural lands. Such approach can be applied to other areas for identification and utilization of remnant habitats in plant conservation. © 2022 Universitatea \"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\" din Iasi. All rights reserved.

TI  - From land cover to land use: applying random forest classifier to Landsat imagery for urban land-use change mapping
PY  - 2022
AB  - The extensive record of Landsat imagery is commonly used to map urban land-cover and land-use change. Random forest (RF) classification was applied for mapping more detailed urban land-use and change categories than is typically attempted with Landsat data. Two dates of Landsat imagery (1990 and 2015) were utilized with surface reflectance, Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (V-I-S) fractions, grey-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) of V-I-S, and temporal variation of V-I-S inputs. GLCM V-I-S and temporal variation of Vegetation as input features of RF classifiers slightly improved accuracies of land use maps. A change map derived from an overlay analysis between the 2015 map and a Landsat-derived urban expansion map was more accurate than one from post-classification comparison of 1990 and 2015 maps. For the Taiwan study area, Transportation Corridor land use tended to lead conversion to Residential and Employment types in relatively undeveloped districts, and extensive urban land-use change occurred in peri-urban areas. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Identifying sources of stress to native aquatic fauna using a watershed ecological risk assessment framework
PY  - 2001
AB  - The free-flowing Clinch and Powell River Basin, located in southwestern Virginia, United States, historically had one of the richest assemblages of native fish and freshwater mussels in the world. Nearly half of the species once residing here are now extinct, threatened, or endangered. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's framework for conducting an ecological risk assessment was used to structure a watershed-scale analysis of human land use, in-stream habitat quality, and their relationship to native fish and mussel populations in order to develop future management strategies and prioritize areas in need of enhanced protection. Our analyses indicate that agricultural and urban land uses as well as proximity to mining activities and transportation corridors are inversely related to fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) and mussel species diversity. Forward stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that coal mining had the most impact on fish IBI followed by percent cropland and urban a...

TI  - Biological conservation of aquatic inland habitats: These are better days
PY  - 2014
AB  - The biodiversity of aquatic inland habitats currently faces unprecedented threats from human activities. At the same time, although much is known about the functioning of freshwater ecosystems the successful transfer of such knowledge to practical conservation has not been universal. This alarming situation is considered here using a theme of the conservation of freshwater fishes, supported where appropriate with examples drawn from other taxa. Global awareness of aquatic conservation issues is also hampered by conditions under the water surface being largely hidden from the direct experience of most members of society. Connectivity, or lack of it, is another challenge to the conservation of freshwater habitats, while urban areas can play a perhaps unexpectedly important positive role. Freshwater habitats frequently enjoy benefits accruing from a sense of ownership or stewardship by local inhabitants, which has led to the development of conservation movements which commonly started life centred on the habitat itself but of which many have now matured into wider catchment-based conservation programmes. A demonstrable need for evidence-based conservation management in turn requires scientific assessments to be increasingly robust and standardised, while at the same time remaining open to the adoption of technological advances and welcoming the rapidly developing citizen science movement. There is evidence of real progress in this context and conservation scientists are now communicating their findings to environmental managers in a way and on a scale that was rarely seen a couple of decades ago. It is only in this way that scientific knowledge can be efficiently transferred to conservation planning, prioritisation and ultimately management in an increasingly scaled-up, joined-up and resource-limited world. The principle of 'prevention is better than cure' is particularly appropriate to most biological conservation issues in aquatic inland habitats and is inextricably linked to educating and/or nudging appropriate human behaviours. When prevention fails, some form of emergency rescue such as captive breeding or translocations may be justified for particularly important animal or plant populations. However, long-haul missions of habitat rehabilitation or restoration are generally to be preferred even if they may take decades to reach fruition. Conservation researchers, managers and practitioners must be realistic in their objectives and timescales for such programmes and take positive steps to communicate such information to stakeholders. Now more than ever, people are interested in conservation and sustainability. There are substantial challenges ahead, but these are better days for the biological conservation of aquatic inland habitats.

TI  - Assessing relationships between human land uses and the decline of native mussels, fish, and macroinvertebrates in the Clinch and Powell river watershed, USA
PY  - 2002
AB  - The free-flowing Clinch and Powell watershed in Virginia, USA, harbors a high number of endemic mussel and fish species but they are declining or going extinct at an alarming rate. To prioritize resource management strategies with respect to these fauna, a geographical information system was developed and various statistical approaches were used to relate human land uses with available fish, macroinvertebrate, and native mussel assemblage data. Both the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) family-level index, and the fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) were lowest in a subwatershed with the greatest coal mining activity (analysis of variance [ANOVA], p &lt; 0.05). Limited analyses in two other subwatersheds suggested that urban and agricultural land uses within a specified riparian corridor were more related to mussel species richness and fish IBI than land uses in entire catchments. Based on land uses within a riparian corridor of 200 m × 2 km for each biological site in the watershed, fish IBI was inversely related to percent cropland and urban area and positively related to pasture area (stepwise multiple regression, R2 = 0.55, p &lt; 0.05). Sites less than 2 km downstream of urban areas, major highways, or coal mine activities had a significantly lower mean IBI value than those more than 2 km away (ANOVA, p &lt; .05). Land use effects included poorer instream cover and higher substrate embeddedness (t test, p &lt; 0.05). Weaker land use relationships were observed for EPT and mussel species richness. Episodic spills of toxic materials, originating from transportation corridors, mines, and industrial facilities, also have resulted in local extirpations of native species, particularly mussels. The number of co-occurring human activities was directly related to stream elevation in the Clinch River, with more human land uses in headwater areas. Approximately 60% of known U.S. Fish and Wildlife mussel concentration sites in the watershed are located within 2 km of at least two land use sources identified as potentially stressful in our analyses. Our results indicate that a number of land uses and stressors are probably responsible for the decline in native species. However, protection of naturally vegetated riparian corridors may help mitigate some of these effects.

TI  - Mapping the fine-scale spatial pattern of artificial light pollution at night in urban environments from the perspective of bird habitats
PY  - 2020
AB  - The increase in artificial light at night (ALAN) is a global concern, while the pattern of ALAN pollution inside urban areas has not yet been fully explored. To fill this gap, we developed a novel method to map fine-scale ALAN pollution patterns in urban bird habitats using high spatial resolution ALAN satellite data. First, an ALAN pollution map was derived from JL1-3B satellite images. Then, the core habitat nodes (CHNs) representing the main habitats for urban birds to inhabit were identified from the land cover map, which was produced using Gaofen2 (GF2) data, and the high probability corridors (HPCs), indicating high connectivity paths, were derived from Circuitscape software. Finally, the ALAN patterns in the CHNs and HPCs were analysed, and the mismatch index was proposed to evaluate the trade-off between human activity ALAN demands and ALAN supply for the protection of urban birds. The results demonstrated that 115 woodland patches covering 4149.0 ha were selected as CHNs, and most of the CHNs were large urban parks or scenic spots located in the urban fringe. The 2923 modelled HPCs occupying 1179.2 ha were small remaining vegetation patches and vegetated corridors along the major transport arteries. The differences in the ALAN pollution patterns between CHNs and HPCs were mainly determined by the characteristics of the green space patches and the light source types. The polluted regions in the CHNs were clustered in a few regions that suffered from concentrated and intensive ALAN, while most of the CHNs remained unaffected. In contrast, the 727 HPCs were mainly polluted by street lighting was scattered and widely distributed, resulting a more varying influence to birds than that in the CHNs. Relating patterns of the ALAN to bird habitats and connectivity provides meaningful information for comprehensive planning to alleviate the disruptive effects of ALAN pollution. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Are small carnivores urban avoiders or adapters: Can they be used as indicators of well-planned green areas?
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Terrestrial mammalian carnivores are generally sensitive to urbanization. Yet, some mesocarnivores have adapted to the urban and suburban environment. The response of small carnivores to urbanization is poorly studied, partly due to methodological difficulties. We assessed the impact of urbanization on a representative of small carnivores – the least weasel Mustela nivalis. Data from 254 trapping sessions of monitoring small mammals (27 810 trap-days) conducted in different urbanized and non-urbanized habitats (Poland, Central Europe) were used and analysed in a logistic regression model. The probability of occurrence of weasels was tested in relation to the land cover type, abundance of rodents (weasel’s food base), proportion of a built-up area (on the 500 m radius buffer) and trapping effort. The weasel avoided urban areas and if the percentage of a built-up area was higher than 32% the probability of occurrence of the weasel was low (P

TI  - Influences of a Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere (Eastern Hemlock) Riparian Habitat on a Lotic Benthic Community
PY  - 2016
AB  - Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) forests provide unique riparian zones that can influence adjacent streams, but increasing mortality from the invasive Adelges tsugae (Hemlock Woolly Adelgid) is eliminating this distinctive landscape component in some regions. The objective of this study was to determine if a stream section within a hemlock ravine harbored a unique benthic community as compared to other sections of the stream that could be threatened in the event of a Hemlock Woolly Adelgid outbreak. We sampled benthic algae and macroinvertebrates in an unnamed tributary of Sugar Creek within Beach City Wildlife Area, OH, in April and September 2015. The stream flows through 3 riparian habitats: beech-maple upland forest, hemlock ravine, and lowland forest dominated by Acer saccharinum (Silver Maple), A. negundo (Box Elder), and Platanus occidentalis (American Sycamore). Our results show that Chironomidae, Navicula, Caloneis, and Nitzschia were the dominant taxa across all 3 stream sections, but that benthic macroinvertebrate richness and density were significantly lower in the hemlock ravine when compared to the lowland habitat. Periphyton community metrics were not significantly affected by riparian habitat. Overall, seasonality was more influential than riparian habitat on benthic community composition; specific taxa were indicative of either the spring or summer season. Connectivity between stream sites and/or the abundance of sandstone bedrock substrate at many sample locations might account for the similarity in benthic communities across these 3 habitats. © The Author(s) 2016.

TI  - What evidence exists on the possible effects of urban forms on terrestrial biodiversity in western cities? A systematic map protocol
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background: As urban areas expand, scientists now agree that the city is an important space for biodiversity conservation. Yet, still relatively little is known about how urban forms could have a differential impact on terrestrial species and ecosystems. If some reviews have been conducted to examine the link between biodiversity and urban characteristics at an infra-city scale, none have explored the relationship between urban organization and biodiversity and tried to assess the capacity of various urban forms to maintain and possibly favour flora and fauna in the city. The resulting map will present the state of knowledge regarding possible relationships between urban forms and its features on the establishment and settlement of terrestrial and temperate biodiversity at infra-city scale in western cities. Methods: The systematic map will follow the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) Guidelines. We will collect the relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature in French and English language. The scientific literature will be retrieved with the use of a search string in two publication databases, one environmental and one social science database (Web Of Science Core Collection, and Cairn.info). We will also perform supplementary searches (search engines, call for literature, search for relevant reviews). All references will be screened for relevance using a three-stage process, according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria. Our study will concentrate on urban areas at the infra-city scale in cities of the temperate biogeographical zone. The subject population will include terrestrial species and ecosystems, except for archaea and bacteria. The exposure will consider all types of urban forms described by any urban descriptors or measures including heterogeneity, fragmentation, housing density, organisation of urban matrix, urban fabric) and all types of urban features (e.g. size, age of the buildings, materials, urban artefacts). All relevant outcomes will be considered (e.g. species richness, abundance, behaviour). We will provide an open-access database of the studies included in the map. Our results will also be presented narratively, together with tables and graphs summarising the key information coded from the retained articles (e.g. study characteristics, types and areas of research that has been undertaken, types of exposure, population concerned, etc.). © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Dispersal traits determine plant response to habitat connectivity in an urban landscape
PY  - 2011
AB  - Identification of trait syndromes that make species vulnerable to habitat fragmentation is essential in predicting biodiversity change. Plants are considered particularly vulnerable if their capacities for persistence in and for dispersal among local habitats are low. Here we investigated the influence of easily measured functional traits on the presence of 45 plant species in an urban landscape in north-west Germany where patches were separated by distances consistent with regular plant dispersal range. To describe the spatial configuration of patches we calculated species-specific patch connectivities. Then we assessed plant connectivity responses in distribution models calculated from connectivities and environmental predictors. Twenty (45%) of the analysed species showed a positive connectivity response after accounting for species-specific habitat requirements. These species differed from non-responsive species by functional traits associated with dispersal, including reduced seed numbers and higher terminal velocities relative to non-responsive species. Persistence traits played however no role which we attribute to the environmental conditions of urban habitats and their spatiotemporal characteristics. Our study underlines that even ruderal plants experience dispersal limitation and demonstrates that easily measured functional traits may be used as indicators of fragmentation vulnerability in urban systems allowing generalizations to larger species sets. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Wide-area mapping of invasive species propagation and containment zones in somaliland using phenometric trends and generalized linear modelling
PY  - 2017
AB  - Spatial information on the occurrence and propagation of invasive species is imperative in order to manage their risk and spread. In this contribution we used phenology and vegetation productivity trends (2001 to 2014) from 250-meter MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time-series data to map propagation and possible containment areas for Prosopis juliflora and Parthenium hysterophorus in western Somaliland (eastern Africa). Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM) with a binomial logistics function was used to link available reference data (Landsat-based) on both invasive species to the MODIS-based vegetation trends. Spread corridors and containment zones were, furthermore, identified for both species. Variable relevance in GLM showed that the variables 'EVI trend' and 'peak value' were highly relevant for P juliflora (log odds ratio >200, p<0.001 and regression estimate >|5|). Riverside and peri-urban areas were identified as important propagation and risk zones. © 2017 IEEE.

TI  - The contribution of the bark of isolated trees as habitat for ants in an urban landscape
PY  - 2009
AB  - Since urbanisation and fragmentation result in a decrease in larger forests, the importance of isolated trees as habitat in urban landscapes is increasing. This study investigated the contribution of trees in urban landscapes to the abundance and variety of arthropod taxa. Ants and other arthropods were surveyed on the bark of 341 trees in three types of arrangement: isolated trees, trees in linear corridors and trees in patches. Ant species and other arthropods were identified and the numbers on each tree were counted. In order to determine the effects of host tree properties (size and plant species) and the surrounding environment (arrangement of trees, surrounding land cover), an analysis of covariance was conducted. Tree species was the most important influence, followed by tree size, on ants and other arthropods in the urban landscape, with little effect from the arrangement of trees. Thus, in order to increase arthropod diversity in urban landscapes, it is important to select tree species that attract a large number of arthropod taxa. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of urbanization on carabid beetles in an urban riparian area
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban rivers and riparian areas serve as corridors that move matter, organisms, and energy to urban areas from adjacent landscapes. However, anthropogenic disturbances and obstructions in river basins have severely impeded the function of many urban rivers as ecological corridors. Here, we used carabid beetles to assess the impact of urbanization on a river and its riparian areas. We identified carabid diversity and composition along an urbanization gradient. We classified 1,855 individuals in 17 species along a river. The carabid communities in riparian areas reflected critically disturbed habitats, and their composition markedly differed between the riparian areas and their adjacent habitats. Carabid beetle diversity sharply decreased with increasing urbanization. Flight capacity and feeding type varied along the urbanization gradient. Environmental variables associated with urbanization such as riparian quality and disturbance level significantly influenced carabid diversity. Land use type in increasingly urbanized areas was correlated with decreased carabid diversity and increased carabid dominance. Patch density, patch size, and interspersion metrics revealed that fragmentation and isolation influenced carabid diversity. Mitigation of disturbances and conservation of riparian microhabitats are required to improve biodiversity in riparian areas. © 2022 Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

TI  - Conservation benefits of riparian buffers in urban areas: The case of the rio corgo (North Portugal)
PY  - 2014
AB  - The widespread urbanization of river catchments has resulted in the degradation of many fluvial ecosystems. We examined the hypothesis that riparian vegetation corridors form effective buffers, mitigating the effects of anthropogenic disturbances in urban river systems. We aimed to identify the principal factors affecting ecological status and biological diversity in the River Corgo (northern Portugal) in order to develop a programme of rehabilitation measures. Data were collected from urban reaches and downstream rural reaches of the River Corgo. We assessed the habitat preferences of two native cyprinid fish species Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Luciobarbus bocagei and also sampled the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna, physicochemical characteristics and hydromorphological support elements following Water Framework Directive compliant protocols. Fish habitat preference curves indicated that the specific habitat preferences of the target native cyprinid fish species were influenced by riparian zone vegetation quality, in addition to micro-habitat characteristics (substrate, current velocity and shelter). Sampling sites located in the urban centre were found to have higher ecological status than sites located in downstream rural and agricultural areas. This may reflect the increased habitat quality and buffering capacity of riparian vegetation, which was better preserved at urban sites. Despite this, non-native fish species were more abundant within urban sites compared to downstream rural sites. The results indicate the significant cumulative effect of anthropogenic influences on downstream sites, such as diffuse pollution from agriculture and loss of riparian cover. Based on the results of this study we recommend that rehabilitation measures should be directed to: A) improve the connectivity of the flowing channel in urban reaches; and b) restore the riparian corridor in the other reaches affected by nutrient input and the spread of invasive fish species.

TI  - Local habitat characteristics have a stronger effect than the surrounding urban landscape on beetle communities on green roofs
PY  - 2018
AB  - Green roofs are a promising tool to return nature to cities and mitigate biodiversity loss brought about by urbanization. Yet, we lack basic information on how green roofs contribute to biodiversity and how their placement in the urban landscape affects different taxa and community composition. We studied the effects of local and landscape variables on beetle communities on green roofs. We expected that both local roof characteristics and urban landscape composition shape communities, but that their relative importance depends on species characteristics. Using pitfall traps, we collected beetles during two consecutive years from 17 green roofs in Basel, Switzerland. We evaluated the contribution of six local and six landscape variables to beetle community structure and to the responses of individual species. Communities on the roofs consisted of mobile and open dry-habitat species, with both local and landscape variables playing a role in structuring these communities. At the individual species level, local roof variables were more important than characteristics of the surrounding urban landscape. The most influential factors affecting the abundances of beetle species were vegetation, described as forb and grass cover (mainly positive), and roof age (mainly negative). Therefore, we suggest that the careful planning of green roofs with diverse vegetation is essential to increase their value as habitat for beetles. In addition, while beetle communities on green roofs can be diverse regardless of their placement in the urban landscape, the lack of wingless species indicates the need to increase the connectivity of green roofs to ground level habitats. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Research on Multi-Scale Ecological Network Connectivity-Taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as a Case Study.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area urban agglomeration is an urban agglomeration with some of the most intensive urbanization since 1980s. A large amount of cultivated land, forest land, water bodies and other land types in the region has been occupied by construction land, resulting in fragmented ecological landscapes and biodiversity in the region and causing many other ecological problems. Based on this, this paper takes the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as a case study, constructs an ecological network of the dispersion scale of five species from 1990 to 2020 based on a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method, identifies the ecological groups in the network and uses the core node-based community evolution path tracking algorithm to analyze the ecological groups in order to explore the changes of ecological network connectivity at different scales in the region and to reveal the overall and local characteristics and changes of the migratory space of terrestrial mammals with different dispersion capabilities. The research results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the area of construction land in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area increased sharply, with good connectivity in the northwest, southwest and eastern regions and poor connectivity in the central region. (2) There are obvious differences between the overall and local changes in the connectivity trends of multi-scale regional ecological networks. On the whole, the overall ecological connectivity of the ecological network at each scale showed a gradual upward trend, and the overall connectivity index IIC and the possible connectivity index <i>PC</i> gradually increased with the increase of the maximum dispersal distance of species. From the perspective of local patches, the larger the species dispersion scale, the larger the value of the revised betweenness centrality index and the patch possible connectivity index. (3) The distribution of ecological groups at different species dispersion scales is different, and the smaller the dispersal scale of the species, the greater the distribution of ecological groups. Small-scale species are limited by the maximum dispersal distance, and the range of their ecological groups is generally small. Small-scale (3 km), mesoscale (10 km) and large-scale (30 km) core nodes of ecological groups show a gradual increase trend, and the overall connectivity of ecological groups has improved. However, the core nodes of the extra-large-scale (60 km) and ultra-large-scale (100 km) ecological groups show a trend of decreasing fluctuations, and the overall connectivity within the ecological group has declined. This study is helpful to clarify the structural characteristics of regional ecological space and provide a theoretical basis for regional ecological planning.

TI  - Effects of urban infrastructure on aquatic invertebrate diversity
PY  - 2020
AB  - Wetlands are one of the world’s most important, economically valuable, and diverse ecosystems. A major proportion of wetland biodiversity is composed of aquatic invertebrates, which are essential for secondary production in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Urban areas have intensified the challenges wetlands encounter by increasing the area of impermeable surfaces and the levels of nutrient and pollutant overflows. We investigated how urban infrastructure affects the aquatic invertebrate fauna of urban wetlands in metropolitan Helsinki, southern Finland. We measured riparian canopy cover, emergent vegetation coverage, and various land cover and road variables. Recreation area, forests, and open natural areas were the most important landscape features positively influencing aquatic invertebrate family richness, whereas buildings and roads had a negative effect on family richness and abundances of many taxa. Recreation area and the various forest types also positively affected the α-diversity indices of wetlands. On the other hand, fish assemblage did not affect either family richness or abundances of the studied taxa. Furthermore, trees growing on the shoreline negatively affected the diversity of aquatic invertebrate families. Invertebrate family diversity was greatest at well-connected wetlands, as these areas added to the regional species pool by over 33%. Our results show that connectivity and green areas near wetlands increase aquatic invertebrate family diversity, and our results could be utilized in urban planning.

TI  - Trees of alignment, a contribution to landscape and urban biodiversity, case of the city of Rabat
PY  - 2019
AB  - The tree plays an essential ecological, aesthetic and social role in urban areas. Out of ignorance, he was the first victim of urban development. The condition of the trees in our cities is becoming worrying, because of the multiple aggressions and alterations of their location, they are injured, degraded, weakened and unsightly. A study of the environmental problems of the alignments and the choice of species used in this artificial environment and their mode of management is important for the preservation of this heritage and man's connection to nature. This work is intended as a landscape approach to the alignments of the city of Rabat to assess their botanical diversity and to highlight the species that make up the urban landscape and that best adapt to the environment and the city's specific climatic conditions. An inventory of this tree heritage was carried out at the beginning of 2019; it allowed to identify more than 40 species belonging to 22 families and to detect inequalities and disparities of alignments in the green corridor in the districts of the city of Rabat. © 2019 Techniques - Sciences - Methodes.

For conservation actions to be effective there must be an understanding of how landscape structure and biological traits shape dispersal. We assessed the effects of landscape, sex and population management (reintroductions and translocations) on gene flow of Leontopithecus rosalia, an endangered arboreal primate living in highly fragmented forests of Brazil. We genotyped 201 individuals using 14 microsatellite loci to answer three questions: (1) How far does L. rosalia disperse? (2) Is dispersal sex-biased? (3) What are the relative contributions of population management, distance, roads and landscape resistance to genetic kinship? We hypothesized that (1) gene flow decrease between more distant sites; (2) males disperse more than females; and (3) management and land-cover resistance (i.e. landscape resistance) are the variables that most influence genetic kinship. We found positive spatial population-structure up to 8 km. The spatial structure was similar between females and males suggesting that they equally contribute to gene flow. Management and landscape resistance best explained genetic kinship, showing that different land-cover types affect the dispersal at different degrees of landscape permeability. We advocate that maintaining more permeable landscapes is essential to ensure dispersal and gene flow of arboreal mammals. Conservation measures in tropical rainforests must take into account not only the habitat amount, but also the degree at which each land use – roads, urban areas, agriculture, pasture, isolated trees, and stepping stones – facilitates or impedes the species dispersal.

TI  - Zoning for regulating of construction land based on landscape security pattern
PY  - 2013
AB  - In recent years, although rapid development of industrialization and urbanization stimulated China's economic growth, uncontrolled urban expansion occupied a large number of ecological land and caused a series problems on urban ecological systems. Due to those problems are constraining China's sustainable urban system development, safeguarding the fragile urban ecological environments is becoming a central issue. Ecological security pattern can support the healthy development of natural ecosystems in a region. How to develop ecological security pattern in urban areas is increasingly important. Landscape security pattern which take interaction between landscape process and pattern as the core, can be used to build ecological security pattern for urban areas. The research area of this paper is Yangzhou that located in the middle of Jiangsu Province. After a decade of rapid urbanization process, ecological land and construction land remain contradictory in research region. Resources and environmental problems caused by unscientific planning are becoming a bottleneck which restricting the regional economy. Using Yangzhou as a case study, this paper explores how to create a practical zoning system for regulating construction land that balances ecological and economic development. The study design uses a framework of landscape security pattern theory and cellular automata theory. First, five landscape security patterns are built, for flood management, oil and water conservation, biodiversity conservation, cultural heritage protection and safeguarding recreation areas. Second, the regional urban construction land expansion pattern in the target year is simulated without ecological constraints with the aid of the neural network cellular automata model. Finally, according to the ecological protection and socio-economic development demands of the study area, regional landscape security pattern and urban construction land expansion pattern are combined to identify priority construction zones, flexible construction zones, conditional construction zones, restricted construction zones and forbidden construction zones. In the study area, the five construction zones occupied 2. 88%, 4. 81%, 1. 05%, 90. 07%, 1. 19% of the total land. Control rules are established for each type of control zone based on its nature and landscape components. In priority construction zones, land development for urban construction is the priority use. In flexible construction zones, adjustment of new construction land is the priority use. In conditional construction zones, protection of farmland and establishment of green activities and local cultural experience corridors are prioritized. In restricted construction zones, the use of land for urban construction is carefully restricted, while the construction of infrastructure capable of protecting the natural and cultural landscape is encouraged. In forbidden construction zones, the focus is on protecting biological habitats and local culture, the development of construction is prohibited in principle. The results show that this practical zoning system, which values construction land over ecological land, can significantly reduce ecological pressure caused by construction and maintain the stability of urban ecological systems. Using regional landscape security patterns and urban construction land expansion patterns to divide construction land into control zones integrates ecological priorities into zoning and achieves an ecological and economic win-win. The system not only caters to present economic needs, but also supports sustainable economic development. Furthermore, flexible construction zones also give local government space to adjust new construction land. In the planning period, flexible new construction land accounted for 43. 76% of all land allocated for construction. Government can freely provide new construction land in these zones according to demands. This practical system provides full autonomy to local government in construction matters and effectively combines control and self-management.

TI  - Multi-scale effects of urban landscape pattern on plant diversity in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China
PY  - 2018
AB  - The changes of urban surface landscape will lead to damage, fragmentation, and losses of biodiversity, resulting in urban biodiversity decline. In order to explore the responses of urban plant diversity to the changes of landscape pattern, we chose the urban area surrounded by round-city highway as research object, set 36 plots in different directions with the Gupeng Square as the center, investigated the plant group in each of the plots through coverage rank method of Braun-Blanquet, and examined the features of plant species diversity in Xuzhou's greenlands. Meanwhile, we divided the landscape of the research area into seven categories: buildings, grasslands, forest lands, waste lands, water areas, roads and farmlands with the help of Erdas, GIS software and Landsat TM remote sensing images from 2005 to 2015 as basic data source. The features of landscape pattern in the research area were analyzed by Fragstats software. We set nine different buffer districts within each of the sample plot by applying the space analyzing function of GIS, calculated 39 landscape pattern metrics using Fragstats, and explored the features of how plant diversity responsed to landscape pattern. After that, the landscape pattern metrics with significant influence on the plant diversity of urban greenlands under different extents were selected by redundant analysis (RDA). The results showed that the plant diversity had obvious temporal and spatial scale effects in responses to landscape pattern and landscape elements. In 2005, the patch area and shape metrics of unused land and farmland could better explain plant diversity in 800 m buffer zone. The patch fragmentation and connectivity metrics of construction land had significant impacts on plant diversity within the extent of 800-2000 m. In 2015, grassland and forest landscapes better explained plant diversity in the 800 m buffer zone while construction sites and unused land had a remarkable impact on plant diversity in the extent of 1000-2000 m. The current plant diversity was more strongly influenced by the 2005 landscape type metrics, indicating that the plant diversity lagged in its response to the changes of landscape pattern. The pattern metrics of landscape level were more consistent with the landscape-class level metrics, indicating that the interaction between species and spatial scale was more dependent on the landscape type. This study would provide effective decision-making information for Xuzhou City planning and construction as well as effective protection of urban green space biodiversity. © 2018, Science Press.

TI  - Assessment of the monitoring of ground-dwelling mammals in northern western Port, Victoria
PY  - 2018
AB  - Melbourne is located in a region of relatively high biodiversity and the region continues to play an important role in the conservation of local, state and national biodiversity. This study represents the first systematic, broad-scale survey of mammals over an area of 795 km2 between Frankston and Bayles, including the rapidly urbanising south-east growth corridor, adjacent agricultural area, and nature conservation reserves around Western Port, including Bass Coast. Covert camera trapping was used continuously for up to 2010 days or over a period of 20-100 days. Nineteen species of mammal were recorded from 404 survey sites. These species comprised 11 native and 8 introduced taxa. At least one mammal taxon was detected at 322 (79%) of the survey sites. At any site, the largest number of species recorded was 12 and the maximum number of native species was 8. Our survey confirms that the region continues to support a rich mammal fauna, including iconic Australian native taxa. The new records refine distribution patterns and emphasise that the complex rural and peri-urban nature of this study area is particularly challenging for mammalian conservation. © 2018, Field Naturalists Club of Victoria.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations in grassland production from 2006 to 2015 in Mongolia along the China-Mongolia Railway
PY  - 2019
AB  - Grassland biomass is the embodiment of grassland productivity, and the material basis for the maintenance of the grassland ecosystem. Grassland is the main vegetation type in the Mongolian Plateau. Grassland changes in the core region of the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor of the Belt and Road Initiative have an important impact on regional ecology, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. This study established three types of models for estimating grassland production through statistical analysis methods using NDVI, EVI, MSAVI, and PsnNet remote sensing indices retrieved from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset. This was combined with ground-measured grassland data and meteorological data. Based on model evaluation, the spatial and temporal distribution and variation characteristics of grassland along the Mongolia part of the China-Mongolia Railway were obtained through inversion for the period from 2006 to 2015. The results showed that all the models had good simulation effects. The optimal model was an exponential model based on MSAVI-with its simulation accuracy reaching 78%. Grassland production in the study area has increased slightly in the past ten years, with little change in the first five years and a fluctuating increase in the next five years. The average grassland production (per unit production) in the past ten years was 3400.39 kg/ha and the average total production was 9707.88 × 104 t. Grassland production increased slightly in most areas along the railway, and in some areas it continued to decline. The regional spatial distribution of increased and decreased grassland production was significantly different. With better grassland resources in the northeastern part of the study area-the area around Chinggis City and the capital of Hentiy Province-had the most significant growth. However, the southern Gobi area-with its trend towards land degradation in the area where the southern Gobi and desert steppe transitions to steppe and dry steppe-had a significant decrease. This meant that the risk of grassland degradation still existed. There were also quantitative and spatial differences in the areas where grassland production decreased on both sides of the railway. The decrease in grassland production on the western side of the railway was more obvious than on the eastern side, and the reduction area was dispersed on the western side and relatively concentrated on the eastern side. In future research, the identification of key areas of grassland degradation along the China-Mongolia Railway as well as its driving forces should be investigated further. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - The effects of water chemistry and lock-mediated connectivity on macroinvertebrate diversity and community structure in a canal in northern England
PY  - 2021
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are under threat from habitat loss, partly due to urban expansion. However, some elements of urban freshwaters are already integral parts of the urban landscape and so are more resilient to loss, representing opportunities for the enhancement of freshwater resources within cities. This study investigated the biodiversity value of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal in Leeds, UK, in relation to its landscape context. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (i) biodiversity value is lowest nearest to the urban core, and (ii) the pattern of canal locks structured ecological communities. Nutrients, metals and dissolved carbon all existed at relatively low concentrations, contrary to what is often seen in urban water bodies, although concentrations were higher in the urban core. This gradient of chemical stress was associated with a decline in macroinvertebrate diversity towards the city centre, which manifested as pollution-sensitive taxa being excluded from this area. Community structures were found to vary between groups of sampling sites separated by locks, suggesting that locks may act as barriers for aquatic invertebrates by restricting dispersal. The results in this study indicate that canals in urban areas can be high-quality habitats, despite the associated anthropogenic stressors, and locks may represent a unique model for researching relationships between connectivity and community structure. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Influence of urbanization on riparian forest diversity and structure in the Georgia Piedmont, US
PY  - 2008
AB  - Riparian forests are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. This study examined the relationships between landscape characteristics and woody plant diversity, structure, and composition of small order riparian corridors along an urban-rural land use gradient in the Georgia Piedmont, US. Riparian plant diversity, structure, and composition were related to landscape metrics and land use. Species richness was negatively associated with impervious surfaces and landscape diversity, and positively associated with forest cover and largest forest patch index. Shannon species diversity was strongly related to the biomass of non-native species, especially for the regeneration layer. Urban sites were characterized by high richness of non-native and pioneer species. Developing sites were dominated by the non-native shrub, Ligustrum sinense Lour., and several native overstory trees, mainly Acer negundo L. While agricultural and managed forest sites were composed of ubiquitous species, unmanaged forest sites had a structurally distinct midstory indicative of reduced disturbance. Urban and agricultural land uses showed decreased native stem densities and signs of overstory tree regeneration failure. Results from this study highlight the impact of the surrounding landscape matrix upon riparian forest plant diversity and structure. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Comparative population genetic structure of the endangered southern brown bandicoot, Isoodon obesulus, in fragmented landscapes of Southern Australia
PY  - 2016
AB  - Genetic connectivity is a key factor for maintaining the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes. In highly modified landscapes such us peri-urban areas, organisms' dispersal among fragmented habitat patches can be reduced due to the surrounding matrix, leading to subsequent decreased gene flow and increased potential extinction risk in isolated sub-populations. However, few studies have compared within species how dispersal/ gene flow varies between regions and among different forms of matrix that might be encountered. In the current study, we investigated gene flow and dispersal in an endangered marsupial, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) in a heavily modified peri-urban landscape in South Australia, Australia.We used 14 microsatellite markers to genotype 254 individuals which were sampled from 15 sites. Analyses revealed significant genetic structure. Our analyses also indicated that dispersal was mostly limited to neighbouring sites. Comparisons of these results with analyses of a different population of the same species revealed that gene flow/dispersal was more limited in this peri-urban landscape than in a pine plantation landscape approximately 400 km to the south-east. These findings increase our understanding of how the nature of fragmentation can lead to profound differences in levels of genetic connectivity among populations of the same species.

TI  - Chicago wilderness: A new force in urban conservation
PY  - 2004
AB  - In 1996, a coalition of diverse and determined organizations launched a new initiative in the Chicago region. Our vision? Chicago Wilderness: a thriving mosaic of natural areas, connected by greenways and wildlife corridors, embedded in the nation's third largest metropolis. In this vision, the region's human communities reclaim a cultural tradition of protecting and restoring the globally outstanding natural communities that enrich our lives. Today, more than 170 organizations join forces to transform this vision into reality. A regional biodiversity recovery plan, the result of 3 years of assessment and planning by scientists, land managers, educators, and policy strategists, sets priorities and determines the lines of action for the coalition. This regional agenda stems from our vision and recovery goals for each ecological community; it encourages targeted research initiatives that focus on characterizing our native biological diversity and on analyzing elements critical to its recovery. Ultimately, though, the long-term survival of our natural wealth rests on the support from the public. Although the challenges to conservation educators and communicators are many, Chicago Wilderness allows us to work together in understanding our audiences, channeling our resources, and creating novel approaches to engage the widest public in our conservation efforts.

PY  - 2020
AB  - The accelerated urban process over the years within the city of Manaus-AM eventually led to partial replacement of vegetation cover by irregular occupations. Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze the type of vegetation cover present in the upper reaches of the Mindu stream, located between the north and east of the urban area of Manaus-Amazonas. The methodology of the work was based on three steps: pre-field carried out by geoprocessing techniques to identify the study area via Qgis, fieldwork monitoring recorded by photographs with the aid of GPS (Global Position System), use of UAV for acquire high spatial resolution aerial images, and the postfield resulting in image processing and data analysis. The results show a concentration of species concentrated to the north of the basin, seeking to identify the distribution and characterization of plant species such as: Conservation Unit, Green Areas, Forest Fragment, Permanent Protection Area (APP), Environmental Protection Area (APA) and Ecological corridor. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

TI  - Recycling of construction debris as aggregate in the Mid-Atlantic Region, USA
PY  - 2004
AB  - Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and portland cement concrete (RPCC) are abundant and available substitutes for natural aggregate in many areas. This paper presents an overview of factors that affect recycled aggregate cost, availability, and engineering performance, and the results of a survey of business practices in the Mid-Atlantic region. For RAP, processing costs are less than those for virgin natural aggregate. Use of efficient asphalt pavement stripping technology, on-site reclamation, and linked two-way transport of asphalt debris and processed asphalt paving mix between asphalt mix plants and paving sites has led to extensive recycling of asphalt pavement in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US. Most of the sites that recycle asphalt pavement (RAP) are located in or near urban areas close to important transportation corridors. RPCC is a viable aggregate source in urban settings where unit costs for processed aggregate from RPCC and natural aggregate are comparable. Disposal fees charged at RPCC recycling sites help defray processing costs and the significantly lower tipping fees at recycling sites versus landfill disposal sites encourage recycling of construction debris as aggregate. Construction contractors and construction debris recycling centers, many of which have the ability to crush and process concrete debris at the job site, produce most RPCC. Production of RPCC aggregate from construction debris that is processed on site using portable equipment moved to the construction site eliminates transportation costs for aggregate and provides an economic incentive for RPCC use. Processing costs, quality and performance issues, and lack of large quantities where needed limit RPCC use. Most RPCC suppliers in the Mid-Atlantic area are located in counties with population densities greater than 400 people/km2 (1036 people/mile2) and that have high unit-value costs and limited local availability of natural aggregate. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Verification of the analysis method for extracting the spatial continuity of the vegetation distribution on a regional scale
PY  - 2011
AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in not only improving urban environments, but also conserving ecosystems. The spatial continuity of vegetation distributions can be expected to make green corridors for landscape management, wind paths against heat island phenomena. In this paper, we develop a spatial analysis method of vegetation distributions using remotely sensed data on a regional scale. The method consists of a spatial autocorrelation analysis, an overlay analysis, and a hydrological analysis with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) adopted as the proxy of vegetation abundance. Application of the method leads to the extraction of the lines between the core areas and sparse areas of vegetation. The purpose of this study is to verify our method through applying a vegetation map digitized from aerial photographs. The map contained three vegetation types of land cover: grasslands, agricultural fields, and tree-covered areas. We use remotely sensed data collected at four different time periods at the regional scale, along with information on the seasonal fluctuations of the vegetation. As a result, the exclusion of seasonal land-cover changes, as in the reaping of agricultural fields, in the process of applying the proposed method produces an effect. The analysis reveals steady areas unaffected by the seasonal fluctuation of vegetation along the lines extracted by applying the proposed method. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Assemblage of medium and large size mammals in an urban semideciduous seasonal forest fragment in Cerrado biome
PY  - 2013
AB  - Nowadays, the processes of deforestation and loss of habitats represent a major threat to many species of mammals. These processes cause changes in natural landscapes by decreasing area, connectivity, and fragment size, and increasing edge effects and number of fragments. Understanding which and how many species persist in disturbed fragments may indicate the species' minimum requirements and might contribute to their conservation. Here we show how the mammalian fauna of medium and large size (higher than 1 kg) are structured in a semideciduous seasonal forest fragment of 36.5 ha in the urban area of Jataí, Goiás. We performed the sampling with 30 sand track plots (1 × 1 m). We analyzed the relative record frequency and built a collector's curve to demonstrate the sampling effort. With a total effort of 600 track plots × days, we recorded twelve species of mammals with our tracks sampling method, from which only the wild mammals were included in the analyzes (11 species). The estimated species richness reached 13 species (SD (Standard Deviation) = ±1, CI (Confidence Interval) = ±2 (11-15 species). The species with the highest relative record frequency was Didelphis albiventris and the species with the lowest was Tamandua tetradactyla. The fragment size must be a limiting factor to the richness and to the occurrence of species, as it may not be sufficient to allow the persistence of a population or an individual. Disturbances that originated from houses, like domestic animals and movement of people, also contributed to the removal and extinction of species. To conserve the species in the fragment, we suggest the prevention of entrance of people and of domestic animals. We also recommend increased connectivity of the fragment with the landscape external to the urban area in order to allow the movement of the currently present species.

TI  - Commuter lines to cut urban sprawl
PY  - 1990
AB  - Over the past decade, massive unrestrained urban growth has seen the population of Mexico City leap to over 20 million, and present estimates envisage another 14 million inhabitants swelling the city by the early years of the next century. Together with the three state administrations adjoining Mexico City, the Ministry of Transport has launched a strategy to relieve the pressure on the central area. Some eight million inhabitants will be dispersed to satellite towns linked to the urban area by high-quality high-capacity transport corridors. Mexico City is ringed to the south and west by steep mountain ranges, so the new development areas are sited in a belt between 70 and 100 km from the city centre. The target of a 45 min journey time effectively precludes road transport. Therefore the whole scheme hinges around good rail links. The six new radial routes will start at the edge of Mexico City's built-up areas at interchanges with the urban metro network. Largely following existing NdeM corridors, the new lines will be double-track throughout and laid out for 140 km/h operation.

TI  - Urban riparian systems function as corridors for both native and invasive plant species
PY  - 2017
AB  - Riparian areas are often the only green areas left in urban and suburban landscapes, providing opportunities for conservation and connectivity of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. While city planners and land managers often tout the importance of riparian networks for these uses, it is not well established if urban riparian plant communities are actually functioning as connected assemblages. Furthermore, urban riparian zones are well known to be highly invaded by non-native plant species and may be functioning to increase the spread of non-native species across the landscape. Here we examine connectivity of plant assemblages in riparian networks within an extensively urbanized landscape. We sampled riparian plant communities at 13 sites along three second-order streams of the Rahway River watershed, New Jersey. We also characterized propagule dispersal at each site by sampling litter packs on the river banks five times between March–October 2011 and identifying germinants from litter packs after cold stratification. Species turnover of both riparian and litter vegetation was more strongly associated with flow distance, particularly for native species, indicating that riverine systems are important for promoting connectivity of native plant assemblages in urban landscapes. However, non-native germinants significantly dominated propagule dispersal along the stream reaches, particularly early in the growing season, suggesting spread utilizing the river system and preemption may be an important mechanism for invasion success in this system. Our data show that management of invasive species should be planned and implemented at the watershed scale to reduce spread via the river system.

TI  - Population structure of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) in a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2009
AB  - Understanding the impacts of landscape-level processes on the population biology of amphibians is critical, especially for species inhabiting anthropogenically modified landscapes. Many pond-breeding amphibians are presumed to exist as metapopulations, but few studies demonstrate the extent and consequences of this metapopulation structure. Gene flow measures may facilitate the construction of more realistic models of population structure than direct measures of migration. This is especially true for species that are cryptic, such as many amphibians. We used eight polymorphic microsatellite loci to determine the genetic population structure of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) breeding at 17 ponds in northeastern Ohio, a landscape fragmented by roads, agriculture, urban areas and the Cuyahoga River. Using a variety of analyses (Bayesian clustering, F-statistics, AMOVA) we generated a model of salamander population genetic structure. Our data revealed patterns of genetic connectivity that were not predicted by geographical distances between ponds (no isolation by distance). We also tested for a relationship between population structure and several indices of landscape resistance, but found no effect of potential barriers to dispersal on genetic connectivity. Strong overall connectivity among ponds, despite the hostile habitat matrix, may be facilitated by a network of riparian corridors associated with the Cuyahoga River; however, high gene flow in this system may indicate a general ability to disperse and colonize beyond particular corridors. © 2009 The Authors.

TI  - Biophysical metrics for detecting more sustainable urban forms at the global scale
PY  - 2017
AB  - To test metrics for rapid identification and global evaluation of more sustainable urban forms, we examine the configuration of the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) in Brazil using satellite remote sensing data and landscape metrics. We adopt principles from landscape ecology and urban planning to evaluate urban heterogeneity and morphology that may constitute more sustainable urban forms, including connectivity, density, geometric complexity (mixed land use), diversity, and greening. Using 2-D wavelet multiresolution analysis and satellite-derived fractional vegetation cover (Fr), the variability of landscape metrics from Landsat (30 m) to MODIS (1 km) scales are investigated. According to our findings, metrics of Patch Density and Landscape Shape Index can be used at the 1-km scale to asses density and geometric complexity of urban form. With the addition of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data, available at high temporal resolution, a move away from or toward more sustainable urban forms is defined in relation to mitigation of the urban heat island. As the geometric complexity and density of finer-scale urban characteristics are related to climatic impacts at the neighborhood scale, sustainability assessments may be more attainable across urban areas. © 2017

TI  - Green corridors in urban landscapes affect the arthropod communities of domestic gardens
PY  - 2012
AB  - Ecological corridors are landscape elements that prevent the negative effects of fragmentation. However, their effectiveness has never been clearly validated in urban landscapes. We analysed the role of green corridors in an urban context by comparing metacommunities of arthropods in (i) woodlots considered as sources of species, (ii) woody corridors and domestic gardens that are (iii) connected (CG) or (iv) disconnected to corridors (DG) and taking into account the connectivity of the matrix. We trapped 3 taxa of arthropods - spiders, carabids and staphylinids - because they are sensitive to fragmentation but with different dispersal capabilities. We analysed their species richness, abundance and taxonomic and functional composition. For the 3 taxa, the taxonomic and functional compositions of communities in CG were closer to those of the corridor and the source than those of DG. Woodland species were associated with source, corridor and CG. A lower abundance in DG was revealed for staphylinids and spiders. Lower species richness in DG was observed for staphylinids. The differences between taxa could be explained by the dispersal capabilities of the species and by their various responses to landscape structures. For carabids, processes at a wider scale could be responsible for their rarity in sources and, consequently, in gardens. For spiders, the colonisation from other sources could explain the high species richness found in disconnected gardens. Our results suggest that the role of corridors is crucial for enhancing biodiversity in green spaces such as domestic gardens. Our results clarify the effectiveness of corridors in urban landscapes and have direct implications for the ecological management of cities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Tropical High-Altitude Streams
PY  - 2007
AB  - This chapter describes the features of tropical high-altitude streams, including physico-chemical conditions, primary producers and macrophytes, fishes, and macro-invertebrates. A particular aim was to describe similarities and differences in the environment, community composition, and functioning of these streams compared to streams in tropical lowlands as well as those at higher latitudes. One prominent difference between the conditions in high-altitude or alpine streams at different latitudes is the less pronounced seasonality in the tropics. Tropical streams originating at high altitudes often have better water quality than streams further down. Precipitation at very high altitudes is less than that at lower elevations. Low water temperature is the most characteristic feature of high-altitude streams. Oxygen concentration is almost constant with increasing altitude. Most alpine streams at temperate latitudes are relatively nutrient poor compared to streams at lower altitudes. The fish fauna of tropical high-altitude streams is very poor in species. The macroinvertebrates fauna in tropical high-altitude streams is dominated by insects. High-altitude streams in the tropics are affected by a number of human activities, which include contamination by pesticides, sediments from fields, livestock grazing, wastewaters from human settlements and cities, acidification and contamination with heavy metals from mining, sedimentation arising from erosion of gravel pits and construction works, reductions in stream discharge due to water abstraction, and fragmentation of longitudinal connectivity caused by dams. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Are high distributed streetscapes also located in the high social interaction streets? A Space syntax approach on street liveability assessment
PY  - 2021
AB  - Cities should be built for people and planned for potential changes with high efficiency. Well-distributed streetscapes in neighborhoods are proved to bring co-benefits of health, active transport, and social equity. This paper provides an innovative framework to interrogate the spatial and social configurations of streetscapes for the City of Greater Bendigo, Australia. The primary research goal is to investigate whether those high distributed streetscapes are also located in the high social interaction streets. The social configuration of streetscapes refers to the degree of integration, connectivity and visibility within a street network and the spatial configuration of streetscapes refers to the percentage of sky, building and trees at any point in the streetscape. The social configurations of streetscapes along street network were measured using space syntax tools and GIS. Space syntax parameters (degree of integration, connectivity and visibility) representing the social interaction level of streets were integrated into the spatial distribution of streetscapes (sky, building, and trees) for analysis. Results showed that Bendigo locality area poses the highest social integration and connectivity. High localized connectivity was observed in the townships of Heathcote and Marong, while recommendation can be made for Heathcote and White Hill area to improve the street network integration and connectivity so as to promote neighborhood liveability. The results also showed that the percentage of older population and population density were positively associated with social connectivity, indicating higher settlements in well-connected townships. Findings from this research can contribute to design more sustainable and efficient streetscapes through our scalable methodological framework. © 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Effects of land use intensification on avian predator assemblages: A comparison of landscapes with different histories in northern Europe
PY  - 2019
AB  - Land use and landcover change alter the ability of habitat networks to maintain viable species populations. While their effects on the quality, amount and patterns of landcover patches are commonly studied, how they affect ecological processes, such as predation on focal species remains neglected. This macroecological study tests the hypothesis that predator assemblages are affected by land use intensity linked to different socio-economic contexts. We measured the distribution and abundance of two avian predator groups (generalist corvid birds and specialist raptors), and proxy variables that mirror their food resources, at three spatial scales in northern Europe's West and East. In total, we made 900 survey counts for avian predators and their resources in six landcover strata throughout five landscapes and analyzed their relationships. The abundance of omnivorous corvid birds was associated with the number of anthropogenic food resources. Thus, corvid birds were most common in the urban and agricultural landcovers, and where forest cover was low. Corvid bird abundance, and availability of their resources, increased with increasing land use intensity. Raptors were less abundant than corvid birds and most common in semi-natural grasslands. The number of raptor species increased with decreasing land use intensity. This study shows that the abundance and composition of avian predator species must be understood to maintain functional habitat networks. © 2019 by the authors.

PY  - 2010
AB  - In this paper, a hierarchy index system suitable for catastrophe progression method was constructed to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the status of ecological land construction in Changsha City in 2007. Based on the evaluation results, the irrationalities of the distribution pattern of Changsha urban ecological land were discussed. With the support of geographic information system (GIS), the ecological corridors of the urban ecological land were constructed by using the 'least-cost' modeling' and, in combining with conflict analysis, the optimum project of the urban ecological land was put forward, forming an integrated evaluation system. The results indicated that the ecological efficiency of urban ecological land in Changsha in 2007 was at medium level, with an evaluation value being 0. 9416, and the quantitative index being relatively high but the coordination index being relatively low. The analysis and verification with software Fragstats showed that the ecological efficiency of the urban ecological land after optimization was higher, with the evaluation value being 0. 9618, and the SHDI, CONTAG, and other indices also enhanced.

TI  - \"Blue-green\" corridors as a tool for erosion and stream control in highly urbanized areas - Case study of Belgrade city
PY  - 2014
AB  - Highly urbanized areas constantly need new surfaces for building of commercial, residential or infrastructure objects. Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, is a large regional centre with a population of 2 000 000 dwellers, covering a territory of 3500 km2. The territory of Belgrade is intersected by 187 streams, with watersheds mostly rural in higher parts, urbanized and highly urbanized in lower parts. Torrential floods that once occurred rarely during pre-development period have now become more frequent and destructive due to the transformation of the watershed from rural to urban land uses. Authorities of Belgrade defined a strategy for erosion control and protection from torrential floods, based on the restoration of \"blue-green\" corridors (residuals of open streams and fragments of forest vegetation). The restoration of \"blue-green\" corridors helps the establishment of new recreational areas, the preservation of biodiversity and the mitigation of effects of climate change. © Copyright 2014 IAHS Press.

PY  - 2018
AB  - Humans have been dominating the urban areas with their abilities and unfavourably tend to have affected other living creatures. This paper directed how to acquire a place in the cities for creating opportunities for birds that live in the cities to live together with us. Several methods were applied emphasizing on Urban Rapid Biodiversity Assessment (RBA) which was adjusted for tropical environments. Vegetation structure, Domain value and the diversity of vascular plants are components determining the quality preference for birds. Results indicated that stream corridors were the best accommodating spaces with an average number of vascular plants was 27; the average number of existing vegetation structures amounted up to 7.00; the average of the total Domain values of all vegetation structures excluding buildings was 24.00 and the average of the total Domain value of all trees was 11.00. Furthermore there were as well empty fields, road corridors, institutional space, green spaces for the public, urban farms and wetlands. The quality of spaces for city birds could be more specific by adding additional filtering of size, ownership, and a development plan. Networking with natural areas would be more feasible if more space were included. Available spaces would be greater when the state of ownership was not limited, despite public spaces were much easier to manage. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Pollinators and urban riparian vegetation: important contributors to urban diversity conservation
PY  - 2022
AB  - Background: Urbanization process around the world has not only changed the patterns of land use, but also fragmented the habitat, resulting in significantly biodiversity loss. Urban rivers, serve as one of the natural corridors in urban ecosystems, are of importance for urban ecosystem stability. However, few studies have been done to explore the relationship between vegetation and pollinators in urban river segments. In this study, two urban streams in the city of Chongqing were selected as the study area, riparian vegetation, butterflies and bees were investigated along all four seasons of a year to illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution patterns. Simultaneously, the ecological functions of the river corridor were analyzed. Result: In this study, 109 plant species belonging to 95 genera of 39 families were recorded; the number of sampled species for butterflies and bees were 12 and 13, respectively. The temporal and spatial patterns of species diversity among vegetation, butterfly, and bee are different, but the trends of variation among them are similar between the two streams. Bees were found to be more closely correlated with native flowering plants in riparian zone, rather than with cultivated riparian vegetation. Conclusions: The native riparian vegetation in urban rivers plays an important role in urban biodiversity conservation by serving as a corridor. This study provides data supporting the protection of the remaining natural patches and restoration of damaged habitats in the city. The survey has accumulated data on native riparian vegetation and pollinators in urban rivers. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Occurrence of the Puma concolor (Linnaeus, 1771) in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil
PY  - 2008
AB  - In August 2002, the presence of the Puma concolor began to be detected near Itapuã State Park (PEI), in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre. This study aimed at: registering the species in the regions using indirect methods; accessing the perception of local inhabitants about the recently-settled species, using free interviews based on semi-structured questionnaires; and identifying potential dispersion routes used by the species to reach the region, using spatial analyses in a geographic information system (GIS), evaluating the concentration of remaining forests in the areas surrounding the park. Field outings were conducted between September 2002 and May 2004 and twelve properties in the area immediately surrounding PEI were visited. Thirty-one traces of the species were recorded in the region. Most of the interviewed families proved to be detached from PEI's conservationist interests and unreceptive to the presence of the puma in the area, revealing the urgency in implementing educational programs geared towards the local community. Spatial analyses demonstrate the high probability of finding the puma in the northeast corner of PEI, generating subsidies for implementing corridors of wildlife that connect the region of the park to other remaining forests in the state.

TI  - Do wooded streets provide connectivity for bats in an urban landscape?
PY  - 2009
AB  - The effects of urbanization on bats are poorly understood, but published data suggests it might be detrimental to them. Even though urban parks provide refuge to native biota, the nature of the urban landscape exacerbates the insularization process. In order to evaluate if wooded streets in an urban landscape provide connectivity for bats, we compared bat community structure in three different types of habitats: urban parks, wooded streets and non-wooded streets. Sampling occurred monthly from August 2006 to July 2007 in the city of Vitória, southeastern Brazil. Richness, relative abundance and diversity were higher in urban parks and lower in non-wooded streets. Jaccard's similarity index showed that the wooded streets are more similar to non-wooded streets than to urban parks. Urbanization may benefit generalist species by providing new resources, but for specialist species critical resources may be lost and persistence endangered. There is evidence that wooded streets may provide some degree of connectivity for birds in urban landscapes, but our results suggest that this is not the case, with wooded streets being used by few individuals of a few species. Vegetation cover is important to maintain bat diversity in urban centers. Activities like landscape planning and gardening should include biodiversity data in their outputs in order to better design a landscape that improves the likelihood of persistence of bats. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

TI  - Spatio-temporal change and its effects on landscape pattern of Jinta oasis in arid China from 1963 to 2009
PY  - 2015
AB  - Oasis was a small and medium scale zonal ecological landscape, and the basic places to sustain human activities and developments in the arid area. Under the influence of the increasing human activities and the change of global climate, oasis change (Oasification and desertification) was not only the most direct reflect of environmental change in the arid area, but also was one of the most active research fields of land degradation and regional sustainable development. Recently, the interaction mechanism between oasis change and landscape pattern had been regarded as an important content of regional environmental change research in arid areas. In China, oases were mainly distributed in temperate and warm temperate desert areas, but only took up 4%—5% of the total area of the northwestern China. However, more than 90% of the population and 95% of social wealth were concentrated within these oases. Jinta oasis located in the Hexi Corridor in arid northwestern China, was not only a typical oasis with long agricultural history, but also was an agro-pastoral transitional zone and ecologically fragile area. Due to the rapid growth of population, economic pressure and excess exploitation using the resources, the ecological environment and sustainable development of Jinta oasis were greatly affected. Therefore, we took Jinta oasis as a case to study oasis spatio-temporal change from 1963 to 2009 and its influence on the landscape pattern. Based on Keyhole satellite photograph in the 1963, Landsat MSS images in the 1973, TM and ETM images from 1986 to 2009, the land cover were divided into two categories: oasis and desert. Oasis included farmland, grassland, woodland, water and residential area which based on classification criteria of Chinese National Technical Standard for Land-Use Survey; desert included salinized land, bare land, desert, Gobi and low coverage grassland which the vegetation cover degree ≤15%.The results were tested by the field investigation, the GPS sampling and interview with local people. After then, the process, trend and spatial pattern change in Jinta oasis and the characteristic of landscape pattern changes were analyzed by a set of mathematical statistical models and indice of landscape ecology. The results showed that: Jinta oasis was being in an unbalanced state, oasis scale and area expanded gradually with an increase of 167.37km2during the period of 1963—2009. Simultaneously, the area of Jinta oasis achieved its maximum with 523. 17km2in 2009. The conversion between oasis and non-oasis was frequent and violent and showed a state of imbalance-balance-extreme imbalance condition, although the degree of conversion was different in different periods. And then, most change of the oasis happened as the reclamation of abandoned land and desert area, especially in the inner and outer marginal area of oasis, such as Yangjingziwan township, Xiba township, Sanhe-Dongba -Dazhuangzi township zone, Jinta-Zhongdong township zone. The area, size and spatial distribution of oasis influenced by human activity had resulted in fundamental changes of oasis landscape pattern. The fractal characteristics, dispersion degree and fragmentation of Jinta oasis were decreased, and the oasis landscape tended to be simple and uniform. All in all, in the latest 46 years, the spatio-temporal change of Jinta oasis drove the change of local landscape pattern to the decrease of the diversity, complex structure and landscape heterogeneity. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - The connectivity of Haifa urban open space network
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urban open spaces are considered as spatial residuals of the expansion of built areas. The environmental impact of the resulting land-cover pattern and associated ecosystem services are frequently evaluated at a crude spatial resolution only. However, wild animals use remaining interconnected fine-grain open spaces as an infrastructure for movement. In this paper, we traced the evolution of an open-space system in Haifa, Israel, and examined the impact of urban morphology on size and distribution of open spaces at different spatial resolutions. At a 30 m resolution, our analysis indicated fragmentation and increasing partial elimination of open spaces. Over time the connectivity declined at a diminishing rate, yet the network did not disintegrate into separate components. The evolution analysis implied that in crude resolution, the open space network is threatened. At a 5 m resolution, our analysis showed that Haifa remains porous to animal movement. Using combined multiple least-cost paths through the urban landscape of heterogeneous permeability, we illustrated extensive connectivity among open spaces. Backyards and other urban in-between spaces complemented the seminatural open-space network connectivity, enabling wildlife movement between habitat patches and thus survival in an urbanized environment. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Effects of built landscape on taxonomic homogenization: Two case studies of private gardens in the French Mediterranean
PY  - 2014
AB  - Urbanization can promote the replacement of native species by exotic species resulting in an increase in community's similarity over time. This process is called biotic homogenization, which is usually studied at large scale from species lists. Our paper addresses the effects of urbanization on plant community at local scale in areas where urban policies are implemented. We focus on private gardens as they are the most common components of green spaces in European urbanized areas. They are also a place where exotic species are introduced. Observations were made on spontaneous flora sampled from gardens in two study sites of the French Mediterranean: a large city and a village located in an urbanizing rural area. We evaluated how urban landscape influences floristic similarity and how exotic species affect homogenization. We divided each study site in three built-up density zones. As the urbanization process of both sites did not take place at the same time, we were able to assess the effect of time on floristic similarity. Results indicate that floristic similarity is less important in high dense built-up areas than in low dense ones. Exotic species tend to reduce floristic similarity in city centers and increase floristic similarity in low dense built-up areas in both sites. Landscape metrics calculated in built-up areas surrounding the gardens influence floristic similarity. Lastly, we found that urban planning in terms of built-up density affects biodiversity distribution and that private gardens can provide landscape connectivity within urban areas. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Environmental design for ecological infrastructure of urban landscape through aggregate with outlier principle (awop) in order to enhance the quality of urban life (case of District Two, Tehran City)
PY  - 2014
AB  - Introduction: The urban population experienced rapid growth in the recent decades, particularly between 1975 and 2000 when it has reached from 1.5 to more than 2 billion people. By turn of the century; half of the world's populations are concentrated in cities. This would severely affect the quality of life in urban areas. Accordingly, cities will be faced with significant challenges in infrastructure and environmental issues to support urban population growth. At present, there is no balance between urban and natural patterns, and urban networks are immensely dominating ecological networks. There are many researches indicating the critical role of cities and their environmental impacts on their natural resources due to cumulative effects of the above issues. Tehran, the capital city of Iran is no exemption; it is seen as a metropolis dealing with many environmental problems; that keeps it far from sustainability indices. To provide the cities with urban improvement, there is a general consensus among the international community about new theories of urban development within the framework of sustainable development as new solutions. These solutions are supported by the world's metropolises network as the major solution to encourage global participation and efforts to reduce the negative impacts of urbanization and population expansion. In parallel, the concepts such as urban green networks and ecological urban networks have attracted considerable attention. Urban ecology as a scientific discipline is rapidly developing throughout the world to discuss the possible environmentally sound solutions for the design and management of cities to move them towards sustainability. Hence, the urban ecology theory is turned to the Eco-city concept by some architects and urban planners. The core idea here is that it is necessary to provide the city with economical spatial infrastructures to make them more compatible with environmental concerns or natural characteristics of the cities. As many researches in the past, focused on the ecology of the city based on the concepts of ecosystems, more recently the role of landscape ecology within and beyond the city are emphasized in this field. Much attention, therefore, has been given to landscape ecology approaches to improve the quality of urban environment in different cities around the world. This study is discussing and presenting the new strategies for eco-city infrastructures, through landscape ecology approach based on the AWOP (Aggregate-with-outliers principle). This is to investigate the design of urban ecological infrastructure networks to protect and enhance natural aspects in urban landscapes and provide the sustainable development of urban areas. In this research the district number two of Tehran city is examined as the study area in terms of these approaches. Materials and Methods: The study area in the present research is Tehran district number 2 as the most developed zones located in center and north of Tehran city. Natural landforms of Alborz Mountain Chain are the most significant aspect of structural elements in this district. There are five major river valleys in Tehran City and two of the valleys (Darakeh and Farahzad rivers) are located in this district. Natural features such as river valleys and streams, network access as air circulation corridors and existence of faults and power lines as the potential to create green corridors, play significant role in sustainable development and design of ecological infrastructure networks in district 2. A large area of urban constructions involves dense and fine-grained textures as the other features of the district. To formulate the theoretical framework and principles of the present research, the required data have been collected and analyzed through literature and library documents. After reviewing the theoretical literature, urban ecological infrastructure network has been analyzed to find a conceptual framework on the basis of ecological landscape design. Forman and Godron introduced concepts such as patches, corridors and matrices as basic elements in landscape ecology. Some layers of district land use map including, river valleys, streams network, access network, faults and power lines, green spaces, semi-private green spaces and reserve lands are required for development and urban renewal. The required data have been derived from preparation of land-use mapping using GIS application. Using Aggregate with Outlier Principle, landscape ecological infrastructure network in district 2 has been designed. The principle, offered by Forman, proposes the optimum arrangement for land use in landscape. AWOP also emphasizes on appropriateness of the distribution, composition and extent of open and green spaces as structural landscape in urban areas. In addition, a range of direct benefits to humans is suggested by such spatial approach. Ecological infrastructure network is obtained through an overlaid patches and corridors (as facilities layers) and urban construction (as limitations layer). Finally, using the results of field study, some strategies and measures have been formulated within the framework of designing urban infrastructures in various ground of this network. Discussion and Results: Using GIS, maps for landscape structural elements in district 2 have been derived from land use map as follows: 1. Patches of Landscape Structure: the patches include green spaces, semi-private green spaces and reserve lands for development and urban renewal. 2. Corridors of landscape structure: Generally, two types of corridors in district 2 can be classified as follows: • Corridors of water flow, which include Darakeh and Farahzad river valleys, west flood inversion channel and ground water corridor network (Aqueducts network). • Corridors of energy flow and humans' and other organisms' movement that includes network access (humans and other organisms movement) and faults and power lines (energy flow). 3. Matrix of landscape structure: Matrix is a homogeneous mass that involves different and small structural elements and included more than half of the land. Thus, dense, fine-grained and impermeable urban construction which comprises a large area of the study area forms urban landscape matrix. After identifying the ecological landscape elements (corridors, patches and matrix), and representing them as distinct layers, network formation requires the overlaying of them. Identified patches and corridors are considered the facilities of designing ecological infrastructure network and landscape matrix layer as limitations of forming the network. After overlaying the layers, 5 critical ecologic areas have been determined in network (Fig. 1). (Figure Presented) Following the field studies and observations, the required strategies and measures within the realm of improvement, conservation, optimization and restoration have been formulated in these zones. Finally, using AWOP, ecological infrastructure network as a method to design network of ecological infrastructure in Tehran's district two has been established (Fig. 2) as follows: 1. According to this principle, natural corridors of Darakeh River Valley (1) and Farahzad River Valley (2) have been preserved as the main components of the network structure. 2. Large patches of vegetation (Pardisan Park) (3) were included in the network as a vast and central green patch. 3. Small natural patches such as Tarasht gardens (4) and Farahzad gardens (5), located in developed urban areas, have also been included in the network. 4. To provide more than one large patch of vegetation, natural garden patches of vegetation have been connected to a large green patch (Pardisan Park). 5. Semi-private green patches have been included in the network as small vegetation patches and connected to large patches of vegetation. Conclusion: s The increase in population of the world and subsequently increase in urban population has led to an imbalance between nature and cities, which caused numerous environmental problems such as air pollution, lack of vitality, contaminated water, soil and public environment pollution. Therefore, attention to the quality of urban life and its promotion with regard to urban population is also necessary. The aim of this study is to design ecological infrastructure of landscape in district number 2 of Tehran City in order to enhance the quality of urban life. Thus, to conclud this research, the spatial structure and function of the study area are examined and categorized based on the patch-corridor-matrix. Based on the landscape ecology approach, the other natural patches and corridors in the urban environment are to be preserved and restored to increase their ecological functions in the city so that natural flows can continue and penetrate into the built environment and built patches. These are the most influential factors in the densely built-up and high populated city regions. Using the principles of landscape ecology framework, AWOP and land use map, matrix, patches and corridors, the study area has been recognized and by using GIS application the necessary factors have been extracted as separate layers. After overlaying the layers of facilities (patches and corridors) and removing in limitation layer (urban construction matrix), five major zones have been identified in the final maps as fallowing: Darakeh and Farahzad River Valleys, Pardisan Park, West flood inversion channel and Tarasht gardens. Design strategies and basic environmental initiatives in the areas of promotion, protection, rehabilitation and restoration of the network have been introduced in order to protect the integrity between structural elements and preserve the original patterns of ecological networks. Finally, landscape design of ecological infrastructure network in district number 2 is also presented (Fig. 2).

TI  - Aspects of the ecology and conservation of the Growling Grass Frog Litoria raniformis in an urban-fringe environment, southern Victoria
PY  - 2008
AB  - Populations of the threatened Growling Grass Frog Litoria raniformis in metropolitan Melbourne currently occur in human-made habitats and there is little information on their current status. We conducted systematic field surveys at 28 waterbodies within a population distributed over agricultural land in the Pakenham area, on the south-eastern urban-fringe of Melbourne Victoria, during the 2005/06 breeding season. Our aim was to identify key areas for the conservation of L raniformis. We recorded L raniformis at 14 waterbodies where we marked 31 males and 16 females. Occupied waterbodies had a greater proportion of submerged vegetation, a higher pH, and were situated close to other occupied waterbodies, generally < 200 m. The adult male and female population size was estimated at 45 ± 10 (± S.E.) and 23 ± 8 individuals, respectively. There was high site fidelity at occupied waterbodies (> 80% recapture rates). Recruitment was recorded in only two waterbodies. Two males and four females were recorded moving 15 - 20 m between adjacent waterbodies, whereas one additional male moved 130 m. Dispersal and movement corridors important for the persistence of L raniformis in the study area include agricultural drains and Gum Scrub Creek. High priority conservation areas are waterbodies situated in close proximity to the creek and Melbourne - Bairnsdale railway reserve, and clusters of occupied waterbodies to the south.

TI  - Forest distribution on small isolated hills and implications on woody plant distribution under threats of global warming
PY  - 2012
AB  - Treelines have been found to be lower in small isolated hilltops, but the specific dynamics behind this unique phenomenon are unknown. This study investigates the distribution patterns of woody plants in Yangmingshan National Park (YMSNP), Northern Taiwan in search of the limitation mechanisms unique to small isolated hills, and to evaluate potential threats under global warming. Forests distributed between 200 to 900 m above sea level (ASL). Remnant forest fragments between 400 and 900 m ASL, have the highest species richness, and should be protected to ensure future forest recovery from the former extensive artificial disturbance. The lower boundary is threatened by urban and agricultural development. The lack of native woody species in these low elevation zones may cause a gap susceptible to invasive species. A consistent forest line at 100 m below mountain tops regardless of elevation suggests a topography-induced instead of an elevation-related limiting mechanism. Therefore, upward-shift of forests, caused by global warming, might be limited at 100 m below hilltops in small isolated hills because of topography-related factors. The spatial range of woody plants along the altitudinal gradient, thus, is likely to become narrower under the combined pressures of global warming, limited elevation, exposure-related stress, and artificial disturbance. Management priorities for forest recovery are suggested to include preservation of remnant forest fragments, increasing forest connectivity, and increasing seedling establishment in the grasslands.

TI  - Effects of multi-scale control factors on spatial heterogeneity of denitrification in riparian soil: A case study in Liu Xi River of Guangzhou city
PY  - 2015
AB  - Soil denitrification enzyme activity was measured by a hierarchical sampling approach within the riparian zone of the Liu Xi River tributary of Guangzhou city, and explored and identified multi-scale factors that influenced soil denitrification. The results showed that soil denitrification potential-represented by soil denitrification enzyme activity (DEA)-showed more heterogeneity on a profile-scale than on a cross-sectional scale and landscape-scale in riparian zones; multi-scale factors controlled the degree of spatial variation in soil denitrification. The profile-scale factors, including soil TOC (total organic carbon), TN (total nitrogen) and NO3--N (nitrate nitrogen), were the major direct regulators of the spatial distribution of DEA. The cross-sectional scale factors, including landscape position and vegetation density, and the landscape-scale factors, including TI, elevation and land-use types, indirectly regulated the distribution of DEA. At the profile scale, the highest DEA occurred on the upper soil, but dramatically declined from the soil surface to the deeper layers. At the cross-sectional scale, the highest DEA was observed at the landscape position, with good landscape connectivity and high-density vegetation within the middle part of the riparian zone. At the watershed scale, DEA showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream except for the sites in urbanized areas. ©, 2015, Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences. All right reserved.

TI  - Macroinvertebrate communities in the Big East Lake water network in relation to environmental factors
PY  - 2017
AB  - The Big East Lake water network (BELWN), located in Wuhan city, China, is mainly composed of six lakes and isolated from the Yangtze river. At the background of restoring the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes, four season investigations were conducted during 2014-2015 to study the spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of macroinvertebrate communities, explore their relationships with environmental factors, and forecast the change trends in assemblages in a long period after restoration measures. A total of 40 species were recorded, oligochaetes and chironomids dominated the communities. Season variation in density and biomass were distinct and the community differences in lakes related to the degrees of organic pollution. In comparison with the historical data, the species richness of mollusks in Donghu lake sharply decreased due to water pollution and the loss of diverse habitat. Concerning on the whole BELWN, the whole taxa recorded in our study was slightly fewer than the previous study. A new recorded species polychaete Nephtys sp. was first collected with an important ecological interest. As an urban lake system dominated by eutrophication, the water nutrients significantly affected the distribution of macroinvertebrates. According to the GAM models, the dominant species responded to environmental gradients with different response curves. After restoring the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes, the macroinvertebrate communities would change and the biodiversity would steadily increase with time. Additionally, the new recorded species Nephtys sp. would spread into the whole BELWN in the foresee future. © S. Chi.

TI  - Extirpation, colonization, and habitat dynamics of a keystone species along an urban gradient
PY  - 2010
AB  - Using 5 years of patch occupancy data for 384 habitat fragments, we evaluated population and habitat dynamics of the black-tailed prairie dog in urban habitat remnants in the rapidly developing landscape of Denver, CO, USA. Specifically, we evaluated the landscape factors, including fragment area, age, and connectivity, that characterize the habitat fragments most likely to be colonized by prairie dogs, as well as those experiencing local extinctions. In addition, we determined which patch types were most often removed by land development. Sites in proximity to colonies were more likely to be colonized by prairie dogs. Local extinctions were most common on isolated colonies, and older and more isolated colonies were more likely to be extirpated by human activity. In general, smaller and older habitat patches were at the highest risk of being lost to land development. Our results provide observations of dynamic changes to the distribution of a potential keystone species in an urban area, which can be used to inform island biogeographic and metapopulation models for wildlife persistence in developing landscapes. Although populations are currently in decline, most local extinctions are the direct result of human activity, and we suggest that prairie dogs in this area can persist with appropriate management. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Analysis of the spatial continuity of vegetation-covered areas on a regional scale
PY  - 2006
AB  - Recently, it is required to investigate the distribution of vegetation-covered areas on a regional scale for not only the improvement of urban environment but also the conservation of ecosystem. The spatial continuity of vegetation-covered areas like a green corridor plays an important role for the preservation of ecological balance especially. For the analysis of the spatial distribution of vegetation-covered areas on a regional scale, we defined the NDVI calculated from Landsat ETM+ data as the potential of the existence of vegetation-covered areas, and applied them to the analysis using local spatial autocorrelation. The areas that showed the positive spatial autocorrelation from a narrow range to a wide range were interpreted as high-potential areas on the spatial continuity of vegetation-covered areas. The new map of Spatial Scale of Clumping vegetation-covered areas (SSC), which presented contour lines based on fluctuations in the number of the range of the positive spatial autocorrelation, was proposed. We applied SSC to the hydrological analysis for extracting ridgelines that contained high spatial continuity of vegetation-covered areas. Through the comparison between the ridgelines and the green corridors in the master plans for parks and open spaces, it was obvious that the areas of high NDVI were dense along the ridgelines that played a role as bridges between core areas and sparse areas of vegetation cover.

TI  - Landscape pattern optimization based on RS and GIS in northwest of Beijing
PY  - 2007
AB  - Heterogeneity of landscapes is supposed to be of significant importance for biodiversity and ecological function in urban ecosystems.However, land use activities caused primarily by urbanization process has a profound and far-reaching impact on stability of landscape and differences of landscape structure at the regional scale. Therefore, in this paper, the northwest region of Beijing is chosen as a study area and the technologies of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) is applied, and meanwhile the priority is been given to understanding of the spatial-temporal characteristics of landscape pattern change through visually interpreting Landsat TM images of 1989, 1996 and 2005 respectively. It is believed that there are a series of landscape ecological problems because of city expansion, such as low landscape ecological connectivity, simplified landscape structure and more obvious fragmentation of green land patch in the plain areas. Moreover, spatial distribution of green land is unbalanced. In order to solve those problems, according to the principle that the movements of flow, energy and material in a landscape are related to some factors such as distance, time, impedance, etc., this study adopts an accumulative cost distance model, combines with ecosystem services and spatial interactions of landscape types, analyzes the spatial difference of the ecological function and the compactness of landscape structure in the study area, and further discusses the landscape pattern optimization proposal.

TI  - Parrots and the city: modeling potential corridors in an urban environment
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization is a worldwide problem affecting wildlife negatively. Cities cause habitat suppression, fragmentation, among other disease spreading, suitable conditions for exotic species, and direct animal kills—consequently, local native species might be extinct. Still, urban areas can also provide biodiversity maintenance because some species can be adapted to the urban environment. Here, we assess how the urban environment influences the displacement of native turquoise-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva). We created a map of environmental suitability to modeling A. aestiva displacement routes among three protected areas in Brasilia, Brazil. We tested (1) if the modeled corridors tend to be near to the areas where A. aestiva occurs and (2) how landscape spatial heterogeneity influences those modeled routes. We expected to observe oriented routes in homogeneous areas (few pixels with high-frequency selection), and the opposite in heterogeneous areas. To test our hypotheses, we recorded A. aestiva and correlated its presence/absence with the modeled corridors and correlated the landscape spatial heterogeneity with different metrics of the modeled corridors. Our results indicate that at least one of the modeled routes was near to the points with parrots. In general, potential dispersal routes with little spatial variation occurred in homogeneous areas. In the urban matrix, potential routes were less oriented with more spatial variation. Our results suggest the adoption of different strategies to manage the natural environment in an urban matrix. By managing the spatial heterogeneity, it is possible to direct how the species use the space, promoting the displacement to desired areas, avoiding the more urbanized ones. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Disentangling landscape and local drivers of ground-dwelling beetle community assembly in an urban ecosystem
PY  - 2020
AB  - Community assembly is the process by which local communities are organized and maintained from the regional species pool. Understanding processes of insect assembly are of interest in \"shrinking\" cities where vacant land has become abundant as a result of protracted economic decline and population loss. Vacant land represents a viable conservation space for insects such as beetles that contribute to ecosystem services including pest suppression, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. However, the inherent heterogeneity of cities may pose challenges for beetle dispersal from source populations, while quality of the urban environment may constrain establishment. The objective of this study was to investigate the constraints to ground-dwelling beetle community assembly in vacant lots and pocket prairies of Cleveland, Ohio using a functional trait-based approach. Functional traits with a strong predictive capacity for ecological functions were measured on beetle species collected via pitfall traps. Assembly of beetle communities was primarily constrained by dispersal limitations to colonization. Over 93% of species found within treatments were capable of flight, and functional diversity of beetle communities was higher across all treatments than expected by chance. Once beetles colonized, successful establishment was influenced by heavy metal contamination and mowing frequency, with these disturbances shaping communities based on body size, antennae length, and origin. Colonization of dispersal-limited species could be facilitated by increasing connectivity among greenspaces in cities, while establishment could be enhanced by managing local environmental conditions. Understanding how insect communities are structured in urban ecosystems provides context for observed patterns of biodiversity, advances conservation efforts, and fosters ecosystem services.

TI  - Do indigenous street trees promote more biodiversity than alien ones? Evidence using mistletoes and birds in South Africa
PY  - 2016
AB  - Trees in urban landscapes provide a range of ecosystem services, including habitat, refugia, food, and corridors for other fauna and flora. However, there is some debate whether the richness and abundance of other biodiversity supported is influenced by the provenance of trees, i.e., native or non-native. This study assessed the presence of mistletoes and birds (and nests) in 1261 street trees. There were marked differences between native and non-native street trees, with the former having a significantly higher prevalence of birds (and nests) and supporting more species and in greater densities, whilst the latter supported a higher prevalence of mistletoes. Additionally, for birds, the proximity to green space, tree size and species were also important, whilst for mistletoes, the proximity to green space, slope aspect, and tree species were significant. Preference ratios indicated that some tree species had a higher than random occurrence of birds or mistletoes, whilst others had a low abundance. The indigenous tree species, Acacia karroo Hayne was the only reasonably abundant street tree species that was important for birds, nests, and mistletoes. At the street scale, there was a positive relationship between street tree species richness and bird species richness. These results emphasise the importance of selecting appropriate tree species if biodiversity conservation is a core outcome.

TI  - Invasion of plants in towns and roadsides around the Iguaque massif (Boyacá, Colombia)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Cities and towns can be conceptualized as invasion hotspots. The connections created by roads or highways facilitate the mobility of these species, expanding their range of distribution and contributing to their expansion through the landscape to other urban areas or nearby natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Here we describe the actual distribution of invasive plants in a region of Colombia and determine the role that urban centers, road edges, and rivers have in shaping their distribution. We mapped—at high resolution—the distribution of exotic species in the Alto Ricaurte region (Boyacá, Colombia), specifically in the towns of Villa de Leyva, Sáchica, Sutamarchán, and Arcabuco and connecting roads. Initially, a list of 40 exotic plant species with invasive potential was assembled: 26 of which were mapped in the region. Then, we used Poisson models to test whether invasive species appear more frequently near cities, roads, and riverbanks. We found that roadside and riverbank areas host more exotic species than more distant zones. Our findings suggest that roads and rivers are efficient dispersal corridors connecting different invasive hotspots with other landscape elements. Urban centers act as islands of invasion and roads and rivers as corridors for species dispersal. This invasion scenario is already causing economic and ecological damage: roads are heavily deteriorated byR. communis, K. densiflora, and C. jubata, while P. aquilinum and M. minutiflora may increase the occurrence of fires in the region. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - The relationship between green roofs and urban biodiversity: a systematic review
PY  - 2022
AB  - As a form of green infrastructure, green roofs can enhance urban biodiversity by providing complex vegetation structures, supplying increased foraging and roosting opportunities for animals and increasing habitat connectivity. Although it is widely believed that green roofs can promote urban biodiversity, this idea has not been widely studied on an empirical scale. Therefore, a systematic understanding of the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity from different perspectives is still lacking. Here we provide a systematic review of the empirical literature on the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity. The results suggest that green roofs benefit urban biodiversity to some extent but cannot replace quondam natural habitats or complex artificial greening environments. Additionally, the studies reviewed here focused primarily on the diversity of plants or arthropods and were conducted almost exclusively in the United States and the United Kingdom. Moreover, most studies investigating the factors of green roofs affecting biodiversity focused on roof area, height, age, substrate depth, and plant community. To improve our understanding of the relationship between green roofs and urban biodiversity, more extensive research, particularly in developing countries, as well as more in-depth studies of a greater number of species and taxa, including chordates, mollusks and microbes, from different perspectives (e.g. at the genetic level) and other potential pathways are needed. In the future, the density, distribution pattern, distance and location relationship between different green roofs should be considered in an integrated manner. In order to more effectively support urban biodiversity, green roofs should be used in conjunction with other urban green spaces. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Identifying the spatial mixture distribution of bird diversity across urban and suburban areas in the metropolis: A case study in Taipei Basin of Taiwan
PY  - 2011
AB  - This study utilized a finite mixture distribution model (FMDM) to identify the distribution of bird diversity in urban and suburban areas of the Taipei basin. The spatial patterns of Shannon's diversity index were estimated using Sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) with bird investigation data. To validate the results of FMDM, bird groups were classified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) based on bird presence-absence records. The probabilities exceeding FMDM's cut-off values for suburban bird communities were obtained from SGS realizations. The results showed that bird diversity in the Taipei basin could be comprised of two-component mixture distributions for urban and suburban bird communities, respectively. The FMDM bird diversity classifications fit the TWINSPAN groups of urban and suburban species. The spatial maps of bird diversity in the study area provide evidence that a metropolis can cause changes in the spatial characteristics of bird communities at the landscape level. Furthermore, the bird diversity and land use maps could be useful for future conservation and urban planning in Taipei Basin, particularly urban green spaces and wetlands. The maps could also be utilized in network planning of green belts or corridors for ecological conservation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Enlightenments from potted landscapes (Bonsai and Penjing) for urban revegetation in the built environment
PY  - 2020
AB  - Impervious surfaces in modern cities can be used for revegetation. However, the ecological quality of belowground ecosystem components and constrained soil space are crucial factors that limit habitat restoration. The long-term development of Bonsai (Penjing) trees has resulted in mature theories and techniques that suggest optimal root-canopy ratios. Considering the similarities with constrained pot landscapes, some “enlightenments”, or key findings, derived from Bonsai theory can also be applied to urban special revegetation (USR). In this study, we analyzed the root-shoot correlations of the different styles of Bonsai trees and provide and assessment on the relationships between Bonsai theory and USR. Using an on-site survey and biomass experiment, nine “enlightenments” from Bonsai theory are proposed: positive root-canopy correlation, environmental stress increasing the root-shoot ratio, connectivity of the tree bark “water line”, rebalancing after disruption of the root-canopy balance, precise root and canopy design, artificial auxiliary fixation of the root, control of growth, horticultural reshaping skills, and plant diversity. In particular, for the successful establishment of urban rebuilt environments, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of root-canopy correlations. Therefore, we suggest that the four main types of USR (green roofs, vertical greening, container gardening, and street trees) should follow the core principle based on the root-shoot balance to effectively design both the root and canopy. © 2020

TI  - Landscape genetic analyses reveal fine-scale effects of forest fragmentation in an insular tropical bird
PY  - 2017
AB  - Within the framework of landscape genetics, resistance surface modelling is particularly relevant to explicitly test competing hypotheses about landscape effects on gene flow. To investigate how fragmentation of tropical forest affects population connectivity in a forest specialist bird species, we optimized resistance surfaces without a priori specification, using least-cost (LCP) or resistance (IBR) distances. We implemented a two-step procedure in order (i) to objectively define the landscape thematic resolution (level of detail in classification scheme to describe landscape variables) and spatial extent (area within the landscape boundaries) and then (ii) to test the relative role of several landscape features (elevation, roads, land cover) in genetic differentiation in the Plumbeous Warbler (Setophaga plumbea). We detected a small-scale reduction of gene flow mainly driven by land cover, with a negative impact of the nonforest matrix on landscape functional connectivity. However, matrix components did not equally constrain gene flow, as their conductivity increased with increasing structural similarity with forest habitat: urban areas and meadows had the highest resistance values whereas agricultural areas had intermediate resistance values. Our results revealed a higher performance of IBR compared to LCP in explaining gene flow, reflecting suboptimal movements across this human-modified landscape, challenging the common use of LCP to design habitat corridors and advocating for a broader use of circuit theory modelling. Finally, our results emphasize the need for an objective definition of landscape scales (landscape extent and thematic resolution) and highlight potential pitfalls associated with parameterization of resistance surfaces. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Human settlement and wood utilization along the mainstream of Heihe River basin, northwest China in historical period
PY  - 2019
AB  - In recent years, archaeologists have studied how ancient humans have shaped, and been shaped by, their surrounding environments in an effort to provide valuable insight into the patterns of human-environment interaction during prehistoric and historical periods. Along the Heihe River in Hexi Corridor of northwest China, archaeologists have found many ancient cities that are good places to explore changes in human settlement patterns in relation to environment change in historical periods. In this paper, we present our investigation of seven ancient cities to clarify the chronology of these cities and their strategy for wood use in the area through the application of radiocarbon dating and charcoal identification. Our results suggest that the ages of many cities are younger than previous estimates, and humans mainly used Tamarix and mixed Tamarix and broad leaf trees in the lower and middle reaches of the Heihe River basin between ∼ AD 240–1380 respectively, and roughly matches the modern spatial distribution of natural woody vegetation in the area. In comparison to the results of archaeological, paleoclimatic and historical studies in Hexi Corridor, we propose that ancient human strategies for wood use and their impact on environment of the Heihe Basin are primarily relevant to human lifestyles rather than climate change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA

TI  - Powerline Corridors Can Add Ecological Value to Suburban Landscapes When Not Maintained as Lawn
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Electric powerline corridors are informal green spaces that encompass large areas of land and have the potential to support biodiversity in urban and suburban landscapes. However, the extent to which these corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of “natural” habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes, residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush mowed on a five-year cycle (“old-field”), and (3) restored and/or maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest. Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by providing alternative habitat types that support many species. Nonetheless, we suggest that managers looking to specifically support native and/or grassland specialist species in this region should manage sites as prairies when possible.</jats:p>

TI  - Study on the development of regional tourism industry under the influence of high-speed railway a case study of the middle reach of Yangtze River
PY  - 2017
AB  - According to the data about the shortest travel time of high-speed and conventional rail network from 10 cities, the domestic tourism income and the amount of domestic tourists in the middle reaches of Yangtze River area, this research will use the transportation accessibility in order to measure the spatial pattern of rail tourist transport accessibility in highspeed rail network. Based on the shortest travel time modified gravity model among 10 cities in high-speed rail network, the tourism economic linkage intensity, quantity, direction and breaking points are comprehensively estimated. And the highspeed rail's influence on the tourism linkage in the middle reach of Yangtze River area is identified. The result shows: Comparing with the existing lines, the tourist transport accessibility among cities is improved under the influence of high speed rail network, and the model presents a decreasing pattern from the central corridor to western wing and eastern wing. It shows the polarization effects of Wuhan and Changsha as the core of this region and there would be diffusion effect to some extent. The result of tourism economic linkage turns out the spatial distribution characteristics of this region. It shows that Wuhan and Changsha are the main cores and Nanchang is the vice core of this area, which constitute three major tourism economic circle. © 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Green and blue infrastructure design in a semi-arid region
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) is a new approach for dealing with biodiversity conservation based on maintaining the ecological networks by ensuring the survival of animal and plant species. GBI is considered a new public policy to avoid the loss of biodiversity by preserving landscape connectivity and protecting natural habitats from fragmentation. Countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, Japan, China, Brazil, and Turkey are seeking to integrate this concept into their environmental policies. This study proposed a methodology to design a GBI at a regional scale applied to the Sousse region in Tunisia. Two main approaches were used. The first was based on identifying three reference species marked by different dispersal distances. The second applied GIS spatial analysis using the buffer model to help assess the ecological connectivity. The methodology developed comprises five steps. In the first step, a forest habitat sub-frame, a semi-open habitat sub-frame, and a wetland sub-frame were determined from a detailed land-use map. Then, different biodiversity reservoirs were identified. In the third step, buffers varying between 200, 250, and 300 m depending on the dispersal distance of the reference species (Cape hare, North African Hedgehog, and Marbled Teal) were applied around the reservoirs to identify zones of potential connections between them. Next, buffers were also applied to detect fragmentation zones along road networks and built-up areas. Finally, the ecological corridors were mapped from the overlay between zones of potential connections and the fragmentation map. The result was the creation of a GBI of the Sousse region with reservoirs of biodiversity and ecological corridors connecting them. This methodological approach and the characterization of the Sousse city GBI map represent the first innovative research applied in Tunisia. This prototype can be a reference for other local or regional spaces, contributing toward realizing a national GBI and promoting sustainable projects.

TI  - Prediction of range expansion and estimation of dispersal routes of water deer (Hydropotes inermis) in the transboundary region between China, the Russian Far East and the Korean Peninsula
PY  - 2022
AB  - Global changes may direct species expansion away from their current range. When such an expansion occurs, and the species colonizes a new region, it is important to monitor the habitat used by the species and utilize the information to updated management strategies. Water deer (Hydropotes inermis) is listed as Vulnerable species in IUCN Red List and is restricted to east central China and the Korean Peninsula. Since 2017, water deer has expanded its range towards northeast China and the Russian Far East. The objective of our study is to provide support for a better understanding of habitat use and provide suggestions for developing conservation strategy. We collected occurrence data in northeast China and the Russian Far East during 2017-2021. We used MaxEnt to predict habitat suitability for water deer and applied Circuitscape to determine possible dispersal routes for the species. We used seven environmental variables, viz., altitude, slope, aspect, distance to built-up area, distance to water source, distance to cropland and distance to roads for habitat suitability prediction. We chose the MaxEnt model (AICc = 2572.86) suitable for our data with the AUC value result of 0.935±0.014. There is good quality habitat for water deer in the boundary area of the Yalu and Tumen River estuaries between China, North Korea, and the Russian Far East, as well as the east and west regions of the Korean Peninsula. We identified three main suitable habitat patches, two of them located in east (NK2) and west (NK3) North Korea, and one in the newly colonized area downstream of the Tumen River along the border of China, Russia, and North Korea (TM1). Elevation, distance to cropland and water sources, and presence of wetlands were the variables that positively contributed to modelling the suitable habitats. Two possible dispersal routes were determined using the circuit theory, one was across the area from North Korea to the downstream Tumen transboundary region (Route B), and the other was across North Korea to the boundary region in China and along the tiger national park in northern China (Route A). A series of protected areas in North Korea, China, and Russia may support the dispersal of water deer. From the study on water deer dispersal, we can understand the existing ecological network in northeast Asia, which will benefit the whole landscape and biodiversity conservation. However, there are many threats present, and there is need for continued monitoring inside and outside the protected areas. Information sharing with stakeholders and carrying out local communities awareness activities are important. The establishment of a Northeast Asia landscape conservation network would help establish monitoring and conservation planning at a broad scale, and this study provides an example of the need for such a network.

TI  - Bat boxes in urban non-native forests: a popular practice that should be reconsidered
PY  - 2017
AB  - Impact mitigation practices are currently one of the hottest topics in conservation and regarded as priorities worldwide. Forest bat populations are known to provide important ecosystem services such as pest control and bat boxes have become one of the most popular management options for counteracting the loss of roosts. However, bat boxes tend to be employed in non-native forests near highly humanized areas where human disturbance is higher. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the surrounding landscape composition affects bat box occupancy in urban non-native forests along the Mediterranean corridor in the Northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Two hundred wooden bat boxes were monitored in young non-native forests in the period 2004–2012. The influence of land cover on occupancy rate of bat boxes was analysed at the landscape level in a 5 km buffer around bat-box stations. In total, 1659 inspections were carried out, in which a 15 % occupancy rate was detected. Bat boxes hosted three different species (Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri). More than 70 % of the occupancy can be explained by habitat and spatial composition. The presence of urban areas around bat boxes tends to have a negative impact on bat occupation rates; by contrast, forest coverage has a positive effect, especially for the tree-dwelling bats. These patterns could be associated with the large number of available roosts in buildings, microhabitat or phylopatry. Thus, to increase success, we suggest that landscape composition should be considered when using bat boxes for conservation.

TI  - A conceptual model of ecological connectivity in the Shellharbour Local Government Area, New South Wales, Australia
PY  - 2008
AB  - The conservation of biological diversity in landscapes dominated by human use is emerging as an increasingly significant challenge, given the rate at which the Earth's remaining vegetation resources are being lost. Whilst traditional approaches to conservation have relied upon the ability of species to persist within the scattered fragments to which they have been confined, recent scientific evidence suggests that the long-term viability of fragmented populations may only be secured through the establishment of ecological connectivity between existing fragments. In the absence of a suitable methodology within which to design connective habitat configurations, a conceptual approach to landscape design was devised for a highly urbanised environment within the Shellharbour Local Government Area (LGA), New South Wales (NSW). This approach utilises beneficial landscape attributes advocated in the literature, and tailors existing rapid assessment methodologies traditionally used to provide simple measures of ecosystem health. Using this methodology, conservationally significant stepping-stone sites were identified between selected terminal habitat patches. The determination of an optimal corridor configuration linking these patches was found to heavily utilise riparian habitat and adjacent residential yard space. Planting endemic species in these areas will support ecological flow by increasing the area of core habitat relative to edge habitat. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The importance of past and present landscape for Japanese hares Lepus brachyurus along a rural-urban gradient
PY  - 2009
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of landscape on the distribution of Japanese hares Lepus brachyurus Temminck, 1845 hares along a rural-urban gradient. We surveyed the presence of hares in 62 forest patches in the Tama Hills, which spreads from forested mountains to the urban core, and found signs of hares in 23 patches. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch size, connectivity, and land cover of the surrounding area (forest, residential and few agricultural area) by logistic regression. To select the most appropriate spatial scale and time period, we conducted a variable selection for all com-binations of buffer size (250-, 500-, 1000- and 2000-m radius), and year (1974, 1984 and 1994). We calculated Akaike weight for the best model to measure the importance of each variable. The model for the best combination of buffer size and year was 500 m in 1994. We conclude that recent landscape determines the occurrence of hares. Forest patch size and percentage of forest cover were important variables in the best model. To protect the wild hare population in suburban areas, it is important to conserve areas of forest that have at least 500 m radius. These areas must be continuously maintained, as hares respond rapidly to changes in landscape.

TI  - A landscape analysis of land cover change in the Municipality of Rome (Italy): Spatio-temporal characteristics and ecological implications of land cover transitions from 1954 to 2001
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper presents a landscape analysis of land cover change in the Municipality of Rome from 1954 to 2001. The overall objective of the analysis is to characterise the temporal and spatial pattern of change and to explore its potential ecological impact. We used three original land cover layers and a set of landscape metrics to describe variations in composition and pattern of land cover types. We then built change trajectories for patches derived from the spatial intersection of land cover data. These trajectories were ecologically assessed using expert judgement and indicators of naturalness such as deviation from potential natural vegetation. The results revealed that approximately 62% of the study area maintained the same land cover type from 1954 to 2001 as a result of composition continuity at the patch level. Urbanisation was by far the most important change process and the main cause of fragmentation of agricultural land and loss of coastal habitats, which imply possible negative effects for biodiversity and ecological processes. However, the star-shaped pattern of urbanisation favoured natural vegetation dynamics, marked persistence of woodlands, and significant stability of agricultural land in peripheral areas, with positive effects in terms of ecological connectivity and vegetation recovery potential. Despite the general nature of land cover data, the spatially explicit ecological assessment of transitions provides a reference layer that can effectively address territorial policies towards urban sustainability and that helps stratification for areas requiring direct investigation of impacts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Coupling urban 3-D information and circuit theory to advance the development of urban ecological networks
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ongoing, rapid urban growth accompanied by habitat fragmentation and loss challenges biodiversity conservation and leads to decreases in ecosystem services. Application of the concept of ecological networks in the preservation and restoration of connections among isolated patches of natural areas is a powerful conservation strategy. However, previous approaches often failed to objectively consider the impacts of complex 3-D city environments on ecological niches. We used airborne lidar-derived information on the 3-D structure of the built environment and vegetation and detailed land use and cover data to characterize habitat quality, niche diversity, and human disturbance and to predict habitat connectivity among 38 identified habitat core areas (HCAs) in Nanjing, China. We used circuit theory and Linkage Mapper to create a landscape resistance layer, simulate habitat connectivity, and identify and prioritize important corridors. We mapped 64 links by using current flow centrality to evaluate each HCA's contribution and the links that facilitate intact connectivity. Values were highest for HCA links located in the west, south, and northeast of the study area, where natural forests with complex 3-D structures predominate. Two smaller HCA areas had high centrality scores relative to their extents, which means they could act as important stepping stones in connectivity planning. The mapped pinch-point regions had narrow and fragile links among the HCAs, suggesting they require special protection. The barriers with the highest impact scores were mainly located at the HCA connections to Purple Mountain and, based on these high scores, are more likely to indicate important locations that can be restored to improve potential connections. Our novel framework allowed us to sufficiently convey spatially explicit information to identify targets for habitat restoration and potential pathways for species movement and dispersal. Such information is critical for assessing existing or potential habitats and corridors and developing strategic plans to balance habitat conservation and other land uses based on scientifically informed connectivity planning and implementation. © 2021 Society for Conservation Biology

PY  - 2020
AB  - The Botanical Garden of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (JB-UFJF) comprises significant Atlantic Forest remnant in urban area of Juiz de Fora municipality. Aiming to know its flora, collections were carried biweekly in the 80 hectares of the JB-UFJF from 2011 to 2014. The collection is deposited in the Herbarium CESJ of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora. 436 species were found, distributed in 270 genera and 96 families. The richest families were Fabaceae (35 spp.), Melastomataceae (27 spp.), Rubiaceae (27 spp.), Solanaceae (21 spp.) and Asteraceae (21 spp.). The richest genera were Miconia (15 spp.), Piper (12 spp.), Psychotria (9 spp.) and Solanum (8 spp.). Six species found in the area are in some category of threat according to the Red List of the Brazilian Flora. The floristic composition showed to be similar to other surveys in the region both in the general flora and by strata, but also evidenced floristic regionalisms both locally and regionally. The high species richness and other particularities found reveal the importance of the area for conservation, highlighting its position as an ecological corridor in the Zona da Mata, in the context of the Ecological Corridor of Serra da Mantiqueira. © 2020 Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.

TI  - The influence of the loss of Brazilian savanna vegetation on the occurrence of stingless bees nests (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini)
PY  - 2014
AB  - The vegetation of the Cerrado, also known as the Brazilian savanna, is rapidly being replaced by agricultural and urban areas. The scope of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the reduction in savanna vegetation and the occurrence of nests of stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini), particularly those of the genus Melipona Illiger. We mapped 33 surveys of stingless bees nests located in Cerrado areas (25 sampled by us and 8 from literature) on Landsat images and assessed the proportions of vegetated, urban and rural areas within a radius of 3 km from each nest. We performed two-step cluster analyses separately for common and rare Meliponini species and Melipona species and assessed the proportion of vegetation in the resulting clusters. Common species such as Trigona spinipes Fabricius and Tetragonisca angustula Latreille were frequent in areas surrounded by vegetation as well as in degraded surround areas. Some species, such as Oxytrigona tataira Smith, occurred predominantly in degraded areas. Most Melipona species were uncommon or absent in the degraded areas. It is possible that isolated trees in rural landscapes provide functional connectivity for opportunistic species of stingless bees but not for susceptible species such as species of Melipona. This study is one of the first to attempt to understand the effects of the loss of Cerrado vegetation on the occurrence of stingless bees' nests.

TI  - Age and sex-dependent effects of landscape cover and trapping on the spatial genetic structure of the stone marten (Martes foina)
PY  - 2016
AB  - Maintenance of genetic variation is of critical importance for wild populations since low levels limit the species’ ability to respond to different threats (diseases, predators, environmental changes) in both the long and the short term. Human activities could impact the genetic variation of wild species in multiple ways, including via fragmentation and harvesting. We used an individual-based landscape genetics approach to describe the impact of landscape elements and trapping pressure on the spatial genetic structure of a large sample (n = 370) of the stone marten (Martes foina) in central-eastern France (Bresse). An analysis of isolation-by-resistance using a causal modeling approach showed an influence of landscape cover and/or trapping pressure on gene flow according to age and sex class. Overall, the connectivity in the study area is provided mainly by vegetation cover, while roads and open areas partially impede it. Unexpectedly for this “urban adapter” species, buildings could reduce gene flow. We also emphasized the sex-dependent effect of trapping on gene flow. Genetic differentiation in males was influenced by trapping pressure and landscape structure while only the latter influenced genetic differentiation in females. A stronger isolation by distance in males than in females suggested that at the scale of the study area, males are more exposed to trapping pressure, which reduces effective dispersal. Overall, the combination of both landscape and trapping costs might create an ‘ecological trap’ that could disrupt gene flow, leading to a north–south division in the study area.

TI  - Woody invasions of urban trails and the changing face of urban forests in the great plains, USA
PY  - 2011
AB  - Corridors such as roads and trails can facilitate invasions by non-native plant species. The open, disturbed habitat associated with corridors provides favorable growing conditions for many non-native plant species. Bike trails are a corridor system common to many urban areas that have not been studied for their potential role in plant invasions. We sampled five linear segments of urban forest along bike trails in Lincoln, Nebraska to assess the invasion of woody non-native species relative to corridors and to assess the composition of these urban forests. The most abundant plant species were generally native species, but five non-native species were also present: white mulberry (Morus alba), common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.) and elm (Ulmus spp.). The distribution of two of the woody species sampled, common buckthorn and honeysuckle, significantly decreased with increasing distance from a source patch of vegetation (P = 0.031 and 0.030). These linear habitats are being invaded by non-native tree and shrub species, which may change the structure of these urban forest corridors. If non-native woody plant species become abundant in the future, they may homogenize the plant community and reduce native biodiversity in these areas. © 2011 American Midland Naturalist.

TI  - Conserving herbivorous and predatory insects in urban green spaces
PY  - 2017
AB  - Insects are key components of urban ecological networks and are greatly impacted by anthropogenic activities. Yet, few studies have examined how insect functional groups respond to changes to urban vegetation associated with different management actions. We investigated the response of herbivorous and predatory heteropteran bugs to differences in vegetation structure and diversity in golf courses, gardens and parks. We assessed how the species richness of these groups varied amongst green space types, and the effect of vegetation volume and plant diversity on trophic-and species-specific occupancy. We found that golf courses sustain higher species richness of herbivores and predators than parks and gardens. At the trophic-and species-specific levels, herbivores and predators show strong positive responses to vegetation volume. The effect of plant diversity, however, is distinctly species-specific, with species showing both positive and negative responses. Our findings further suggest that high occupancy of bugs is obtained in green spaces with specific combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. The challenge for managers is to boost green space conservation value through actions promoting synergistic combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. Tackling this conservation challenge could provide enormous benefits for other elements of urban ecological networks and people that live in cities. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Do railway edges provide functional connectivity for plant communities in an urban context?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Functional connectivity is essential to maintaining biodiversity in fragmented landscapes but little attention has been given to structures that can provide it in an urban context. Using both the taxonomic and functional diversity of semi-natural grassland plant communities, we assessed the functional connectivity of linear transportation infrastructures in urban landscape. We sampled the vegetation at 71 study sites located along the edges of two railway lines. We hypothesised that if railways favour functional connectivity, then spatially connected communities should be more similar than disconnected communities. Therefore, we compared floristic dissimilarities between site pairs that were either connected or separated by a railway spatial break (overpass or station). As a further approach, we supposed that functional connectivity may attenuate the effect of urbanisation filters on plant communities. Thus we examined whether and how edges' plant communities were influenced by urbanisation and compared our results to the patterns described in the literature. Functional connectivity was mainly maintained at railway stations, contrary to overpasses, which seemed to interrupt dispersal, demonstrating that railway edges provide connectivity for some but not all functional groups: this was only true for moderately mobile species. Surprisingly, railway edges did not seem to play an additional connective function for invasive species, the presence of which being strongly related to the urbanisation intensity and not influenced by spatial breaks along railways. Our study thus highlights the potential function of railway edges as corridors for common grassland plants. Landscape managers should include railways in green networks to improve connectivity in urban landscapes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Moth species richness, abundance and diversity in fragmented urban woodlands: Implications for conservation and management strategies
PY  - 2014
AB  - Urban expansion threatens global biodiversity through the destruction of natural and semi-natural habitats and increased levels of disturbance. Whilst woodlands in urban areas may reduce the impact of urbanisation on biodiversity, they are often subject to under or over-management and consist of small, fragmented patches which may be isolated. Effective management strategies for urban woodland require an understanding of the ecology and habitat requirements of all relevant taxa. Yet, little is known of how invertebrate, and in particular moth, assemblages utilise urban woodland despite being commonly found within the urban landscape. Here we show that the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of moth assemblages found within urban woodlands are determined by woodland vegetation character, patch configuration and the surrounding landscape. In general, mature broadleaved woodlands supported the highest abundance and diversity of moths. Large compact woodlands with proportionally less edge exposed to the surrounding matrix were associated with higher moth abundance than small complex woodlands. Woodland vegetation characteristics were more important than the surrounding landscape, suggesting that management at a local scale to ensure provision of good quality habitat may be relatively more important for moth populations than improving habitat connectivity across the urban matrix. Our results show that the planting of broadleaved woodlands, retaining mature trees and minimising woodland fragmentation will be beneficial for moth assemblages. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - The 'habitat backbone' as strategy to conserve pioneer species in dynamic port habitats: Lessons from the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) in the Port of Antwerp (Belgium)
PY  - 2008
AB  - Biodiversity conservation in economic areas like ports has recently become more important in the European Union due to a stricter interpretation of nature protection laws. In this study we develop a planning and design strategy-the 'habitat backbone'-with which to support the long-term survival of pioneer species that occur in ports and have low dispersal abilities. For those species, long-term survival in port areas is uncertain because supply of their habitats (on vacant lots) is capricious and depends on land use dynamics. By gaining knowledge about spatial and temporal characteristics of these dynamics we were able to develop a solution to conserve such species. Our solution is based on the creation of permanent habitat-defined as a 'backbone'-on (semi-) public land with an overall carrying capacity sufficient to support persistent populations. This best ensures long-term survival, and the backbone may also act as refugium. Satellite populations that emerge on adjacent vacant lots will thereby add to the persistence of the overall metapopulation. Management of permanent habitat is focused on retaining early-successional stages of vegetation. Implementing this strategy in the case of the natterjack toad in the Port of Antwerp taught us that realization of a habitat backbone is possible only if landowners, local governments and environmental NGOs cooperate. In the case at hand, such cooperation resulted in a plan that should ensure a coherent and persistent habitat network in which a chorus of some 1,400 natterjack toads could be accommodated-more than the number of toads currently observed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Avifaunal use of wooded streets in an urban landscape
PY  - 2000
AB  - Birds in urban landscapes primarily occupy parks (forest fragments), wooded streets (linear strips connecting fragments), or the urban matrix. I studied the effects of street location in the landscape, vegetation structure, and human disturbance (pedestrian and automobile load) within wooded streets on bird species richness, temporal persistence, and density of feeding and nesting guilds, and on the probability of street occupation by individual species in Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons. The number of species recorded increased from the least suitable (control streets without vegetation) to the most suitable habitats (urban parks), with wooded streets being intermediate landscape elements. Fourteen species, belonging to four of the eight guilds identified in this system, were recorded in wooded streets in both years. Streets that connected urban parks, along with vegetation structure, positively influenced the number of species within wooded streets, species persistence, guild density, and probability of occupation of streets by individual species. Human disturbance exerted a negative influence on the same variables. Wooded streets potentially could function as corridors, allowing certain species - particularly those feeding on the ground and breeding in trees or tree holes - to fare well by supporting alternative habitat for feeding and nesting. Local improvements in corridor quality, through increased vegetation complexity and reduced human disturbance, could exert a positive influence on the regional connectivity of the system. Because of differential use of corridors by species with different habitat requirements, however, corridor implementation should also take into account the target species of management.

TI  - Identification of habitat controls on northern red-legged frog populations: implications for habitat conservation on an urbanizing landscape in the Pacific Northwest
PY  - 2017
AB  - Introduction: In the Pacific Northwest of North America, research addressing lentic-breeding amphibian population vulnerability has emphasized aquatic habitats, frequently neglecting terrestrial habitats. Consequently, wetland protection and restoration often fails to preserve or restore adjacent uplands required by lentic-breeding amphibians. Inattention to the juxtaposition and connectivity of uplands to wetlands could locally extirpate lentic-breeding amphibians. The objective of this research is to identify the relative importance of juxtaposed terrestrial and aquatic habitats in a lentic-breeding amphibian, the northern red-legged frog (Rana aurora), by evaluating the relationship between its occurrence and abundance with its aquatic and terrestrial habitats. To accomplish this, egg mass counts were used to quantify R. aurora populations in 30 stillwater habitats across an urbanization gradient. Using a Geographic Information System, seven descriptors of aquatic and surrounding terrestrial habitats were measured to evaluate their relationships to R. aurora occurrence and abundance. Results: Rana aurora occurrence and breeding abundance both reflect the forested area around wetland breeding sites and forest connectivity to those sites. Rana aurora breeding abundance also strongly reflects the percent of forested perimeter around wetland breeding sites. The forest habitat most important for R. aurora breeding abundance seems to be > 200 m from the breeding wetlands. The American bullfrog presence and the two aquatic parameters measured, wetland area and vegetated area, were unrelated to R. aurora occurrence and breeding abundance. Conclusions: Area and connectivity of juxtaposed forested terrestrial habitat may represent a basic control on R. aurora presence and population size. Urban development policies should consider preservation and restoration of upland forest habitats beyond current fixed-width buffers and wetland habitat area at landscape scales. © 2017, The Author(s).

TI  - Urban land development for biodiversity: suggested development and management guidelines for eco-estates using case studies from coastal KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
PY  - 2021
AB  - Anthropogenic land transformation, especially agriculture and urban development, are the leading causes of natural land cover loss and ultimate decline in environmental functionality and connectivity in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. However, recent developments in the form of housing estates with conservation and environmental management intentions (termed eco-estates) have increased. These eco-estates generally improve species and functional diversity in urban regions of coastal KwaZulu-Natal and improve connectivity for biodiversity between urban green spaces and existing natural landscapes. To provide the first comprehensive development and management guidelines for eco-estates, we reviewed and assessed research into the effects of eco-estate development on environmental functionality and connectivity using case studies from coastal KwaZulu-Natal. We suggest suitable regions for eco-estate establishment and provide detailed guidelines for eco-estate development, environmental rehabilitation and conservation, and eco-estate flora and fauna management. These guidelines will hopefully facilitate biodiversity conservation and improve current and future eco-estate management and, ultimately, the ecosystem health of coastal KwaZulu-Natal. They are applicable for eco-estate development and management in similar tropical and sub-tropical mixed land-use matrices. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Mapping artificial lightscapes for ecological studies
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary: Artificial illumination of the night is increasing globally. There is growing evidence of a range of ecological impacts of artificial light and awareness of light pollution as a significant environmental issue. In urban and suburban areas, complex spatial patterns of light sources, structures and vegetation create a highly heterogeneous night-time light environment for plants and animals. We developed a method for modelling the night-time light environment at a high spatial resolution in a small urban area for ecological studies. We used the position and height of street lights, and digital terrain and surface models, to predict the direct light intensity at different wavelengths at different heights above the ground surface. Validation against field measurements of night-time light showed that modelled light intensities in the visible and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum were accurate. We show how this model can be used to map biologically relevant lightscapes across an urban landscape. We also illustrate the utility of the model using night-time light maps as resistance surfaces in the software package circuitscape to predict potential movement of model nocturnal species between habitat patches and to identify key corridors and barriers to movement and dispersal. Understanding the ecological effects of artificial light requires knowledge of the light environment experienced by organisms throughout the diurnal and annual cycles, during periods of activity and rest and during different life stages. Our approach to high-resolution mapping of artificial lightscapes can be adapted to the sensitivity to light of different species and to other urban, suburban, rural and industrial landscapes. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Density-dependent habitat selection of corridors in a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2001
AB  - This paper assesses the occurrence of density-dependent habitat selection in an urban fragmented landscape, composed of forest fragments (urban parks) connected by corridors (wooded streets), to test the hypothesis that as population density increased in the parks their suitability decreased and individuals entered alternative habitats, such as wooded streets. Density variation of six species was studied during two consecutive breeding seasons. Vegetation structure in wooded streets was significantly less complex than in urban parks, supporting the view that wooded streets were less suitable for breeding birds. Five species (Coal Tit Parus ater, Spotless Starling Sturnus unicolor, Serin Serinus serinus, Black-billed Magpie Pica pica and Woodpigeon Columba palumbus) showed density-dependent habitat occupation of wooded streets, while the Common Blackbird Turdus merula did not. As park suitability decreased with rising densities, wooded streets became a profitable alternative in terms of foraging, breeding, or for moving between parks. However, the relationships varied both between and within species in different years. Such differences could have been caused by variable rates of human disturbance, renewal of resources and predation risks in wooded streets. More detailed studies are required to determine how birds perceive and regulate their population dynamics in fragments and associated corridors, particularly for species targeted for management.

TI  - Pocket parks in a compact city: How do birds respond to increasing residential density?
PY  - 2013
AB  - The desire to improve urban sustainability is motivating many city planners to adopt growth strategies that increase residential density, leading to substantial changes to urban landscapes. What effect this change will have on biodiversity remains unclear, but it is expected that the role of public greenspace in providing wildlife habitat will become critical. We explored the role of urban \"pocket parks\" as habitat for birds, and how this role changed with increasing residential density in the surrounding neighbourhood. We found that parks in neighbourhoods with high levels of public greenspace (corresponding to less residential land) supported more bird species and individuals overall, and more woodland-dependent species, insectivores and hollow-nesters. Total greenspace area was more important (included in the best ranked models for all bird responses) than the configuration (number, average size and connectivity) of greenspace patches. The majority of species were common suburban birds, indicating that species we assume are tolerant to urban areas will be negatively affected by increasing residential density. Parks form part of an interconnected network of urban open space. For parks to continue to support a diverse native bird community, the network must be viewed, managed, and maintained in its entirety. We suggest three key management actions to improve the bird diversity values of urban greenspaces in compact cities: (1) Increase urban greenspace cover in residential neighbourhoods. (2) Increase vegetation structure in greenspace. (3) Encourage homeowners to plant trees and shrubs. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - The value of green belts in urban sprawl: A case study OD Taichung City, Taiwan
PY  - 2017
AB  - The role of green belts is not only to provide the recreation for human activities but also to improve environmental quality and to provide refuges for wildlife under intensified urban development. After the new demarcation of administrative areas, the influx and construction of industrial zones and commercial buildings has caused a major change of the original landscape in the Dadu hill area in Taichung City, Taiwan. The aims of this study are to provide recommendations pertaining the design of ecological corridors to improve the connectivity of the remaining green places, and the assessment of the health of habitat for the developed urban area. We compared the biodiversity (birds, mammals, plantation) and carbon flux in three different suburban areas including a campus, a metropolitan park and an undeveloped woodland in regular disturbance by human and fire. According to the results of habitat similarity, the metropolitan park and campus were grouped with the higher diversity of birds, but the woodland had the higher diversity of plantation and mammals. Seasonal change is the main factor which affects the carbon flux and vegetation growth situation, and the disturbance by human activities and canopy and coverage by plantation are the causes of fluctuations. The habitat assessment which integrated the biodiversity and carbon flux provided another angle to evaluate the greenbelt design comprehensively. However, the quantification of the whole ecosystem service value is a further direction of environment management, especially in green place conserving under the urban sprawl. © Int. J. of GEOMATE.

TI  - Uncorrected land-use planning highlighted by flooding: The Alba case study (Piedmont, Italy)
PY  - 2012
AB  - Alba is a town of over 30 000 inhabitants located along the Tanaro River (Piedmont, northwestern Italy) and is famous for its wine and white truffles. Many important industries and companies are based in Alba, including the famous confectionery group Ferrero. The town suffered considerably from a flood that occurred on 5-6 November 1994. Forty-eight percent of the urban area was inundated, causing severe damage and killing nine people. After the flood, the Alba area was analysed in detail to determine the reasons for its vulnerability. Information on serious floods in this area since 1800 was gathered from official records, state technical office reports, unpublished documents in the municipal archives, and articles published in local and national newspapers. Maps, plans and aerial photographs (since 1954) were examined to reconstruct Alba's urban development over the last two centuries and the planform changes of the Tanaro River. The results were compared with the effects of the November 1994 flood, which was mapped from aerial photographs taken immediately after the flood, field surveys and eyewitness reports. The territory of Alba was subdivided into six categories: residential; public service; industrial, commercial and hotels; sports areas, utilities and standards (public gardens, parks, athletics grounds, private and public sport clubs); aggregate plants and dumps; and agriculture and riverine strip. The six categories were then grouped into three classes with different flooding-vulnerability levels according to various parameters. Using GIS, the three river corridors along the Tanaro identified by the Autorita di Bacino del Fiume Po were overlaid on the three classes to produce a final map of the risk areas. This study shows that the historic floods and their dynamics have not been duly considered in the land-use planning of Alba. The zones that were most heavily damaged in the 1994 flood were those that were frequently affected in the past and sites of more recent urbanisation. Despite recurrent severe flooding of the Tanaro River and its tributaries, areas along the riverbed and its paleochannels have been increasingly used for infrastructure and building (e.g., roads, a municipal dump, a prison, natural aggregate plants, a nomad camp), which has often interfered with the natural spread of the floodwaters. Since the 1994 flood, many remedial projects have been completed along the Tanaro and its tributaries, including levees, bank protection, concrete walls and floodway channels. In spite of these costly projects, some areas remain at high risk for flooding. The method used, which considered historical data, river corridors identified by hydraulic calculations, geomorphological aspects and land-use planning, can indicate with good accuracy flood-prone areas and in consequence to be an useful tool for the coherent planning of urban expansion and the mitigation of flood risk. © 2012 Author(s).

TI  - Effects of habitat structure, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity on urban forest bird communities
PY  - 2015
AB  - As urbanization accelerates, urban biodiversity conservation is becoming a great concern for the maintenance of urban ecosystem functions. In particular, forest bird communities in urban areas have been recognized as a conservation target because of their functions in food webs and ecosystem services. But our understanding of which local- and landscape-scale factors influence native bird communities within urban green spaces is still insufficient to provide managers with information for effectively planning biodiversity management programs. Here we examine how local habitat characteristics, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity influence the diversity of forest bird communities in 44 small forest patches (0.5–20.0 ha) embedded in an urbanized landscape. Patch size exerted a positive influence on the diversity of most bird functional groups, and it had the greatest effects on total abundance and species richness. The second most important factor was human disturbance. Remnant patches with lower levels of human disturbance had higher diversity than newly established patches where intense human activities occurred more frequently. In addition, vegetation complexity and habitat connectivity were positively related to total species richness and abundance, respectively, but they were less important. Management strategies for the conservation of urban forest birds, therefore, should consider not only local improvements in habitat structure – through increased patch size, reduced human disturbance, and increased vegetation complexity – but also the maintenance of habitat connectivity.

TI  - Aquatic diversity in a former floodplain: Remediation in an urban context
PY  - 2009
AB  - The Lobau, a former floodplain area of the Danube River situated within the city limits of Vienna (Austria), was strongly affected by the river regulation in 1875. The reduced hydrological connectivity led to an increasing loss of aquatic habitats. A water enhancement scheme with a maximum water input of 0.5 m3 s-1 was initiated in 2001. The present study assesses the effect of this scheme on biodiversity using three target species groups - aquatic molluscs, dragonflies and fish - following a common Before-After Control-Impact design (BACI). Dragonflies and molluscs were positively affected, reflecting the habitat alterations in the system. For fish, no significant impact was observed. The aim of the scheme has been achieved: increased habitat diversity and improved habitat conditions for the system's initial community and further rheophilic/rheotolerant species. Water enhancement schemes can be effective remediation measures and deserve further attention in the management of urban wetlands. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fragmentation and internal disturbance of native vegetation reserves in the Perth metropolitan area, Western Australia
PY  - 2004
AB  - Remnant vegetation in metropolitan areas tends to be highly fragmented and affected by disturbances from the urban environment. A rapid survey in 71 nature reserves in the metropolitan of Perth noted surrounding land uses, types of disturbances, rated the level of weeds, rubbish, formal and informal walking paths and fire influence, and estimated vegetation condition. These data were analysed against information on reserve area and shape, connectivity to other native vegetation, period of patch encapsulation, distance from the city centre and local population density to reveal patterns of fragmentation and disturbance in the metropolitan area. Smaller reserves occurred in the highly populated inner metropolitan area, and these reserves displayed high levels of fragmentation, higher levels of weed infestation and path density and low vegetation condition. Reserves were larger, with high levels of connectivity and with less weed cover and higher vegetation condition in the outer metropolitan area. The research highlighted that whilst reserve attributes are largely set in inner urban areas, planning is required in outer metropolitan areas to ensure patches remain well connected and of optimal size and shape. Inner metropolitan reserves should also be preserved and managed, as they are highly valuable for representing the vegetation types that once occurred there, and for providing natural areas for inner city residents. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The role of ecological networks in \"Environmental logic-identity forming\" design of urban regions, case study: Isfahan poladshahr urban region
PY  - 2016
AB  - Introduction: This study is dealt with the environmental planning from a bio-cybernetic and hierarchical systems viewpoint within the context of landscape ecology. This viewpoint requires not only knowledge of the science of ecology but also ecological wisdom in order to recognize the place of humankind in nature. The conceptual and practical approach which is provided will help landscape planners play a useful role in this process. The study looks at the concept of ecology in urban landscape of Poladshahr Newtown, Isfahan. The paper outlines some of the challenges associated with urban regions landscape development in order to achieve the following aims: (1) to apply a landscape ecology approach in conceptualizing a model of thought for urban region landscape development; and (2) to suggest strategies for the important role of networking in different levels of organizational orders in the process of designing urban region identity. The approach is based on ecological processes and mostly focuses on ecological principles which play a leading role in achieving sustainable urban region landscapes. It necessitates that any planning strategy, especially in large-scale urban region landscapes, should consider the concepts of implementing and designing complex ecological networks. In this context, multi-objective urban networks go beyond the ecological improvement of the urban region to address recreation, beautification, flood control, water quality and other infrastructures objectives. Applying the hierarchical view is suggested by the late systems philosophers to the levels of increasing coordination in interdisciplinarity to transdisciplinarity. It is regarded the latter as the highest stage of multi-level coordination towards a common purpose. Materials and methods: The research is to address the design of the ecological networks of Poladshahr Newtown urban region. This is in order to construct a foundation applying landscape ecology in the process of developing urban region landscapes. In this way, the conditions become suitable for conserving both the identity of the urban region as well as the environmental sustainability of the landscape. Because of the increasingly population growth and construction density, the landscape of Poladshahr Newtown possesses very little natural patches, and the corridors formed through urban development have very little effects on environmental quality of the landscape. This has resulted in a condition in which the green patches of the urban structure are few and also far apart and the connecting corridors do not have any significant ecological impact. Using the landscape ecology approach, and with the aim of leaning towards the sustainability of urban region's identity, a new approach becomes necessary to achieve the design of sustainable ecological networks of the urban region. While this approach offers the possibility of utilizing the hidden potentials of natural landscapes, it also advocates the principles of environmental sustainability; the interaction between urban region and natural landscape while remaining faithful to the issue of place identity within natural and manmade ecosystems. Poladshahr Newtown lies in the Tabas Plain, 38 km southwest of Isfahan and 5km northeast of Isfahan Steel Factory. It also lies alongside the Isfahan-Shahrekord highway. Poladshahr Newtown consists of two large central and northern areas, which have their own unique structure. The central area has a spiral form and the northern area has an ordered orthogonal geometry. The spatial order of the new town follows the spatial pattern of the region landscape, which has been combined with manmade and natural elements within the city to form the current urban structure. Poladshahr began its existence in 1963 as a new town and since 1984 it has become known as a \"Poladshar Newtown\". The current population is over 85000 and the total area is around 7700 hectares. The proximity of the city to the capital city of the province and its easy access to big industries of the region has made the town a very suitable place for urban dwelling. Poladshahr is the oldest new town in the last 50 years in Iran and because of its important features such as unique geographical location, proximity to important transit highways, neighboring to industrial areas and unique urban fabric; it has been considered as one of the most significant new towns in Iran (Naqhsh-eh-Jahan Pars Consultant Report 1387). The Panji and Ashtarjan mountain ranges in the west and south of the city and the farming plains of Lanjan in the east are among the natural features that limit the regional landscape of the new town. New foresting in the south in the foothills of the Ashtarjan mountain range are among other natural features which have created a valuable ecological zone with high natural significance within this part of the region. Actually when a development plan is proposed to construct an urban region landscape, it is expected that the mechanism of living processes is thoroughly questioned. Here, landscape is the total of abiotic and biotic phenomena and their interrelations in the three dimensional space on the earth surface. It can be recognized by its horizontal and vertical structure and its combination of the variation in attributes: atmosphere, rock, soil, water, vegetation, animals, and man. This holds for the material and organisms for their activities and artifacts. As a new trend in applying the principles of landscape ecology to urban region planning, the concepts of implementing and designing of the ecological networks and urban greenways are gaining increasing attention. Nowadays, with the ever-increasing expansion of cities, larger areas of natural landscapes fall into urban limits. Maintaining the biological attributes of natural landscapes and qualifying the ecological balances of urban landscapes needs to qualify both ecological processes of natural landscapes and environmental processes of urban landscape services. The answer of landscape planners to this demand is the design of proper landscape ecological networks. This will ensure that the ecological and environmental characteristics of urban landscapes will also have the necessary qualities for conditioning human interactions. Landscapes are increasingly urban in nature and ecologically and culturally sensitive to change at local through global scales. Therefore, multiple perspectives are required to understand urban landscapes and align ecological and society values to ensure the sustainable development of place landscapes. This study brings landscape ecology and place identity together to integrate both ecological and societal processes influencing urban region landscape development. This would enhance citizens quality of life and also direct the excellence process of social programming. The approach needs to identify the progressive cohesion and unified structural principles that are most deeply embedded in time-space dimensions of purposive and ultimate-programming bio-human systems. Such ecoenvironmental-societal principles govern the basic institutional orders in an urban region landscape. In this case, 'structure' is the mode in which the evolutionary urban landscape expresses itself in ultimate reproduction, and 'structural analysis' involves studying the conditions in which ideal bio-socio-spatial systems via the application of generative rules and resources are produced and reproduced in interaction. Results and discussion: Urban regions landscape planning process consists of changing the structure and function of total visual and spatial human space while preventing the breakdown, simplification and degeneration of green and open patches of the landscape. The design should be in such a way that the diversity of activities and the density of the built environment do not cause either the natural and open patches of the landscape to be segregated or the ecological networks of landscape circle of mater, energy and specie to be disturbed. In this context, the necessity to give value to the principles of landscape ecology in assessing the state of interconnections between natural and human processes is apparent. These principles focus on structures, functions and transformations of landscapes and attempt to find patterns and interactions between landscape elements, patches, corridors, and the matrix. These principles include the principles of ecological network to integrate ecology into sustainable land development. They necessitate the need to investigate the bio-human induced causes and effects of land-use and land-cover dynamics in directing social programming as well as planning for new landscapes. The necessary cybernetic forces act via the fluxes of energy and information. They depend on the measure of isolation and connection (connectivity) between the landscape attributes, and between the mosaic patches and their composing elements. Conclusion: The investigation of natural and manmade regional landscape of Poladshahr Newtown required some information. The information was obtained from Naghsh-e Jahan Pars Consultant Report (2008). This information is then observed through the regional elements of the model of urban region identity components. The Eco, Built and Human logics of the component model were used to observe the Pre-programmed-Purposive-Transcendental quality of the cycle of matter and energy in management of the Eco-Environmental-Societal function of the urban region landscape. According to the principal issues related to the urban region landscapes content composition and spatial configuration, some considerations were provided for the structural and functional improvement of Poladshahr Urban Region landscape system.

TI  - Vegetation attributes drive the taxonomic richness and functional composition of beetles and spiders in mountainous urban green spaces
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) enhance the quality of life in urban environments and serve as habitat corridors or refuge for organisms, including beetles and spiders. The attributes of UGS allow them to harbour species that offer essential ecosystem services. However, the ability of UGS to provide services is limited by the extent to which they have been altered anthropogenically. We described the taxonomic richness and functional composition of arthropods in a mountainous urban ecosystem of Ghana by focussing on the activity of both beetles and spiders at the family level. Two main land-use types (woodlands and built-up areas) were identified and characterised based on the presence or absence of certain vegetation attributes. Sixteen plots in each land-use type with sizes 20 × 20 m were demarcated and fitted with four pitfall traps in each plot to sample continuously for eight weeks, the activity density of both beetles and spiders. Samples were sorted into families and functional groups (detritivores, fungivores, herbivores and predators). The taxonomic richness and activity density were both significantly higher in the woodlands than in the built-up areas. Similarly, all functional groups showed a higher affinity to the woodlands than the built-up areas. Habitat attributes defined by plant diversity and structural complexity were the underlying drivers explaining the differences in arthropod communities between the land-use types. Though the built-up areas seem degraded and open, the remaining small vegetation patches still support the activities of some taxa that should merit the protection of such remnant vegetation in urban ecosystems. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Landscape-scale Remote Sensing and Classification of Lentic Habitats in a Tropical City
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ponds and lakes may be common in urban landscapes and frequently have high biodiversity and conservation value. The importance of landscape-scale conservation of lentic habitat networks has recently been recognised, yet little research has been conducted at this scale. Approaches to inventorying lentic habitats at the landscape-scale are needed to support science and conservation. This paper uses remote sensing to inventory lentic habitats across Greater Kuala Lumpur (GKL), Malaysia, characterising their distribution, abundance and type. Remote sensing images were employed to automatically identify and map the distribution of lentic habitats, capturing 1,013 individual ponds and lakes, which represent 74.3 % of the likely total. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), a multivariate hierarchical clustering method, was used to develop a typology using physical characteristics extracted from the imagery, yielding six distinct types. The diversity of habitat types was greater in peri-urban and suburban areas (Shannon’s H = 1.68) than in the urban core (Shannon’s H = 1.48), suggesting that urban structure influences the spatial pattern of lentic habitat diversity. Physicochemical and vegetation field data were collected from a sample of each type (n = 60). Comparisons of group membership in the typology produced from remote sensing and field data indicated demonstrable heterogeneity in local conditions within each type, and a lack of consistency between local and broader scale characteristics. Our work shows how inventories produced from remote sensing can provide insights into landscape-scale biodiversity drivers, and contribute to larger-scale conservation of lentic habitat networks. This approach can complement local studies to improve understanding of factors operating at different scales.

TI  - Landscape metrics to assess the ecological conditions of city regions: Application to Kwangju City, South Korea
PY  - 2005
AB  - Urbanisation can cause severe environmental problems and threaten biodiversity by habitat destruction, fragmentation and degradation. This is particularly the case in fast-growing South Korean city regions. While nature conservation policies were recently adopted that require the creation of habitat corridors, there is a lack of ecological information and tools for effective biodiversity conservation planning. This research has developed and customised an approach that combined landscape character assessment with four landscape ecological metrics to provide quantitative information on the ecological conditions for biodiversity conservation planning at the city regional level. The metrics used in this study were landscape heterogeneity, patch shape, patch distance and patch context. These indices were simple to use and required land cover data that were recorded from aerial photography and a digital topographic map. The metrics indicated the highest species richness, highest potential for species dispersal and highest ecological stability for the mountain landscape, followed by the urban fringe, agricultural land and the urban area. The results suggest that the landscape ecological metrics provide a useful tool that could play an important role in supporting spatial planning for biodiversity conservation. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Changes in diversity and composition of flora along a corridor of different land uses in Karachi over 20 years: Causes and implications
PY  - 2016
AB  - Karachi Metropolitan Corporation has been extensively planting few species along the streets over the last few decades. However, the suitability of the species was not properly studied before planting them in Karachi. This is evident from the fact that many species were profusely planted in Karachi during different decades, which were later removed for various reasons. For instance, Eucalyptus was extensively planted during 1980s and 1990s along the streets in Karachi, which was later removed due to their fast growing roots and shoots that damaged many civic services. Therefore, the current study investigates (i) the changes in taxonomic diversity and the composition of the species growing along a major roadway of different land uses in Karachi, (ii) causes and implications due to the changes in their diversity and composition. This study reveals that monoculture plantings were commonly practiced in Karachi. Currently, Conocarpus erectus is the most frequent species, which alone has 83.55% individuals on the street under study. Earlier, the same street was extensively planted with Eucalyptus and Guaiacum officinale. In 1993, the street under study was represented by 32.04% native plants and 67.96% exotic plants from 67 different species. Currently, the same street is represented by 53 species. The target-based 10:20:30 heuristic guidelines and non-target based Shannon and Inverse Simpson Diversity indices have been applied to analyze the flora of the street. Inverse Species Diversity index of the plants along the corridor has declined substantially from 8.75 to 1.41 over the last two decades that shows an increase in monotonous landscaping along the street under study, which make them vulnerable to diseases and pests. The changes in species richness along different land uses have also been analyzed. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Ecological connectivity in agricultural green infrastructure: Suggested criteria for fine scale assessment and planning
PY  - 2021
AB  - In promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service capacity, landscape connectivity is considered a critical feature to counteract the negative effects of fragmentation. Under a Green Infrastructure (GI) perspective, this is especially true in rural and peri-urban areas where a high degree of connectivity may be associated with the enhancement of agriculture multifunctionality and sustainability. With respect to GI planning and connectivity assessment, the role of dispersal traits of tree species is gaining increasing attention. However, little evidence is available on how to select plant species to be primarily favored, as well as on the role of landscape heterogeneity and habitat quality in driving the dispersal success. The present work is aimed at suggesting a methodological approach for addressing these knowledge gaps, at fine scales and for peri-urban agricultural landscapes, by means of a case study in the Metropolitan City of Rome. The study area was stratified into Environmental Units, each supporting a unique type of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV), and a multi-step procedure was designed for setting priorities aimed at enhancing connectivity. First, GI components were defined based on the selection of the target species to be supported, on a fine scale land cover mapping and on the assessment of land cover type naturalness. Second, the study area was characterized by a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) and connectivity was assessed by Number of Components (NC) and functional connectivity metrics. Third, conservation and restoration measures have been prioritized and statistically validated. Notwithstanding the recognized limits, the approach proved to be functional in the considered context and at the adopted level of detail. Therefore, it could give useful methodological hints for the requalification of transitional urban–rural areas and for the achievement of related sustainable development goals in metropolitan regions.

TI  - Using ecological theory to guide urban planting design: An adaptation strategy for climate change
PY  - 2011
AB  - Global climate change threatens the structure and function of ecological communities in urban areas, including public and private gardens. An adaptation strategy was developed to accommodate the challenges of urban greenspace design under a changing climate. The strategy offers a protocol for planting design that focuses on adding resilience to plantings rather than matching specific plant species to specific predictions of climate change. The adaptation strategy begins by rating locally appropriate plant species on ecological criteria for plasticity, functional redundancy, response diversity, and structural diversity. The plant palette is then developed within the confines set by ecological value and aesthetic goals, plus cultural and financial considerations. Collective application of the strategy at smaller scales across the urban landscape has the potential to protect and expand nature corridors that are resilient to climate change and to provide a low cost version of assisted migration. Examples of how to apply the adaptation strategy demonstrate that the approach is not specific to place or scale, and does not require extensive training or bring added expense. The benefits and manageable challenges of the strategy are discussed in relation to biodiversity conservation, social impact, the opportunity for \"designed\" experiments that examine urban ecosystem processes, and existing model forecasts for climate change. © 2011 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

TI  - Construction and Optimization of the Ecological Security Pattern of Xishuangbanna Based on Fragmentation Index
PY  - 2022
AB  - Tropical forests are considered the most abundant source of biodiversity in the terrestrial ecosystem and the key to international biodiversity conservation. Due to the rapid process of urbanization and land conflicts, regional ecological security is under tremendous pressure, resulting in biological habitat destruction, ecosystem service degradation, biodiversity reduction, etc. Consequently, the construction and optimization of ecological security patterns can improve ecological environment stability, restore ecological function, and protect biodiversity, which is an important spatial way to solve regional ecological environment problems and improve regional ecological security. In this study of Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province of China, ecological sources were obtained through ecological system service and ecological sensitivity comprehensive superposition, followed by ecological source extraction through hot spot analysis. The resistance coefficient was modified on the basis of the land cover type through landscape fragmentation comprehensive index construction, and Linkage Mapper calculation was performed to calculate ecological corridors and nodes with the ArcGIS cost-distance analysis module to construct and optimize the ecological security pattern in the Xishuangbanna area. The main results are as follows: (1) Twenty important ecological source areas were extracted from the Xishuangbanna area, covering a total of 7, 709.56 km2 and accounting for 40.33% of the study area. The coincidence rate with the existing nature reserves is 89.92%, which is mainly distributed in natural reserve areas, such as the northern part of Jinghong City, Central and southern parts of Mengla County, and the southern part of Menghai County. (2) Compared with the resistance surface corrected by night light data, the spatial differentiation of the landscape resistance surface corrected on the basis of landscape fragmentation is more significant. Among this, the identification of ecological corridors, the spatial distribution of the corridors, the reduction of conflict points of human activities, network connections, and optimal corridor verification delivered relatively better results. (3) The ecological corridor, which includes the key corridor and the potential corridor of 278.59 km and 631.73 km, respectively, shows a spatial pattern combined with the half ring and the small rings. Moreover, the ecological nodes include 20 resource strategic points, four ecological strategic points, 27 ecological temporary rest points, and 24 ecological fracture points. (4) By referring to the ecological security patterns of Xishuangbanna area, the layout of the ecological spatial structure was optimized as \"one belt, one corridor, and four groups. \" \"One belt\" was the ecological river corridor belt with the Lancang River as the main axis and the tributaries on both sides. \"One corridor\" refers to the central corridor structure connecting the national nature reserves of Mengyang, Naban River, and the Mangao Nature Reserve. Based on the existing nature reserves, the four groups were divided into the Bulong-Mangao nature reserves, Menglun three sub-reserves, Mengla-Yiwu-Mengyang-Menglun nature reserves, and Mengla-Shangyong nature reserves. This study provides a practical case for formulating ecological and environmental protection in Xishuangbanna. © 2022 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The winter bird community of river corridors in eastern England in relation to habitat variables
PY  - 2006
AB  - Most river corridors have been highly modified and managed but they still support diverse assemblages of birds. To aid conservation it is important to know which river corridor habitats support the greatest diversity and numbers of bird species. All birds were counted on three occasions in winter along 50 one km stretches of lowland rivers in eastern England, and habitat variables were recorded. A total of 81 species was recorded. Species richness was greatest on tidal stretches of river, followed by urban/amenity sites, with lowest richness on rural stretches. Mute Swans, Mallards and Moorhens were significantly more numerous at urban/amenity stretches and were scarce or absent in headwater reaches. Three terrestrial species also occurred in significantly greater numbers in urban/amenity stretches. No species was significantly more numerous in rural stretches. TWINSPAN analysis separated out tidal and urban/amenity stretches, while bird species were separated into those associated with riparian trees and shrubs, and those of more open stretches, with further groups associated with wider rivers and the tidal stretches. A CANOCO analysis showed river width to be the most significant factor explaining bird distributions, followed by presence of floodbanks, riparian tree cover and amount of thick marginal vegetation. The rivers studied and their immediate floodplains have long been managed and modified from source and this has an overriding influence on habitat quality and on the species richness and numbers of birds utilizing any particular stretch.

TI  - Scenario Analysis for Resilient Urban Green Infrastructure
PY  - 2022
AB  - With the advancement of urbanization, the stress on the green infrastructure around the urban agglomeration has intensified, which causes severe ecological problems. The uncertainty of urban growth makes it difficult to achieve effective protection only by setting protection red lines and other rigid measures. It is of practical significance to optimize the resilience of the stressed green infrastructure. To this end, we explore a scenario simulation analysis method for the resilience management of green infrastructure under stress. This research applies artificial neural network cellular automata to simulate the impacts of the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration expansion on the green infrastructure in 2030 in three scenarios: no planning control, urban planning control, and ecological protection planning control. Based on the analysis, we identify four green infrastructure areas under stress and formulate resilience management measures, respectively. The results show that: (1) The distribution pattern of green infrastructure under stress is different in three scenarios. Even in the scenario of ecological protection planning and control, urban growth can easily break through the ecological protection boundary; (2) Residential, industrial, and traffic facility land are the main types of urban land causing green infrastructure stress, while forest, shrub, and wetland are the main types of the stressed green infrastructure; (3) Efficient protection of green infrastructure and the management of the urban growth boundary should be promoted by resilient management measures such as urban planning adjustment, regulatory detailed planning, development strength control and setting up the ecological protection facilities for the stressed green infrastructure areas of the planning scenarios and the no-planning control scenarios, for the areas to be occupied by urban land, and for the important ecological corridors. The results of this study provide an empirical foundation for formulating policies and the methods of this study can be applied to urban ecological planning and green infrastructure management practice in other areas as well. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - The importance of stormwater ponds for amphibians in the city of Miinster (North Rhine-Westphalia)
PY  - 2018
AB  - The aim of this study in the city of Miinster was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for amphibians. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian species richness of 46 stormwater ponds (SP) in comparison to 46 control ponds (CP). Our study revealed that environmental conditions clearly varied between SP and CP. The most pronounced differences were that SP were larger, shallower, sunnier, more isolated by streets and had a greater cover of built-up area and lower cover of arable land surrounding them. Nevertheless, the amphibian assemblages of SP and CP were very similar. All nine amphibian species (including three threatened species) detected in this study were found in both pond types. Moreover, species richness (2.8 ± 0.2 vs. 2.3 ± 0.2) and the frequency of each species did not differ between SP and CP. The only exception was Pelophylax spp., which occurred more regularly in SP. Both habitat and landscape quality affected amphibian species richness; however, the explanatory power of the habitat models was about twice as high as those of the landscape models. In conclusion, stormwater ponds play an important role for amphibians in urban areas. In comparison to CP, the low landscape quality in the surroundings of SP seemed to be compensated by a higher habitat quality due to regular management. © 2018 Laurenti Verlag. All rights reserved.

TI  - Factors affecting wildlife-vehicle collision on the expressway in a suburban area in northern Poland
PY  - 2018
AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) pose a serious socio-economic and traffic safety issue. We investigated factors affecting the location and number of WVC on the expressway \"Tri-City Bypass\" in a suburban area in N Poland. We analysed WVC with large-sized (LSM; ungulates; 54% of roadkills) and small-sized mammals (SSM; mainly carnivores; 46% of roadkills) and both groups combined (AM). We identified WVC hotspots and analysed factors affecting their spatial distribution with Poisson regression based on four sets of landscape and road-related features (area, patchiness, presence and other features). The most frequent mammal victims of WVCs were wild boar Sus scrofa (31%), roe deer Capreolus capreolus (21%) and European badger Meles meles (13%), among LSM, and red fox Vulpes vulpes (27%) among SSM. In general, our results indicated that most WVCs occurred in areas with a higher number of forest patches and a higher total length of forest edge (AM, LSM), in curvy sections of the road (LSM). The number of WVCs was lower in locations covered by urbanized areas and grassland (LSM), in the sections with fences, exits and overpasses (LSM, AM). The road sections where there is a higher risk of severe collisions (involving large species) are situated in areas where the Tri-City Bypass bisects a highly forested area, which serve as movement corridors for LSM between fragmented forest complexes. We conclude that the number of WVCs can be reduced by preventing animals from accessing the road and ensuring a safe road crossing. This could be achieved by extending fencing and retrofitting some existing underpasses. © 2018, NWJZ, Oradea, Romania.

TI  - Physical and financial barriers to implementing a nature reserve network in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA
PY  - 2007
AB  - To understand the potential financial cost of acquiring lands within a proposed reserve network for the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, we used an assessors GIS database to estimate the acquisition cost in one county within the network to be US$ 2.5 billion. When only larger parcels were selected for the reserve network, the cost of the network decreased exponentially as the size-threshold for parcel selection increased, while the total area of the network decreased only linearly. Although acquiring only larger parcels may make sense financially, it does not result in adequate habitat representation because the spatial distribution of parcels is such that the lower elevation oak woodland and mid-elevation conifer forests tend to be on smaller parcels, which fall below the larger size thresholds and the resulting potential reserve areas are fragmented. Then, for the area surrounding the two major highways that cross the Sierra Nevada, we identified seventeen road barrier areas and six urban conflict areas that pose major, but possibly mitigable barriers to wildlife movement at different time scales. We propose that (1) wildlife conflicts with highway traffic could be feasibly mitigated by installing wildlife overcrossings at the identified locations and (2) constraints on development rather than land acquisition are necessary to protect biodiversity. Finally, we suggest that a combination of highway crossings and restrictions on land-use may be the cheapest way to protect biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effect of catchment urbanization on ant diversity in remnant riparian corridors
PY  - 2013
AB  - The conversion of rural land to residential use is occurring rapidly as the global trend of city expansion continues. The impact of this land use change on riparian biodiversity was investigated by examining ant communities from 12 remnant riparian corridors in northwest Sydney, Australia. Ants were sampled from rural and urban catchments using pitfall traps. Data on vegetation floristics, habitat structure and stream water quality were also collected. No significant differences in ant diversity metrics or assemblage structure were found between urban and rural sites. Similarly, very few environmental variables revealed significant differences between land use types. One exception, however, was the percentage cover of exotic plants, which was related to ant assemblage structure. Small-leaved and broad-leaved privet (Ligustrum spp.) were highly correlated with total weed cover. The results suggest that ants respond mostly to small-scale habitat characteristics, especially those related to the dominance of exotic plants. As all sites had experienced some level of human impact, it is possible that all the sites have already transgressed an ecological threshold due to the earlier catchment land use change from natural to agricultural use. This apparent sensitivity may explain the failure to observe any significant differences between the urban and rural catchments examined in this study. It is recommended that managers looking to protect the integrity of riparian invertebrate communities should focus on addressing local habitat pressures in human-modified catchments. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Characterisation of invasive plant proliferation within remnant riparian green corridors in Lusaka District of Zambia using Sentinel-2 imagery
PY  - 2019
AB  - Natural riparian corridors can serve as biodiversity reservoirs in urban environments. Despite the many opportunities that riparian corridors present for biodiversity conservation within urban environments, they may present conservation challenges by providing a thriving hub for local and alien invasive plants. The aim of the study was to map and characterise the occurrence of local and alien invasive plants along the natural green riparian corridors in Lusaka district of Zambia. A combination of field surveys and remote sensing approaches using Sentinel-2 imagery were employed to conduct the vegetation mapping and characterise the invasive plant proliferation. Five local and nine alien invasive plant species were identified within the natural green riparian corridors at 23 field survey sites. A total of 108 plant species were recorded in the study area out of which 57 were grasses of the Poacea family, five were local invasive and nine were alien invasive plant species. Six of the invasive plant species were mapped using Sentinel-2 data. The study showed that 47.35% of areal extent of the natural green riparian corridors in Lusaka had invasive and alien plant presence. Invasive and alien plant richness was determined to affect non-invasive plant richness and diversity. There was no linear association between poverty and percentage cover of invasive plant species but percentage cover of invasive plants seemed to be concentrated around wards with a poverty headcount around 0.15. The outcomes of this research are relevant for the management of invasive species within natural green corridors in urban areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Title: Ecological relevance of least cost path analysis: An easy implementation method for landscape urban planning
PY  - 2019
AB  - Landscape connectivity promotes dispersal and other types of movement, including foraging activity; consequently, the inclusion of connectivity concept is a priority in conservation and landscape planning in response to fragmentation. Urban planners expect the scientific community to provide them with an easy, but scientifically rigorous, method to identify highly connecting contexts in landscapes. The least-cost paths (LCP) method is one of the simplest resistance-based models that could be a good candidate to spatially identify areas where movement is potentially favored in a given landscape. We tested the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts facilitating individual movements compared to those performed in un-connecting landscape contexts. We used a landscape-level behavioral experiment based on a translocation protocol and individual repeated measures. In the city of Rennes (France), 30 male hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were translocated and radio-tracked in both highly connecting and un-connecting contexts, respectively, which were determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. Individual movement patterns were compared between the two predicted contexts. Individuals travelled longer distances, moved faster, and were more active in the highly connecting contexts compared to the un-connecting contexts. Moreover, in highly connecting contexts, hedgehog movement followed LCP orientation, with individuals using more wooded habitats than other land cover class. By using a rigorous experimental design, this study validated the ecological relevance of LCP analysis to identify highly connecting areas, and could be easily implemented by urban landscape planners. © 2019

TI  - Spatial patterns of DOC concentration and DOM optical properties in a Brazilian tropical river-wetland system
PY  - 2017
AB  - The Cerrado (savanna) and Pantanal (wetland) biomes of Central Western Brazil have experienced significant development activity in recent decades, including extensive land cover conversion from natural ecosystems to agriculture and urban expansion. The Cuiabá River transects the Cerrado biome prior to inundating large areas of the Pantanal, creating one of the largest biodiversity hot spots in the world. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the optical absorbance and fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from 40 sampling locations spanning Cerrado and Pantanal biomes during wet and dry seasons. In the upper, more agricultural region of the basin, DOC concentrations were highest in the rainy season with more aromatic and humified DOM. In contrast, DOC concentrations and DOM optical properties were more uniform for the more urbanized middle region of the basin between wet and dry seasons, as well as across sample locations. In the lower region of the basin, wet season connectivity between the river and the Pantanal floodplain led to high DOC concentrations, a fourfold increase in humification index (HIX) (an indicator of DOM humification), and a 50% reduction in the spectral slope (SR). Basin-wide, wet season values for SR, HIX, and FI (fluorescence index) indicated an increasing representation of terrestrially derived DOM that was more humified. Parallel factor analysis identified two terrestrially derived components (C1 and C2) representing 77% of total fluorescing DOM (fDOM). A third, protein-like fDOM component increased markedly during the wet season within the more urban-impacted region. ©2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Does demolition improve biodiversity? Linking urban green space and socioeconomic characteristics to avian richness in a shrinking city
PY  - 2017
AB  - Anthropogenic change, specifically urbanization, has lasting impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Past work has linked green space variables and socioeconomic characteristics with biodiversity in urban areas. Shrinking cities present an interesting case for studying biodiversity because many of these places have implemented demolition policies to remove vacant buildings from the landscape, which returns previously urbanized land back into a “natural” state. The objective of this study is to investigate the multifaceted relationship among urban green space, socioeconomic characteristics, demolition activities, and avian species richness in the shrinking city of Buffalo, NY. We first establish a baseline understanding of how social and ecological factors are related to avian species richness through generalized linear models (GLM) and then incorporate a variable characterizing demolition to understand how the process of demolition may be impacting species richness relative to other factors. Second, since our analysis relies on “citizen science” data from eBird, we aim to better understand the factors driving eBird participation in Buffalo through zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models to test how social and ecological characteristics and demolition affect checklists submission across the city. Our findings suggested that demolition activities do not increase species richness in Buffalo, indicating these sites may not be returning to a natural state that is usable by birds. We also found that areas that have undergone considerable demolition may be a potential deterrent to eBird participation, and eBird users may create bias by sampling areas with greater green space connectivity, and thus higher richness.

TI  - Roads limit of seed dispersal and seedling recruitment of Quercus chenii in an urban hillside forest
PY  - 2018
AB  - Paved roads in urban forests cause forest fragmentation and thus reduce animal populations, threaten dispersal and recruitment of animal-dispersed plants. Here, we tracked animal-mediated seed dispersal of Quercus chenii in the urban forest centre and near roadsides to test the effect of paved roads on seed dispersal and recruitment. We conducted experiments in a forest patch in urban areas of Wuhan, China. The forest was dominated by the focal tree species and separated by paved roads. Only two potential seed dispersal animals, one rodent (Niviventer confucianus) and one jay (Garrulus glandarius) were observed in this stand. Seeds were removed farther but not as fast in the forest centre compared to roadsides, while no differences of seed fate, dispersal direction, and seedling establishment were detected between the forest centre and roadsides, indicating the thick vegetation along roadsides provided feeding shelters for small animals. However, when compared with primary forests containing more seed dispersers, seed removal rate in this urban forest fragment was much slower in both forest centre and roadside. Furthermore, due to road barriers, seeds were seldom moved across the paved road and remained in the fragmented stand, reflecting a limited function of seed dispersers. These results suggested paved roads isolated forests into small “islands” and weakened the ecological function of seed dispersers by impeding long distance seed dispersal. Reintroducing dispersers and building wildlife corridors would be impactful ways to restore urban forest patches. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Human-altered and human-transported (HAHT) soils in the U.S. soil classification system
PY  - 2018
AB  - Human-altered and human-transported (HAHT) soils are widespread across the globe and are concentrated near where people live and work. Although some of the HAHT soils are significant because they can be hazardous to human, animal, and plant health, most are not mapped or classified to the same extent as agricultural soils. The purpose of this article is to discuss the occurrence, types, and importance of HAHT soils and to document the historical and proposed classification of HAHT soils in Soil Taxonomy. There are two main forms of materials that define HAHT soils: human-altered soils formed in human-altered materials (HAM) from the soil surface to 50 cm (or to bedrock if shallower) or more and human-transported soils formed in human-transported materials (HTM) from the soil surface to 50 cm (or to bedrock if shallower) or more. The HAHT soils mainly occur in urban areas, transportation corridors, mined lands, landfills, filled shallow water, and agricultural areas on anthropogenic landforms. Hazards include danger from radioactivity, pollution, content of hazardous artifacts, or presence on unstable landforms that may fail during heavy rains or earthquakes. The HAHT soils are extensive, and their extent is growing. In the past, few HAHT soils were described or classified adequately because the U.S. Soil Taxonomy system was established for agricultural and other naturally occurring soils. However, HAHT soils are now being recognized and classified in many soil classification systems at very high levels. A new soil order is proposed for U.S. Soil Taxonomy that would include the most obvious profoundly and intentionally altered HAHT soils. A discussion and justification is given for an unofficial proposal. Input will be collected from international groups of scientists, and modifications of the unofficial proposal are expected. The long-term result of establishing a new soil order will be to enable proper classification, allocation, and mapping of HAHT soils worldwide. © 2018 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of potential resource availability provided by street trees in southeastern Brazil
PY  - 2020
AB  - Street trees provide several ecosystem services in urban areas, including food for fauna. Tree species richness, composition and the relative abundance of native vs. non-native species can affect the populations of pollinators and dispersers. This work aims to evaluate the potential availability of food resources provided by street trees, in space and time, considering different pollination and seed dispersal syndromes at Santo André city (Southeastern Brazil). The georeferenced data for all catalogued tree individuals in the Urban Macrozone constituted our sampling domain. The species were categorized according to its geographical origin, pollination and seed dispersal syndromes, flowering and fruiting season. We divided the study area into cells and calculated: number of individuals, species richness, species diversity; richness and diversity of potentially flowering and fruiting individuals in each season of the year. 38,379 trees were catalogued, representing 578 trees/km2, totalizing 230 species. Most individuals (73%) were non-native. The number of individuals, species richness and diversity varied spatially. The pollination syndrome with higher potential resources availability was melittophily (pollination by bees and wasps) has during spring whereas ornithochory (seed dispersal by birds) was the dispersal syndrome with higher potential resources availability which occurred in summer. Despite the dominance of exotic individuals, the most common syndromes are in accordance with what is expected for tropical Atlantic rainforest regions. However, some pollination and dispersal syndromes presented very low potential resource availability in different seasons and no availability in some regions. These results should be taken into account by stakeholders for a better planning of planting efforts, considering the distribution, in space and time, of the potential availability of resources provided by street trees to fauna in order to improve connectivity. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Determinants of extinction in fragmented plant populations: Crepis sancta (asteraceae) in urban environments
PY  - 2012
AB  - Local populations are subject to recurrent extinctions, and small populations are particularly prone to extinction. Both demographic (stochasticity and the Allee effect) and genetic factors (drift load and inbreeding depression) potentially affect extinction. In fragmented populations, regular dispersal may boost population sizes (demographic rescue effect) or/and reduce the local inbreeding level and genetic drift (genetic rescue effect), which can affect extinction risks. We studied extinction processes in highly fragmented populations of the common species Crepis sancta (Asteraceae) in urban habitats exhibiting a rapid turnover of patches. A four-year demographic monitoring survey and microsatellite genotyping of individuals allowed us to study the determinants of extinction. We documented a low genetic structure and an absence of inbreeding (estimated by multilocus heterozygosity), which suggest that genetic factors were not a major cause of patch extinction. On the contrary, local population size was the main factor in extinction, whereas connectivity was shown to decrease patch extinction, which we interpreted as a demographic rescue effect that was likely due to better pollination services for reproduction. This coupling of demographic and genetic tools highlighted the importance of dispersal in local patch extinctions of small fragmented populations connected by gene flow. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Landscape genetics of the Alpine newt (Mesotriton alpestris) inferred from a strip-based approach
PY  - 2011
AB  - Habitat destruction and fragmentation are known to strongly affect dispersal by altering the quality of the environment between populations. As a consequence, lower landscape connectivity is expected to enhance extinction risks through a decrease in gene flow and the resulting negative effects of genetic drift, accumulation of deleterious mutations and inbreeding depression. Such phenomena are particularly harmful for amphibian species, characterized by disjunct breeding habitats. The dispersal behaviour of amphibians being poorly understood, it is crucial to develop new tools, allowing us to determine the influence of landscape connectivity on the persistence of populations. In this study, we developed a new landscape genetics approach that aims at identifying land-uses affecting genetic differentiation, without a priori assumptions about associated ecological costs. We surveyed genetic variation at seven microsatellite loci for 19 Alpine newt (Mesotriton alpestris) populations in western Switzerland. Using strips of varying widths that define a dispersal corridor between pairs of populations, we were able to identify land-uses that act as dispersal barriers (i.e. urban areas) and corridors (i.e. forests). Our results suggest that habitat destruction and landscape fragmentation might in the near future affect common species such as M. alpestris. In addition, by identifying relevant landscape variables influencing population structure without unrealistic assumptions about dispersal, our method offers a simple and flexible tool of investigation as an alternative to least-cost models and other approaches. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Biodiversity losses and conservation trade-offs: Assessing future urban growth scenarios for a North American trade corridor
PY  - 2013
AB  - The Sonoran Desert and Apache Highlands ecoregions of North America are areas of exceptionally high plant and vertebrate biodiversity. However, much of the vertebrate biodiversity is supported by only a few vegetation types with limited distributions, some of which are increasingly threatened by changing land uses. We assessed the impacts of two future urban growth scenarios on biodiversity in a binational watershed in Arizona, USA and Sonora, Mexico. We quantified and mapped terrestrial vertebrate species richness using Wildlife Habitat Relation models and validated the results with data from National Park Service (NPS) biological inventories. Future urban growth, based on historical trends, was projected to the year 2050 for (1) a Current Trends (CT) scenario and (2) a Megalopolis (MEGA) scenario that represented a transnational growth corridor with open-space conservation attributes. Based on CT, 45% of existing riparian woodland (267 of 451species) and 34% of semi-desert grasslands (215 of 451 species) will be lost, whereas in the MEGA scenario, these types would decline by 44% and 24%, respectively. Outcomes of the two models suggest a trade-off at the taxonomic class level: CT would reduce and fragment mammal and herpetofauna habitat, while MEGA would result in loss of avian-rich riparian habitat. © 2013 Copyright This work was authored as part of the Contributors official duties as Employees of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

TI  - Potential habitat connectivity for Malayan gaur (Bos gaurus) in a fragmented forest area in Peninsular Malaysia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aim: To predict the distribution of suitable habitats for Malayan gaur (Bos gaurus) at a highly fragmented forest area in Peninsular Malaysia and to identify the potential connectivity between suitable habitat patches. Methodology: Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitats of the Malayan gaur. Gaur presence-only data and six environmental variables were collated for the habitat suitability modeling, and area under curve (AUC) value was used to estimate the performance of the model. The resulting model was then used to derive a potential connectivity map through least-cost analysis using Corridor Designer toolbox in ArcGIS 10.4. Result: The AUC value of the habitat suitability model was 0.84. Distance from urban areas indicated the highest relative contribution to the model (26.9%), followed by distance from water body (24.2%) land use (18.0%) elevation (14.3%), slope (14.0%) and lithology (2.6%). Predicted suitable habitats for gaur were found mostly in lowland forest areas, especially in the vicinity of rivers within forest reserves. A total of five wildland blocks were derived from the habitat suitability model, and several potential corridor swaths were identified connecting the wildland blocks. Interpretation: The absence of gaur occurrence in suitable habitats suggest that fragmented habitats greatly affected gaur distribution and population. Road network and agricultural lands are the major barriers of gaur movement as they are very sensitive towards disturbances and conflict. Thus, this research proposes potential connectivity at a regional scale for Malayan gaur for use in future planning inconservation, management and development. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)

TI  - Response of earthworm communities to soil engineering and soil isolation in urban landscapes
PY  - 2021
AB  - Engineered soils provide numerous ecosystem services in urban landscapes, such as water regulation and plant growth. They are constructed to optimize soil physicochemical properties but their biological properties are given little consideration. In particular, earthworm communities may be highly impacted by soil engineering processes and soil isolation caused by asphalted surfaces separating soils, and in particular roadside soils, from pseudo-natural soils. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate (i) the effects of soil engineering processes applied to construct roadside soils, and (ii) the effects of soil isolation from pseudo-natural soils by asphalted surfaces on earthworm communities. The study was conducted in an urban landscape in the suburbs of Paris, France. We sampled earthworms in roadside soils from two distinct soil engineering processes: basic engineering (BER) associated with shallow stripping depth and advanced engineering (AER) associated with deep stripping depth and organic amendment. Within each soil engineering process, two levels of soil isolation were defined depending on the asphalted surface separating roadside soils from pseudo-natural soils: light isolation (LI) in case of a narrow cycle path, and high isolation (HI) in case of a wide road. Soil engineering did not affect the total earthworm abundance whereas the total species richness was negatively impacted in comparison to nearby pseudo-natural soils. High soil isolation differently impacted earthworm communities depending on the engineering process. Regarding AER, earthworm abundance and species richness were significantly lower in HI than in LI while no differences were observed between BER-LI and BER-HI. Overall, engineering processes define the soil's ability to host earthworms, and soil isolation defines soil ability to be colonized from nearby environments. Considering the contribution of earthworms to the provision of ecosystem services, both soil engineering and soil isolation should be taken into account in urban projects to optimize their development in urban landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A simplified assessment of how tree allocation, wind environment, and shading affect human comfort
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urban areas encounter a common problem called the heat island effect. Public-space plantings and parks have become a crucial countermeasure for decreasing urban temperatures. In this study, field measurements were carried out in a subtropical park in the summer to investigate the effect of plantings on microclimate and the thermal environment of pedestrian areas. It was found that obstructions affected the wind field; although cold air enters parks, an overcrowding of plants resulted in temperature rises in downstream areas. Shading is a key to thermal comfort in both tropical and subtropical regions, and its effect is augmented by ventilation. Trees that are planted without proper planning can decrease wind movement, which in turn has a detrimental effect on thermal comfort, especially downwind. Wind corridors through urban parks can promote both shading and ventilation, improving thermal comfort, and should thus be considered when designing the layout and trimming of plantings. Data from both fixed- and mobile-type measurements were used to validate the feasibility of a computational fluid dynamics simulation model. It was observed that wind speed and shading are the two main variables that influence the human comfort index, based on which a simpler human comfort assessment was proposed to replace the conventional index, standard effective temperature (SET*). The proposed method can be used as a guideline for landscape architects when designing planting locations. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Artificial light may change flight patterns of bats near bridges along urban waterways
PY  - 2021
AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is considered as a major threat to biodiversity, especially to nocturnal species, as it reduces availability, quality and functionality of habitats. However, its effects on the way species use landscape elements such as rivers are still largely understudied, especially the effect of crossing infrastructure lighting on bridges. These elements are nevertheless key commuting and foraging habitats in heavily urbanised landscapes for several taxa such as bats that are particularly affected by ALAN. We studied the effects of the illumination of facades and undersides of bridges on the relative abundance of pipistrelle bats, on their 3D distribution and their behavioural response (i.e. flight speed) close to bridges. We set-up an innovative approach based on a microphone-array to reconstruct positions and flight trajectories in 3D. We studied the effect of lighting on bats in the close proximity of six similar bridges, mostly differentiated by the presence or absence of lighting (3 lit and 3 unlit). All bridges cross the same waterway, within a uniformly and highly urbanized agglomeration (Toulouse, France). We found that bat activity was 1.7 times lower in lit sites. Bats tended to keep a larger distance, and to fly faster close to illuminated bridges. These results suggest that bridge lighting strongly reduces habitat availability and likely connectivity for bats. In that case, results call for switching off the illumination of such bridges crossing riverine ecosystems to preserve their functionality as habitats and corridors for bats. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London

TI  - The fox and the beach: Coastal landscape topography and urbanisation predict the distribution of carnivores at the edge of the sea: Beach Fox Habitat Choice
PY  - 2020
AB  - Mitigating the impact of invasive species is a global conservation challenge, which requires an understanding of the factors that drive the distribution, abundance, and ecological interactions of invaders. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are a widespread and abundant invasive omnivore in Australia. They are common in dunes and coastal areas that abut marine shorelines, which provide abundant food resources in the form of carrion. They are considered a key threatening process to Australia's biodiversity. The global literature posits that foxes use a broad mix of habitats, leading to an expectation of few consistent associations of foxes with landscape attributes and human uses of beaches and coastal dunes – this is the fundamental hypothesis tested here. Fox distribution was comprehensively mapped in Eastern Australia (108 km of shoreline, 192 sites, 6900 h of wildlife camera footage) and related (general additive models) to a range of potential drivers (e.g. topographic features, habitat types, urbanisation, connectivity, dogs, fox removal) on ocean beaches. Notwithstanding the catholic nature of red foxes elsewhere, here we show that habitat use by red foxes along ocean beaches is not indiscriminate: more foxes occur on beaches backed by high dunes and large expanses of natural vegetation. Conversely, significantly fewer foxes occur where natural dune habitats have been lost to urban areas. Fox removal did not affect fox distributions. Foxes are functionally important carnivores in coastal landscapes, and their disjunct distribution demonstrated by us suggests a spatially heterogeneous functional signal in coastal food-webs. More broadly, sandy beach ecosystems, interspersed by urban development, dominate many coasts, offering a rich bio-geographic tapestry to test how models of fox habitat choice articulate into invasive species management and food-web interactions.

TI  - Key coastal landscape structures for resilient coastal green infrastructure to enhance the abundance of migratory birds on the Yellow Sea
PY  - 2018
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the key landscape structures of migratory bird habitats that affect abundance of migratory birds to promote resilient coastal green infrastructure planning on the Yellow Sea coast. We classified coastal areas into four watersheds of South Korea and conducted multivariate regression analysis between migratory bird populations and landscape structures including total class area (CA), patch area distribution (MN), patch density (PD), and edge density (ED). At the national level, sandbank MN, sandbank CA, water ED, and grasslands were derived as key landscape structures affecting the abundance of migratory birds. At the watershed level, key landscape structures were determined as follows: Urban area_MN for the Han River watershed, rice paddy MN for the Asan watershed, rice paddy CA for Saemangeum, and grassland MN for the Youngsan River watershed. Considering the multifunctionality, redundancy, and connectivity of the resilience strategy, we provide specific coastal infrastructure planning recommendations at the national and watershed scales. This study investigated key coastal landscape structures for resilient coastal green infrastructure to enhance the abundance of migratory birds on the Yellow Sea. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The construction and optimization of ecological security pattern in the Harbin-Changchun urban agglomeration, China
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban agglomerations have become a new geographical unit in China, breaking the administrative fortresses between cities, which means that the population and economic activities between cities will become more intensive in the future. Constructing and optimizing the ecological security pattern of urban agglomerations is important for promoting harmonious social-economic development and ecological protection. Using the Harbin-Changchun urban agglomeration as a case study, we have identified ecological sources based on the evaluation of ecosystem functions. Based on the resistance surface modified by nighttime light (NTL) data, the potential ecological corridors were identified using the least-cost path method, and key ecological corridors were extracted using the gravity model. By combining 15 ecological sources, 119 corridors, 3 buffer zones, and 77 ecological nodes, the ecological security pattern (ESP) was constructed. The main land-use types composed of ecological sources and corridors are forest land, cultivated land, grassland, and water areas. Some ecological sources are occupied by construction, while unused land has the potential for ecological development. The ecological corridors in the central region are distributed circularly and extend to southeast side in the form of tree branches with the Songhua River as the central axis. Finally, this study proposes an optimizing pattern with “four belts, four zones, one axis, nine corridors, ten clusters and multi-centers” to provide decision makers with spatial strategies with respect to the conflicts between urban development and ecological protection during rapid urbanization.

TI  - Machine learning identifies specific habitats associated with genetic connectivity in Hyla squirella
PY  - 2012
AB  - The goal of this study was to identify and differentiate the influence of multiple habitat types that span a spectrum of suitability for Hyla squirella, a widespread frog species that occurs in a broad range of habitat types. We collected microsatellite data from 675 samples representing 20 localities from the southeastern USA and used machine-learning methodologies to identify significant habitat features associated with genetic structure. In simulation, we confirm that our machine-learning algorithm can successfully identify landscape features responsible for generating between-population genetic differentiation, suggesting that it can be a useful hypothesis-generating tool for landscape genetics. In our study system, we found that H. squirella were spatially structured and models including specific habitat types (i.e. upland oak forest and urbanization) consistently explained more variation in genetic distance (median pR 2=47.78) than spatial distance alone (median pR 2=23.81). Moreover, we estimate the relative importance that spatial distance, upland oak and urbanized habitat have in explaining genetic structure of H. squirella. We discuss how these habitat types may mechanistically facilitate dispersal in H. squirella. This study provides empirical support for the hypothesis that habitat-use can be an informative correlate of genetic differentiation, even for species that occur in a wide range of habitats. © 2012 The Authors.

TI  - Woodland reserves within an urban agglomeration as important refuges for small mammals
PY  - 2017
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p> The aim of the study was to determine the species richness (S, Chao- 1 index) and diversity (Shannon-Wiener H’ index, diversity profiles) of small mammal assemblages in woodland reserves in an urban agglomeration and to compare the similarity of assemblages (with the use of Ward’s method) in terms of proportions of small mammals connected to the habitats of different level of naturalness. The work was conducted from 2004-2015 at 9 woodland reserves in Warsaw (Poland). On the basis of the analysis of pellets of tawny owls Strix aluco, 2792 individuals were identified (24 species). Reserves supported from 7 to 16 of the small mammal species, the highest overall number of species estimated (Chao-1) was 19. Species present in every reserve were Apodemus flavicollis, A. agrarius, Rattus norvegicus, Sorex araneus and Talpa europaea. Least frequent were Microtus agrestis and M. subterraneus. Seven species of bats were detected. Species diversity was lower in the biggest forest complexes, where forest rodents dominated small mammal assemblage. The heterogeneity of habitats within reserve and in the surroundings, in combination with limited human-interference, resulted in an increase in the species diversity. Overall, the reserves under study were an important refuge for small mammals within the Warsaw agglomeration. However, safeguarding of adjacent areas against excessive anthropogenic change is needed and ecological corridors that link different areas need to be retained.</jats:p>

TI  - The role of stream ecosystems in urban planning: A case study from the stream Rekolanoja in Finland
PY  - 2006
AB  - Purpose - Urban stream ecosystems have often been seen as channels of water flow rather than as the valuable parts of an urban green space system providing ecosystem services. The study seeks to address the importance of urban stream ecosystems from the perspective of urban ecology, human health and social well-being in the context of urban planning. Design/methodology/approach - The case study area is the Rekolanoja stream ecosystem in the City of Vantaa, southern Finland. The data from the case study area were gathered from existing ecological studies and by conducting semi-structured interviews, a resident inquiry and a writing contest. Findings - The results from the Rekolanoja case show that intense management of the streamside vegetation and treatment of the stream channel in construction projects have decreased species richness and diminished valuable streamside biotopes. However, the stream corridor can function as an important recreational and educational element within the local green space network and thereby become a symbol of local identity. Practical implications - Planners, decision-makers and other interest groups can use the findings from this study in determining the values of small urban stream ecosystems in urban development. Originality/value - The Rekolanoja case indicates that planners and residents see the value of such an aquatic element as increasingly important for urban biodiversity and ecological corridor functions, as well as for local human health and social well-being, e.g. recreation and stress relief. Future land-use decisions will show whether a genuine change in the values and thinking of planners and decision-makers is taking place. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

TI  - Urban land use does not limit weaver bird movements between wetlands in Cape Town, South Africa
PY  - 2015
AB  - Urbanisation often has profound impacts on ecological processes. Management of these impacts is central to urban conservation efforts. We used data from 6591 individually ringed weaver birds from 42 ringing locations to investigate the influence that the urban matrix, as well as patch isolation, size and quality, had on weaver bird movement between ringing locations in Cape Town, a growing city within a global biodiversity hotspot. Distance-based linear models revealed that proximity to other sites was the dominant predictor of weaver movement while the site variables (wetland size and bird abundance) had a limited and inconclusive influence. Once the variation explained by the proximity and site variables had been accounted for, the composition of the surrounding urban matrix, the length of the least cost path between wetlands, and the presence of rivers as potential movement corridors (measured at three spatial scales) all had little influence on weaver movement. Analysis of the weaver bird movement-wetland network using social network analysis showed that the network is simple, clustered, and non-random, with relatively high vulnerability to node loss and some indication of preferential attachment (i.e., increased use of more used sites). Since proximity (site isolation) is the dominant influence on weaver movements, and the network is already sparse, further wetland loss is likely to reduce population viability. Our results match the predictions of classical theory and suggest that patch management will matter more for wetland passerines than matrix management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Urban plant assemblages by land use type in Milan: Floristic, ecological and functional diversities and refugium role of railway areas
PY  - 2021
AB  - The investigation of plant assemblages growing in urban ecosystems offers the chance to observe new interactions among biodiversity, urban planning and public health, in the context of a changing world with increasing city surfaces and populations. In this context, the aim of this work is the study of floristic, ecological and functional diversity of land use types of Milan, such as a) Built-up areas (urbanized and productive zones), b) Roads (borders and flowerbed of main boulevards and avenues), c) Railways (tracks borders, stations and adjacencies) and d) Green areas (parks, gardens, and orchards). A floristic survey was performed through stratified sampling and a floristic database was built. The following bioecological information was added to each sampling location: species richness, %alien species, %families, %life forms, functional diversity, %Grime's CSR strategies, Ellenberg's indicator values (EIVs), urbanity index and functional diversity estimators. Differences among land use types were detected with linear mixed models. In total, about 300 taxa were recorded, and 34 % of the species surveyed were aliens. The Railways were prominent with regard to several traits such as floristic richness, number of insect-pollinated species, mean EIV for light and soil reaction and functional diversity estimators. On the other hand, the urbanity index was the lowest in Railways. In general, Urban areas and Roads had lower trait values, while Green areas had intermediate performances. Our results showed that despite the expected high presence of ruderal and alien species, typical of disturbed environments, the urban landscapes of Milan are diversified in their ecological functions and included areas rich in uncommon species limited to peculiar habitats. The railway landscape of Milan represents a reservoir and refuge for many native species, incorporating microhabitats not present in other city landscapes. Therefore, railway areas should be included in the planning of green networks to improve connectivity and support the nature in urban landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - A comprehensive framework for seismic risk assessment of urban water transmission networks
PY  - 2018
AB  - Earthquakes are natural disasters which human beings cannot control, causing significant damage to the economy and society as a whole. In particular, earthquakes affect not only buildings but also lifeline structures such as water distribution, electric power, transportation, and telecommunication networks. The interruption of these networks is critical because it can directly damage the facilities and, at the same time, cause long-term loss of the overall system for society. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the uncertainties of ground motion, deterioration of pipelines, and interdependency of lifelines. Therefore, it is essential to predict the damage through possible earthquake scenarios and accounting for factors affecting lifeline structures. This study proposes a comprehensive framework to quantify the impact of earthquakes on the connectivity of urban water transmissions. The framework proposes the following steps to predict damage from earthquakes: (1) estimate the ground motion considering the spatial correlation, (2) propose a modified failure probability of buried pipelines considering deterioration, and (3) evaluate the seismic fragility curves of network components and the interdependency among water treatment plants, pumping plants, and substations. For numerical simulations, an actual water network system in South Korea was constructed using graph theory, and the magnitudes and locations of the epicenters were determined based on historical earthquake data. Finally, the reliability performance indicators (e.g., connectivity loss and serviceability ratio) were measured when earthquakes of various magnitudes occurred in the urban area. This framework will enable the prediction of damage from earthquakes and enhance decision making to minimize the extent of damage. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - Urban habituation, ecological connectivity and epidemic dampening: The emergence of hendra virus from flying foxes (Pteropus spp.)
PY  - 2011
AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change is often implicated in the emergence of new zoonoses from wildlife; however, there is little mechanistic understanding of these causal links. Here, we examine the transmission dynamics of an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus, Hendra virus (HeV), in its endemic host, Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or flying foxes). HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen, with a high case-fatality rate in humans and horses. With models parametrized from field and laboratory data, we explore a set of probable contributory mechanisms that explain the spatial and temporal pattern of HeV emergence; including urban habituation and decreased migration-two widely observed changes in flying fox ecology that result from anthropogenic transformation of bat habitat in Australia. Urban habituation increases the number of flying foxes in contact with human and domestic animal populations, and our models suggest that, in addition, decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in population immunity, giving rise to more intense outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. Ten of the 14 known HeV outbreaks occurred near urbanized or sedentary flying fox populations, supporting these predictions. We also demonstrate that by incorporating waning maternal immunity into our models, the peak modelled prevalence coincides with the peak annual spill-over hazard for HeV. These results provide the first detailed mechanistic framework for understanding the sporadic temporal pattern of HeV emergence, and of the urban/peri-urban distribution of HeV outbreaks in horses and people. © 2011 The Royal Society.

TI  - Unsheltered Homelessness in Urban Parks: Perspectives on Environment, Health, and Justice in Salt Lake City, Utah
PY  - 2019
AB  - Unsheltered homelessness in the United States forces hundreds of thousands of people to sleep, eat, and live in the public sphere. Urban parks often become temporary homes for individuals facing poverty, substance addiction, mental illness, servitude, and other social concerns. For individuals facing homelessness, these parks are primary sources of stability in often desperate situations. Residing in parks and protected areas, however, raises concerns for the residents in terms of personal health and safety, and raises other concerns for public health, public safety, and environmental impacts. This research considers the relationships between unsheltered homelessness and perspectives of local environmental conditions. Surveys were completed by recreational users (n = 332) of City Creek Canyon, a riparian corridor in Salt Lake City, Utah, to understand visitors' perspectives of the social and environmental impacts of unsheltered homelessness in the area. Results indicate an overall awareness of homelessness in the area, and a simultaneous indication that homelessness does little to affect either recreational behavior or perceived environmental impacts to the water, wildlife, or overall ecological functioning. Implications from this research illuminate that common responses of forced displacement of individuals facing homelessness from parks - by law enforcement, health department, or park management officials - represent not only social justice concerns but also environmental justice concerns for those facing homelessness. Similar to \"right to the city\" movements, access to environmental resources, in this case a place to live, represents an environmental justice issue for some of the most marginalized members of our communities.

TI  - Long-term effectiveness of US 1 crossing project in reducing Florida Key deer mortality
PY  - 2011
AB  - Deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) are the primary source of mortality for the endangered Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium). Of these collisions, >50% occur on United States Highway 1 (US 1), the primary roadway connecting the islands in the Florida Keys, USA. The DVCs on the 5.6-km section of US 1 on Big Pine Key are responsible for approximately 26% of annual Key deer mortality, but extensive urban development along this highway segment complicates efforts to reduce DVCs using traditional methods (e.g., fencing, underpasses). In 2002, a continuous 2.6-km system of 2.4-m fencing, 2 underpasses, and 4 experimental deer guards was completed. We evaluated the long-term effectiveness of these highway improvements in reducing DVCs within an urban landscape. Deer used the underpasses all 7 postconstruction years (2003-2009) with dramatic increases in use over the course of the project. Roadway fencing largely eliminated deer intrusion onto the fenced area of US 1. Although well-maintained fencing effectively restricted deer movement onto the fenced section of US 1 (73-100% decline), other sections of US 1 experienced increases in DVCs. Overall, highway improvements along the US 1 corridor were effective in reducing Key deer mortality over the long-term. The success of deer guards in preventing deer access into the fenced section of US 1 supported the feasibility of implementing similar wildlife exclusion projects in other urban areas. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.

TI  - Influence of connectivity & topsoil management practices of a constructed technosol on pedofauna colonization: A field study
PY  - 2018
AB  - At the present time, rehabilitation of polluted urban areas and the restoration of their soil are environmental priorities. The creation of constructed soils appears to be a tempting way to restore, lastingly, a contaminated urban soil provided that they can become fertile and host a functional biodiversity delivering essential ecosystem services. To ensure this, the recolonization of newly established technosols composed of a mixture of compost and in situ deep alluvion was monitored using judiciously chosen bioindicators: springtails, mites, earthworms, carabid beetles and woodlice. These technosols were part of an experimental plot located inside the future “Ecoquartier de l'Union” (Roubaix, France). The results show that, if the connection of the technosols with an element of the local landscape (in this case a railway hedgerow) plays a part chiefly in aiding the first stages of recolonization, notably for earthworms and springtails, technosols management has a lasting impact on the colonization dynamics and the implantation of the different taxa. Establishing an herbaceous cover (flowering meadow, lawn) or a hedge was especially profitable to the pedofaunic communities, which were richer and more abundant, as well as to the technosols functioning (better litter degradation, diversified collembolan communities with regards to functional traits). The same is true for the addition of RCW (Ramial Chipped Wood) which benefits earthworm and mesofauna through the organic components released and the associated fungal development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Identifying man-made objects along urban road corridors from mobile lidar data
PY  - 2014
AB  - This letter is dedicated to a generic approach for the automated detection and classification of man-made objects in urban corridors from point clouds acquired by vehicle-borne mobile laser scanning (MLS). The approach is designed based on a priori knowledge in urban areas: 1) man-made objects feature geometric regularity such as vertical planar structures (e.g., building facades), whereas vegetation reveals huge diversity in shape and point distribution and 2) different types of urban man-made objects can be characterized by the point extension and the height above the ground level. Therefore, MLS-based point clouds are first divided into three layers with respect to the vertical height. In each layer, seed points of man-made objects are indicated by a line filter in the footprints of off-ground objects, which is generated by binarizing the spatial accumulation map of the point clouds. These seed points are further classified by examining in which layers the seed points of objects are found. Finally, points belonging to respective objects can be retrieved based on the classified seed points. The experiments show that various man-made objects on both sides of the street can be well detected, with a detection rate of up to 83%. For the classification of detected urban objects, overall accuracy of 92.37% can be achieved. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Making the case for gardens: Estimating the contribution of urban gardens to habitat provision and connectivity based on hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Preserving and expanding green infrastructure (GI) is key to biodiversity conservation in cities, but a significant share of urban land is commonly underutilized in GI plans: gardens. This is despite the fact that gardens can support diverse wildlife communities by providing habitat and by functioning as corridors. In this article, we apply circuit theory-based modeling in order to quantify the contribution of two types of gardens to connectivity in the city of Braunschweig, Germany: private gardens and allotment gardens. We ran four permeability scenarios: 1.) all green spaces including private and allotment gardens are permeable; 2.) private gardens are non-permeable; 3.) allotment gardens are non-permeable; 4.) only public green spaces but no gardens are permeable. We based our modeling on the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a common, relatively well-understood and well-liked urban species. Observations by citizen scientists were used for a plausibility analysis and interpreting the results. Our results confirm the importance of gardens for providing habitat and connectivity. The overall landscape permeability to the movement of hedgehogs would decrease by 75% and the area of core habitats would decline by 63% without private and allotment gardens. While private gardens contribute most to landscape connectivity, some allotment gardens occupy key areas for the overall connectivity in the city. In conclusion, circuit theory-based modeling is a promising tool for urban GI planning and the output of those models can inform decision makers and gardeners. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Street lighting: sex-independent impacts on moth movement
PY  - 2016
AB  - Artificial lights have become an integral and welcome part of our urban and peri-urban environments. However, recent research has highlighted the potentially negative ecological consequences of ubiquitous artificial light. In particular, insects, especially moths, are expected to be negatively impacted by the presence of artificial lights. Previous research with light traps has shown a male-biased attraction to light in moths. In this study, we sought to determine whether street lights could limit moth dispersal and whether there was any sex bias in attraction to light. More specifically, we aimed to determine sex-specific attraction radii for moths to street lights. We tested these hypotheses by collecting moths for 2 years at an experimental set-up. To estimate the attraction radii, we developed a Markov model and related it to the acquired data. Utilizing multinomial statistics, we found that attraction rates to lights in the middle of the matrix were substantially lower than predicted by the null hypothesis of equal attraction level (0·44 times). With the Markov model, we estimated that a corner light was 2·77 times more attractive than a wing light with an equivalentre attraction radius of c. 23 m around each light. We found neither sexual differences in the attraction rate nor in the attraction radius of males and females. Since we captured three times more males than females, we conclude that sex ratios are representative of operational sex ratios or of different flight activities. These results provide evidence for street lights to limit moth dispersal, and that they seem to act equally on male and female moths. Consequently, public lighting might divide a suitable landscape into many small habitats. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume (i) that public lighting near hedges and bushes or field margins reduces the quality of these important habitat structures and (ii) that public lighting may affect moth movement between patches. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Urban flower beds as a part of Bariloche’s biocultural landscape: species richness and management decisions
PY  - 2022
AB  - Introduction: In urban areas, flower beds with ornamental species provide structure and color, attract pollinators, act as wildlife corridors, bring nature closer, and offer humans a fount of wellbeing. Depending on the selection criteria, urban flora can be a biodiversity reserve or a source for spreading invasive species. Objectives: The species richness, life forms, botanical families, and origins of the plants used in Bariloche’s flower beds was estimated. M&M: The city of Bariloche lies within the Nahuel Huapi National Park and has multicultural characteristics. In total, 1,120 sidewalk flower beds were studied; 560 under municipal management and 560 managed by the neighborhood. Results: There were 121 species, with Lobelia erinus (23.3%) and Clarkia amoena (19.7%) being the most widely used. Of the 54 botanical families represented, the most frequent were Rosaceae (28.5%, 9 species), Campanulaceae (23.7%, 2) and Compositae (20.4%, 18). Herbaceous plants were dominant (70 species), followed by shrubs (43), sapling trees (6), and climbing plant (2). The neighbors manage a larger diversity of plants and native species (92 species /11 native) than the municipality (64/4). The presence of native elements (e.g., Alstroemeria aurea and Fucsia magellanica) holds implications for preservation, while the invasive species (e.g., Hedera helix and Cytisus scoparius) bring risk and should be monitored and controlled. Conclusions: It is concluded that the flora in flower beds represents a part of the region’s biocultural landscape, as dynamic backdrops built through time, showing similarities with worldwide selection patterns © 2022, Boletin de la Sociedad Argentina de Botanica.All Rights Reserved.

TI  - How urban riparian corridors affect the diversity of spontaneous herbaceous plants as pollination and dispersal routes - a case of the Wenyu River- North Canal in Beijing, China
PY  - 2023
AB  - The loss of biodiversity due to rapid urbanization can be mitigated by urban riparian corridors. As an important component of urban biodiversity, spontaneous herbaceous plants play an essential role in the ecological functions of urban river corridors. Currently, the influence of the landscape structure within corridors on plant diversity has been poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the species and functional diversity, especially the functional traits of origin, pollination, and dispersal, of spontaneous herbaceous plants in the Wenyu River-North Canal riparian corridor in Beijing. The results showed that urban riparian corridors have a positive effect on the spread of alien and invasive plants as well as increasing the native plant diversity. No significant differences in diversity indicators but significant differences in the composition of functional traits between habitat types. Plants with long pollination and dispersal distances tended to be more closely related to the landscape structure indices at larger scales. Invasive plants were more common in patches with significant connectivity, while native plants were positively correlated with water and road connectivity. Anemophilous and anemochores were more common in habitats with sinuous edges. Ant-dispersed plants were closely related to the water bodies. Autochores were positively correlated with the connectivity of habitat patches. Plants dispersed by birds and mammals were weakly correlated with landscape structure. Our study underlines that emphasis should be placed on the support for plant pollination and dispersal, together with the prevention and control of invasive plants in the construction and management of future urban ecological corridors. © 2023

TI  - Temperature and not landscape composition shapes wild bee communities in an urban environment
PY  - 2023
AB  - More than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase. Even if urbanisation is widely regarded as a major threat to global biodiversity, recent research highlighted the potential ecological importance of cities for pollinators. Key determinants of cities' ability to sustain pollinators are the presence of green areas and the connectivity between them. However, also temperature is expected to be of primary importance for pollinator activities. Here, we aimed at disentangling the effects of temperature, open habitat cover, and distance from the city centre on wild bee communities in the city of Rome (Italy). We selected 36 sites along two statistically independent gradients of temperature and open habitat cover, and we sampled wild bee communities using pan-traps for 4 months. Then, we measured functional traits of wild bee species, that is, body size, social behaviour, nesting strategy, and diet breadth. Temperature emerged as the main driver of wild bee communities, with communities richer in species and individuals at warmer temperatures. We found little species replacement between cold and warm sites. In addition, with increasing temperatures, bee communities were dominated by polylectic and small-bodied species. Here, we showed that in a highly urbanised environment, temperature shapes pollinator communities irrespective of other landscape metrics. Even if warming seemed beneficial for urban pollinator abundance and richness, it might strongly homogenise bee communities by selecting for those traits that make species more easily adaptable. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Canopy bridges as road overpasses for wildlife in urban fragmented landscapes
PY  - 2013
AB  - The effects of habitat fragmentation and deforestation are exacerbated by some elements, such as roads and power lines, which may become filters or barriers to wildlife movements. In order to mitigate mortality and restore connectivity, wildlife passages are being constructed as linear corridors. The installation of these mitigation measures must be followed by systematic monitoring, in order to evaluate their use and effectiveness, to assist in their management, and to convince stakeholders of their value. In this paper we present the results of a monitoring study of the use of rope overpasses developed near a protected area in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. The canopy bridges were installed by the Urban Monkeys Program in places where electric hazards and road-kills of brown howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans Cabrera, 1940) were recorded. Camera traps were installed at each bridge, and local people were selected and trained to monitor overpass use over 15 months, from August 2008 to October 2009. Three species were recorded using canopy bridges: brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba clamitans Cabrera, 1940), white-eared opossum (Didelphis albiventris Lund, 1840) and porcupine (Sphiggurus villosus Cuvier, 1823). Rope bridges with the highest number of species recorded had more forest cover and lower urban area around them than overpasses little used. Our results indicate that overpasses, in Porto Alegre, work as a linear corridor between forest remnants, although the outcomes for individual survival, group persistence, population demography or gene flow have not been measured. Furthermore, canopy bridges may be important to mitigate the impact of roads and power lines on wildlife, but electric cables also need to be completely isolated when present, to warrant animals' physical integrity.

TI  - Importance of private working lands for the conservation of neotropical birds on an urban-wilderness gradient
PY  - 2022
AB  - Global biodiversity and land conservation initiatives rely on an accurate understanding of the spatial distribution of species populations and communities. Identifying the spatial habitat use of wildlife communities across land uses and levels of human modification provides the opportunity to produce more efficient and effectual conservation plans. Our goal was to model breeding bird community occupancy across a complete spectrum of human land use modification to determine the habitat characteristics that best maximized the conservation of bird diversity. We used repeat-visit point counts on private and public lands to record the detection/non-detection of breeding bird species across the land use gradient. We modeled multiple proportional land cover and landscape structure covariates and employed a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model to analyze the habitat use of each species and to estimate guild-level species richness dynamics across the study area. We detected a total of 70 breeding bird species and our model estimated a total of 78 species within the total metacommunity. We found that insectivorous species richness was lowest in urban and suburban areas (xˆ = 7), but highest on multiple use working lands with low to moderate levels of human modification (xˆ = 22), not in the fully preserved protected areas (xˆ = 16). In contrast, the richness of the predominately human commensal omnivorous species was highest in urban and suburban areas (xˆ = 10) and across much of the more human modified landscape and lowest in the preserved lands (xˆ = 3). Moderately disturbed working lands, which primarily consisted of a mixture of rotating silvicultural tracts, agriculture, low density housing, and riparian corridors, supported the most species (xˆ = 36) and were especially important for the occupancy of breeding neotropical insectivores. These findings highlight the potential conservation benefits for incorporating private working lands with multiple land uses and land covers into future conservation planning scenarios, both for their wildlife conservation potential and as buffers around traditional protected areas. © 2022

TI  - Deforestation in central Chile causes a rapid decline in landscape connectivity for a forest specialist bird species
PY  - 2013
AB  - The abundance of woodland birds in fragmented forest landscapes may depend on the properties of patch networks. Understanding the consequences of deforestation on woodland birds, therefore, necessarily requires determining which changes in landscape structure make a major contribution to the degradation and subdivision of patch networks. In this study, we addressed how accelerated deforestation in central Chile has modified the landscape structure and function for thorn-tailed rayaditos—a woodland specialist bird. Using a graphical approach based on the habitat use and movement patterns of rayaditos, we quantified the reduction of the internal connectivity of components (i.e., connected patch networks) in the last two decades and determined the main mechanisms responsible for this connectivity loss. Forest cover decreased 61.7 % between 1989 and 2009. The component size, the fraction of components with ≥1 occupied patches and the number of patches per component experienced a large decline during the study period. Over time, most forest cover (ca. 80 %) was contained in only two components. The connectivity of components decreased steeply by 90 %. Only the loss of large patches made a highly significant contribution to explaining changes in connectivity, while the removal of stepping stones was marginally significant. The conversion of forest both to shrubland and to peri-urban areas were the only land-use variables explaining connectivity change with effects that changed over time. Conservation measures to ensure persistence of rayaditos populations in central Chile should be focused on the retention of key elements for connectivity.

TI  - Spatiotemporal pattern of urban heat island in Lanzhou of Northwest China based on fractal net evolution approach and spectral mixture analysis
PY  - 2013
AB  - By using the Landsat TM/ETM+ thermal infrared remote sensing data of 1993 , 2001, and 2011 to retrieve the ground temperature in the urban area of Lanzhou City, and by adopting object-oriented fractal net evolution approach (FNEA) to make image segmentation of the ground temperature, the urban heat island (UHI) elements were extracted. The G* index spatial aggregation analysis was made to calculate the urban heat island ratio index ( URI), and the landscape metrics were used at landscape level to quantify the changes of the spatial pattern of the UHI from the aspects of quantity, shape, and structure. The impervious surface distribution and vegetation coverage were extracted by a constrained linear spectral mixture model to explore the relationships of the impervious surface distribution and vegetation coverage with the UHI. In recent 20 years, the UHI effect in Lanzhou City was strengthened, with the URI increased by 1.4 times. The urban expansion had a spatiotemporal consistency with the UHI expansion. The patch number and density of the UHI landscape were increased, the patch shape and the whole landscape tended to be complex, the landscape became more fragmented, and the landscape connectivity was decreased. The conversion of the UHI mainly occurred from low temperature grade patch type to high temperature grade patch type. The heat island strength had a negative linear correlation with the urban vegetation coverage, and a positive logarithmic correlation with the urban impervious surface coverage.

TI  - Importance of riparian forests in urban catchments contingent on sediment and hydrologic regimes
PY  - 2006
AB  - Forested riparian corridors are thought to minimize impacts of landscape disturbance on stream ecosystems; yet, the effectiveness of streamside forests in mitigating disturbance in urbanizing catchments is unknown. We expected that riparian forests would provide minimal benefits for fish assemblages in streams that are highly impaired by sediment or hydrologic alteration. We tested this hypothesis in 30 small streams along a gradient of urban disturbance (1-65% urban land cover). Species expected to be sensitive to disturbance (i.e., fluvial specialists and \"sensitive\" species that respond negatively to urbanization) were best predicted by models including percent forest cover in the riparian corridor and a principal components axis describing sediment disturbance. Only sites with coarse bed sediment and low bed mobility (vs. sites with high amounts of fine sediment) had increased richness and abundances of sensitive species with higher percent riparian forests, supporting our hypothesis that response to riparian forests is contingent on the sediment regime. Abundances of Etheostoma scotti, the federally threatened Cherokee darter, were best predicted by models with single variables representing stormflow (r2 = 0.34) and sediment (r2 = 0.23) conditions. Lentic-tolerant species richness and abundance responded only to a variable representing prolonged duration of low-flow conditions. For these species, hydrologic alteration overwhelmed any influence of riparian forests on stream biota. These results suggest that, at a minimum, catchment management strategies must simultaneously address hydrologic, sediment, and riparian disturbance in order to protect all aspects of fish assemblage integrity. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

TI  - Construction of green space planning framework based on ecosystem service function simulation: a case study of shallow mountain area in Beijing
PY  - 2019
AB  - Objective: In the context of rapid urbanization and global climate change, the deterioration of the ecological environment has brought tremendous impact on human life and health. Ecosystem service function assessment has been promoted as a method to cope with climate change and build a green and livable living environment. Establishing a green space planning framework based on ecosystem service function simulation calculus has scientific guiding significance for objectively evaluating the service function of green space and building a sustainable green space network. Method: On the basis of summarizing the relevant research of scholars at home and abroad, this paper takes the shallow mountain area of Beijing as an example to construct a green spatial planning framework based on the assessment of ecosystem service function. Six functional indicators, namely, heat island mitigation, soil and water conservation, carbon sequestration and oxygen release, climate regulation, biodiversity conservation and cultural recreation, were selected, and runoff was adopted. Coefficient formula calculation, MaxEnt model simulation and other methods were used to evaluate, identify the location of key green spaces of different service types in the region and propose suitable green space types. Finally, through the construction of recreational greenways and ecological corridors, green space links were strengthened and the layout of green space was improved. Result: The results showed that the spatial distribution of ecosystem service benefits of different types showed some differences. According to the service differences provided by different regions, seven types of green space were delimited, including wetland park, forest park, country park, urban park, geological park, scenic spot and ecological conservation green space. Six new green roads were added. In plain and shallow mountainous area, ecological corridors were constructed in villages and towns such as Hot Spring Town, Yanshou Town, Shisanling Town and Yukou Town, and linear green space for the purpose of protecting target animals was established. Conclusion: The aim is to strengthen the implementation of ecological priority development strategy in shallow mountain areas and promote the formation of sustainable green development mode. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Forestry University.

TI  - Effects of environmental factors and landscape features on movement patterns of Florida black bears
PY  - 2017
AB  - A greater understanding of how environmental factors and anthropogenic landscape features influence animal movements can inform management and potentially aid in mitigating human-wildlife conflicts. We investigated the movement patterns of 16 Florida black bears (Ursus americanus floridanus; 6 females, 10 males) in north-central Florida at multiple temporal scales using GPS data collected from 2011 to 2014. We calculated bi-hourly step-lengths and directional persistence, as well as daily and weekly observed displacements and expected displacements. We used those movement metrics as response variables in linear mixed models and tested for effects of sex, season, and landscape features. We found that step-lengths of males were generally longer than step-lengths of females, and both sexes had the shortest step-lengths during the daytime. Bears moved more slowly (shorter step-lengths) and exhibited less directed movement when near creeks, in forested wetlands, and in marsh habitats, possibly indicating foraging behavior. In urban areas, bears moved more quickly (longer step-lengths) and along more directed paths. The results were similar across all temporal scales. Major roads tended to act as a semipermeable barrier to bear movement. Males crossed major roads more frequently than females but both sexes crossed major roads much less frequently than minor roads. Our findings regarding the influence of landscape and habitat features on movement patterns of Florida black bears could be useful for planning effective wildlife corridors and understanding how future residential or commercial development and road expansions may affect animal movement. © 2017 American Society of Mammalogists.

TI  - Forest soils adjacent to urban interstates: Soil physical and chemical properties, heavy metals, disturbance legacies, and relationships with woody vegetation
PY  - 2011
AB  - While urban ecology is an expanding field of study, some natural areas within the urban environment remain under-examined. These include naturally regenerating forest communities adjacent to urban interstates. In addition, the status of interstate soils and their relationships with the community composition of forested interstate verges has received little ecological study. The purpose of this study was to examine variation in soil conditions along forested interstate corridors in Louisville, KY and to explore the extent to which soil characteristics (e. g., bulk density, pH) and heavy metals (e. g., Pb, Zn) vary with respect to three factors: interstate (e. g., traffic density), surrounding urban environment (e. g., industrial land use), and interstate construction legacies. Additionally, we explored the relationships between several edaphic factors and woody vegetation structure in these forested verges. We found that the degree and direction of the slope of land towards the interstate and the distance to the interstate pavement were strong determinants of soil characteristics and heavy metal concentrations, suggesting that the movement of de-icing salts, heavy metals, and other pollutants from the interstate was important in determining forest soil conditions along urban interstates. Since within our study area these highways did not extend into rural lands, variation in urban land uses and cover within 26 km of the city center was not large enough to explain variation in soil characteristics or heavy metals, except for a positive correlation between chromium and surrounding industrial land use. We did find that past physical soil disturbance caused by interstate construction (e. g., imported fill) left an important legacy on soil characteristics, heavy metal retention, and woody plant growth patterns in forests adjacent to urban interstates. The legacy of interstate construction on the current forest community structure (e. g., lower species richness) and the future forest (e. g., reduced tree regeneration) may further alter ecosystem productivity and ecosystem services provided by these forests and their soils. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - The dynamics of social-ecological systems in urban landscapes: Stockholm and the National Urban Park, Sweden
PY  - 2004
AB  - This study addresses social-ecological dynamics in the greater metropolitan area of Stockholm County, Sweden, with special focus on the National Urban Park (NUP). It is part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and has the following specific objectives: (1) to provide scientific information on biodiversity patterns, ecosystem dynamics, and ecosystem services generated; (2) to map interplay between actors and institutions involved in management of ecosystem services; and (3) to identify strategies for strengthening social-ecological resilience. The green areas in Stockholm County deliver numerous ecosystem services, for example, air filtration, regulation of microclimate, noise reduction, surface water drainage, recreational and cultural values, nutrient retention, and pollination and seed dispersal. Recreation is among the most important services and NUP, for example, has more than 15 million visitors per year. More than 65 organizations representing 175,000 members are involved in management of ecosystem services. However, because of population increase and urban growth during the last three decades, the region displays a quite dramatic loss of green areas and biodiversity. An important future focus is how management may reduce increasing isolation of urban green areas and enhance connectivity. Comanagement should be considered where locally managed green space may function as buffer zones and for management of weak links that connect larger green areas; for example, there are three such areas around NUP identified. Preliminary results indicate that areas of informal management represent centers on which to base adaptive comanagement, with the potential to strengthen biodiversity management and resilience in the landscape.

TI  - An assessment of a conservation strategy to increase garden connectivity for hedgehogs that requires cooperation between immediate neighbours: A barrier too far?
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban areas are associated with high levels of habitat fragmentation. For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human habitation, including residential gardens. 'Hedgehog Street' is a public engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important. Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0% creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8% of non-Champions stated that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring holes: only 11.4% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2% of gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0% of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those householders who are not innately \"wildlife-friendly\", and to quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of individual movement and, ultimately, populations.

TI  - Genetic structure across urban and agricultural landscapes reveals evidence of resource specialization and philopatry in the Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica L
PY  - 2021
AB  - Human activity continues to impact global ecosystems, often by altering the habitat suitability, persistence, and movement of native species. It is thus critical to examine the population genetic structure of key ecosystemservice providers across human-altered landscapes to provide insight into the forces that limit wildlife persistence and movement across multiple spatial scales. While some studies have documented declines of bee pollinators as a result of human-mediated habitat alteration, others suggest that some bee species may benefit from altered land use due to increased food or nesting resource availability; however, detailed population and dispersal studies have been lacking. We investigated the population genetic structure of the Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica, across 14 sites spanning more than 450 km, including dense urban areas and intensive agricultural habitat. X. virginica is a large bee which constructs nests in natural and human-associated wooden substrates, and is hypothesized to disperse broadly across urbanizing areas. Using 10 microsatellite loci, we detected significant genetic isolation by geographic distance and significant isolation by land use, where urban and cultivated landscapes were most conducive to gene flow. This is one of the first population genetic analyses to provide evidence of enhanced insect dispersal in human-altered areas as compared to semi-natural landscapes. We found moderate levels of regional-scale population structure across the study system (GʹST = 0.146) and substantial co-ancestry between the sampling regions, where co-ancestry patterns align with major human transportation corridors, suggesting that human-mediated movement may be influencing regional dispersal processes. Additionally, we found a signature of strong site-level philopatry where our analyses revealed significant levels of high genetic relatedness at very fine scales (&lt;1 km), surprising given X. virginica's large body size. These results provide unique genetic evidence that insects can simultaneously exhibit substantial regional dispersal as well as high local nesting fidelity in landscapes dominated by human activity. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Assessment of biodiversity value by the possibility of connectivity (PC)-based method
PY  - 2016
AB  - The assessment of biodiversity was of great importance in the evaluation system of ecosystem services. Currently, compared with the method adopted actual habitat size which was the popular method in most of the studies, the method used landscape connectivity had more advantages in reflecting the spatial distribution of the value of biodiversity. Moreover, the method with landscape connectivity was more conductive to identify the key area of biodiversity conservation, which had significance in guiding the urban planning. In our paper, a method of landscape pattern was proposed for the assessment of biodiversity value that considered both habitat size and spatial connectivity, which regarded the index of possibility of connectivity (PC index) as its primary parameter. We took Miyun County as case study to calculate the biodiversity value by both the popular method and the proposed method. The calculation of biodiversity value covered six land use types: grazing land, forest land, cropland, water area, built-up land, and unused land. Furthermore, we had identified the key patches for biodiversity conservation by the reclassification of the biodiversity value. The biodiversity value had been reclassified into internal value and external value for the identification of key conservation patches. As a result, we concluded the total biodiversity value of each land use type we had concerned: grazing land was 3.69×106 Yuan·ha-1·year-1, forest land was 132.39×106 Yuan·ha-1·year-1, cropland was 5.65×106 Yuan·ha-1·year-1, water area was 18.94×106 Yuan·ha-1·year-1, built-up land was 0, and unused land was 0.11×106 Yuan·ha-1·year-1. Then, for the identification of key patches, we found that there were three kinds of key patches: (1) the patches with larger habitat size; (2) the satellite patches around the large patches as the undertaken area for biological migration; (3) the stepping stone patches. © 2016 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

TI  - Life in linear habitats: the movement ecology of an endangered mammal in a peri-urban landscape
PY  - 2020
AB  - Animal movement can be significantly altered in human‐dominated landscapes such as urban and peri‐urban areas, where habitat is often fragmented and/or linear. Knowledge regarding how wildlife respond to anthropogenic change is vital for informing conservation efforts in such landscapes, including the design of nature reserves and wildlife corridors. To better understand how threatened species persist and behave within human‐dominated landscapes, we examined the home range and space use of the nationally endangered southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus obesulus in peri‐urban Melbourne, Australia’s second‐largest city. Specifically, we examined whether: (1) bandicoots were confined to linear strips of remnant vegetation or also made use of the broader highly modified landscape matrix; (2) the configuration of the linear vegetated strips affected home range shape; and (3) home range area differed between bandicoots living in linear strips and those in larger remnant habitat patches. We found that: (1) 71% of adult males and 33% of adult females used the matrix, but non‐dispersing juveniles were entirely confined to the linear strips; males also travelled greater distances into the matrix (away from the vegetated strips) than females; (2) bandicoots had longer home ranges in narrower strips and males had longer home ranges than females; and (3) home range area for both sexes was smaller in linear strips than has been recorded in other studies in larger remnant habitats. Our study highlights the importance of retaining narrow, fragmented and modified vegetation to accommodate threatened biodiversity within human‐dominated landscapes, but suggests the surrounding matrix may also offer important resources for adaptable species, such as bandicoots. Supporting off‐reserve conservation of biodiversity in novel ecosystems is increasingly pertinent in our rapidly urbanizing world.

TI  - Tree Cover Is Unevenly Distributed Across Cities Globally, With Lowest Levels Near Highway Pollution Sources
PY  - 2020
AB  - Obtaining accurate tree cover maps within cities is a first step toward managing for equitable access to their ecosystem services. For example, by removing air pollutants trees contribute to fewer health impacts, and tree cover expansion could extend these benefits by targeting the most polluted areas and vulnerable populations. To support strategic tree expansion, this research created urban tree cover maps using the 2017 NASA MOD44B satellite 250 m pixel product for 35 megacities, areas with large levels of pollution and vulnerable populations. Estimates of tree cover from photo-interpretation (PI) were used to characterize map error, city-wide, and from low to high tree cover, using 21 bins from 0 to 100% tree cover. Map accuracy was highest when MOD44B percent tree cover was combined with its tree cover standard deviation product, with average difference of 1.8% compared with PI estimates of 19.9% city-wide tree cover. MOD44B estimates of tree cover spatial patterns had strong explanatory value. The maps explained the PI estimates of low to high tree cover at 5% tree cover intervals with an R2 = 0.97. The Getis Ord Gi* statistic determined a non-random spatial distribution of tree cover within the megacities, with significant clustering into hot spots of relatively high tree cover and cold spots of relatively low tree cover. Tree cover hot spots were most often furthest from downtown, at the rural-urban interface or within higher elevation terrain. Tree cover cold spots were most often in areas of concentrated development and along traffic corridors known for high levels of particulate matter and other air pollutants that could be reduced by trees. Given small increases in exposure to particulate matter are associated with significant increases in death rates from viruses, and that climate change and associated heat waves are forecast to exacerbate health risks to air pollution, we need to improve global urban tree cover. These map products can be used to expand tree cover that strategically contributes to pollutant abatement, human well-being, and sustainable cities. Copyright © 2020 Endreny, Sica and Nowak.

AB  - Because ecosystem approaches to management adhere to ecological systems rather than human-defined boundaries, collaboration across jurisdiction, agencies, and land ownership is often necessary to achieve effective management of transboundary resources. Local natural resource and land use planners increasingly recognize that while ecosystem management requires looking beyond specific jurisdictions and focusing on broad spatial scales, the approach will partly be implemented at the local level with the coordination of local policies across larger landscapes. This article evaluates the collective capabilities of local jurisdictions to manage large transboundary ecological systems in Florida. Specifically, it combines plan evaluation with geographic information systems (GIS) techniques to map, measure, and analyze the existing mosaic of management across selected ecosystems in the southern portion of the State. Visual and statistical results indicate significant gaps in the management framework of southern Florida that, if filled, could achieve a greater level of consistency and more complete coverage of ecosystem management policies. Based on the spatial distribution of 58 ecosystem management indicators, notable gaps persist in the southwest coast, southeast coast, and central Everglades ecosystems, particularly for wildlife corridors and collaboration with neighboring jurisdictions. We also test for spatial autocorrelation of ecosystem planning scores and find that local jurisdictions with strong ecosystem management capabilities tend to cluster within specific ecosystems. Based on the findings, we make recommendations on how and where local plans can be strengthened to more effectively attain the objectives of ecosystem approaches to management.

TI  - Does the virus cross the road? Viral phylogeographic patterns among bobcat populations reflect a history of urban development
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban development has major impacts on connectivity among wildlife populations and is thus likely an important factor shaping pathogen transmission in wildlife. However, most investigations of wildlife diseases in urban areas focus on prevalence and infection risk rather than potential effects of urbanization on transmission itself. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a directly transmitted retrovirus that infects many felid species and can be used as a model for studying pathogen transmission at landscape scales. We investigated phylogenetic relationships among FIV isolates sampled from five bobcat (Lynx rufus) populations in coastal southern California that appear isolated due to major highways and dense urban development. Divergence dates among FIV phylogenetic lineages in several cases reflected historical urban growth and construction of major highways. We found strong FIV phylogeographic structure among three host populations north-west of Los Angeles, largely coincident with host genetic structure. In contrast, relatively little FIV phylogeographic structure existed among two genetically distinct host populations south-east of Los Angeles. Rates of FIV transfer among host populations did not vary significantly, with the lack of phylogenetic structure south-east of Los Angeles unlikely to reflect frequent contemporary transmission among populations. Our results indicate that major barriers to host gene flow can also act as barriers to pathogen spread, suggesting potentially reduced susceptibility of fragmented populations to novel directly transmitted pathogens. Infrequent exchange of FIV among host populations suggests that populations would best be managed as distinct units in the event of a severe disease outbreak. Phylogeographic inference of pathogen transmission is useful for estimating the ability of geographic barriers to constrain disease spread and can provide insights into contemporary and historical drivers of host population connectivity. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Diversity in fragments of artificial and natural marine habitats
PY  - 2009
AB  - In fragmented landscapes the matrix, i.e. the surrounding but different habitat, can have a strong influence on the biodiversity in fragments. The amount of natural habitat converted for urban use is increasing on every continent, so fragments of natural habitat are becoming more likely to be embedded in a matrix of human-made habitat, rather than other natural habitats. This is particularly prevalent on urbanised coastlines. Yet there has been little research to help us understand the dynamics and consequences of fragmented coastal landscapes. In Sydney, Australia, most of the natural intertidal landscape of Sydney Harbour (a mosaic of rocky shore, mudflats and sandflats) has been replaced by artificial habitat (such as seawalls). I tested the hypothesis that biota on rocky shores in Sydney Harbour would differ depending on whether shores were embedded in a matrix of artificial habitat (here called 'complete fragments'), natural habitat (here called 'natural patches'), or a mixture of the 2 types of matrix (called mixed fragments). Assemblages at mid-shore levels were significantly different among these types of fragments. At mid- and low-shore levels, assemblages were more variable in mixed fragments than in complete fragments and natural patches. The kinds of mobile and sessile taxa that contributed most to differences among fragments differed, depending on which types of fragments were compared. Many taxa were found in greater abundance in natural patches than in mixed or complete fragments, although not all comparisons were statistically significant. Artificial habitat seems to interrupt natural connectivity among local populations of intertidal marine organisms in this urbanised estuary.

TI  - Promoting and developing insect conservation in Australia's urban environments
PY  - 2018
AB  - Accelerating pressures to accommodate rapidly increasing human populations in Australia pose major problems for insect conservation in urban and periurban regions from loss of natural habitats, alien species impacts and a variety of other causes. Several urban insects have become notable flagships for promoting wider conservation interests, leading to wider appreciation of environmental benefits of ‘open spaces’, urban forests, connectivity, ‘green architecture’ and other landscape features as relevant planning considerations in urban development. Their conservation, under a range of ecological contexts and threats, occurs in conjunction with energetic advocacy and educational programs that can emphasise the roles and diversity of Australia's unique insect fauna. Approaches to conserving native insects amidst urban intensification are discussed from selected case studies and citizen science projects that illustrate principles and complexities of single-species conservation, the values of indicator and diversity surrogate taxa and the implications of alien species on native insect diversity and its losses in urban environments. Important lessons and implications include the following: (1) recognition that taxonomic and ecological diversity of insects can be high in urban areas; (2) acknowledgment that insect diversity in urban environments is vulnerable to changes and a variety of threatening processes; (3) mitigation responses that involve reducing threats, preserving open spaces with natural vegetation, creating new open areas and promoting connectivity; (4) establishment of partnerships that enhance conservation values and prospects through individual people, local authorities and government agencies; and (5) increasing awareness of insects as integral components of ecological sustainability contributing to the wider values of urban environments. © 2018 Australian Entomological Society

TI  - Introducing Transversal Connectivity Index (TCI) as a method to evaluate the effectiveness of the blue-green infrastructure at metropolitan scale
PY  - 2021
AB  - This study introduces the Transversal Connectivity Index (TCI) as an ecological indicator for classifying the natural landscape patches by their effective transversal connectivity to the water surfaces. The method applies specifically to urban areas at which the quality of blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is of fundamental importance in reducing the climate change consequences. Effective transversal connectivity among the BGI at the metropolitan scale supplies various ecosystem services in support of nature-based solutions for emerging urban challenges. The TCI value is computed (determined) by integrating a variety of existing and novel landscape indicators into an equation. The connectivity indicators belong to two categories: the intra-patch consists of the isoperimetric quotient, and patch ecological indicator, and the inter-patch ones listed as the band level, the shared border ratio, and the transport fragmentation buffer. The method is tested on the metropolitan zone of Berlin, and the results reveal unconventional findings of the effectiveness of BGI in urbanized landscapes. Despite the abundant green surfaces present in Berlin, only 50% of them have direct access to freshwater surfaces, based on Urban Atlas land use land cover data. The proposed indexing method is reproducible for other metropolitan areas, leading to comparative evaluation of effective BGI, having direct implications with emerging agendas of metropolitan management and policy making like the City Biodiversity Index, the concept of Sponge City, and Sustainable Development Goals. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - The influence of riparian corridor land use on the Pesquería River's macroinvertebrate community (N.E. Mexico)
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Earth's freshwater ecosystems are currently under threat, particularly in developing countries. In Mexico, intensive land use and inadequate monitoring policies have resulted in the severe degradation of the country's freshwater ecosystems. This study assesses how the macroinvertebrate communities in the Pesquería River, located in Northeastern Mexico, are affected by riparian land use, in order to determine their potential use as bioindicators to evaluate the macroinvertebrate integrity of the Pesquería River. First, we characterized the land use cover in the riparian channel. Second, we sampled 16 sites for benthic macroinvertebrates along the main channel during the wet and dry seasons. Third, we evaluated the influence of the riparian channel land use on the macroinvertebrate community using 42 different biological metrics. The land use characterization depicted a riparian channel mainly influenced by agricultural and urban land use. Eighty-one invertebrate taxa were identified during the study. Permutational analysis of the variance analysis confirmed significant differences across the different land use classes and the macroinvertebrate community composition while no differences were found between seasons. The indicator species analysis revealed 31 representative taxa for natural land use, 1 for urban, and 4 for agricultural land use. Our modelling analysis showed that 28 of the 42 biological metrics tested responded significantly to land use disturbances, confirming the impact of land use changes on the Pesquería River's macroinvertebrate communities and suggesting that these metrics may have a use as bioindicators. Finally, this study may provide significant biological information for further studies in similar conditions. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Assessing the landscape and ecological quality of urban green spaces in a compact city
PY  - 2014
AB  - The interrelated nature of landscape metrics calls for their joint application in analyzing complicated landscape patterns and associated ecological processes. Using geographic information system, remote-sensing and factor-analysis techniques, the landscape patterns of urban green spaces (UGS) in the compact city of Hong Kong were analyzed for their landscape-ecological quality in different land uses and districts. Using the Fragstat software, some key indices were selected to characterize the landscape mosaic with reference to patch size, patch shape, proximity relationship and edge configuration. Some old districts have smaller and more heterogeneous UGS than newer ones due to relatively low-quality landscape attributes. The landscape patterns of UGS have not improved with old-town renewal and new-town developments. In land uses with less human disturbance, UGS tend to be larger, and more homogeneous to enhance ecosystem services, and are closer to each other with more green cover to enhance connectivity and facilitate movements of organisms and people between proximal patches. Furthermore, vegetation-dominated land uses often have more complicated and hence longer UGS edges than other land uses to augment interfacial benefits. Of the 11 land uses, Government, institution and community and open space have more complicated UGS edges than more human-dominated types. The findings could inform the landscape-pattern design of UGS in compact cities to optimize their ecological qualities and benefits to both nature and residents, and to reinforce urban nature conservation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Urban primate ranging patterns: GPS-collar deployments for Macaca fascicularis and M. sylvanus
PY  - 2017
AB  - The global increase in urbanization is leading to heavier interface between humans and wildlife. Within these anthropogenic landscapes, little is known about ranging patterns, particularly with regard to urban primates. Here we present the results of the first long-term deployment of multiple GPS collars on two species of macaques to investigate the impacts of urbanization on urban primate ranging patterns in Singapore and Gibraltar. Collars data acquisition were excellent with respect to the amount, quality, and accuracy of data collected; however, remote connectivity and drop-off functionality was poor across all deployments. Analyses highlighted high variability in ranging patterns between individuals within each species that aligned with access to human food resources and patterns of tourism. Individuals from troops with less access to human food had much larger home, core, and day ranges relative to those with regular provisioning or raiding opportunities. Almost no temporal range overlap was observed between any focal individuals at either site and spatial overlap was low for all but two troops at each site. We found no relationship between anthropogenic schedules and changes in ranging patterns. Significant seasonal variation existed for daily path length and day range size for both the Singapore long-tailed and the Gibraltar Barbary macaques, with long-tailed macaques increasing their range during the equatorial monsoon season and Barbary macaques increasing their range during drier, summer months. This study highlights how the behavioral plasticity found within the genus Macaca is reflected in ranging pattern variability within urban environments. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Assessing habitat connectivity for ground-dwelling animals in an urban environment
PY  - 2014
AB  - The best model revealed spatially explicit connectivity ''pinch points,'' as well as multiple habitat connections. Cross-validation indicated the general validity of the selected connectivity model. The results show that both habitat connectivity and habitat quality affect the movement of urban hedgehogs (relative importance of the two variables was 19.2% and 80.8%, respectively), and are thus both relevant for predicting urban animal movements. To ensure viable species populations in fragmented landscapes, individuals must be able to move between suitable habitat patches. Despite the increased interest in biodiversity assessment in urban environments, the ecological relevance of habitat connectivity in highly fragmented landscapes remains largely unknown. The first step to understanding the role of habitat connectivity in urban ecology is the challenging task of assessing connectivity in the complex patchwork of contrasting habitats that is found in cities. We developed a data-based framework, minimizing the use of subjective assumptions, to assess habitat connectivity that consists of the following sequential steps: (1) identification of habitat preference based on empirical habitat-use data; (2) derivation of habitat resistance surfaces evaluating various transformation functions; (3) modeling of different connectivity maps with electrical circuit theory (Circuitscape), a method considering all possible pathways across the landscape simultaneously; and (4) identification of the best connectivity map with information-theoretic model selection. We applied this analytical framework to assess habitat connectivity for the European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, a model species for grounddwelling animals, in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, using GPS track points from 40 individuals. Our study demonstrates that even in the complex habitat patchwork of cities, habitat connectivity plays a major role for ground-dwelling animal movement. Data-based habitat connectivity maps can thus serve as an important tool for city planners to identify habitat corridors and plan appropriate management and conservation measures for urban animals. The analytical framework we describe to model such connectivity maps is generally applicable to different types of habitat-use data and can be adapted to the movement scale of the focal species. It also allows evaluation of the impact of future landscape changes or management scenarios on habitat connectivity in urban landscapes. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - An ex-post evaluation approach to assess the impacts of accomplished urban structure shift on landscape connectivity
PY  - 2018
AB  - Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of different urban structures on landscape connectivity, and most of them rely on the comparison approach or ex-ante scenario analysis. However, we still lack an ex-post method to capture the consequences of accomplished urban structure shift (from monocentric to polycentric), which is guided by the land use planning. To fill this gap, we develop an ex-post evaluation approach which integrates counterfactual analysis and landscape graphs. Counterfactual analysis is combined with cellular automata simulation model, to uncover what the city might look like, if it had continued to expand in a monocentric structure; and the landscape graphs enable us to reveal the possible landscape connectivity in actual and counterfactual scenarios. We select Nanjing city as the study area and 4 target species, to delve into the varying impacts of the urban structure shift on different taxonomic groups. Our case study demonstrates that: (1) the impact of urban structure shift is more relevant to the long disperser; (2) the actual landscape (polycentric) would facilitate the bird's dispersal, while (3) forest mammals have higher connectivity in the counterfactual scenario (monocentric), and the possible reasons are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate that the urban structure shift might not necessarily cause the connectivity decline, on condition that the key connectivity providers are identified by integrating ecological network analysis into the land use planning, and well preserved in the shift. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Distribution and spread of environmental weeds along New Zealand roadsides
PY  - 2009
AB  - Most non-native weeds and other naturalised plants are in the early stages of invasion into New Zealand landscapes. For this invasion to be controlled, even partially, it is important to understand the dominant routes, mechanisms, and rates of weed spread across landscapes. With their linear corridors of disturbed habitats, roadsides are thought to play a large role in the spread of some weeds. We used both new surveys and existing data to assess which of the 328 environmental weeds listed by the Department of Conservation are most frequently found on roadsides, where, and whether distribution patterns are consistent with linear dispersal. We also analysed historical survey data for relationships between reserve weediness and proximity to roads. We surveyed 340 plots of 100-m-long stretches of roadside across four regions and found between 2 and 19 environmental weeds per plot; 128 species in total (Chao estimate 148). Especially abundant were agricultural species (weeds and cultivated), species that have been naturalised for well over 50 years, and species that disperse externally attached to vertebrates. While we purposefully sampled within 10 km of town limits, we found no strong effect of distance from town on roadside weed richness, including richness of just ornamentally sourced weeds. Instead, number of houses within 250 m and presence of an adjacent house or other residential structure were both important, as was presence of woody vegetation on and adjacent to roadsides. Reserves adjacent to roads had significantly higher weed richness than reserves further from roads, although the causal mechanisms are unclear. Our results suggest that while roadsides include suitable habitats for most environmental weeds, distributions are patchy and roads show little sign of acting as linear dispersal corridors, instead largely reflecting neighbouring land uses. As such, roadside weeds should best be managed as part of the wider landscape. © New Zealand Ecological Society.

TI  - Human-modified landscape acts as refuge for mammals in atlantic forest
PY  - 2018
AB  - Human-modified landscapes (HMLs) are composed by small, isolated and defaunated forest fragments, which are surrounded by agricultural and urban areas. Information on species that thrives in these HMLs is essential to direct conservation strategies in local and regional scales. Since HMLs are dominant in the Atlantic Forest, we aimed to assess the mammalian diversity in a HML in southeastern Brazil and to propose conservation strategies. We collected data of terrestrial (small-, medium- and large-sized) and volant mammals in three small forest fragments (10, 14 and 26 ha) and adjacent areas, between 2003 and 2016, using complementary methods: active search, camera trapping, live-traps, mist nets and occasional records (i.e., roadkills). In addition, we used secondary data to complement our species list. We recorded 35 native mammal species (6 small-sized, 16 mediumand large-sized, and 13 bats) and seven exotic species in the HML. The recorded mammal assemblage (non-volant and volant), although mainly composed of common and generalist species, includes three medium- and large-sized species nationally threatened (Leopardus guttulus, Puma concolor and Puma yagouaroundi) and two data deficient species (Galictis cuja and Histiotus velatus), highlighting the importance of this HML for the maintenance and conservation of mammal populations. Despite highly impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, the study area harbors a significant richness of medium- and large-sized mammals, being an important biodiversity refuge in the region. However, this biodiversity is threatened by the low quality of the habitats, roadkills and abundant populations of domestic cats and dogs. Therefore, we stress the need of conservation strategies focusing on the medium- and large-sized mammals as an umbrella group, which could benefit all biodiversity in the landscape. We recommend actions that promotes biological restoration, aiming to increase structural composition and connectivity of the forest fragments, reducing roadkills and controlling the domestic cats and dogs’ populations, in order to maintain and improve the diversity of mammals in long-term. © 2018, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

TI  - Saproxylic beetle biodiversity in golf course habitats
PY  - 2016
AB  - Saproxylic beetles are a diverse group of insects that use deadwood as food or habitat at some stage of their life. While a few species of saproxylic beetles are considered to be pests, the majority of species perform important ecological roles such as decomposition, nutrient recycling, pollination in the mobile adult form, or act as food sources for other organisms. Their diversity and variable responses make them good biological indicators. Promoting biodiversity in managed areas, such as golf courses, may be relatively easy by creating saproxylic habitat. We examined the influence on saproxylic beetle communities of habitat type, log type, and distance from a fairway. Sentinel logs were provided for colonization for one season, and emergence was monitored over the following 2 years. We found that beetle species richness increased with log volume but did not change with distance from the fairway playing surface. Our findings suggest that although species richness may be low compared with that in less fragmented habitats, a diverse assortment of saproxylic beetles can be supported in golf course wooded habitats. This may be accomplished by leaving fallen trees in place when they do not pose a hazard or interfere with play. In particular, the provision of large woody debris that is more difficult to remove may maximize the benefit to superintendents and the saproxylic beetle community. Findings also support the idea that golf courses containing woody patches may increase habitat connectivity for these insects, and possibly other organisms, in otherwise highly fragmented urban areas.

TI  - Green and Blue Infrastructures as A Model of Sustainable Urban Planning—Landscape Design for Praça De Espanha in Lisbon—Portugal
PY  - 2022
AB  - The speech about Smart Cities includes a discourse where the sustainability of cities is unavoidable. Blue and green infrastructures (BGI) have a great role in cities sustainability because they offer feasible and valuable economic, social and environmental solutions for urban areas facing the challenges of climate change such as cloudbursts and droughts. BGI connects urban hydrological functions with urban nature, landscape design and planning. Thereby using the landscape systems namely blue (water) and green (vegetation) to protect against flooding and assure soil permeability among others. Within the BGI framework we propose a landscape design to Praça de Espanha in Lisbon. This landscape design is based on landscape systems (water, topography, vegetation, circulation (mobility)) and it is part of a continuous and productive landscape structure promoting the occurrence of ecologic, economic and social processes. The proposed landscape design is in line with the policies and strategies for the ecological and sustainable development strategies that Lisbon has promoted and that it is included in the smart cities principles and orientations. This landscape design promotes social inclusion where human and ecological, physical and functional connectivity are articulated promoting different types of leisure and activities, through urban space polyvalence, multifunctionality and permeability (in all senses). This design proposal combines and includes natural, ecological and heritage values as well as the cultural heritage of the place itself. Always with an ecological purpose we designed with a systemic and interconnected approach: water, topography, circulation (mobility), vegetation (creating spatiality: full/empty, light/shadow, close/open), cultural, aesthetic and poetic values, and community (as a participatory element and fundamental on the design process) promoting various functions (leisure, sports, protection and production) and creating a multifunctional landscape space, that reinforces and becomes part of the city BGI. This multifunctional landscape structure is fundamental for the sustainable development of cities, enabling a real-time response to environmental changes but also to the preservation and valuation of cultural values, heritage and identity, aesthetic concerns and leisure. It also enables partnerships among local government, civil society, communities and private sector. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Conservation value of small reserves
PY  - 2020
AB  - The importance of large reserves has been long maintained in the scientific literature, often leading to dismissal of the conservation potential of small reserves. However, over half the global protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are <100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50%) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be included in conservation planning. © 2019 Society for Conservation Biology

TI  - Invaders on the road: Synanthropic bird foraging along highways
PY  - 2013
AB  - Intercity roads potentially offer a high availability of easily accessible food and could therefore be expected to represent a preferential area for synanthropic bird foraging. As a consequence, a road-network could act as an invasion corridor for non-native urban birds. This study is a first approximation to verify such pattern of spread, by determining if foraging is actually the main activity carried out along intercity roads. With this aim, during the spring of 2011 we surveyed 200 points along the New Zealand intercity road-network, carrying out observations on four invasive synanthropic bird species (Eurasian house sparrow Passer domesticus, Eurasian blackbird Turdus merula, Eurasian starling Sturnus vulgaris and Indian myna Acridotheres tristis). For every species we also investigated: food preferences, the possibility that certain road features could affect the occurrence of feeding activity along roads, and foraging micro-habitat selection along roads. Predominant observed behaviors related to feeding activity, with differences concerning species-specific foraging strategies. Sparrows were mainly observed feeding on small-sized items (such as seeds and invertebrates), while both starlings and mynas showed more generalist feeding habits. These three species were mostly observed along the side of the lane, in contrast with blackbirds, mainly detected preying on invertebrates along the mown grassy verges of the road. Similarly to urban areas, intercity roads provide easily accessible food, available for all the study species. We propose a road-mediated invasion pattern for synanthropic birds, and encourage future studies to optimize management strategies, and targeting intercity roads as the most suitable control areas to prevent spread.

TI  - Sustainable policies to improve urban ecosystem resilience
PY  - 2017
AB  - In the contemporary debate about key issues of urban science (sustainability, environment, governance, etc.) resilience has a fundamental role. It is defined as the ability of a complex system to cope with external stresses through adaptation and mutation strategies and to return to an equilibrium state (not necessarily equal to the original one). In particular, ecosystem resilience is based on the concepts of diversity (biodiversity), redundancy (ecological variability), cycles of adaptation (multiple equilibrium states), and interaction between spatial scales (hierarchy) and temporal (activation of different times responses). In an urban context with high soil sealing, such as historical centers, it is essential to find new methods and application techniques that will be able to integrate the use of natural solutions with artificial ones and increasing ecosystem resilience and urban ecological quality. In fact, in these contexts, the percentage of permeable and green public areas available is not capable of performing ecosystem functions: so, it is necessary to act on private property through green punctual interventions (such as green roofs and walls), that may become fundamental elements of the municipal ecological network. In fact, these actions bring benefits from several points of view (environmental, economic, building comfort, etc.) The aim of the paper is to study the relationship between technical aspects and urban policies, and, in particular, to resolve the main question: how to encourage private owners to invest in green interventions for improving buildings' efficiency and environmental quality? In this process it is important to define sustainable policies acting on private property that consider both individual and global interests. Further, the article focuses on different case studies and examples taken from the United States with the objective to define similar policies in the Italian context. © 2017 WIT Press.

TI  - Estimating population density and connectivity of American mink using spatial capture-recapture
PY  - 2016
AB  - Estimating the abundance or density of populations is fundamental to the conservation and management of species, and as landscapes become more fragmented, maintaining landscape connectivity has become one of the most important challenges for biodiversity conservation. Yet these two issues have never been formally integrated together in a model that simultaneously models abundance while accounting for connectivity of a landscape. We demonstrate an application of using capture-recapture to develop a model of animal density using a least-cost path model for individual encounter probability that accounts for non-Euclidean connectivity in a highly structured network. We utilized scat detection dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a means of collecting non-invasive genetic samples of American mink (Neovison vison) individuals and used spatial capture-recapture models (SCR) to gain inferences about mink population density and connectivity. Density of mink was not constant across the landscape, but rather increased with increasing distance from city, town, or village centers, and mink activity was associated with water. The SCR model allowed us to estimate the density and spatial distribution of individuals across a 388 km2 area. The model was used to investigate patterns of space usage and to evaluate covariate effects on encounter probabilities, including differences between sexes. This study provides an application of capture-recapture models based on ecological distance, allowing us to directly estimate landscape connectivity. This approach should be widely applicable to provide simultaneous direct estimates of density, space usage, and landscape connectivity for many species. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Assessing a riverfront rehabilitation project using the comprehensive index of public accessibility
PY  - 2012
AB  - Good urban riverfronts have both ecological and social benefits in urban planning and development. With rapid increase of urban stream rehabilitation projects in developing countries, the concept of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (PAR) has become a highlight in evaluating river ecosystem improvement. In this study the Comprehensive Index of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (CIPAR) that consists of 4 sub-indexes and 12 indicators is designed for assessing the conditions of PAR. The index system is novel for its combined consideration of riverfront accessibilities and benefits. These four sub-indexes measure (1) spatial accessibility reflecting riverfront openness and main transportation convenience, (2) visual accessibility reflecting visual field openness, (3) corridor continuity reflecting riverfront vegetation condition, water-oriented settings, and spatial continuity, and (4) amenity reflecting comfortable experience of riverfront environment and diversity of riverfront activities. Based on the questionnaire and field data collected during March 1-15, 2011, 24 reaches of the Suzhou Creek and its distributaries were assessed with CIPAR, and the urban riverfront after rehabilitation was quantified. The result showed that most of the reaches of Suzhou Creek still suffered a poor-fair PAR condition, and that among the four sub-indexes, visual accessibility got the lowest score with an average score of 0.7. The unsatisfactory PAR condition along the Suzhou Creek mainly resulted from the failure in synchronizing the planning and management of riverfront land uses and river channels in previous phase of the rehabilitation project. This case study supports the use of CIPAR to assess the effectiveness of riverfront rehabilitation project. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..

TI  - Visualisation of landscape alterations with the proposed linear projects and their impacts on the ecology
PY  - 2022
AB  - Land-use transformations altering the ecosystem function have impacted the sustenance of natural resources. Implementation of unplanned developmental activities in the ecologically fragile regions has contributed to frequent landslides, conversion of perennial rivers to intermittent or seasonal rivers, reduced water retention capability, etc. Addressing these challenges entails understanding the drivers of land-use change and also their role in altering land uses. Large-scale linear projects such as roads and railways, though contribute to better infrastructure and enhance employment opportunities but severely change the landscape structure affecting peoples’ livelihood due to the reduction of ecosystem goods and services. Planned interventions are essential for adopting appropriate land-use trends and shift the trajectory of ecosystem service provision through prior visualization of land-use dynamics with likely impacts. The current study analyses the possible land-use changes in the ecologically fragile central Western Ghats with the proposed railway networks, namely (i) Mysore–Kushalnagar and (ii) Mysore–Thalassery (limited to Karnataka state), using an agent-based model (Fuzzy-AHP-CA-Markov) considering the linear project regions with a buffer of 5 km. The analyses reveal a reduction of forests by 2 and 5%, respectively, during 2010 and 2019. This trend would continue with a significant forest decline by 2026. Areas under built-up have increased over 5% during 2010–2019, which would increase by 7% (2019 and 2026) at the expense of cultivation lands. Major cities such as Mysore and Kushalnagara would witness concentrated urban growth with sprawl in the peripheries, while other towns have undergone leapfrog developments. The spatial distribution of fauna and flora indicates that most parts of the buffer region endow endemic species and serve as foraging grounds. Prediction of likely land uses in 2026 suggests that these regions would undergo large-scale alterations threatening fauna and flora. Implementing linear projects in the ecologically fragile Western Ghats would further destabilize the region, posing a threat with the increased hazard frequencies and the sustenance of natural resources. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Article puma (Puma concolor) in the neighborhood? records near human settlements and insights into human-carnivore coexistence in central Chile
PY  - 2021
AB  - The wildland-urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes-creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Wildlife sightings near human settlements have appeared to increase in the last years. This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the O'Higgins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km2 of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range. Our results contribute to the understanding of the presence and movements of P. concolor near urban areas and human settlements, confirming their persistence in and adaptation to human-dominated landscapes. We also provide insights into human-carnivore coexistence in the current global context in the densely populated central Chile.

TI  - Homogenisation and fragmentation of the European landscape: Ecological consequences and solutions
PY  - 2002
AB  - The rural landscapes of Europe are in both a homogenisation and a fragmentations process. Regional differences are disappearing due to the dominating equalising impact of the worldwide market. If regional differences are not maintained and protected then the cultural landscapes of Europe and their biological diversity will decline and only remnants will remain. Models on agricultural management and data on landscape changes from all Europe confirm this. Regional differences have to be maintained through conscious environmental and ecological planning. Concepts for this have been developed in all countries in Europe, such as the ecostabilisation concept and the concept of ecological networks. Nature management by farmers is more and more accepted. Landscape planners should be aware of their changing role from designer towards negotiator with the actors in the landscape with different landscape functions and planning tasks in mind. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Does infill outperform climate-adaptive growth policies in meeting sustainable urbanization goals? A scenario-based study in California, USA
PY  - 2017
AB  - Land allocation for urban growth is central to sustainable development strategy because urban growth can impact space available for food production, ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Urbanization is a growing stressor due the 2.5 billion additional people projected to live in urban areas by 2050. Potential climate change impacts to natural systems increase the need for sustainable urbanization, which should integrate land use needs for urban growth with climate adaptation objectives such as maintaining biodiversity, food production and ecosystem services. Here we compare climate-neutral and climate-adaptive urbanization scenarios to see which produces the most sustainable urbanization, defined as being the most effective at meeting development, conservation, and two climate adaptation objectives. We modeled five urban growth scenarios portraying an increase of 25.8 million people by 2050 for California, USA comprising three climate-neutral scenarios: business-as-usual, compact-new-growth and infill (redevelopment); and two climate-adaptive scenarios: preservation of agricultural climate refugia or future plant dispersal corridors. Infill was the least impacting for the multiple objectives tested; preserving 46–57% more land for other uses. Each climate-adaptive scenario reduced land consumption for its respective target, but increased impacts to the opposite climate-adaptive scenario target. Infill has the potential to contribute towards sustainable urbanization, particularly if combined with other climate adaptation targets.

TI  - Demographic and genetic viability of a medium-sized ground-dwelling mammal in a fire prone, rapidly urbanizing landscape
PY  - 2018
AB  - The rapid and large-scale urbanization of peri-urban areas poses major and complex challenges for wildlife conservation. We used population viability analysis (PVA) to evaluate the influence of urban encroachment, fire, and fauna crossing structures, with and without accounting for inbreeding effects, on the metapopulation viability of a medium-sized grounddwelling mammal, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus), in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We surveyed two metapopulations over one and a half years, and parameterized the PVA models using largely field-collected data. The models revealed that spatial isolation imposed by housing and road encroachment has major impacts on I. obesulus. Although the species is known to persist in small metapopulations at moderate levels of habitat fragmentation, the models indicate that these populations become highly vulnerable to demographic decline, genetic deterioration, and local extinction under increasing habitat connectivity loss. Isolated metapopulations were also predicted to be highly sensitive to fire, with large-scale fires having greater negative impacts on population abundance than smallscale ones. To reduce the risk of decline and local extirpation of I. obesulus and other smallto medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals in urbanizing, fire prone landscapes, we recommend that remnant vegetation and vegetated, structurally-complex corridors between habitat patches be retained. Well-designed road underpasses can be effective to connect habitat patches and reduce the probability of inbreeding and genetic differentiation; however, adjustment of fire management practices to limit the size of unplanned fires and ensure the retention of long unburnt vegetation will also be required to ensure persistence. Our study supports the evidence that in rapidly urbanizing landscapes, a pro-Active conservation approach is required that manages species at the metapopulation level and that prioritizes metapopulations and habitat with greater long-Term probability of persistence and conservation capacity, respectively. This strategy may help us prevent future declines and local extirpations, and currently relatively common species from becoming rare. © 2018 Ramalho et al.

TI  - Trade-associated pathways of alien forest insect entries in Canada
PY  - 2012
AB  - Long-distance introductions of new invasive species have often been driven by socioeconomic factors, such that traditional \"biological\" invasion models may not be capable of estimating spread fully and reliably. In this study we present a new methodology to characterize and predict pathways of human-assisted entries of alien forest insects. We have developed a stochastic quantitative model of how these species may be moved with commodity flow through a network of international marine ports and major transportation corridors in Canada. The study makes use of a Canadian roadside survey database and data on Canadian marine imports, complemented with geo-referenced information on ports of entry, populated places and empirical observations of historical spread rates for invasive pests. The model is formulated as a probabilistic pathway matrix, and allows for quantitative characterization of likelihoods and vectors of new pest introductions from already or likely-to-be infested locations. We applied the pathway model to estimate the rates of human-assisted entry of alien forest insect species across Canada as well as cross-border transport to locations in the US. Results suggest a relatively low nationwide entry rate for Canada when compared to the US (0.338 new forest insect species per year vs. 1.89). Among Canadian urban areas, Greater Toronto and Greater Vancouver appear to have the highest alien forest insect entry potential, exhibiting species entry rates that are comparable with estimated rates at mid-size US urban metropolises. © 2011 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

TI  - Examining the occurrence of mammal species in natural areas within a rapidly urbanizing region of Texas, USA
PY  - 2017
AB  - In much of the United States and elsewhere, urbanization continues to transform landscapes. In central Texas, anthropogenic conversion of land is due in part to a rapidly growing population in the Austin and San Antonio metro areas and the subsequent infrastructure and resources needed to support that growth. Protected natural areas adjacent to urbanized landscapes are often intended to mitigate the impact of land development by serving as wildlife habitat. To maximize the potential of this habitat, we must assess how urbanization influences the occurrence of species in these natural areas (e.g., parks, greenspaces, preserves). We used motion-activated cameras to survey 72 sites (points) across six different regions throughout the urban corridor from San Antonio to Austin. Using occupancy modeling, we examined the influence of ten different urbanization factors (model covariates) on the occurrence of a variety of medium-sized mammal species. Generalist species, such as raccoons and opossums, had an increased probability of occurrence at sites with greater urban influence and were most likely to occur in smaller more urbanized study areas. Ringtails and grey foxes appeared to be unaffected by urbanization and were equally likely to occur across all sites. None of the other examined species were found to have a conclusively positive or negative response to urbanization. Knowledge of the effect of urbanization on wildlife will be important in evaluating current preserves as well as planning future preserves. Our study suggests that natural areas within urbanizing landscapes can be effective in providing habitat for some wildlife species. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sugarcane and Eucalyptus plantation equally limit the movement of two forest-dependent understory bird species
PY  - 2018
AB  - Habitat fragmentation results in landscape configuration, which affects the species that inhabit it. As a consequence, natural habitat is replaced by different anthropogenic plantation types (e.g. pasture, agriculture, forestry plantations and urban areas). Anthropogenic plantations are important for biodiversity maintenance because some species or functional groups can use it as a complementary habitat. However, depending on plantation permeability, it can act as a barrier to the movement of organisms between habitat patches, such as forest fragments, reducing functional connectivity for many species. Anthropogenic plantations are becoming the most common land use and cover type in the Anthropocene and biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes requires information on how different plantation types affect the capacity of the species to move through the landscape. In this study, we evaluated the influence of the type and structure of plantations on the movement of two forest-dependent understory bird species – plain antvireo (Dysithamnus mentalis) and flavescent warbler (Myiothlyps flaveola) – within a highly fragmented landscape of Atlantic Forest hotspot. Knowing that forestry plantation is assumed to be more permeable to dependent forest bird species than open ones, we selected six study areas containing a forest fragment and surrounding plantation: three with sugarcane plantation and three with Eucalyptus sp. plantation. We used playback calls to stimulate the birds to leave forest fragments and traverse the plantations. Control trials were also carried out inside the forest fragments to compare the distances crossed. We observed that individuals moved longer distances inside forest than between plantation types, which demonstrate that plantations do constrict the movements of both species. The two plantation types equally impeded the movements of the species, suggesting the opposite of the general assumption that forestry plantations are more permeable. Our results indicate that, for generalist species, plantation type does not matter, but its presence negatively impacts movement of these bird species. We highlight that plantations have negative influences on the movements of common bird species, and discuss why this is important when setting conservation priorities. © 2018 Ecological Society of Australia

TI  - The specially protected natural reservation in urban areas: The legal status, governance, development and use in tourism and recreation activity (on the example of the SPNR system of the city of lipetsk)
PY  - 2016
AB  - In the article the questions of the organization of the specially protected natural reservationspecially protected natural reservations in the city and suburbs are considered. Tendencies in identification and creation of city SPNR are analyzed. On the example of Lipetsk the creation problems of local SPNR, typical for Russia, are revealed. In the city governance there was no idea that the created SPNR system had to be included in common regional structure of SPNR, had to be built considering the city development and, finally, to enter in the ecological framework of the city. The significant problem of SPNR creation is an administrative accessory of the land plots within the city and in close proximity to it. The unwillingness of the city authorities to consider large territories as potential local SPNR led them to the idea of creation of chain of especially protected natural objects (separate trees). In most cases, park territories which by definition are created for the organization of population recreational activity have the SPNR status in the cities. Therefore there is a need of combination of nature protection and recreational functions in these territories. SPNR make a basis for structure of the city ecological framework which needs to be divided into internal and external elements (internal and external ecological framework). External elements should be aimed to preservation of biological and landscape diversity and to be the buffer for closely guarded territories (nature reserves). The external ecological framework of the city has to cover the territory of the city and its suburbs. Internal elements should be aimed to preservation of the quasi natural environment in the city and to be the ecological corridors, making the city landscape ecologically transparent. © 2016 Klimov, Karandeev and Belyaeva.

TI  - Uncertainties in mapping forest carbon in urban ecosystems
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Spatially explicit urban forest carbon estimation provides a baseline map for understanding the variation in forest vertical structure, informing sustainable forest management and urban planning. While high-resolution remote sensing has proven promising for carbon mapping in highly fragmented urban landscapes, data cost and availability are the major obstacle prohibiting accurate, consistent, and repeated measurement of forest carbon pools in cities. This study aims to evaluate the uncertainties of forest carbon estimation in response to the combined impacts of remote sensing data resolution and neighborhood spatial patterns in Charlotte, North Carolina. The remote sensing data for carbon mapping were resampled to a range of resolutions, i.e., LiDAR point cloud density – 5.8, 4.6, 2.3, and 1.2 pt s/m2, aerial optical NAIP (National Agricultural Imagery Program) imagery – 1, 5, 10, and 20 m. Urban spatial patterns were extracted to represent area, shape complexity, dispersion/interspersion, diversity, and connectivity of landscape patches across the residential neighborhoods with built-up densities from low, medium-low, medium-high, to high. Through statistical analyses, we found that changing remote sensing data resolution introduced noticeable uncertainties (variation) in forest carbon estimation at the neighborhood level. Higher uncertainties were caused by the change of LiDAR point density (causing 8.7–11.0% of variation) than changing NAIP image resolution (causing 6.2–8.6% of variation). For both LiDAR and NAIP, urban neighborhoods with a higher degree of anthropogenic disturbance unveiled a higher level of uncertainty in carbon mapping. However, LiDAR-based results were more likely to be affected by landscape patch connectivity, and the NAIP-based estimation was found to be significantly influenced by the complexity of patch shape.

TI  - Phytoplankton responses to adaptive management interventions in eutrophic urban estuaries
PY  - 2019
AB  - Upstream anthropogenic perturbations can dramatically affect estuarine water quality, especially in small systems where water retention times are high. Management of these modified ecosystems often requires direct interventions to prevent detrimental long-term effects. The heavily urbanized and temporarily closed Zandvlei Estuary in South Africa has a long history of anthropogenic manipulation, and therefore acts as an ideal case-study to gauge reactive management practices. Continued deterioration of estuarine water quality and ecological functioning prompted the adoption of an adaptive management approach. Subsequent management interventions to increase salinity variability and nutrient removal included the (1) adoption of a mouth management plan, (2) regular harvesting of submerged vegetation, and (3) removal of flow obstructions. Physico-chemical and nutrient monitoring data (2010–2018) were assessed to document the response of phytoplankton to these interventions. Time-series analysis indicated an upward trend in salinity throughout the estuary. This corresponded with a temporal decline in phytoplankton biomass levels and was supported by model results that highlighted a strongly inverse relationship with salinity. The frequency of high-biomass events (&gt;80 μg Chl-a l−1) also declined in each of the designated estuarine zones. In April 2012, an extensive harmful algal bloom (HAB) of Prymnesium parvum (Prymnesiophyceae) was recorded (~530 μg Chl-a l−1) in the estuary, culminating in hypoxic conditions (O2 &lt; 2 mg l−1) and fish kills. However, the subsequent mechanical breaching of the mouth has prevented reoccurrences of P. parvum. Similarly, more saline conditions arising from increased marine connectivity reduced the abundance of the previously dominant Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae classes. The overall improvement in water quality validates the efficacy of management interventions aimed at restoring and conserving ecosystem functionality. Yet, these efforts are a deviation from natural estuarine functioning and thus a ‘catchment to coast’ approach that incorporates upstream nutrient mitigation measures is needed to achieve sustainable long-term management objectives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The ground beneath your feet: Digital elevation data for today and tomorrow
PY  - 2011
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) are fundamental data infrastructure that support a large range of applications in environmental modelling. The distribution of solar radiation, patterns of wetness and water movement, mobility of animals and evolution of soils are all intimately linked to topographic form. DEMs for the Australian continent have progressed from 1/10 th degree resolution in 1982 to 1/40 th degree in 1991, 9 second (1/400th degree) in 1996 and now 1 second (about 30 m) derived from the NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM). Each improvement in resolution and accuracy enables new applications as more detail and structure are revealed. The 1 second SRTM-derived DEMs for Australia are now publicly available through the Geoscience Australia National Elevation Data Framework (NEDF) portal (http://nedf.ga.gov.au). The raw SRTM data has been processed through a series of steps to provide several products suitable for different purposes: • DEM-S is a bare-earth elevation model with stripes and voids removed, offsets due to trees treated and noise substantially reduced in flatter areas by adaptive smoothing, which is suitable for most applications where connectivity of flow is not the primary concern such as calculation of slopes and topographic position • DEM-H is a hydrologically conditioned elevation model derived from DEM-S with drainage enforcement using 1:250,000 scale stream lines, which is suitable for applications where hydrological connectivity is of primary concern such as calculation of contributing areas and catchment delineation • DEM is the pre-cursor to DEM-S before adaptive smoothing, which may be useful when the retention of detail is more important than smoothness. There is also a cleaned digital surface model (DSM) that is the precursor to DEM-S before tree offsets are removed, which is restricted to Australian government use only. Most users of DEMs need information about the shape of the landscape, not just height, so we are producing a set of standard derived products including slope, aspect, curvatures, topographic position, relief, contributing area and wetness index. These derived surfaces are key inputs for continental scale prediction of soil properties and ecological patterns. Predictions of a suite of key soil properties on a 3 second grid for the Australian continent, using the 1 second terrain layers, are being developed and will contribute to the GlobalSoilMap.net global grid of soil properties. Catchments and stream lines derived from DEM-H will form the basis for future versions of the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (http://www.bom.gov. au/water/geofabric/index.shtml). Digital elevation data continues to improve as measurement technology improves. Airborne lidar already provides high precision terrain data with vertical accuracy of 20 cm or better at 1 m horizontal resolution or better. This data is available in parts of Australia where the better accuracy justifies the high cost, such as urban areas, coastal lowlands, wetlands and floodplains. We need to develop ways of using high resolution data covering limited areas in combination with lower resolution data covering the continent. New global DEMs are being acquired and will replace SRTM in the years ahead. The TANDEM-X satellite radar system will potentially produce global elevations at 2-3 times better resolution and accuracy than SRTM, and other systems will follow. Higher resolutions bring further technical challenges, not least in data volume: each 1 second DEM product for Australia is a 40 GB dataset and finer resolutions will be correspondingly larger.

TI  - Genetic basis and evolution of rapid cycling in railway populations of tetraploid Arabidopsis arenosa
PY  - 2018
AB  - Spatially structured plant populations with diverse adaptations provide powerful models to investigate evolution. Human-generated ruderal habitats are abundant and low-competition, but are challenging for plants not adapted to them. Ruderal habitats also sometimes form networked corridors (e.g. roadsides and railways) that allow rapid long-distance spread of successfully adapted variants. Here we use transcriptomic and genomic analyses, coupled with genetic mapping and transgenic follow-up, to understand the evolution of rapid cycling during adaptation to railway sites in autotetraploid Arabidopsis arenosa. We focus mostly on a hybrid population that is likely a secondary colonist of a railway site. These mountain railway plants are phenotypically similar to their cosmopolitan cousins. We thus hypothesized that colonization primarily involved the flow of adaptive alleles from the cosmopolitan railway variant. But our data shows that it is not that simple: while there is evidence of selection having acted on introgressed alleles, selection also acted on rare standing variation, and new mutations may also contribute. Among the genes we show have allelic divergence with functional relevance to flowering time are known regulators of flowering, including FLC and CONSTANS. Prior implications of these genes in weediness and rapid cycling supports the idea that these are \"evolutionary hotspots\" for these traits. We also find that one of two alleles of CONSTANS under selection in the secondary colonist was selected from rare standing variation in mountain populations, while the other was introgressed from the cosmopolitan railway populations. The latter allele likely arose in diploid populations over 700km away, highlighting how ruderal populations could act as allele conduits and thus influence local adaptation.

TI  - Connotation, characteristics and recognition of semi-natural habitats in agricultural space
PY  - 2022
AB  - Maintaining the ecological security of agricultural space is an important goal of comprehensive land remediation and ecological restoration. The semi-natural habitats (SNHs) in the transitional zone between natural and artificial habitats can be called \"shared space\", which are formed under the strong interaction of natural elements and artificial elements. SNHs have ecological assemblages which have been substantially modified in their composition, balance or function by human activities. They have evolved through traditional agricultural, pastoral or other human activities and depended on their continuation to retain their characteristic composition, structure and function. Despite not being natural, these habitats and ecosystems often have the characteristics of diversification of resource types, complex landscape pattern and diversification of ecological functions, providing high value in terms of biodiversity and other ecosystem services. There is no gainsaying that it is a key area to ensure and improve the ecosystem health of agricultural space. By analyzing the connotation and characteristics of SNHs, taking Luojiang District of Sichuan Province as an example, the SNHs in agricultural space were identified from the perspective of pattern. The results showed that; (1) the proportion of SNHs in Luojiang District was 27.28%, mainly concentrated in the mixed agricultural and forestry areas, followed by the urban and rural areas. The agricultural concentration areas had a relatively low proportion of SNHs, and there had problems such as small habitat area, fragmented patches, and blocked connectivity. (2) The proportion of ecological SNHs was 17.28%, that was mainly distributed in the fringes of agricultural concentration areas. And the proportion of artificial SNHs was 10.00%, which was mainly distributed in the surrounding areas of large residential areas and in mountainous areas with mixed land use. (3) From the perspective of overall space, the region formed a gradual distribution pattern of agricultural concentration areas-ecological SNHs-artificial SNHs-artificial habitats or natural habitats. And the landscape pattern could be summarized as four patterns of \"sheet core-environmental screen -corridor-patch\". (4) In the new era of territorial space planning, the research on semi-natural habitats in agricultural space needs to link urban space and ecological space to achieve systematic protection and restoration, so as to provide adaptability for the management and control of territorial space under the constraints of China's current national policy of food security and ecological civilization construction strategy. © 2022 Science Press.

TI  - The acoustics of a small south pacific country - Environmental noise management in New Zealand
PY  - 2006
AB  - Like most developed nations of the world, there are significant environmental noise issues in new Zealand. There are a range of management methods that are being used to control the effects of noise. These can be summarised as; a) reducing noise at the source b) reducing the transmission of noise c) avoiding or mitigating noise at the receiving end. Under the current New Zealand legislative regime policies and rules are in place at each of these levels to provide some measure of comfort that environmental noise effects are being managed, at least to some degree. The most significant area for concern is probably land transport noise experienced along major road corridors, particularly in built up, urban areas, and residential subdivisions near these roads where there appears to be no methods in place to control or reduce the slowly increasing total noise associated within incremental growth in road traffic volumes. At this stage New Zealand lacks methods to suitably identify and evaluate the adverse environmental noise effects of the existing land transport system, and methods to provide information on possible benefits that could be delivered by adopting any selected policy. It appears such deficiencies may be planned to be addressed in a policy development process underway at the Ministry of Transport, however having established such methods in the future, the government still needs to develop methods to allocate resources to mitigate the effects of noise from the existing network. Although not as prominent an issue as road transport noise, noise associated with the movement of passengers and freight by rail also needs to be considered as currently there are no policies in this regard. Ironically, the more complex matter of managing noise from commercial and industrial premises appears to be reasonably well handled at the local authority level under the duties and responsibilities imposed on them by the Resource Management Act. Mixed use urban environments are typified by commercial and residential activities, often sited in close proximity to each other. In accordance with overseas trends, population densities in city centres are increasing as the numbers of inner city apartments increase each year. While noise from such sources as street works and rubbish collection can cause problems it is the potential noise effects of commercial activities (such as entertainment premises in inner city living areas) that District Plans appear able to adequately control. Not all local authorities have achieved success in this, however it is important to note that the policy and management methods exist and it is often a matter of each Council developing appropriate action steps within the available policy tools to hand Experience in New Zealand has shown that setting noise limits at the site boundary is often the best way to minimise adverse noise effects on sensitive land use activities in the local area. Setting district plan noise limits higher than normal guideline levels for areas used for residential purposes would normally be accompanied by a parallel requirement for acoustic insulation of all new buildings housing noise-sensitive activities. Experience in New Zealand indicates the use of \"Noise Management Plans\" within planning rules and requirements can be an effective method for ensuring environmental noise is adequately controlled. For example, Noise Management Plans have been put in place where there is vigorous community reaction to potential noise effects from airport expansions or new industrial plantrs near residential sites. A noise management plan usually contains: identification of the range of potential noise sources specific steps that will be taken to ensure compliance with specified noise limits (these may be linked to a resource consent or district plan limit) a written undertaking from the author (eg. an acoustic engineer) that the means given in the plan will be adequate to ensure compliance with the noise limits specified in the conditions a programme of noise measurement to check that compliance has been achieved through monitoring and testing. Overall, while the New Zealand experience in developing and putting in practice effective methods to manage noise in the environment, is generally positive.

TI  - Lateral and longitudinal patterns of water physico-chemistry and trace metal distribution and partitioning in a large river floodplain
PY  - 2017
AB  - Floodplain water bodies provide habitat to diversified ecological communities. Floodplains are also among the most impacted aquatic ecosystems. While the link between the lateral connectivity of floodplain sites to the main channel and their plant, fish and invertebrate communities has been well established, detailed information on chemical characteristics and particularly on trace metal spatial distribution and partitioning is scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the link between the lateral connectivity and physico-chemical variables, their trace metal concentrations and partitioning as well as the upstream-downstream gradient of these parameters. In connected and disconnected water bodies of the Rhone River upstream and downstream of the city of Lyon, we measured major ions, dissolved organic carbon, trace metal concentrations (Al, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and U) in water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediment. The results revealed a clear difference between connected and disconnected water bodies. pH, SPM, Na+, and NO3- concentrations were lower in disconnected sites while conductivity, DOC, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were higher. Conductivity and a part of the major ion concentrations increased in the downstream sections. Trace metal concentrations and partitioning varied between connected and disconnected sites. In the dissolved fraction, trace metal concentrations were higher in connected sites. In the surface sediment, concentrations were higher in disconnected sites for the majority of metals. The upstream-downstream gradient was less important than the connected-disconnected gradient. Only three metals in the dissolved fraction (Cu, Cd and Pb) showed a clear increase in downstream sections. Overall, the study shows that the functioning of floodplains produces strong spatial patterns concerning the concentrations and partitioning of trace metals. These findings improve our understanding of trace metal biogeochemistry in floodplains and have important applications for floodplain restoration projects.

TI  - Investigating the ecology of the Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus) within the wider bumblebee community in North-West Ireland
PY  - 2021
AB  - Bumblebees are a key pollinator group globally which have declined over time. However, while some species remain common others are rare and have declined at a sharper rate. The Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus Morawitz) is classified as ‘Endangered’ on the Irish Red List, and ‘Vulnerable’ at European level. We aimed to investigate the ecology of B. distinguendus within the wider bumblebee community in its only remaining Irish population to inform conservation management. Eight true bumblebee species were recorded in total in four habitat types surveyed, with highest species richness in species-rich grassland and highest abundance in urban habitats. Highest numbers of B. distinguendus were found in two designated nature reserves. However, outside these reserves the species was only found in three of twelve sites surveyed in both species-rich and coastal grassland habitats. B. distinguendus is a late emerging species in this region with a foraging preference for Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra). Availability of key forage species was lowest when numbers of B. distinguendus were highest, potentially limiting survival of this species. Some smaller suitable habitats in urban areas and roadside verges were not used by the species, which suggests potential issues with habitat connectivity, patch size and/or availability of nesting and hibernation sites. Based on our findings, we suggest that existing species-rich and coastal grassland sites should be conserved, and other areas restored, for B. distinguendus in Ireland. Conservation management should focus on delaying cutting grasslands until late September, winter grazing of stock and reducing pesticides and fertilisers with the aim of increasing forage availability in late season, and ensuring that suitable habitats are connected in the landscape to allow adequate habitat area as well as movement and dispersal of the species to new areas.

TI  - Multiple scale protection planning of waterbird habitats in Xi'an Chanba River wetland
PY  - 2008
AB  - Urban wetland and wildlife diversity protection is the important task of urban ecological construction. With the case study of Chan-ba River wetland in Xian City, the issues of urban waterbird habitat protection planning are discussed in this paper. By field investigation, the study area is found feeding 20 species, belonging to 8 orders and 12 families, showing a high birds diversity level. Some indigenous plant species and different habitat types are also found in the study area, with high value in sight of urban nature protection. The protection of the waterbird habitats in Chanba river wetland should be based on the relating theories of landscape ecology, conservation biology, and metapopulation, and carried on from different spatial scale. The main approaches include; habitat network construction, small habitat design, water depth control, and land use pattern optimization in riparian zone, plant community organization.

TI  - Landscape structures affect risk of canine distemper in urban wildlife
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urbanization rapidly changes landscape structure worldwide, thereby enlarging the human-wildlife interface. The emerging urban structures should have a key influence on the spread and distribution of wildlife diseases such as canine distemper, by shaping density, distribution and movements of wildlife. However, little is known about the role of urban structures as proxies for disease prevalence. To guide management, especially in densely populated cities, assessing the role of landscape structures in hampering or promoting disease prevalence is thus of paramount importance. Between 2008 and 2013, two epidemic waves of canine distemper hit the urban red fox (Vulpes vulpes) population of Berlin, Germany. The directly transmitted canine distemper virus (CDV) causes a virulent disease infecting a range of mammals with high host mortality, particularly in juveniles. We extracted information about CDV serological state (seropositive or seronegative), sex and age for 778 urban fox carcasses collected by the state laboratory Berlin Brandenburg. To assess the impact of urban landscape structure heterogeneity (e.g., richness) and shares of green and gray infrastructures at different spatial resolutions (areal of 28 ha, 78 ha, 314 ha) on seroprevalence we used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models with binomial distributions. Our results indicated that predictors derived at a 28 ha resolution were most informative for describing landscape structure effects (AUC = 0.92). The probability to be seropositive decreased by 66% (0.6 to 0.2) with an increasing share of gray infrastructure (40 to 80%), suggesting that urbanization might hamper CDV spread in urban areas, owing to a decrease in host density (e.g., less foxes or raccoons) or an absence of wildlife movement corridors in strongly urbanized areas. However, less strongly transformed patches such as close-to-nature areas in direct proximity to water bodies were identified as high risk areas for CDV transmission. Therefore, surveillance and disease control actions targeting urban wildlife or human-wildlife interactions should focus on such areas. The possible underlying mechanisms explaining the prevalence distribution may be increased isolation, the absence of alternative hosts or an abiotic environment, all impairing the ability of CDV to persist without a host. © 2018 Gras, Knuth, Börner, Marescot, Benhaiem, Aue, Wittstatt, Kleinschmit and Kramer-Schadt.

TI  - Landscape structure influences pollinator movements and directly affects plant reproductive success
PY  - 2012
AB  - Pollinators play a key role within most terrestrial communities in maintaining plant populations, as well as pollinating many agricultural crops for seed and fruit production. The mobility of pollinating animals is significant to their importance but we know little about how landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can influence the flight directions of bumblebees (Bombus spp. Hymenoptera, Apidae), one of Europe's most important groups of pollinators. A bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on plant reproductive success - plants had increased pollinator activity, pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections. The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on bumblebees for pollination services. © 2011 The Authors.

TI  - Landscape, habitat characteristics and the genetic population structure of two caddisflies
PY  - 2007
AB  - 1. In a region of south-eastern England, we investigated the hierarchical genetic structure of populations of two stream-dwelling caddisflies (Trichoptera: Polycentropodidae) with contrasting distributions: Plectrocnemia conspersa inhabits numerous small, patchily distributed seeps and streams, while the confamilial Polycentropus flavomaculatus is found in fewer but larger streams and rivers. We also contrasted the genetic structure of P. conspersa in the lowland south-east with that in an upland region in the north west. 2. Microsatellite genotypes were obtained from samples of both species taken from a 'core area' and at sites 15, 40 and 100 km from this core (two regions for P. conspersa, totalling 45 sites and 1405 larvae; one region for P. flavomaculatus, totalling 10 sites and 269 larvae). 3. The genetic structure of P. conspersa differed in the two regions. In the upland north-west, significant genetic differentiation was observed at a spatial scale of around 40 km from the core, while there was no structure in the lowland south-east up to around 100 km. Areas of high altitude did not appear directly to reduce gene flow, whereas other potential landscape barriers, including particular geological formations, large urban areas and the sea had a pronounced effect. 4. Weak genetic differentiation in P. conspersa across large distances, particularly in the lowland south-east, suggests that it disperses strongly, facilitating gene flow within and between catchments. Conversely, for P. flavomaculatus we found strong genetic differentiation between almost all sites, suggesting that dispersal is much more limited. 5. Greater dispersal in the patchily distributed P. conspersa than in P. flavomaculatus, which occupies larger and presumably more persistent habitats, could be a general feature of other similarly distributed aquatic insects. While higher relief is potentially a partial barrier to dispersal, P. conspersamust have effective gene flow through such apparently inhospitable terrain, perhaps attributable to dispersal between neighbouring small and ephemeral populations. Indeed, its exploitation of headwaters and seeps requires the ability to disperse between such sites. Apparently it cannot, however, overcome more continuous barriers, consisting of large tracts of landscape with few habitable larval sites. Such landscapes, including those created by humans, may have a stronger effect on population connectivity and colonization in the longer term. © 2007 The Authors.

TI  - Qualitative variation in roadside weed vegetation along an urban-rural road gradient
PY  - 2012
AB  - Information on mechanisms of differentiation or homogenization of urban floras is deficient, despite their importance for urban nature conservation and urban land management. Roads, as a major human promoter of urbanization, can be an initial habitat for plants dispersed by transportations. We assumed that variation in weed vegetation along urban-rural roadside gradients is small, particularly in curbside cracks. We classified vegetation occurring in curbside cracks along the National Route 3 in southern Japan and compared the characteristics of the vegetation types recognized. Species in curbside cracks were recorded on 40 plots. Three vegetation types were classified, in part related to surrounding land-use types. Although the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the number of native species clearly differed among the vegetation types in the curbside cracks, no significant differences between the three floristic vegetation types were found in the number of non-natives and invasive alien species. This may result from the small specificity and complexity of landscape structures, due to the continuity and connectivity of paved-road networks. Of the 122 species, 44 were non-natives or invasive alien species. The vegetation types generally involved the same plant families, with large numbers of species from the Asteraceae and Poaceae, regardless of vegetation types, but frequency of occurrence of the two families clearly differed between natives and non-natives and invasive alien species. Ephemeral non-natives and invasive alien species, particularly Asteraceae and Poaceae, seem to have advantageous dispersal strategies or low habitat dependency facilitating their occurrence in curbside cracks, regardless of adjacent land uses and the urban-rural landscape gradient. Expansion of these species may cause a homogenization of regional floras along roads. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Comparison of bird diversity between temperate floodplain forests and urban parks
PY  - 2022
AB  - Biodiversity in urban green areas has been widely explored in several bird studies because birds are known to be important bio-indicators. Many studies have investigated the different responses of bird communities to urbanization and land use changes in urban environments. However, there are still important knowledge gaps related to the impacts of the heterogeneity, spatial structure, and connectivity of green areas on avian diversity. Such information is needed for sustainable urban planning. In this study, we focused on the comparison of bird communities between urban parks in the heritage city of Olomouc and hardwood floodplain forests in the vicinity of the city. The results of the study indicate the high importance of urban parks for the maintenance of bird diversity even though urban parks are man-made habitats. The results highlight the importance of some native vegetation structures in urban parks (old trees, bush ecotones) for maintaining urban bird biodiversity. Some implications of the results can be widely used as a decision support tool for the management of urban green areas and for the planning of ecological networks in urban landscapes. © 2021

TI  - The response of herpetofauna to urbanization: Inferring patterns of persistence from wildlife databases
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urbanization involves the conversion of natural habitats into human-modified ecosystems and is known to reduce the diversity and abundance of indigenous plant and animal communities. Urbanization may lead to the extinction of indigenous species or facilitate the establishment of non-indigenous communities in cities and towns. We analysed sighting records held in wildlife databases to infer the probability of persistence of reptiles and amphibians (‘herpetofauna’) within Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Throughout greater Melbourne, 81% (13) of the 16 frog species recorded had ≥95% probability of being extant in 2006, compared with 56% (22) of the 39 species of reptiles recorded. The number of frog species that had ≥95% probability of being extant in inner local government areas (LGAs) within 10 km of the centre of Melbourne was higher (86%) than in the outer LGAs (69%). Conversely, only 46% of reptile species had ≥95% probability of being extant in inner and outer LGAs. The proportion of reptile species with <50% probability of being extant in inner LGAs was higher than for frog species (25% and 7%, respectively), suggesting that reptiles have been negatively affected by urbanization to a much greater extent than frogs. Based on the probability of species being extant, frogs and reptiles exhibited variations in their response to urbanization between species that persisted (urban-adapters) and species that did not (urban-sensitive or urban-avoiders). These differences in response were likely related to individual species' life-history and their requirements for habitat, space and dispersal. To conserve herpetofauna in urban areas we need to maintain structural complexity in remnant habitat patches, and implement strategic policies and management actions that protect habitat remnants and habitat corridors.

TI  - Identifying eradication units in an invasive mammalian pest species
PY  - 2014
AB  - Eradication of invasive species is an important component for species conservation and ecosystem restoration. Success of eradications is dependent on knowledge of population connectivity in order to determine reinvasion pathways, and hence populations requiring simultaneous eradication (eradication units). The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) was introduced into New Zealand from Australia and Tasmania, and now occupies a wide range of habitats across the majority of New Zealand. Possums are one of the most destructive invaders within New Zealand, with extensive control operations occurring throughout the country. Understanding the population connectivity of possums on mainland New Zealand (North and South Islands) will enhance the success of planned eradications. We examined the genetic population structure of invasive possums to identify gene flow, thus reinvasion pathways, between seven populations around Dunedin and on the Otago Peninsula where eradication of possums is occurring. Genetic variation at 12 microsatellite loci was comparable between all sampled populations and exhibited a significant isolation by distance pattern. Bayesian clustering methods supported the existence of two population clusters, indicating the presence of a reinvasion pathway onto the Otago Peninsula from urban areas at the Southern end of the Peninsula. To avoid recolonisation, all possums on the Otago Peninsula should be eradicated simultaneously, with the implementation and ongoing maintenance and monitoring of an urban buffer zone. We recommend pre-eradication genetic analyses be adopted by all pest managers to define appropriate eradication units, thereby maximising eradication success and avoiding costly failures. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii) have been extending their breeding range into urban areas, prompting questions about the relative importance of cities to the demography and conservation of these raptors. A key unanswered question is how urban subpopulations interact with their precedent exurban subpopulations. Two general models have been proposed to describe relationships among subpopulations in a metapopulation: (1) source-sink, where immigrants from sources sustain sinks; and (2) balanced dispersal, where dispersal is proportionally equal among subpopulations. I evaluated whether either of these models predict metapopulation dynamics of urban and exurban Cooper's Hawks in central New Mexico using demographic data in a Bayesian integrated population model. All urban female Cooper's Hawks began breeding in their first year; 69% settled at nests in the urban subpopulation and 31% emigrated and settled in an exurban subpopulation. The high rate of female emigration was likely because of a shortage of breeding urban males, caused by a 1 yr delay in male age-at-first-breeding. Emigration exceeded immigration by nearly 30%, making a balanced-dispersal model implausible. Although the urban subpopulation was a source, the primary recipient subpopulation was not a sink; urban emigrants appeared to have a competitive advantage obtaining exurban nest sites. High urban winter prey abundance supported year-long residency among urban female Cooper's Hawks, whereas nearly all exurban females migrated. Resident urban females that emigrated settled on exurban nesting territories before migrants returned, and thus without direct competition from them. Previous metapopulation models do not incorporate the concept that differences in dispersal behavior between subpopulations can drive dispersal dynamics in a metapopulation. These findings provide further evidence that patch dynamics in a metapopulation can be complex, and may be governed by factors other than just demographic rates and connectivity. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.

TI  - Is the riparian habitat creation an effective measure of plant conservation within the urbanized area?
PY  - 2015
AB  - The study presents results of habitat creation and riparian vegetation recovery in artificial oxbow lakes in urbanized area within the large river valley. The investigation of open water, rush and wet meadows flora and vegetation in three ponds located in the city centre of Opole was conducted in years 2001-2013. Oxbow lakes were constructed as a compensation measure and no vegetation was transplanted into the ponds on purpose. 13-years observation showed that (1) the red-listed species are able to spontaneous reoccurrence after habitat restoration, but they can thrive only in first years of oxbow lakes recolonisation process, (2) there are some restoration constraints, especially in relation to Phragmites australis and Nuphar lutea expansion, but alien species invasions were insignificant and (3) the species number and vegetation cover was constantly increasing during the recolonisation process in recreated oxbow lakes. The dynamic of vegetation was considerable, especially in first 6 years of experiment when the significant increase in diversity and richness of native plant species was observed. After that time, the increasing expansion of P. australis and N. lutea was noted causing the decline of several species and vegetation types. So, restoring just the environmental conditions may be sufficient for a limited period of time only. Strong disturbances, much intense that moderate inundations, imitating disastrous flooding within the valley each 10-13 years are need to maintain the ecological niches for river corridor and riparian species. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

TI  - Design method of urban micro-scale ecological infrastructure: A case study of Promoter Regions in Xiong'an New Area
PY  - 2021
AB  - Rapid urbanization brings a series of sustainable development challenges such as ecological damage and environmental pollution, which needs to be avoided in the stage of urban planning. The ecological infrastructure construction reflects the concept of ecosystem restoration and collaborative environmental governance. It is an effective means to guide urban planning under the new urbanization background. Nowadays, macro-scale ecological infrastructure construction is relatively systematic at home and abroad, while the micro-scale is relatively lacking. Due to the small scale and lacking network, the ecological infrastructure construction in community and other small scale regions in China can not prevent the problems of rainwater waterlogging and non-point source pollution emerge. In this study, the Promoter Regions in Xiong'an New Area as the research object, a design method, and the technical process of urban micro-scale ecological infrastructure are established. (1) Based on the site's survey and theoretical research, analyze the site current condition, and consider the relevant factors such as natural factors, physical perception, psychological perception, and the ecological process to construct the ecological infrastructure system where “corridor as the bone, patches as the node”. (2) Identify the regional functional ecological patches, which includes major animal activities, migration, and conservation of plant diversity, to construct a systemic corridor connecting the whole city to provide multiple functions, a structural corridor to increase ecosystem services within the city, and a local functional corridor to infiltrate ecosystem services into the urban fabric. (3) Evaluate the expected effect of ecological infrastructure construction by residents' perceptions and annual runoff control rate. The ecological infrastructure construction helps alleviate the ecological environment problems faced by the construction of Xiong'an New Area, guarantee the living environment's quality, and provide a reference for future urban construction. © 2021 Science Press.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of habitat quality in response to socioeconomic and landscape patterns in the context of urbanization: A case in Zhengzhou City, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, the habitat quality (HQ) in urban areas has been eroded. This phenomenon is destroying the balance of ecosystems, triggering the reduction of biodiversity and the decay of ecosystem service functions. The study of the relationship between urbanization and HQ in Zhengzhou City is beneficial for the reference of sustainable urban ecological planning and management. Based on landscape classification data and socioeconomic data for three years, this study analyzes the spatial correlations between socioeconomic and landscape pattern factors and HQ, compares the dynamic changes in the explanatory power of different factors, and explores the joint effects between multiple factors. The results show that: (1) The overall value of HQ index in Zhengzhou City decreased by.10 during 2000-2020, mainly occurring in suburban areas, with a small amount of HQ improvement occurring in the core areas of ecological protection, such as mountains and river channels. (2) The spatial autocorrelation of all influencing factors with HQ increased during this period, while the negative impact from socioeconomic sources was stronger than the positive impact from landscape patterns. (3) Intensive human activities lead to a single habitat type, which reduces HQ; rich landscape types and complex landscape composition can enhance HQ. Improving the connectivity of blue-green landscapes helps to attenuate the negative effects of urbanization on HQ. (4) Changes of HQ in the study area and the development of multi-factor effects on HQ are driven by the Zhengzhou Metropolitan Area Plan. Urban development policies and management can build idyllic complexes at the edge of urban development, preserving pristine blue-green patches to avoid their homogenized distribution and thus slowing the decline of HQ. The above results provide new ideas for the development of sustainable urban ecology. © Mengqi Zhao et al..

TI  - Assessment of river habitat quality in the Hai River Basin, northern China
PY  - 2015
AB  - We applied a river habitat quality (RHQ) assessment method to the Hai River Basin (HRB); an important economic centre in China; to obtain baseline information for water quality improvement; river rehabilitation; and watershed management. The results of the assessment showed that the river habitat in the HRB is seriously degraded. Specifically; 42.41% of the sites; accounting for a river length of 3.31 × 104 km; were designated poor and bad. Habitat in the plain areas is seriously deteriorated; and nearly 50% of the sites; accounting for a river length of 1.65 × 104 km; had either poor or bad habitats. River habitat degradation was attributable to the limited width of the riparian zone (≤5 m); lower coverage of riparian vegetation (≤40%); artificial land use patterns (public and industrial land); frequent occurrence of farming on the river banks and high volumes of solid waste (nearly 10 m3); single flow channels; and rare aquatic plants (≤1 category). At the regional scale; intensive artificial land use types caused by urbanization had a significant impact on the RHQ in the HRB. RHQ was significantly and negatively correlated with farmland (r = 1.000; p < 0.01) and urban land (r = 0.998; p < 0.05); and was significantly and positively correlated with grassland and woodland (r = 1.000; p < 0.01). Intensive artificial land use; created through urbanization processes; has led to a loss of the riparian zone and its native vegetation; and has disrupted the lateral connectivity of the rivers. The degradation of the already essentially black rivers is exacerbated by poor longitudinal connectivity (index of connectivity is 2.08–16.56); caused by reservoirs and sluices. For river habitat rehabilitation to be successful; land use patterns need to be changed and reservoirs and sluices will have to be regulated.

TI  - Reproductive success and pollen dispersal in urban populations of an insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urban development increasingly occupies more landscape and is responsible for habitat alteration and fragmentation of so many ecosystems that urban environments can no longer be excluded from the areas to be considered in conservation strategies. Appropriate management measures ensuring population viability are needed, but due to the usually irreversible feature of the urbanisation process, the measures may differ from non-urbanised areas. Sufficient gene flow levels, leading to successful seed production, appear to be a key element in the sustainable persistence of insect-pollinated plant remnant populations. This study investigated reproductive success and pollen dispersal patterns in Centaurea jacea, an insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb, in the Brussels urban area (Belgium). Reproductive performance of urban park populations was compared with populations occurring in urban semi-natural sites. Pollen dispersal patterns were examined within and among-population patches from two urban parks using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Urban park populations showed a higher reproductive success than those in urban semi-natural sites. Depositions of fluorescent dye particles on recipient individuals were found within populations (<20 m), among populations within parks (over a few hundred meters) and among parks (maximal investigated distance: 2.6 km), indicating pollinator movements and a potential gene flow by pollen over relatively long distances. Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution with respect to spatial distance. The very small populations received more immigrant dye deposition when located at short distances from the source population. These findings demonstrate that urban populations do not perform worse in reproductive success than populations from agricultural landscapes, despite their small size, and can function as a network exchanging pollen. The conversion of urban park lawns into interconnected networks of ecologically managed hay meadows, allowing simultaneous flowering and seed production in many patches of target species, is to be strongly encouraged. © 2009 Rübel Foundation, ETH Zürich.

TI  - Indicators for assessing habitat values and pressures for protected areas-An integrated habitat and land cover change approach for the Udzungwa Mountains National Park in Tanzania
PY  - 2016
AB  - Assessing the status and monitoring the trends of land cover dynamics in and around protected areas is of utmost importance for park managers and decision makers. Moreover, to support the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)'s Strategic Action Plan including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, such efforts are necessary to set a framework to reach the agreed national, regional or global targets. The integration of land use/cover change (LULCC) data with information on habitats and population density provides the means to assess potential degradation and disturbance resulting from anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and urban area expansion. This study assesses the LULCC over a 20 year (1990-2000-2010) period using freely available Landsat imagery and a dedicated method and toolbox for the Udzungwa Mountains National Park (UMNP) and its surroundings (20 km buffer) in Tanzania. Habitat data gathered from the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA)'s eHabitat+Web service were used to perform ecological stratification of the study area and to develop similarity maps of the potential presence of comparable habitat types outside the protected area. Finally, integration of the habitat similarity maps with the LULCC data was applied in order to evaluate potential pressures on the different habitats within the national park and on the linking corridors between UMNP and other protected areas in the context of wildlife movement and migration. The results show that the UMNP has not suffered from relevant human activities during the study period. The natural vegetation area has remained stable around 1780 km2. In the surrounding 20 km buffer area and the connecting corridors, however, the anthropogenic impact has been strong. Artificially built up areas increased by 14.24% over the last 20 years and the agriculture area increased from 11% in 1990 to 30% in the year 2010. The habitat functional types and the similarity maps confirmed the importance of the buffer zone and the connecting corridors for wildlife movements, while the similarity maps detected other potential corridors for wildlife. © 2016 by the authors.

TI  - Urbanization drivers differentially affect ground arthropod assemblages in the city of Turin (NW-Italy)
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization is a complex process associated with environmental changes affecting many biotic and abiotic ecosystem components, which cause the alteration of biological communities, habitat features, connectivity and stability. In particular, the urbanization process is usually associated with a decrease in species richness that parallels a general increase in the overall abundance of individuals, mostly due to generalist and tolerant species taking advantage of the altered environmental conditions and outcompeting and excluding native species. We here adopted a hierarchically nested sampling design to investigate the response of ground arthropods to the combined effects of multiple facets of urbanization, namely increased impervious surface cover, temperature and patch isolation, measured at small, intermediate and large spatial scale. We studied 15 plots of 150 m in diameter located in the city of Turin (NW-Italy), along an urbanization-cover gradient ranging from suburbia to the city center. For each plot we considered the level of urbanization at three different scales (circular buffers with a 100, 400 and 1600 m radius). Within each plot, we identified a control and an isolated subplot, and in each subplot, we measured ground temperature using dataloggers and we sampled ground arthropods with pitfall traps. Firstly, by relating ground temperature and urbanization cover, we showed that temperature values reflected an Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which indicates increasing values of temperature along the urbanization gradient. This trend was particularly evident at large scale regarding daily and diurnal temperature, and at small scale regarding nocturnal temperature. Secondly, we demonstrated that different groups of ground arthropods respond differently to urbanization cover, with major effects at the largest spatial scale. Finally, we extrapolated the differential contribution of urbanization cover, UHI-effect and patch isolation to the observed activity density of the investigated taxonomic groups: Coleoptera and Hemiptera were influenced by temperature, whereas Hymenoptera, Collembola, Acari and Araneae were mainly influenced by urbanization, especially in control subplots. Our results emphasize how a multitaxonomic approach can help unravel patterns of community assembly in urban areas. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - City-level comparison of urban land-cover configurations from 2000-2015 across 65 countries within the global belt and road
PY  - 2019
AB  - The configuration of urban land-covers is essential for improving dwellers' environments and ecosystem services. A city-level comparison of land-cover changes along the Belt and Road is still unavailable due to the lack of intra-urban land products. A synergistic classification methodology of sub-pixel un-mixing, multiple indices, decision tree classifier, unsupervised (SMDU) classification was established in the study to examine urban land covers across 65 capital cities along the Belt and Road during 2000-2015. The overall accuracies of the 15 m resolution urban products (i.e., the impervious surface area, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies) derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were 92.88% and 93.19%, with kappa coefficients of 0.84 and 0.85 in 2000 and 2015, respectively. The built-up areas of 65 capital cities increased from 23,696.25 km2 to 29,257.51 km2, with an average growth rate of 370.75 km2/y during 2000-2015. Moreover, urban impervious surface area (ISA) expanded with an average rate of 401.92 km2/y, while the total area of urban green space (UGS) decreased with an average rate of 17.59 km2/y. In different regions, UGS changes declined by 7.37% in humid cities but increased by 14.61% in arid cities. According to the landscape ecology indicators, urban land-cover configurations became more integrated (ΔShannon's Diversity Index (SHDI) = -0.063; 4Patch Density (PD) = 0.054) and presented better connectivity (4Connectance Index (CON) = +0.594). The proposed method in this study improved the separation between ISA and bare soil in mixed pixels, and the 15 m intra-urban land-cover product provided essential details of complex urban landscapes and urban ecological needs compared with contemporary global products. These findings provide valuable information for urban planners dealing with human comfort and ecosystem service needs in urban areas. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Ecosystem service provision by road verges
PY  - 2020
AB  - This is the final version. Available on open access from Wiley via the DOI in this record.1. Roads form a vast, rapidly-growing global network that has diverse, detrimental ecological impacts.
However, the habitats that border roads (‘road verges’) form a parallel network that might help
 mitigate these impacts and provide additional benefits (ecosystem services; ES).

2. We evaluate the capacity of road verges to provide ES by reviewing existing research and
considering their relevant characteristics; area, connectivity, shape, and contextual ES supply and
demand. We consider the present situation, and how this is likely to change based on future
 projections for growth in road extent, traffic densities and urban populations.

3. Road verges provide a wide range of ES, including biodiversity provision, regulating services (e.g. air
 and water filtration) and cultural services (e.g. health and aesthetic benefits by providing access to
 nature), but also displace other habitats and provide ecosystem disservices (e.g. allergens and damage
to infrastructure). Globally, road verges may currently cover 270,000 km2 and store 0.015 Gt C year-1  ,
 which will further increase with 70% projected growth in the global road network.

 4. Road verges are well-placed to mitigate traffic pollution and address demand for ES in surrounding
 ES-impoverished landscapes, thereby improving human health and wellbeing in urban areas, and
 improving agricultural production and sustainability in farmland. Demand for ES provided by road 
 verges will likely increase due to projected growth in traffic densities and urban populations, though
traffic pollution will be reduced by technological advances (e.g. electric vehicles). Road verges form a
 highly-connected network, which may enhance ES provision but facilitate the dispersal of invasive
 species and increase vehicle-wildlife collisions.

 5. Synthesis and applications.
Road verges offer a significant opportunity to mitigate the negative ecological effects of roads and to
 address demand for ES in surrounding ES-impoverished landscapes. Their capacity to provide ES might
be enhanced considerably if they were strategically designed and managed for environmental
 outcomes, namely by optimizing the selection, position and management of plant species and
habitats. Specific opportunities include reducing mowing frequencies and planting trees in large
 verges. Road verge management for ES must consider safety guidelines, financial costs and ecosystem
 disservices, but is likely to provide long-term financial returns if environmental benefits are taken into
account.Natural Environment Research Counci

TI  - Applying network analysis to the conservation of habitat trees in urban environments: A case study from Brisbane, Australia
PY  - 2006
AB  - In Australia more than 300 vertebrates, including 43 insectivorous bat species, depend on hollows in habitat trees for shelter, with many species using a network of multiple trees as roosts. We used roost-switching data on white-striped freetail bats (Tadarida australis; Microchiroptera: Molossidae) to construct a network representation of day roosts in suburban Brisbane, Australia. Bats were caught from a communal roost tree with a roosting group of several hundred individuals and released with transmitters. Each roost used by the bats represented a node in the network, and the movements of bats between roosts formed the links between nodes. Despite differences in gender and reproductive stages, the bats exhibited the same behavior throughout three radiotelemetry periods and over 500 bat days of radio tracking: each roosted in separate roosts, switched roosts very infrequently, and associated with other bats only at the communal roost. This network resembled a scale-free network in which the distribution of the number of links from each roost followed a power law. Despite being spread over a large geographic area (&gt;200 km2), each roost was connected to others by less than three links. One roost (the hub or communal roost) defined the architecture of the network because it had the most links. That the network showed scale-free properties has profound implications for the management of the habitat trees of this roosting group. Scale-free networks provide high tolerance against stochastic events such as random roost removals but are susceptible to the selective removal of hub nodes. Network analysis is a useful tool for understanding the structural organization of habitat tree usage and allows the informed judgment of the relative importance of individual trees and hence the derivation of appropriate management decisions. Conservation planners and managers should emphasize the differential importance of habitat trees and think of them as being analogous to vital service centers in human societies. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.

TI  - The green areas of San Juan, Puerto Rico
PY  - 2014
AB  - Green areas, also known as green infrastructure or urban vegetation, are vital to urbanites for their critical roles in mitigating urban heat island effects and climate change and for their provision of multiple ecosystem services and aesthetics. Here, I provide a high spatial resolution snapshot of the green cover distribution of the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, by incorporating the use of morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) as a tool to describe the spatial pattern and connectivity of the city’s urban green areas. Analysis of a previously developed IKONOS 4-m spatial resolution classification of the city of San Juan from 2002 revealed a larger area of vegetation (green areas or green infrastructure) than previously estimated by moderate spatial resolution imagery. The city as a whole had approximately 42% green cover and 55% impervious surfaces. Although the city appeared greener in its southern upland sector compared to the northern coastal section, where most built-up urban areas occurred (66% impervious surfaces), northern San Juan had 677 ha more green area cover dispersed across the city than the southern component. MSPA revealed that most forest cover occurred as edges and cores, and green areas were most commonly forest cores, with larger predominance in the southern sector of the municipality. In dense, built-up, urban land, most of the green areas occurred in private yards as islets. When compared to other cities across the United States, San Juan was most similar in green cover features to Boston, Massachusetts, and Miami, Florida. Per capita green space for San Juan (122.2 m²/inhabitant) was also comparable to these two U.S. cities. This study explores the intra-urban vegetation variation in the city of San Juan, which is generally overlooked by moderate spatial resolution classifications in Puerto Rico. It serves as a starting point for green infrastructure mapping and landscape pattern analysis of the urban green spaces within the city of San Juan. The effectiveness of research and city planning will be further enhanced as a result of this type of finer-scale urban cover exploration. © 2014 by the author(s).

TI  - Protected areas and agricultural expansion: Biodiversity conservation versus economic growth in the Southeast of Brazil
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract The conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural land and urban areas plays a threat to the protected areas and the natural ecosystems conservation. The aim of this paper is to provide an analysis of the agricultural expansion and its impact on the landscape spatial and temporal patterns in a buffer zone of a protected area located in the transition zone between the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The land use and land cover were mapped between 1971 and 2008 and landscape metrics were calculated to provide a spatiotemporal analysis of the forest structure and the expansion of the croplands. The results showed that the landscape patterns were affected by the economic cycles. The predominant crop surrounding the protected area is sugar cane, which increased by 39% during this period, followed by citrus. This landscape change is connected to the Brazilian oil crisis in 1973. The rapid expansion of sugar cane was largely driven by Brazil's biofuel program, the “Proalcool” (pro-alcohol), a project in 1975 that mixed ethanol with gas for automotive fuel. The forest loss occurred mainly between 1971 and 1988, decreasing the forest cover from 17% in 1971 to 12.7% in 2008. Most of the forest patches are smaller than 50 ha and has low connectivity. Throughout the years, the fragments in the buffer zone have become smaller and with an elongated shape, and the park has become isolated. This forest fragmentation process and the predominance of monoculture lands in the buffer zone threaten the protected areas, and can represent a barrier for these areas to provide the effective biodiversity conservation. The measures proposed are necessary to ensure the capability of this ecosystem to sustain its original biodiversity.

TI  - Temporal and spatial evolution of surface thermal environment in Huainan Mining Area in the last decade
PY  - 2021
AB  - Land surface temperature(LST) is an important parameter to describe land surface processes and reflect land surface characteristics. It is of great significance to study the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of surface temperature in the mining area in the last decade for understanding the influence of coal mining activities on the ecological environment. Huainan Mining Area is a typical high-phreatic mining area in eastern China. In order to explore the relationship between spatio-temporal heterogeneity of surface temperature and mining disturbance in this area, surface temperature inversion and underlying surface information extraction are carried out by using five periods of Landsat images from 2008 to 2018. Combined with the calculation of thermal landscape pattern index and urban heat island proportion index, the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of surface thermal environment in Huainan Mining Area are analyzed. The results show that the surface temperature distribution pattern and its change are closely related to the underlying surface structure and its change in Huainan Mining Area. From 2008 to 2018, this mining area is mainly the middle temperature area, followed by the sub-low temperature and sub-high temperature area, with the area and proportion of the high temperature and low temperatures area being relatively low. Due to the construction of towns and mines, as well as the accumulation of coal gangue and mining subsidence water from coal mining, the area of construction land and water area is constantly increasing, and the vegetation area is constantly decreasing. Correspondingly, the low, sub-high and high temperature zones are increasing, and the middle and sub-low temperature zones are decreasing. On the whole, the urban heat island proportion index and the heat island effect are increasing. In the low temperature region, the patch fragmentation and complexity are decreasing and the dominance is increasing. The changes of patch fragmentation and complexity, landscape agglomeration and connectivity, diversity and evenness at other temperatures are divided into three stages: 2008-2013, 2013-2015 and 2015-2018. In 2013-2015, the intensity of human disturbance was higher. And the patch fragmentation and complexity increased, so did the landscape agglomeration and connectivity. The diversity and uniformity were reduced. The research results provide a scientific basis for the restoration and management of ecological environment and urban industrial planning in Huainan Mining Area. © 2021 Science Press.

TI  - A multi-criterion approach for prioritizing areas in urban ecosystems for active restoration following invasive plant control
PY  - 2018
AB  - Resources for biodiversity conservation and invasive plant management are limited, and restoring invaded vegetation is labour-intensive and expensive. Managers must prioritize their actions to achieve their goals efficiently and effectively. They must distinguish between areas that require only the removal of invasive alien plants (“passive restoration”) from those that require additional restoration measures (“active restoration”). This study used a multi-criterion approach (Analytical Hierarchical Process) to develop a framework for identifying areas that require active restoration, and then to prioritize these areas for active restoration. The South African city of Cape Town is used as a test case to illustrate the utility of the framework. Framework criteria selected in determining the need for active restoration included: dominant alien species invading the area, density of invasion, duration of invasion, indigenous vegetation cover, adjacent land use, level of disturbance, size of the area, aspect, soil texture, soil depth and erodibility, slope and vegetation type. In deciding which areas to prioritize for active restoration, factors such as vegetation conservation status, selection in a regional conservation plan and connectivity function were assessed. Importance in ecosystem functioning (by providing a diversity of habitats and soil conservation) and the delivery of ecosystem service benefits were also considered. The resulting framework provides an objective tool for prioritizing sites for active restoration.

TI  - Response of Macrophyte Diversity in Coastal Lakes to Watershed Land Use and Salinity Gradient
PY  - 2022
AB  - Coastal lakes are subject to multiple stressors, among which land use, hydrological connectivity, and salinity have the greatest effect on their biodiversity. We studied the effects that various land cover types (CORINE) of coastal lake watersheds had on macrophyte diversity in ten coastal lakes along the southern Baltic coast as characterised by twelve phytocenotic indices: these being a number of communities, Shannon-Wiener diversity, evenness, and indices of taxonomic distinctiveness of plant communities: vegetation coverage; colonisation index; share of the phytolittoral area in the total lake area, as well as shares of nympheides, pondweeds, charophytes, marine, emerged and submerged communities in the total lake area. The effects were checked for three groups of lakes distinguished by differences in salinity-freshwater (F, 5), transitional (T, 4), and brackish (B, 1)-in which a total of 48 macrophyte communities were identified. The most abundant in aquatic phytocoenoses were lakes of T type. A partial least squares regression model (PLS-R) showed a stronger impact of land-use types in immediate vicinities and entire watersheds than the impact of physico-chemical properties of water on phytocenotic indices in the lakes. Macrophyte diversity was relatively low in urban and agricultural catchments and relatively high in forest and wetland areas. Agriculture had a negative impact on the number of macrophyte communities in F lakes and, in T lakes, on the number of macrophyte communities, biodiversity, evenness, and proportion of emerged, submerged, and marine communities. Urban areas contributed to lower values of evenness, vegetation coverage, and share of marine communities in F, but, in T, to lower the number of macrophyte communities, evenness, and proportion of submerged and marine communities. Our results confirm the significant impact of land use on macrophyte diversity in coastal aquatic ecosystems. Combined analysis of anthropogenic and natural descriptors is a prerequisite for analysing human threats to biodiversity in coastal lakes. Macrophyte community-based measures of biodiversity are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic impact on the ecological condition of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Research on the improvement of urban ecological space service base on landsenses ecology: a case study in Shunyi District, Beijing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Landsenses ecology integrates natural factors, physical perception, psychological cognition and other aspects, and serves land use and construction. In fulfilling the vision and goal of building the world-leading harmonious and livable capital, Beijing attaches great importance to the perception and interaction of urban residents with urban ecological space, which is a vivid embodiment of the concept of landsenses ecology coupling the urban ecological space with the living environment quality and mental health. Ecological space is of great significance for maintaining regionally ecological security and biodiversity, improving the quality of human settlements, and promoting regionally sustainable development. This study analyzed the landscape pattern of the ecological space and visual space pattern in Shunyi District combining the idea of landsense creation in landsenses ecology with the ecological planning practice of Shunyi District. The results show that in terms of the landscape pattern of the ecological space, the proportion of the ecological space dominated by forest, grassland, farmland and wetland has reached 6 5 %, but the patches of forest, grassland and wetland in Shunyi District were relatively fragmented. There are large patches of settlement near the Beijing Capital International Airport, and there are few forests and green spaces around the airport and the central city. In terms of visually spatial pattern, the highways and lower-grade roads in Shunyi District mostly have higher green view, the spatial distribution of green view in county roads is uneven, and the green view of roads in the center of the district is generally low. Overall, the length of the road sections with the medium and lower-medium green view was nearly 6 0 %, and there were fewer road sections having the above-average green view, especially the high-level green view. Therefore, there remain large room for improving the ecological service by landsenses creation. Furthermore, this study aimed to improve the urban ecological space services of Shunyi District and summarized four core visions of ecological space landscape pattern optimization, visual space pattern optimization, scientific planning and management of ecological space, and comprehensive improvement of ecosystem services. Based on the four visions, the targeted measures for landscape creation were proposed, including strengthening the ecological protection of shallow mountainous areas, constructing leisure and recreation zone along the shallow mountains and Chaobai River, increasing the quality of the visual space of Shunyi District, improving the ecological space leisure and recreation services in Shunyi District, clarifying the urban ecological space planning, strictly observing the ecological protection red line, improving landscape diversity, and constructing ecological corridors, etc. © 2020 Science Press.

TI  - Exploiting three dimensional vegetation structure to map wildland extent
PY  - 2012
AB  - Wildland and wilderness refer to areas of land which have been subject to little or no modification by human activity. These areas are important due to their role as wildlife habitats, the contributions they make to air and water quality and for human recreation. However, the intermingling of wildland and homes also increases the risk to life and property through wildfires. Management of this risk requires current and detailed knowledge of the spatial extent of wildland. What constitutes wildland vegetation is often difficult to define and may be influenced by both the horizontal continuity and vertical structure. We present a method to map wildland vegetation based on a combination of a vertically stratified cover threshold and spatial morphology. To test its practical application, the method was applied to airborne lidar data collected prior to a major wildfire that occurred in Australia in 2009. Distance between the lidar defined wildland extent and homes impacted by the fire was assessed and compared to previously published data using manual delineation of wildland extent. Results showed that the proportion of homes destroyed at the wildland boundary was greater than reported in previous fires and that there was an exponential decline in the proportion of homes destroyed as a function of distances to wildland. Although the method is objective the extent of wildland depends on the parameters which define thresholds of cover and lateral extent and connectivity. This highlights the need for a clear definition of wildland that can be used to determine extent using objective methods such as those described, whether this is in the context of quantifying wildfire vulnerability or other related applications such as ecological assessment and monitoring. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The social connectivity of urban rivers
PY  - 2017
AB  - By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other rivers for hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation. The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of ‘closeness’ of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15 m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers ~ 50 to ~ 200 m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a ‘lively’ atmosphere. At widths over ~ 200 m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaking in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity. In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A functional classification method for examining landscape pattern of urban wetland park: A case study on Xixi Wetland Park, China
PY  - 2011
AB  - With the rapid approval and establishment of urban wetland parks, it is necessary to assess the sustainability of urban wetlands. The paper took Xixi Wetland Park as a case study area because of its representative of urban wetlands in China. Xixi National Wetland Park is located at the west part of Hangzhou, covering an area of 11. 5 km2, and featuring abundant ecological resources, beautiful natural scenes and a rich cultural heritage of many millennia. It is a model for integrating wetland ecological conservation, recreations, scientific research and education. We use Quick bird images and GIS to inventory information of landscape in Xixi Wetland Park, in particularly established a functional classification system for examining landscape pattern of urban wetland park. The results showed that: (1) patches and corridors in the landscape can be classified by the ecological conservation and the recreation according to their functional characteristics in Xixi Wetland Park; (2) Xixi Wetland Park is of the characteristics of both ecological conservation and rational utilization, in which 54% area for ecological protection and 46% area for tourism and recreation; (3) the ecological patches in Xixi Wetland park is featured with large area, complex shapes and low diversity, and the recreation patches is featured with small area, sample shapes and high diversity; (4) although the area of ecological corridors was only half of the recreational corridors, its network structure is quite complex, which is in favor of the conservation of wetlands in the park; (5) the ecological patches in the buffer areas of ecological corridors covered of 70.7%, and the recreational patches only account of 29.3%, which indicated that the ecological corridors performed a great role in connecting ecological parches. Synchronously, the ecological parches covering of 46. 8% in the buffer areas of recreational corridors indicated that the recreational corridors not only can meet visitors, but also can be in favor of ecological protection; (6) the method of landscape pattern analysis based on functional classification is in favor of identifying spatial characteristics of landscape functions, and can exhibit the spatial relationship between ecological conservation and utilization for a landscape in urban park.

TI  - Distribution,habitat preference and conservation status of the Yellow-bellied Glider (Petaurus australis) in the Hills Shire,northwestern Sydney
PY  - 2011
AB  - Clearing of native vegetation for urban and rural development constitutes one of the major threats to conservation of forest-dependent fauna in New SouthWales.The Hills Shire is an extensively forested local government area in northwestern Sydney which is experiencing rapid population growth and the associated expansion of residential and infrastructure development in both urban and rural areas. The Yellow-bellied Glider is one of many threatened species occurring in the Shire and information about this species' habitat requirements is needed for conservation planning. This study tested the hypothesis that the occurrence of Swamp Mahogany Eucalyptus robusta is an important factor explaining the distribution of the Yellow-bellied Glider inThe Hills Shire. Spotlighting and call broadcast surveys for this and five other threatened species were undertaken on four occasions at each of 33 randomly-located sites stratified by proximity (<500 m and > 1500 m) to forest containing Swamp Mahogany.TheYellow-bellied Glider was detected at 10 sites and was significantly more likely to occur at sites where Swamp Mahogany was present. Yellow-bellied Gliders were strongly associated with forests on alluvial soils occurring below 20 m elevation where Swamp Mahogany was present. Swamp Mahogany appears to be indicative of locations where a confluence of factors, including the forest types on adjacent slopes and ridges, results in favourable habitat for the gliders.The food resources provided by the winter-flowering Swamp Mahogany and other river-flat eucalypts, including Forest Red Gum E tereticornis, is also thought to be important. The population of Yellow-bellied Gliders inThe Hills Shire, based on all known records, was estimated to be 50 to 75 individuals occurring in at least 15 family groups most of which were distributed within seven core areas. The conservation of the Yellow-bellied Glider in the Shire requires the protection of these core areas and the existing forested corridors linking them.TheYellow-bellied Glider population inThe Hills Shire is geographically isolated and warrants consideration for listing as an endangered population under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.

TI  - The ecology of an Australian reptile icon: How do blue-tongued lizards (Tiliqua scincoides) survive in suburbia?
PY  - 2001
AB  - Although most species of large reptiles in the Sydney region are now restricted to remnant bushland, the blue-tongued lizard (; Tiliqua scincoides) remains abundant. How has this large, slow-moving reptile managed to persist in the suburbs? We implanted radio-transmitters into 17 adult blue-tongued lizards and tracked them for six months (October 1998 to March 1999). Radio-tracked animals utilised 5-17 suburban backyards, but each lizard spent most of its time in a few 'core' areas near 2-7 shelter sites. Males had larger home ranges than females (mean of 12700 v. 5100 m2) and moved further between shelter sites. Gravid females (mean home range 1000 m2) were more sedentary. Lizards used corridors of dense vegetation to move between retreat sites, and actively avoided crossing roads. In sunny weather, lizards typically basked close to their overnight shelter for 1-4 h each morning until they obtained body temperatures of approximately 32°C. They maintained high body temperatures while moving about in the afternoon. In combination, the following ecological factors may facilitate persistence of blue-tongued lizards at our suburban study sites. (i) The most important subgroup of the population in terms of conservation are gravid females, which are highly sedentary and, thus, less likely to encounter the dangers of suburbia. (ii) The more 'expendable' males move about much more, but mostly in times and places that involve minimal risk from humans and their domestic pets. (iii) Lizards show strong site fidelity, spending up to 70% of their time in 'safe' locations; importantly, they avoid roads. (iv) Blue-tongued lizards readily utilise 'artificial' shelter sites and the commensal prey species (e.g. snails) found in most gardens. (v) These lizards can grow rapidly, mature early, and produce large litters. Because blue-tongued lizards have a long life span (over 30 years in captivity), populations of adults may persist for many years in the absence of recruitment.

TI  - Environmental, economic, social and political drivers for increasing use of woodfuel as a renewable resource in Britain
PY  - 2006
AB  - Present woodfuel usage in Britain is negligible. Historically, Britain has been fortunate in having abundant coal, oil and gas. At an EU level, biomass is seen as an important element of energy, environment and agriculture/forestry policy. In the European context, biomass is taken to include agricultural and industrial wastes in addition to forest woodfuel, and it is regarded as a potential source of heat, fuels and electricity. In the UK, energy policy as a whole is based on four considerations - environment, energy reliability and security, affordability for the poorest in society and competitive pricing for businesses, industries and households. Within UK policy, the dominant driver for greater use of biomass as a renewable source of energy is climate change mitigation; energy security is an emerging driver; all other potential benefits of biomass as a renewable resource are of limited significance. At the moment, the UK focus is narrower than in Europe. National targets are set only for electricity generation. Furthermore, expansion of energy crops, which are defined in the major regulations as 'crops planted since 1989 and grown primarily for the purpose of being used as a fuel' and, therefore, do not include material from extant forests, is seen as the main way to ensure energy security and minimise carbon expended to transport the raw material to the point of end use. Nevertheless, woody biomass from forests, sawmills, urban areas and transportation corridors is already available in vastly greater quantities than 'energy crops'. At a regional and local scale, global environmental issues are of lower relative importance and a much wider range of potential benefits tend to be taken into consideration. For example, the economic benefits of woodfuel heating in areas without connections to the gas grid have been an important consideration in the steady increase in woodheat developments. In other areas where there is a less obvious financial driver, rural development is a powerful determinant of support for woodfuel projects. Crown Copyright © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Assessing land-use effects on water quality, in-stream habitat, riparian ecosystems and biodiversity in Patagonian northwest streams
PY  - 2011
AB  - Changes in land-use practices have affected the integrity and quality of water resources worldwide. In Patagonia there is a strong concern about the ecological status of surface waters because these changes are rapidly occurring in the region. To test the hypothesis that greater intensity of land-use will have negative effects on water quality, stream habitat and biodiversity we assessed benthic macroinvertebrates, riparian/littoral invertebrates, fish and birds from the riparian corridor and environmental variables of 15 rivers (Patagonia) subjected to a gradient of land-use practices (non-managed native forest, managed native forest, pine plantations, pasture, urbanization). A total of 158 macroinvertebrate taxa, 105 riparian/littoral invertebrate taxa, 5 fish species, 34 bird species, and 15 aquatic plant species, were recorded considering all sites. Urban land-use produced the most significant changes in streams including physical features, conductivity, nutrients, habitat condition, riparian quality and invertebrate metrics. Pasture and managed native forest sites appeared in an intermediate situation. The highest values of fish and bird abundance and diversity were observed at disturbed sites; this might be explained by the opportunistic behavior displayed by these communities which let them take advantage of increased trophic resources in these environments. As expected, non-managed native forest sites showed the highest integrity of ecological conditions and also great biodiversity of benthic communities. Macroinvertebrate metrics that reflected good water quality were positively related to forest land cover and negatively related to urban and pasture land cover. However, by offering stream edge areas, pasture sites still supported rich communities of riparian/littoral invertebrates, increasing overall biodiversity. Macroinvertebrates were good indicators of land-use impact and water quality conditions and resulted useful tools to early alert of disturbances in streams. Fish and birds having a greater ability of dispersion and capacity to move quickly from disturbances would reflect changes at a higher scale. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Prioritizing habitat conservation outside protected areas in rapidly urbanizing landscapes: A patch network approach
PY  - 2017
AB  - Biodiversity conservation is challenging in urbanizing landscapes where recurring habitat degradation occurs and space is limited for subsequent restoration. Conservation efforts based on natural reserves may not be able to maintain certain ecological processes that extend beyond the reserves. There is an urgent need to conserve or restore critical habitats outside of protected areas to maintain the functional connectivity of habitat networks. In this study, we developed a connectivity modelling approach associated with varying conservation scenarios to establish habitat conservation priorities in a rapidly urbanizing area of Shenzhen, China. We incorporated unprotected habitat patches into the reserve network via four scenarios and prioritized the contributions of these patches to habitat connectivity. We also investigated the responses of species with different dispersal abilities to habitat changes under each conservation scenario. The results showed that the spatial pattern of unprotected habitats played an important role in enhancing the connectivity of the entire network within the study area. The habitat patches around protected areas could create greater connectivity gains and should be prioritized for conservation. The key patches that substantially enhance connectivity were identified as special conservation concerns. The connectivity benefits from different scenarios were closely linked with species dispersal abilities. This study promotes the understanding of the importance of habitats outside of protected areas in urbanizing landscapes and provides the species-specific and spatially explicit conservation schemes for making informed decisions in urban planning and management. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - What makes urban parks good for California quail? Evaluating park suitability, species persistence, and the potential for reintroduction into a large urban national park
PY  - 2022
AB  - Preserving and restoring wildlife in urban areas benefits both urban ecosystems and the well-being of urban residents. While urban wildlife conservation is a rapidly developing field, the majority of conservation research has been performed in wildland areas. Understanding the applicability of wildland science to urban populations and the relative importance of factors limiting species persistence are of critical importance to identifying prescriptive management strategies for restoring wildlife to urban parks. We evaluated how habitat fragmentation, habitat quality and mortality threats influence species occupancy and persistence in urban parks. We chose California quail Callipepla californica as a representative species with potential to respond to urban conservation. We used publicly available eBird data to construct occupancy models of quail in urban parks across their native range, and present an application using focal parks interested in exploring quail reintroduction. Urban parks had a 0.23 ± 0.02 probability of quail occupancy, with greater occupancy in larger parks that were less isolated from potential source populations, had higher shrub cover and had lower impervious cover. Less isolated parks had higher colonization rates, while larger parks had lower extinction rates. These results align with findings across urban ecology showing greater biodiversity in larger and more highly connected habitat patches. A case study highlighted that interventions to increase effective park size and improve connectivity would be most influential for two highly urban focal parks, while changes to internal land cover would have a relatively small impact. Low joint extinction probability in the parks (0.010 ± 0.013) indicated reintroduced populations could persist for some time. Synthesis and applications. We show how eBird data can be harnessed to evaluate the responsiveness of wildlife to urban parks of variable size, connectivity and habitat quality, highlighting what management actions are most needed. Using California quail as an example, we found park size, park isolation and presence of coyotes are all important drivers of whether quail can colonize and persist in parks. Our results suggest reintroducing quail to parks could be successful provided parks are large enough to support quail, and management actions are taken to enhance regional connectivity or periodic assisted colonization is used to supplement local populations. © 2021 British Ecological Society

TI  - Thermal environment effect of urban water landscape
PY  - 2013
AB  - Rapid urban expansion has profoundly impacted on urban biodiversity, ecosystem functions, regional climate change, and the quality of life. One of the ecological consequences of urban expansion is the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon, which is formed when higher atmospheric and surface temperatures in urbanized areas are observed over the surrounding rural area. Urban thermal environment problems caused by UHI have some further impacts on energy consumption, human health and urban sustainable development. As a synthesis representation of urban environment effect, UHI is jointly determined by the physical properties of land surface and heat release by related socioeconomic activities. Within the urbanized area there are diverse landscape types, such as urban building landscape, road landscape, green space, water body, and so on. Among various urban landscape types, the thermal environment effect of water landscape is quite different. It is important to study how the water body might influence the urban thermal environment. The SPOT 5 and Landsat 7 ETM+ images are applied to derive the spatial pattern of urban water landscape and land surface temperature in Shanghai, and spatial analysis technique will be used to explore the thermal environment effect of water landscape. An intense urban heat island effect is identified in Shanghai City, with its center located on the west bank of Huangpu River. At the same time, a cold island effect is detected for the water landscape patches and corridors. Statistical significance is not found between area and perimeter of water patches (or river corridors) and their impact on local thermal environment. However, the water patch has a stronger thermal environment effect than the river corridor. The impact of water patch decreases as the distance to UHI center increases. For instance, the temperature of water patch in Luxun Park (the closest to the UHI center among all water patches) is 3.65°C lower than the average temperature of its surrounding region, with only 2.60°C lower than the average temperature of the region where Century Park is located, which is much further to the UHI center. Besides the distance to the UHI center, the impact of water patch on nearby area is also determined by the land surface composition. For instance, the surrounding area with more vegetation has a lower temperature than the area with more impervious surface. River corridors also influence the local thermal environment. Huangpu River, Suzhou River, Yunzao River and Chuanyang River are compared based on a buffering method, with the river width and the location of the river corridor as the two key factors on the local thermal environment. Flowing through UHI center and with the largest river width, Huangpu River has much higher impact on the thermal environment of the surrounding areas. The findings in this study are helpful to provide some effective policy implications for urban planning and design.

TI  - Are Collembola “flying” onto green roofs?
PY  - 2018
AB  - Green roofs, especially productive ones (e.g. of edible biomass), are urban ecosystems developed in response to the scarcity of arable areas in urban environments. Their installation is also perceived as a possible way to preserve biodiversity in cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting biodiversity, especially soil biodiversity, has rarely been studied. In order to orient the ecological engineering of green roofs, it is crucial to understand the resulting biodiversity patterns. We hypothesised that a functional trait-based approach could be used to investigate different ways of colonisation. We investigated collembolan communities in both extensive and productive green roofs. Surprisingly, no difference was observed in either taxonomic or functional structures of collembolan diversity between extensive and productive green roofs. Conversely, according to the functional composition, two ways of colonisation are suggested: a passive wind dispersal − the “flying” collembolans − and a settlement through compost inputs. We conclude that stakeholders should take into account the spatial connections of green roofs with other green spaces in order to support soil biodiversity. Further studies are needed to more accurately elucidate the importance of green roof types for collembolan communities and associated ecological networks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatial and temporal scale of analysis alter conclusions about the effects of urbanisation on plant–pollinator networks
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Bipartite networks of flowering plants and their visitors (potential pollinators) are increasingly being used in studies of the structure and function of these ecological interactions. Whilst they hold much promise in understanding the ecology of plant–pollinator networks and how this may be altered by environmental perturbations, like land-use change and invasive species, there is no consensus about the scale at which such networks should be constructed and analysed. Ecologists, however, have emphasised that many processes are scale dependent. Here, we compare network- and species-level properties of ecological networks analysed at the level of a site, pooling across sites within a given habitat for each month of surveys, and pooling across all sites and months to create a single network per habitat type. We additionally considered how these three scales of resolution influenced conclusions regarding differences between networks according to two contrasting habitat types (urban bushland remnants and residential gardens) and the influence of honey bee abundance on network properties. We found that most network properties varied markedly depending on the scale of analysis, as did the significance, or lack thereof, of habitat type and honey bee abundance on network properties. We caution against pooling across sites and months as this can create unrealistic links, invalidating conclusions on network structure. In conclusion, consideration of scale of analysis is also important when conducting and interpreting plant–pollinator networks.</jats:p>

TI  - Evaluating the potential of urban areas for bat conservation with citizen science data
PY  - 2022
AB  - Global change, including urbanisation, threatens many of the >1400 bat species. Nevertheless, certain areas within highly urbanised cities may be suitable to harbour bat populations. Thus, managing urban habitats could contribute to bat conservation. Here, we wanted to establish evidence-based recommendations on how to improve urban spaces for the protection of bats. In a team effort with >200 citizen scientists, we recorded bat vocalisations up to six times over the course of 2 years at each of 600 predefined sites in the Berlin metropolitan area. For each species we identified the preferred and non-preferred landscape features. Our results show that artificial light at night (ALAN) had a negative impact on all species. For soprano pipistrelles and mouse-eared bats ALAN had the largest effect sizes among all environmental predictors. Canopy cover and open water were especially important for bat species that forage along vegetation edges and for trawling bats, respectively. Occurrence probability of species foraging in open space decreased with increasing distance to water bodies. On a larger scale, impervious surfaces tended to have positive effects on some species that are specialised on foraging along edge structures. Our study constitutes an important contribution to the growing body of literature showing that despite the many negative impacts of urbanisation on wildlife, urban environments can harbour bat populations if certain conditions are met, such as access to vegetation and water bodies and low levels of ALAN. Our findings are of high relevance for urban planners and conservationists, as they allow inferences on how to manage urban spaces in a bat-friendly way. We recommend limiting ALAN to the minimum necessary and maintaining and creating uninterrupted vegetated corridors between areas with high levels of canopy cover and water bodies, in which ALAN should be entirely avoided. © 2021

TI  - Scalable green infrastructure-The case of domestic private gardens in Vuores, Finland
PY  - 2018
AB  - The planning, implementation, and everyday use of the built environment interweave the green and grey components of urban fabric tightly together. Runoff from grey and impermeable surfaces causes stormwater that is managed in permeable surfaces that simultaneously act as habitats for vegetation. Green infrastructure (GI) is one of the concepts that is used to perceive, manage, and guide the components of urban green spaces. Furthermore, GI pays special attention to stormwater management and urban vegetation at several scales at the same time. This study concentrated on scalable GI in domestic private gardens. A set of garden designs in Vuores, Finland were analyzed and developed by Research by Design. The aim was to study how garden scale choices and designs can enhance GI at the block and neighbourhood scales to rethink design practices to better integrate water and vegetation throughout the scales. As a result, we propose a checklist for designers and urban planners that ensures vegetation-integrated stormwater management to enhance habitat diversity in block scale and possibility to use blocks of private plots for ecological networks. The prerequisite for garden designers is to be capable to balance between water, vegetation, and soil, and their processes and flows in detail the scale. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Lagrangian sampling for emerging contaminants through an urban stream corridor in Colorado
PY  - 2009
AB  - Recent national concerns regarding the environmental occurrence of emerging contaminants (ECs) have catalyzed a series of recent studies. Many ECs are released into the environment through discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and other sources. In 2005, the U.S. Geological Survey and the City of Longmont initiated an investigation of selected ECs in a 13.8-km reach of St. Vrain Creek, Colorado. Seven sites were sampled for ECs following a Lagrangian design; sites were located upstream, downstream, and in the outfall of the Longmont WWTP, and at the mouths of two tributaries, Left Hand Creek and Boulder Creek (which is influenced by multiple WWTP outfalls). Samples for 61 ECs in 16 chemical use categories were analyzed and 36 were detected in one or more samples. Of these, 16 have known or suspected endocrine-disrupting potential. At and downstream from the WWTP outfall, detergent metabolites, fire retardants, and steroids were detected at the highest concentrations, which commonly exceeded 1 μg/l in 2005 and 2 μg/l in 2006. Most individual ECs were measured at concentrations less than 2 μg/l. The results indicate that outfalls from WWTPs are the largest but may not be the sole source of ECs in St. Vrain Creek. In 2005, high discharge was associated with fewer EC detections, lower total EC concentrations, and smaller EC loads in St. Vrain Creek and its tributaries as compared with 2006. EC behavior differed by individual compound, and some differences between sites could be attributed to analytical variability or to other factors such as physical or chemical characteristics or distance from contributing sources. Loads of some ECs, such as diethoxynonylphenol, accumulated or attenuated depending on location, discharge, and distance downstream from the WWTP, whereas others, such as bisphenol A, were largely conservative. The extent to which ECs in St. Vrain Creek affect native fish species and macroinvertebrate communities is unknown, but recent studies have shown that fish respond to very low concentrations of ECs, and further study on the fate and transport of these contaminants in the aquatic environment is warranted. © 2008 American Water Resources Association.

TI  - The Mayaro virus and its potential epidemiological consequences in Colombia: An exploratory biomathematics analysis
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background: Mayaro virus (Togaviridae) is an endemic arbovirus of the Americas with epidemiological similarities with the agents of other more prominent diseases such as dengue (Flaviviridae), Zika (Flaviviridae), and chikungunya (Togaviridae). It is naturally transmitted in a sylvatic/rural cycle by Haemagogus spp., but, potentially, it could be incorporated and transmitted in an urban cycle by Aedes aegypti, a vector widely disseminated in the Americas. Methods: The Mayaro arbovirus dynamics was simulated mathematically in the colombian population in the eight biogeographical provinces, bearing in mind the vector's population movement between provinces through passive transport via truck cargo. The parameters involved in the virus epidemiological dynamics, as well as the vital rates of Ae. aegypti in each of the biogeographical provinces were obtained from the literature. These data were included in a meta-population model in differential equations, represented by a model structured by age for the dynamic population of Ae. aegypti combined with an epidemiological SEI/SEIR-type model. In addition, the model was incorporated with a term of migration to represent the connectivity between the biogeographical provinces. Results: The vital rates and the development cycle of Ae. aegypti varied between provinces, having greater biological potential between 23 °C and 28 °C in provinces of Imerí, biogeographical Chocó, and Magdalena, with respect to the North-Andean Moorland (9.33-21.38 °C). Magdalena and Maracaibo had the highest flow of land cargo. The results of the simulations indicate that Magdalena, Imerí, and biogeographical Chocó would be the most affected regarding the number of cases of people infected by Mayaro virus over time. Conclusions: The temperature in each of the provinces influences the local population dynamics of Ae. aegypti and passive migration via transport of land cargo plays an important role on how the Mayaro virus would be disseminated in the human population. Once this arbovirus begins an urban cycle, the most-affected departments would be Antioquia, Santander, Norte de Santander, Cesar (Provinces of Magdalena), and Valle del Cauca, and Chocó (biogeographical province of Chocó), which is why vector control programmes must aim their efforts at these departments and include some type of vector control to the transport of land cargo to avoid a future Mayaro epidemic.[Figure not available: see fulltext]. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Multi-region assessment of chemical mixture exposures and predicted cumulative effects in USA wadeable urban/agriculture-gradient streams
PY  - 2021
AB  - Chemical-contaminant mixtures are widely reported in large stream reaches in urban/agriculture-developed watersheds, but mixture compositions and aggregate biological effects are less well understood in corresponding smaller headwaters, which comprise most of stream length, riparian connectivity, and spatial biodiversity. During 2014–2017, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) measured 389 unique organic analytes (pharmaceutical, pesticide, organic wastewater indicators) in 305 headwater streams within four contiguous United States (US) regions. Potential aquatic biological effects were evaluated for estimated maximum and median exposure conditions using multiple lines of evidence, including occurrence/concentrations of designed-bioactive pesticides and pharmaceuticals and cumulative risk screening based on vertebrate-centric ToxCast™ exposure-response data and on invertebrate and nonvascular plant aquatic life benchmarks. Mixed-contaminant exposures were ubiquitous and varied, with 78% (304) of analytes detected at least once and cumulative maximum concentrations up to more than 156,000 ng/L. Designed bioactives represented 83% of detected analytes. Contaminant summary metrics correlated strong-positive (rho (ρ): 0.569–0.719) to multiple watershed-development metrics, only weak-positive to point-source discharges (ρ: 0.225–353), and moderate- to strong-negative with multiple instream invertebrate metrics (ρ: −0.373 to −0.652). Risk screening indicated common exposures with high probability of vertebrate-centric molecular effects and of acute toxicity to invertebrates, respectively. The results confirm exposures to broad and diverse contaminant mixtures and provide convincing multiple lines of evidence that chemical contaminants contribute substantially to adverse multi-stressor effects in headwater-stream communities. © 2021

TI  - Deep vertical rotary tillage increases the diversity of bacterial communities and alters the bacterial network structure in soil planted to corn
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p> Deep vertical rotary tillage (DVRT) is a novel technique; however, its influence on soil bacterial diversity and community structure remains unclear. Herein, it was hypothesized that this tillage method significantly improves the bacterial diversity and alters the bacterial community structure and therefore it supports enhanced soil ecosystem functions in cultivated land. We investigated the soil bacterial communities and performed molecular ecological network analysis of cultivated land soils under different tillage regimes using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing. Soil samples were collected from the experimental field under 2 treatments: DVRT and conventional rotary tillage (CT) in Shizuishan City, Ningxia, China, in a 2-year field experiment. The α-diversity indices showed that DVRT resulted in higher bacterial diversity. In addition, the principal coordinate analysis results revealed a clear separation among the groups of cultivated land soils under the 2 treatment regimes. The key physicochemical factors that significantly influenced bacterial diversity and community structure were pH and total potassium concentration. The network analysis indicated that the bacterial network of DVRT soils consisted of more functionally interrelated bacterial modules than that of soils under CT, and the topological roles of characteristic bacteria and key bacteria were also different. In relation to CT, the relative abundances of organisms belonging to the functional groups of “Xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism”, “Signal transduction”, and “Metabolism of cofactors and vitamins” were significantly increased in cultivated land soils under DVRT. It was concluded that DVRT treatment could improve bacterial diversity, alter the bacterial network structure, and enhance potential ecosystem functions in soils of cultivated land. </jats:p>

TI  - Neurotoxicity of pesticides: The roadmap for the cubic mode of action
PY  - 2020
AB  - Pesticides are used today on a planetary-wide scale. The rising need for substances with this biological activity due to an increasing consumption of agricultural and animal products and to the development of urban areas makes the chemical industry to constantly investigate new molecules or to improve the physicochemical characteristics, increase the biological activities and improve the toxicity profiles of the already known ones. Molecular databases are increasingly accessible for in vitro and in vivo bioavailability studies. In this context, structure-activity studies, by their in silico-in cerebro methods, are used to precede in vitro and in vivo studies in plants and experimental animals because they can indicate trends by statistical methods or biological activity models expressed as mathematical equations or graphical correlations, so a direction of study can be developed or another can be abandoned, saving financial resources, time and laboratory animals. Following this line of research the present paper reviews the Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) studies and proposes a correlation between a topological connectivity index and the biological activity or toxicity made as a result of a study performed on 11 molecules of organophosphate compounds, randomly chosen, with a basic structure including a Phosphorus atom double bounded to an Oxygen atom or to a Sulfur one and having three other simple covalent bonds with two alkoxy (-methoxy or-ethoxy) groups and to another functional group different from the alkoxy groups. The molecules were packed on a cubic structure consisting of three adjacent cubes, respecting a principle of topological efficiency, that of occupying a minimal space in that cubic structure, a method that was called the Clef Method. The central topological index selected for correlation was the Wiener index, since it was possible this way to discuss different adjacencies between the nodes in the graphs corresponding to the organophosphate compounds molecules packed on the cubic structure; accordingly, \"three dimensional\" variants of these connectivity indices could be considered and further used for studying the qualitative-quantitative relationships for the specific molecule-enzyme interaction complexes, including correlation between the Wiener weights (nodal specific contributions to the total Wiener index of the molecular graph) and the biochemical reactivity of some of the atoms. Finally, when passing from SAR to Q(uantitative)-SAR studies, especially by the present advanced method of the cubic molecule (Clef Method) and its good assessment of the (neuro)toxicity of the studied molecules and of their inhibitory effect on the target enzyme-acetylcholinesterase, it can be seen that a predictability of the toxicity and activity of different analogue compounds can be ensured, facilitating the in vivo experiments or improving the usage of pesticides. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.

TI  - Replacing natural wetlands with stormwater management facilities: Biophysical and perceived social values
PY  - 2015
AB  - Urban expansion replaces wetlands of natural origin with artificial stormwater management facilities. The literature suggests that efforts to mimic natural wetlands in the design of stormwater facilities can expand the provision of ecosystem services. Policy developments seek to capitalize on these improvements, encouraging developers to build stormwater wetlands in place of stormwater ponds; however, few have compared the biophysical values and social perceptions of these created wetlands to those of the natural wetlands they are replacing. We compared four types of wetlands: natural references sites, natural wetlands impacted by agriculture, created stormwater wetlands, and created stormwater ponds. We anticipated that they would exhibit a gradient in biodiversity, ecological integrity, chemical and hydrologic stress. We further anticipated that perceived values would mirror measured biophysical values. We found higher biophysical values associated with wetlands of natural origin (both reference and agriculturally impacted). The biophysical values of stormwater wetlands and stormwater ponds were lower and indistinguishable from one another. The perceived wetland values assessed by the public differed from the observed biophysical values. This has important policy implications, as the public are not likely to perceive the loss of values associated with the replacement of natural wetlands with created stormwater management facilities. We conclude that 1) agriculturally impacted wetlands provide biophysical values equivalent to those of natural wetlands, meaning that land use alone is not a great predictor of wetland value; 2) stormwater wetlands are not a substantive improvement over stormwater ponds, relative to wetlands of natural origin; 3) stormwater wetlands are poor mimics of natural wetlands, likely due to fundamental distinctions in terms of basin morphology, temporal variation in hydrology, ground water connectivity, and landscape position; 4) these drivers are relatively fixed, thus, once constructed, it may not be possible to modify them to improve provision of biophysical values; 5) these fixed drivers are not well perceived by the public and thus public perception may not capture the true value of natural wetlands, including those impacted by agriculture. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A new habitat availability index to integrate connectivity in landscape conservation planning: Comparison with existing indices and application to a case study
PY  - 2007
AB  - Connectivity is a major concern for the maintenance of wildlife populations, ecological flows, and many other landscape functions. For these reasons many different connectivity indices have been used or proposed for landscape conservation planning; however, their properties and behaviour have not been sufficiently examined and may provide misleading or undesired results for these purposes. We here present a new index (probability of connectivity, PC) that is based on the habitat availability concept, dispersal probabilities between habitat patches and graph structures. We evaluate the performance of PC and compare it with other widespread indices through a set of 13 relevant properties that an index should ideally fulfil for adequately integrating connectivity in landscape planning applications. We found that PC is the only index that systematically accomplished all the requirements, overcoming some serious limitations of other available indices. We encourage the use of PC as a sound basis for planning decision-making. To demonstrate the use and potential of PC for practical landscape applications, we present an example of application to a case study for the goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in Catalonia (NE Spain), where we identify those habitat areas that most contribute to overall landscape connectivity and evaluate the effectiveness and potential improvement of a protected areas network (Natura 2000) for conserving those critical habitat areas. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Aseismic Mining Subsidence in an Abandoned Mine: Influence Factors and Consequences for Post-Mining Risk Management
PY  - 2019
AB  - In the Lorraine area of eastern France, decades of iron-ore mining from 1850 to 1997 have left vast underground cavities beneath or in the vicinity of urban areas. Several major collapses occurred in the southern part of this iron-ore basin in the 1990s, after the mine closure and the flooding of underground mine workings. Following these large-scale collapses, the French government initiated a strategy of post-mining risk management to prevent and control risks associated with these ground failures. The high-risk zones are secured either by reducing the vulnerability while the moderate risk zones are monitored for public safety purposes by using in situ monitoring. This monitoring relies mainly on real-time microseismic systems, to detect precursors to a rapid large-scale collapse. After the progressive closing and then flooding of the northern iron basin ending in 2008, subsidence was observed in a town of the Lorraine basin in autumn of 2009. However, this local subsidence, with a low velocity of few centimeters per month, was not clearly detected by the borehole microseismic monitoring station located nearby. Only some microseismic events were recorded, which could not be unambiguously related to the beginning of the subsidence event. To better understand this lack of microseismic precursor a geophysical investigation was launched. A calibration blast experiment was carried out from a remaining old underground access in order to answer to the following questions: (1) what is the seismic wave attenuation field?; (2) what is the minimum source power that can be detected by the sensors?; (3) what is the impact of the geology, the faults corridor and the integral pillar extraction zone on the wave propagation field? The results of this study show strong anelastic attenuation of the seismic waves though the monitored overburden most likely related to the extensive fault system intersecting the study site. Strong attenuation might explain the lack of detected microseismicity during the subsidence event. In order to clarify this issue, a mobile GPS monitoring system was designed and tested to address this type of situation in future. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Landscape ecological risk assessment and ecological security pattern optimization construction in Yinchuan City
PY  - 2022
AB  - The ecological environmental protection and high-quality development of Yinchuan City have become important parts of sustainable development in the Yellow River Basin, and the regional ecological security pattern must urgently be optimized. This study draws attention to the spatial and temporal characteristics of landscape ecological risk and constructs an ecological security pattern of Yinchuan City in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China, by employing land use data from 2000, 2010, and 2020; analyzing the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of landscape ecological risk based on landscape ecological risk assessment; and studying the ecological risk evolution rule of different land use. This study proposes the ecological security pattern and ecological security protection strategies using the landscape ecological risk index (ERI) and the minimal cumulative resistance (MCR) model. Meanwhile, in order to reflect the magnitude of resistance encountered during species migration, the paper used core ecological sources which had areas greater than 10 km2 and were mainly distributed in natural protected areas such as Helan Mountain and Baijitan National Nature Reserve. It chose six resistance factors, including landscape ERI, vegetation coverage, elevation, slope, distance from road, and distance from water to calculate the resistance value. Based on ecological sources and resistance, the minimal cumulative resistance value was obtained by MCR and the ecological corridors and ecological nodes were identified preliminarily. Finally, the preliminary ecological security pattern was optimized, combined with land use map of 2020 and the MCR value, and the ecological security strategies were proposed. The results show that: (1) Landscape ecological risk in Yinchuan City shows the distribution characteristics, are high in which the middle and north but low in the south is low. The average ERIs of 2000, 2010, and 2020 are 0.2155, 0.2145, and 0.2130, respectively, which indicates an overall downward trend in the landscape ecological risk has appeared in the past 20 years and an ecological risk level moving from high to low. (2) Twenty-two ecological corridors and 52 ecological nodes are identified. The cumulative length of the ecological corridors is 511.23 km and shows the net distribution in the northwest-southeast direction, which is sparse in the north and dense in the south. Six key ecological corridors are through the north and south. These are distributed along the region that includes the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve and the Yellow River-Baijitan National Nature Reserve, and form the spatial distribution characteristics of“three vertical”. (3) Yinchuan City has formed an optimized ecological security pattern, which consisted of 819.56 km2 ecological sources, 22 ecological corridors, and 52 ecological nodes, and some ecological security protection strategies are proposed on the basis of ecological security pattern, which provides theoretical reference and a basis for landscape ecological risk assessment and promotion of the ecological security level. © 2022 by the Author(s).

TI  - Habitat impacts the abundance and network structure within tick (Acari: Ixodidae) communities on tropical small mammals
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ticks of small mammals pose a significant risk to public health but these hazards are poorly understood in the tropics due to the paucity of information on the disease ecology of ticks in these regions. Mapping and quantifying the diversity of small mammal/tick networks and the effects of habitat on these medically important systems is key to disease prevention. Singapore represents a microcosm of much of tropical Asia as it has a diverse, though poorly studied, community of ticks and small mammals. Singapore also has a range of terrestrial habitats exhibiting a gradient of degradation. Small mammals and their ticks were sampled across the island in four main habitat types (old secondary forest, young secondary forest, scrubland, urban) across 4.5 years. Four tick species were collected (Amblyomma helvolum, Dermacentor auratus, Haemaphysalis semermis, Ixodes granulatus) from 10 small mammal species. Habitat was found to have a significant effect on both the abundance and structure of tick communities on small mammals. Old secondary forest communities had the highest tick abundance, comparatively high connectance, niche overlap (among ticks), linkage density, and were the preferred habitat of the zoonotic tick I. granulatus. Therefore, future disease spillover is likely to emerge from small mammal-tick communities in old secondary forests. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - The status of commons in the changing landscape in the Czech Republic
PY  - 2021
AB  - Commons were ancient pastures, which once occurred in every village in many countries, including the Czech Republic. They have been a landscape and social phenomenon for decades. However, social and economic changes brought an end to community ownership and traditional management of these commons. The number of commons has been decreasing since the middle of the 19th century and currently very few remain. This paper evaluates the status of former commons in 35 cadastres in south-western Bohemia and describes the changes they have undergone in the last two hundred years. Three historical periods were identified as the main drivers in the changes in the status of commons. We started with a period from the middle of the 19th century to the 1950s, the second from 1950s to 1990s and the last from 1990s to 2019. Aerial images and field surveys revealed that 93% of former commons disappeared due to afforestation, conversion to fields and natural succession occurring on abandoned commons. The social and economic aspects associated with these changes are mentioned. Some of the commons are part of the Territorial system of landscape ecological stability (Ecological networks) and we suggest that more of the remaining commons should be included in this network. They could play a role in maintaining biodiversity and providing stepping stones in a uniform agriculture landscape. We propose to evaluate the conservation and ecosystem value of these commons in more detail and set up the appropriate management essential for the preservation or restoration of commons, an indisputable part of our biological and cultural heritage. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Local econetwork of vinnytsia Сity
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>The purpose of the study is to identify the peculiarities of the local econetwork of Vinnytsia for the sustainable urban development. Methods: field research (key, area and route), literary-cartographic, analytical-cartographic analysis, collecting and processing of statistical information, theoretical generalization and systematization of facts, analysis, abstraction, analogy, synthesis. Results. 30 key territories, which occupy 15.9% of the city area, are distinguished in the structure of Vinnytsia econetwork. According to the peculiarities of vegetation and modern landscapes, all key territories are grouped into the following groups: forest, forest-meadow, forest-swamp, pond, garden-park and cemetery. Forest key territories that correspond to the background landscapes in the past are predominant (81.7% of the area). Key territories are joined by two national and twenty five local ecological corridors, which cover 12% of the city area. River-valley ecocorridors prevail among them in area and length while street-road ecological corridors prevail in their quantity. Buffer areas, that cover 4.8% of the city’s territory, are designed around key territories and ecological corridors. Thirteen recovery territories, which occupy 0.9% of Vinnytsia area, are potential for increasing the area of key territories and ecocorridors in the future. In perspective, seven interactive elements, projected mainly by stream valleys, occupying 0.6% of the city territory, may pass into the category of ecocorridors. The novelty of the study is that for the first time: since the change of Vinnytsia’s borders in 2015, the city econetwork project has been developed; peculiarities of interactive elements and ecotechnical junctions are identified and specificated; peculiarities of the landscape complexes of the territory were taken into account while justifying the choice of structural elements of the econetwork.</jats:p>

TI  - Cost-effective species conservation in exurban communities: A spatial analysis
PY  - 2010
AB  - Exurban areas have increasingly become zones of conflict as conservation and development compete for the same finite land resources. Conversion of natural areas to land dominated by human use results in loss, degradation, and fragmentation of wildlife habitat which often lead to species endangerment or even extinction. Recently, reserve site selection models have begun to integrate spatial attributes in order to design more compact and connected reserve networks that are thought to improve long-term species persistence. While these models are a good step forward to designing conservation reserve networks, they might not be adequate for use in exurban areas that consist of heterogeneous mosaics of land uses where habitat fragmentation already exists and not all parcels are available for preservation. This paper presents a species conservation framework that expands upon traditional reserve site selection models in three ways. First, because of the focus on exurban areas, the framework used here allows for land conversion within core habitat patches. Second, the framework provides a more robust assessment of connectivity among patches by accounting for land-use heterogeneity in the dispersal matrix. And third, the framework explicitly incorporates species population dynamics. We apply our conservation framework to the case of pond-breeding salamanders in an exurban community in Rhode Island, USA. Comparisons are made between the outcomes for uniform conservation policies and more flexible policies that accommodate ecological and economic heterogeneity. As expected, policies that offer more flexibility in the decision-making process are less costly in terms of foregone development. Conservation planners should consider core habitat patches, dispersal matrix, and spatial scale in their decision making. By not assessing the potential impact of dispersal barriers, reserve site selection models will result in conservation plans that may not protect species over the long term, particularly for species residing in highly fragmented landscapes such as those found in many exurban communities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Urbanisation processes in puszcza zielonka landscape park in poland-and its buffer zone in the context of protection of natural structures
PY  - 2020
AB  - Puszcza Zielonka Landscape Park (PZLP), located in western Poland is an area under the constant pressure of urbanization processes occurring in the zone of influence of the Poznań urban agglomeration. The park was established in 1993. The protected area is surrounded by built-up areas, which interrupt the continuity of wildlife corridors. The park and its buffer zone are located in six communes, which have their own spatial policies. The aim of the article was to determine changes in the trends, scale and rate of investments in the park and its buffer zone, expressed by changes in the land cover and use, which have taken place since the establishment of the park. These changes were considered important factors affecting the state of protected natural values and defining the effectiveness of protective instruments. The study included an analysis of the spatial policy of the communes expressed in Study of the Conditions and Directions of the Spatial Management (SCDSM) and its compliance with the Park protection trends indicated in the Protection Plan. The analyses were carried out with GIS tools. The results showed conflicts between the intended changes in land development expressed by local governments and the park protection objectives. © 2020, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

TI  - Protecting an Ecosystem Service: Approaches to Understanding and Mitigating Threats to Wild Insect Pollinators
PY  - 2016
AB  - Insect pollination constitutes an ecosystem service of global importance, providing significant economic and aesthetic benefits as well as cultural value to human society, alongside vital ecological processes in terrestrial ecosystems. It is therefore important to understand how insect pollinator populations and communities respond to rapidly changing environments if we are to maintain healthy and effective pollinator services. This chapter considers the importance of conserving pollinator diversity to maintain a suite of functional traits and provide a diverse set of pollinator services. We explore how we can better understand and mitigate the factors that threaten insect pollinator richness, placing our discussion within the context of populations in predominantly agricultural landscapes in addition to urban environments. We highlight a selection of important evidence gaps, with a number of complementary research steps that can be taken to better understand: (i) the stability of pollinator communities in different landscapes in order to provide diverse pollinator services; (ii) how we can study the drivers of population change to mitigate the effects and support stable sources of pollinator services and (iii) how we can manage habitats in complex landscapes to support insect pollinators and provide sustainable pollinator services for the future. We advocate a collaborative effort to gain higher quality abundance data to understand the stability of pollinator populations and predict future trends. In addition, for effective mitigation strategies to be adopted, researchers need to conduct rigorous field testing of outcomes under different landscape settings, acknowledge the needs of end-users when developing research proposals and consider effective methods of knowledge transfer to ensure effective uptake of actions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Characteristics of urban expansion and vegetation change in built-up areas of Gan-Qing-Ning based on nighttime light data
PY  - 2022
AB  - Carrying out research on the spatial development pattern and vegetation change characteristics of urban built-up areas in the Gan-Qing-Ning region on the upper reaches of the Yellow River can provide an important reference for building a scientific and reasonable urban development system and maintaining regional ecological security barriers. Based on DMSP / OLS and statistical data, this paper extracted the urban built-up area boundaries of 21 prefecture-level cities (prefectures) in Gan-Qing-Ning region by using statistical data comparison method, and analyzed the urban expansion characteristics from five aspects: urban spatial expansion characteristics, expansion speed, dynamic degree, compactness and center of gravity transfer. On this basis, the SPOT/ VEGETATION NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data was introduced, and the annual average NDVI was used as an indicator to represent the vegetation status in urban built-up areas. The vegetation change of urban built-up areas in the study area from 2002 to 2013 was studied from five aspects: sum, mean, ratio and its change amount, interannual change rate, percentage and stability of NDVI. The results showed that: 1) As one of the effective methods to extract urban built-up area, the statistical data comparison method had high accuracy in our study area, and the error rate was within 6.7%. 2) The urban land formed a discontinuous spatial pattern of “几” around the Hexi Corridor and the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and had three different distribution patterns: point, line and plane. 3) The annual average rate and dynamic degree of urban expansion showed an upward trend, and the rate of urban expansion during 2010—2013 (4.53 km2 / a) was twice as high as that during 2006—2010. 4) Except for Jiuquan, Haixi, Baiyin, Tianshui, Shizuishan and Lanzhou, the compactness index of other urban build-up areas was relatively high. 5) In the first stage (2002—2006) and the second stage (2006—2010), the center of gravity shifted northward, and in the third stage (2010—2013), the center of gravity shifted southward. 6) The total NDVI of urban built-up area increased with the increase of built-up area. 7) The vegetation in urban built-up areas showed a positive trend on the whole. From the perspective of the mean NDVI, the vegetation condition got worse from 2002 to 2006, and improved from 2006 to 2013. Moreover, the mean NDVI distribution showed obvious spatial differences, and the central and western regions were generally smaller than the eastern ones. From the perspective of the interannual variation rate and percentage of NDVI, the built-up area of each city was larger than the peripheral background area. 8) The vegetation status in urban built-up areas was generally worse than that in background areas, and the NDVI ratio and its variation in nearly 4/ 7 urban built-up areas showed a downward trend from 2002 to 2013. 9) Vegetation stability in urban built-up areas was poor, and the variation coefficients of more than half of the cities increased to varying degrees in the past 12 years. © 2022 Science Press.

TI  - Environmental effects of brushwood harvesting for bioenergy
PY  - 2017
AB  - Sweden aims to increase the proportion of renewable energy sources, ultimately to be able to phase out fossil fuels. To achieve this, new energy sources need to be explored. In this multi-disciplinary article, we examine the technical, economical, ecological and legal possibilities to commercially and sustainably harvest brushwood for bioenergy, while simultaneously gaining positive environmental effects, both for biological diversity, the cultural heritage, and the climate. The Swedish open landscape is becoming covered with secondary brushwood regrowth through natural succession, except where it is kept open. Brushwood is spreading along roads, railway lines, edge zones, in power line corridors, abandoned semi-natural grasslands, nature reserves, and in marginal land in urban areas. Such brushwood consists of saplings, bushes and young trees of a range of deciduous plant species, e.g. birch, aspen, alder and goat willow, sometimes mixed with conifers, often forming dense thickets. Such secondary brushwood regrowth could be systematically utilised as a new source of renewable bioenergy. Commercial brushwood harvesting in Sweden may contribute 26 PJ of energy annually, which may be a small but significant contribution, considering the favourable energy ratio (Er = 28), indicating that large emission reductions can be achieved, if fossil fuels are replaced. Growing brushwood does not require fertilizers or pesticides, soil tillage or crop management, and it does not compete with any other potential land use. Many brushwood habitats are already being managed to clear brushwood, for other purposes, minimizing the added harvesting cost. Apart from providing bioenergy, it has also been suggested that brushwood harvesting would benefit biological diversity. A large number of nationally redlisted species are dependent on the active management of open habitats, including semi-natural grasslands, and man-made habitats such as road verges and power line corridors. Our literature review shows that brushwood harvesting could benefit both biological diversity and the cultural heritage, and contribute to the management of the open cultural landscape. There are however certain limitations. Brushwood harvesting would favour a certain set of species, including many redlisted, but it may also threaten another set of species, especially species associated with early successional stages of forest regeneration, as well as forest edge species, depending on how and where it is applied. Harvesting may be affected by legislation imposing limitations regarding habitats of particular importance for biodiversity. The environmental and legal constraints would probably reduce the profitability of brushwood harvesting in certain areas, as well as the annual production of bioenergy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Urban afforestation and its ecosystem balance contribution: a bibliometric review
PY  - 2021
AB  - Purpose: Urbanization is characterized mainly by changes in land use and conversion of natural areas into built environments, as well as by a series of impacts, such as loss of biodiversity, which interfere with the proper functioning of ecological networks. Design/methodology/approach: Thus, the authors apply a bibliometric analysis using the term “Urban Trees” in the “Web of Science” database, between 2009 and 2019, as a keyword to include all urban green structures and identify the main aspects of urban ecological relationships. They found 8,367 published articles. Findings: This review identified the main countries and research institutions that operate in urban afforestation. In general, developing countries seek to understand the environmental benefits that urban afforestation can provide, demonstrating the importance of maintaining existing green areas in urban centers to promote the balance of the ecosystem. It depends directly on the flow of ecosystem services provided by green infrastructures in the city, contributing significantly to carbon sequestration, retention of particulate matter, mitigation of heat islands and reduction of surface runoff, directly favoring the health and well-being of the population. The authors conclude that the actions currently implemented in urban afforestation, especially to increase the richness and abundance of species, will be decisive for the future of urban centers and the construction of more sustainable and egalitarian cities. Originality/value: This work sought to develop a bibliographic research based on information obtained by bibliometric analysis that has the ability to identify trends and volumes of scientific production in a given area of knowledge. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Temporal-spatial analysis of vegetation coverage dynamics in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan regions
PY  - 2017
AB  - Identifying the dynamics of vegetation coverage is important for the research of ecological security and ecosystem services. This study analyzed MODIS NDVI remote sensing data and identified the temporal-spatial dynamics of vegetation coverage during 2005-2015 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan regions. The analysis methods included linear regression, coefficient of variation, R/S analysis, and other mathematical methods. The results showed that (1) the vegetation coverage increased by 0.065 from 2005 to 2015. The vegetation restoration experienced a stable fluctuation phase after two fast-improving periods. (2) The significantly improved area occupied 47.45% of the region and the insignificant area accounted for 33.9% of the region, which was mainly in the North China Plain. The degraded area accounted for 6.8% of the region and was scattered in the surroundings of big cities. (3) The sustainability of vegetation restoration was dominant (58.8%) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The vegetation area of anti-sustainability accounted for 34.4%, mainly distributed in Zhangjiakou, Cangzhou, and the south-east of Baoding. The continuous degradation area was only 4.8% of the region and distributed in the cities of Tianjin, Langfang, and Cangzhou. These results could be useful for identifying the dynamics of vegetation coverage and predicting the potential trends of ecological network connectivity. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - Aquatic insect diversity in streams across a rural–urban land-use discontinuum
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization negatively impacts the diversity of aquatic insect assemblages in headwater streams and can lead to the homogenization of insect communities at the regional level. However, less is known about the impact of urbanization on insects in headwater streams within smaller cities that have significant upstream portions outside of urban land use. We collected insects monthly from April to September in 2014 and 2015 from five streams that flowed from rural upstream through urban downstream land use, plus two rural reference streams, in Greater Binghamton, New York, in the northeast USA. While urbanization was associated with lower insect taxonomic richness (α¯) and elevated stream water conductivity, the regional diversity (γ) was similar among urban and rural land use. This corresponded to higher dissimilarity among urban sites (β) than among rural sites. To our knowledge, this is the first report of higher urban stream insect community β-diversity. Our results suggest that urbanization in this medium-sized city negatively impacts stream insect richness, but the change of community assemblages is not homogenous across the urban landscape. Connectivity between upstream rural sites and downstream urban sites may provide some relief from the impacts of urbanization in smaller cities. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Urban forest invertebrates: how they shape and respond to the urban environment
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Invertebrates comprise the most diversified animal group on Earth. Due to their long evolutionary history and small size, invertebrates occupy a remarkable range of ecological niches, and play an important role as “ecosystem engineers” by structuring networks of mutualistic and antagonistic ecological interactions in almost all terrestrial ecosystems. Urban forests provide critical ecosystem services to humans, and, as in other systems, invertebrates are central to structuring and maintaining the functioning of urban forests. Identifying the role of invertebrates in urban forests can help elucidate their importance to practitioners and the public, not only to preserve biodiversity in urban environments, but also to make the public aware of their functional importance in maintaining healthy greenspaces. In this review, we examine the multiple functional roles that invertebrates play in urban forests that contribute to ecosystem service provisioning, including pollination, predation, herbivory, seed and microorganism dispersal and organic matter decomposition, but also those that lead to disservices, primarily from a public health perspective, e.g., transmission of invertebrate-borne diseases. We then identify a number of ecological filters that structure urban forest invertebrate communities, such as changes in habitat structure, increased landscape imperviousness, microclimatic changes and pollution. We also discuss the complexity of ways that forest invertebrates respond to urbanisation, including acclimation, local extinction and evolution. Finally, we present management recommendations to support and conserve viable and diverse urban forest invertebrate populations into the future.</jats:p>

TI  - Implementing the connectivity of natural areas in cities as an indicator in the City Biodiversity Index (CBI)
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract The City Biodiversity Index (CBI), or Singapore Index on Cities’ Biodiversity, serves as a tool to monitor biodiversity in cities and was endorsed by the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2009. Indicator 2 of the CBI measures the connectivity of natural areas in cities. We propose an improved and straightforward method for measuring connectivity based on the effective mesh size metric to replace the previous method used in the CBI. The previous version did not account for intra-patch (within-patch) connectivity nor for major barriers. Our evaluation of the new version of Indicator 2 through its application to Montreal and Lisbon confirmed its reliability. In Montreal, natural areas have a total connectivity value of 581.7 ha, the majority of which exists between, rather than within, patches of natural area. Smaller patches (

TI  - Stepping-stone populations in linear landscape elements increase pollen dispersal between urban forest fragments
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background and aims - Understanding how to ensure connectivity by gene flow between insect-pollinated plant populations is essential for designing functional ecological networks in a human-dominated matrix such as in urban settings. Linear landscape elements (LLEs) might contribute to such connectivity by increasing pollen transfer. Methods - Pollen dispersal was investigated for the insect-pollinated herb Primula elatior in urban forest remnants, using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue, in three study sites comprising population pairs located in fragments connected or not by a wooded LLE. We examined whether the presence of a small patch of plants of P. elatior placed within the LLE (stepping-stone population) might increase pollen dispersal compared to an LLE where P. elatior is absent. Key results - Dye dispersal showed a leptokurtic decay distribution, with most dye transfer events at short distances (80% at less than 15.4-114.8 m) and a maximal distance of 647.5 m. Populations not connected by an LLE, separated by distances of 249 m or more, did not exchange dye, whereas populations that were connected by LLEs (up to 602 m) did show interpopulation dye transfer, suggesting that LLEs function as biological corridors facilitating dye dispersal. The presence of a stepping-stone population of P. elatior within the LLE increased between-population dye transfers (between 1.8 and 3.3 times the proportion of visited individuals) and deposition distances, compared to an LLE with no stepping stone, at least when pollen flow already existed. Conclusions - These results provide evidence that LLEs may be more effective for pollen dispersal when serving as both movement conduit and habitat. In urban settings, developing a network of core populations connected by LLEs comprising small, even temporary, stepping-stone populations should be encouraged. © 2012 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.

TI  - Functional ecology of wild bees in cities: towards a better understanding of trait-urbanization relationships
PY  - 2020
AB  - A functional ecological understanding of urban wild bee communities is of growing importance especially in regard to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service maintenance and effective conservation programmes. In this paper, we review and summarize the published literature aiming to inform future research investigations in the growing field of wild bee functional ecology. Specifically, we: (1) review which functional trait-based analyses have been carried out on wild bees in cities thus far; (2) summarize which wild bee species traits have been considered; (3) evaluate any consistent wild bee trait–environment relationships (i.e. urbanization) across studies; and (4) synthesize findings and limitations to inform future research recommendations. We reviewed 48 studies based on a systematic Web of Knowledge search. We found consistent trait characteristics for ‘nesting type’, ‘diet’, ‘body size’, ‘sociality’ and ‘phenology’ across studies. More than one third of the studies were descriptive and the majority of studies were located in urban gardens in temperate Europe and North America, calling for more research from underrepresented geographic regions and from the entire spectrum of urban habitat types. Of these studies, only five analyzed functional diversity indices and three studies applied statistics to relate urban wild bee traits to urbanization factors. Future studies should consider trait-based statistics, and could incorporate functional trait-based ecological networks to examine network shifts across urbanization gradients. Our review suggests that we lack generalizable information about wild bee trait and urbanization relationships yet, making conservation recommendations challenging. Therefore, we propose more research that considers methodological recommendations to develop a comparable and comprehensive understanding of how urbanization affects the functional ecology of urban wild bees to link with specific urban conservation measures.

TI  - Landscape pattern analysis of the urban forest and green network structure in the Pudong district of Shanghai, China
PY  - 2017
AB  - Introduction: Urbanization has altered the natural landscape in the world. The urban expansion has been occurring more rapidly than ever before in China. Objective: To analyze the urban forest landscape pattern and ecological network structure in the Pudong district in Shanghai, China. Materials and methods: The study area covers 553 km2, including 253 km2 of built-up area. Using Landsat 7 2008TM, 2007 Spot Image, Google Earth and city maps, the structural characteristics were analyzed. The landscape patterns of the urban forest and green network structure were interpreted using ArcGIS Software. Results and discussion: The area of the urban forest patches (&gt;900 m2) and the built-up area in the district were 5.15 % and 5.78 % respectively. The area of the green corridor network was 80.27 km2 while the density was 1.99 km·km-2. The linkage of the green network was 1.30, circuitry was 0.19 and connectivity 0.47. The tree canopy coverage was 7.02 % in the entire study area, and 10.27 % in the built-up area. The tree canopy coverage can reach to 8.68 % ~ 9.79 % in the total study area, and 11.49 % ~ 12.3 % in the built-up area. Conclusion: The green network has been constructed, but it was not well designed, so it is necessary to improve its structure. The existing trees cannot modify the forest environment for all the urban forest. Planting more trees is feasible to increase the tree canopy coverage. © 2017 Universidad Autonoma Chapingo.

TI  - Gender differences in traditional knowledge of useful plants in a Brazilian community
PY  - 2021
AB  - Genders differ in traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) about plants, but how gender influences TEK sharing is still poorly understood. Here, we examined how gender is associated with the diversity, transmission, and structure of TEK. We tested whether women and men differ in terms of plant knowledge (species richness, α-diversity), knowledge heterogeneity (β-diversity), and in the structure of social-ecological networks they form. The study was carried out in a suburban community in the city of Ouro Preto, Southeastern, Brazil. Using the snow-ball technique, semi-structured interviews, guided tours, and participant observation, we gathered information from 33 women and 33 men in the community. We collected information about their culture, social-economic profiles, and plant knowledge from which we identified 291 plant species in 10 use categories. Overall, our results indicated that the cognition and sharing of ethnobotanical knowledge are structured by gender. Women rated better in their plant knowledge repertory (greater α-diversity), while plant knowledge among men was more heterogeneous (greater β-diversity), suggesting less information sharing among them. We observed that the network among women is more connected, exhibited greater information sharing, with a greater number of central individuals, who likely provide the cohesion and maintenance of TEK in the community. Our findings indicate how socialecological networks can provide insights and information to unveil social patterns of knowledge transmission. Understanding how TEK is fostered and shared among community members will favor better planning of ethnobotanical studies, as well as inform decision-makers about strategies for the conservation of plant TEK.

TI  - Urban morphological dynamics in Santiago (Chile): Proposing sustainable indicators from remote sensing
PY  - 2016
AB  - Latin America is one of the world's most urbanised regions, with more than 80% of inhabitants living in urban areas and over 50 cities with at least 1 million inhabitants. The concept of urban structure types (UST) allows the dynamics of a growing urban environment to be captured in its quantity and quality. They are defined as areas of homogenous appearance in the urban matrix with a recognisable mixture of built-up areas and open spaces. We used the vegetation-impervious-soil (V-I-S) model approach to classify and monitor different types of USTs in Santiago (∼800 km2), Chile between 1985 and 2015. The V-I-S model is based on a simplification of the large diversity of urban land cover types in three general categories: vegetation, impervious surfaces and soil. These categories were obtained by processing Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI images. First, we applied standard radiometric calibration and co-registration methods to all datasets. Second, using a linear spectral unmixing algorithm we performed a soft classification of urban land cover types (end members): trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants, soils, buildings, roads and water bodies. All end members were validated using a combination of photointerpretation on high-resolution images (∼1 m) and field data collection (only for 2015). In each pixel we used the resulting probability scores, logically grouped, to obtain final values for each V-I-S component. Third, we used statistical clustering of V-I-S values to create a set of eight pixel groups, which we interpreted as USTs and mapped them for each date. The overall accuracy for V-I-S components in 1985 and 2015 were 78% and 82%, respectively, and errors did not exhibit any spatial correlation. The main sources of differentiation between USTs were the trade-off proportions between vegetation and impervious components, whereas soil proportions remained near 5% across the city in both dates. To analyse the change in UST spatial configuration between dates, we used a set of selected landscape metrics and discussed their use as indicators for sustainable urban development. These indicators relate to the dispersion pattern of urban growth, the connectivity of open green space and the complexity in the composition of the UST types within the different sectors of the city. We were able to identify, using the dynamics exhibited by the USTs, three main zones: (1) city centre, where USTs of high-intensity development predominate, (2) eastern high-income areas whose spatial structure is marked by a relatively high urbanisation intensity with a very large proportion of vegetated spaces, and (3) peripheral areas, with significant changes in composition and configuration of USTs, in recent decades, showing high rates of urbanisation, shifting from low-medium to high densities. We concluded that these patterns and their dynamics are mainly determined by the spatial socio-economic stratification of the population.

TI  - Mammals in São Paulo State: diversity, distribution, ecology, and conservation
PY  - 2022
AB  - Mammals are charismatic organisms that play a fundamental role in ecological functions and ecosystem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and pest control. The state of São Paulo represents only 3% of the Brazilian territory but holds 33% of its mammalian diversity. Most of its territory is dominated by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas which directly affect the diversity and persistence of mammals in the landscape. In addition, São Paulo has the largest port in Latin America and the largest offshore oil reservoir in Brazil, with a 600 km stretch of coastline with several marine mammal species. These human-made infrastructures affect the diversity, distribution, ecology, and the future of mammals in the state. Here, we answer five main questions: 1) What is the diversity of wild mammals in São Paulo state? 2) Where are they? 3) What is their positive and negative impact on human well-being? 4) How do mammals thrive in human-modified landscapes? 5) What is the future of mammals in the state? The state of São Paulo holds 255 species of native mammals, with four endemic species, two of them globally endangered. At least six species (two marsupials, Giant otter, Pampas deer, Brazilian dwarf brocket deer, and Giant armadillo) were extirpated from the state due to hunting and habitat loss. The intense human land use in the state forced many mammalian species to change their diet to cope with the intense fragmentation and agriculture. Large-scale monoculture has facilitated the invasion of exotic species such as wild boars (javali) and the European hare. Several “savanna-dwelling” species are expanding their ranges (Maned wolf, Brocket deer) over deforested areas and probably reflect changes towards a drier climate. Because the state has the largest road system, about 40,000 mammals from 33 species are killed per year in collisions causing an economic loss of 12 million dollars/year. The diversity of mammals is concentrated in the largest forest remnants of Serra do Mar and in the interior of the State, mainly in the regions of Ribeirão Preto and Jundiaí. Sampling gaps are concentrated throughout the interior of the state, particularly in the northwest region. Wild mammals play a fundamental role in many ecosystem services, but they can also be a concern in bringing new emergent diseases to humans. Although the taxonomy of mammals seems to be well known, we show that new species are continuously being discovered in the state. Therefore, continuous surveys using traditional and new technologies (eDNA, iDNA, drones), long-term population monitoring, investigation of the interface of human-wildlife conflict, and understanding of the unique ecosystem role played by mammals are future avenues for promoting sustainable green landscapes allied to human well-being in the state. The planting of forest or savanna corridors, particularly along with major river systems, in the plateau, controlling illegal hunting in the coastal areas, managing fire regimes in the Cerrado, and mitigating roadkill must be prioritized to protect this outstanding mammal diversity. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

TI  - Core areas in the structure of the regional ecological framework of Sevastopol City
PY  - 2022
AB  - Aim. To identify land and water areas for inclusion in the regional ecological framework of Sevastopol City and to define the core areas for ensuring the representative character of the nature protection network and the ecological stability of the region. Material and Methods. Based on field surveys, archival and published data, the structure of the ecological framework of Sevastopol was specified as a part of the Crimean ecological network, developed in 2008. A schematic map of the protected areas and ecological framework elements was developed and calculation of their area carried out using the QGIS-3.10.10. The index of environmental significance was calculated according to Guryevskikh and a scale for its gradation was suggested. For ecological centres and corridors, the ratio of key areas of the first and second order was analyzed. Results. The creation of 34 protected areas was proposed and their conservation value was shown. The boundaries of the core areas and 11 structural elements of the ecological framework were specified, its representativeness was characterized and problems of its implementation were discussed. As a result of optimization of the nature protection network of Sevastopol, the share of the protected areas and ecological framework of the total area of the city will be increased to 37.1 and 66%, respectively. A complex of conservational measures has been proposed for the protection of populations and biotopes of rare species included in the Red Data Book of Sevastopol. Conclusions. The creation of new core areas and the optimisation of the nature conservation network will ensure the maintenance of the sustainability of the ecological framework and the ecological stability of the region but will not make significant changes to the previously formed disproportion due to the impossibility of creating large objects with a high category of protection. The implementation of the ecological framework project will help to reduce the risk of losing the biological and landscape diversity of the region. © 2022 The authors.

TI  - Natural resource use in specially protected areas of the Crimean Peninsula
PY  - 2016
AB  - On the backdrop of increase in number and area occupied by specially protected areas (PAs), their involvement in economic activities increases. The trend is typical for a new Russian territory – the Crimean Peninsula. The article presents results of analysis of current structure of natural resource use in PAs of the Crimean Peninsula that is represented by 208 objects. The current PAs system of Crimea along with its structure by categories, number of objects and their areas is demonstrated. The maximum PAs area is accounted for wildlife refuges (zakazniks) and nature reserves – the objects of strict protection (75%). The data also provided on the dynamics of PAs system formation from 2000 to 2014. It was indicated the increase in number of protected areas by 46%, and their area by 57%. Proportion for the areas covered by PAs in each administrative unit of the Crimean Peninsula has been calculated. It was found that the proportion of protected areas is higher in the urban districts. Bakhchisarai district with PAs ratio above 10% stands out from the other peninsula districts. In seven districts protected areas has not been established yet. A wide range of land use types is indicated for wildlife refuges and natural monuments. Types of natural resource use are identified, which are represented in protected areas of the Crimean Peninsula (a case of Baidarskii Reserve), and their spatial structure is demonstrated. The main types of nature resource use in Baidarskii Reserve are recreational, forestry, agricultural and residential. At the same time, special attention has been paid to the geoecological problems that have arisen because of different types of nature resource use. Agriculture caused transformation of vegetation, soils, and pasture digression. Recreational use of natural resources contributed to changing the composition and structure of plant communities, along with transforming density of upper soil layers. Recreational load is localized mainly along touristic trails.

TI  - A long-term, multitrophic level study to assess pulp and paper mill effluent effects on aquatic communities in four US receiving waters: Characteristics of the study streams, sample sites, mills, and mill effluents
PY  - 2009
AB  - Watershed characteristics, study streams, sample sites, mills, and mill effluents are provided for 4 streams included in a long-term study to assess potential effects of pulp and paper mill effluents on US receiving waters. The study streams are Codorus Creek (Pennsylvania, USA), Leaf River (Mississippi, USA) and McKenzie and Willamette rivers (Oregon, USA) and were chosen to represent a blend of mill process types, effluent concentrations, and coldwater/warmwater stream systems. The described effluent quality, water quality, and habitat data sets encompass the initial 7 to 8 y of a study anticipated to continue >10 y and provide a backdrop to a series of articles describing periphyton, macro-invertebrate, and fish community properties in these same streams. The mean in-stream waste concentration (IWC) for these 4 effluent discharges was 32.4%, 2.0%, 0.5%, and 0.2% v/v for Codorus Creek and Leaf, McKenzie, and Willamette rivers, respectively, as compared with a median of 0.4% for US mills. Effluent quality measurements included Selenastrum capricornutum, Ceriodaphnia dubia, and Pimephales promelas chronic bioassays as sanctioned by the US Environmental Protection Agency for estimating effluent effects on receiving-water aquatic communities. Based on mean bioassay inhibition concentration for a 25% effect and on mean IWC, a margin of safety against adverse biological effects of 2, 25, 137, and 150 times was indicated for Codorus Creek and Leaf, McKenzie, and Willamette rivers, respectively. Habitat and water quality assessment was carried out over a gradient of sample sites above and below the effluent discharge to determine nonmill-related conditions that might interfere with interpretation of effluent effects. Noneffluent related localized differences in conditions for some parameters, including current velocity (McKenzie River), and surface incident photosynthetically active radiation (Codorus Creek and Willamette River) occurred at the sample stations immediately upstream or downstream of the effluent discharge. In addition, broader watershed differences were evident on Codorus Creek, where a relatively rich riparian corridor and stream structure occurred upstream in contrast to areas of canopy and stream-structure loss in the downstream urban area. The mill effluent discharges contributed to increases in receiving-water color and conductivity, although upstream tributaries contributed additional conductivity to Codorus Creek and color to the Leaf River. The McKenzie River provided the only example of a nutrient increase immediately downstream of a mill discharge. This increase in total nitrogen (0.11 vs 0.16 mg/L) could not, however, be differentiated with respect to whether it was of mill effluent or tributary stream origin. Tributary streams were potentially important total nitrogen contributors on Codorus Creek and the Willamette River. As an integrated study, the effluent quality and physical/chemical watershed descriptions provided here represent 1 component of the broader study addressing potential point-source effluent effects within the context of the larger watershed and a multiyear timescale. The absence of effluent-related in-stream chemical/physical responses, other than increases in conductivity and color, and a considerable bioassay-based margin of safety, provides for a working hypothesis that there will be no effluent-related biological population/community responses from these 4 mill discharges. This hypothesis, as it relates to periphyton, macro-invertebrate, and fish communities, will be addressed in other articles in this series. © 2009 SETAC.

TI  - Landscape resistance and habitat combine to provide an optimal model of genetic structure and connectivity at the range margin of a small mammal
PY  - 2014
AB  - We evaluated the effect of habitat and landscape characteristics on the population genetic structure of the white-footed mouse. We develop a new approach that uses numerical optimization to define a model that combines site differences and landscape resistance to explain the genetic differentiation between mouse populations inhabiting forest patches in southern Québec. We used ecological distance computed from resistance surfaces with Circuitscape to infer the effect of the landscape matrix on gene flow. We calculated site differences using a site index of habitat characteristics. A model that combined site differences and resistance distances explained a high proportion of the variance in genetic differentiation and outperformed models that used geographical distance alone. Urban and agriculture-related land uses were, respectively, the most and the least resistant landscape features influencing gene flow. Our method detected the effect of rivers and highways as highly resistant linear barriers. The density of grass and shrubs on the ground best explained the variation in the site index of habitat characteristics. Our model indicates that movement of white-footed mouse in this region is constrained along routes of low resistance. Our approach can generate models that may improve predictions of future northward range expansion of this small mammal. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Content of selected trace elements and exchangeable cations in soils of the Barycz River Valley
PY  - 2014
AB  - In many ways, the Barycz Valley is a unique region. For one thing, it contains the highest number of fish ponds in Poland. Secondly, it is free from heavy industry and large cities. Thus, this region may be considered considerably clean, and the observed concentrations of trace elements are typical for non-degraded environments. There is, however, a threat of excessive accumulation of trace elements such as Zn, Pb and Cu in waters of the rivers in the Barycz drainage basin, received from point sources, and especially supplied with wastewater. These rivers play a very important role; namely, they are the source of water for filling up numerous ponds (Marek 1989). On the other hand, any seepage of river waters into the groundwater may cause excessive concentrations of trace elements in soils near the ponds. The objective of the study was to analyse and assess sorption properties of sandy soils used as hay meadows. As the study was conducted in a special bird protection area (SBP) included in the European Ecological Network Nature 2000, special attention was paid to the content of selected trace elements. The following analyses were performed on the collected soil samples: particle size distribution, pH in 1 mol KCl dm-3, TOC, N total, content of exchangeable base cations (Ca+2, Mg+2, K+, Na+) and total content of the metals Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb and Cu. The genesis of the examined soils seems closely linked to the very wet moistened local environment, which significantly influenced the physical and physicochemical soil parameters. These soils were formed in a region crisscrossed by a dense network of watercourses of the Barycz River drainage basin, with strong ominant aquaculture traditions. The sum of base exchange cations (S) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) in the examined soils are strongly affected by the particle size distribution, the fact confirmed by significant positive relationships with the silt fraction and colloidal fraction, and significant negative correlations with the sand fraction. Higher content of Zn, Pb and Cu in surface genetic horizons of the examined soil profiles may point to the anthropogenic origin of the metals. Despite the dominant sandy texture, the soils are characterised by a thick humus horizon, abundant in TOC and TN, which increases their capacity for trace element accumulation. Our assessment of the contamination of these soils with Zn, Pb and Cu did not demonstrate any excess in terms of the permissible levels of the trace elements.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of environment quality of ecotonal zones in iranian central plateau using landscape ecological metrics
PY  - 2015
AB  - Introduction: Environmental changes can be monitored at many scales but the scale of landscape and region has more information in support of sustainable spatial planning. The availability of remote sensing imagery provides multi-scale observation with periodic repetitions over time. Landscape and regional scales are adequately covered by satellite images. Remote sensing images provide non-average and dis-aggregated data suitable for sustainable environmental planning. The spatial arrangement of elements influences horizontal flows and movements across land mosaics. Hence, modification of landscape affects directly the ecological processes, flows and movement. Coarse-scale monitoring focuses on the structural composition and spatial configuration at the scale of landscape or region. Advances of environmental planning and management in the last decades can be described as two dimensions: 1. theoretical shift that has happened in the methodologies of the study of natural and cultural systems. Systems approach and nested hierarchical organization are the core concepts of this novel paradigm. Moving across scales is the most important strategy to cope with complexity, nonlinearity, and copious feedback loops of ecological systems. 2. The technological developments that have enhanced the efficiency of data collection, surveying, analysis and synthesis. Remote sensing and satellite imagery technology have granted synoptic and updated digital data and improved availability and accessibility of materials for spatial and temporal investigations. GIS and spatial information systems have promoted the application of techniques of analysis, simulation and modeling. Spatial indices are quantitative tools for detection of structural pattern of land mosaics. The indices indicate three main aspects of landscape transformation, including loss, degradation and fragmentation. The structural pattern of the landscape can be measured in two main dimensions, i.e. composition and configuration. Composition indices quantify number, type and extent of elements, but the configuration indices measure spatially-explicit attributes, namely arrangement and layout of elements in the mosaic. The temporal dynamics of land mosaics could be monitored by means of a comparative approach and variability of the landscape indices. The variability of the indices over space-time dimensions could serve as a bridge between spatial pattern and ecological functioning. The spatial-temporal monitoring of landscape can act as a decision support system and is a prerequisite for diagnosis of adaptivity and resilience. Coarse scale monitoring of heterogeneous environment by measuring landscape ecological indices can help enhance the efficiency and the effectiveness of land use decisions. Iranian landscapes: The high and arid plateau of Iran is composed of diverse and contrasting environments. Iran's diversity in climatic conditions and its rich biodiversity and ecosystems are rooted in its unique geography. Iran is a typical high mountain country situated within the dry belt of Asia. Half of Iran is composed of high mountains. The Iranian high mountains are a rather continuous chain especially at the Elburz and Zagros which enclose Iran in northwest-northeast and northwest-southeast directions. The temperature in Iran is characterized by relatively large annual range about 22°C to 26°C. The rainy period in most of the country is from November to May followed by dry period between May and October with rare precipitation. The average annual rainfall of the entire country is about 240 mm. Objectives: The mountainous matrix in Iran has created specific conditions, constraints, opportunities and advantages. Sequence of different altitude zones in the upland to lowland (or mountain to desert) continuum can be regarded as an association of landscapes. Most human settlements and large metropolitan areas are placed on the midaltitudes between mountain and desert. Current share of urbanization in Iran is more than 71.4 percent and the annual growth rate of urban population in the last decade was 4.69 %. Urbanization growth has caused the sprawl of urban areas upwardly into the ecotonal foothills (the zone between high- and midlands) and has transformed the structure and function of this strategic zone. These Foothill zones connect mountains in the upland to the plains in the midlands. This ecotonal band serves as an interrelation joint between high and mid altitudes. The main goal of this study is to investigate the ways of connection, relations and changes in this ecotonal strip. However, Specific objectives of this study are: 1. applying landscape ecological concepts in evaluation of the ecotonal environment; 2. retrieval of land covers using Landsat images of 2000 and 2013; 3. calculation of spatial indices of landscape and analysis of spatial distribution of patches mosaic; and 4. monitoring and tracking the landscape changes over time by means of spatial indices. Materials and Methods: Study area: Study area of this research is the ecotonal zone between up-land mountainous areas and mid-land plain in the southern slopes of the central Elburz region. Tehran-Karaj region placed on the southern slopes. Data: Two satellite images of Landsat 8 OL1 (2013) and two images of Landsat 7 ETM+ (2000) are used to capture land cover classes. Considering natural conditions and urbanization impacts, the ecotone strip is longitudinally divided into four zones: (1) north Tehran to Kan River; (2) Kan River to Karaj River; (3) Karaj River to Kordan River; and (4) Kordan River to Abyek. Analysis is performed zone-specifically using ArcMap (Version 9.3, ESR1) Zonal Statistics in Spatial Analyst Extension. Land cover classification: We classified land covers into four main groups: vegetation covers, anthropogenic impervious surfaces, open spaces, and water bodies. The supervised method with maximum likelihood is applied to classify the satellite images. Calculation of landscape indices: We used the eight landscape indices to quantify the spatial pattern of the ecotone zone in the southern slope of Elburz. This study considers each land cover as a patch. Landscape indices are as follows: NP (number of patches), CAP (class area proportion), MPS (mean patch size), AW-MPS (area-weighted mean patch size), TE (total edge), PARA (perimeter to area ratio) and MNND (mean nearest neighbor distance). Results and Discussion: Our results indicate the measurement of indices for the years 2000 and 2013 in total landscape and sub-landscape as well as class levels. At the 13-years period from 2000 to 2013, land covers in the ecotonal belt have been changed as follows: vegetation changed from 12.8 to 8.53 percent; open class from 51.43 to 38.55 percent; and built class from 28.73 to 52.59 percent. Class area proportion of vegetation (CAP-Veg) in the entire area declined by 2000 to 2013. The same trend has also occurred in all other zones. Maximum and minimum changes of vegetation class have taken place, respectively, in zone 1 (North of Tehran) with 22.61 % and zone 4 (Suburb of Karaj-Qazvin) with 14.07%. Total NP-Bni increased from 636 to 1155 during the period of 13 years. Interesting point was the reduction of NP-Bui in the zone 1 (from 202 in 2000 to 140 in 2013), contrary to the general trend of increase in other zones. This is due to the expansion of the built patches and then joining them together. This change is called a transformation of the contextual matrix. The highest value of NP-Bui was in zone 4 (212 for 2000 and 737 for 2013). The mean patch size (MPS) is calculated as the division of the total area to the number of patches. Throughout the area, MPS descended from 36.97 in 2000 to 19.62 hectares in 2013, which are a result of the elevated numbers and the declined areas of patches. These are also signs of fragmentation process. The arithmetic mean patch size (MPS) carries the same weight for all patches, but the area-weighted mean patch size (AW-MPS) exerts the weight of each patch through the ratio of the patch area to the total area. When the variance of sizes is high, arithmetic mean cannot be a good description of the actual condition, but areaweighted mean can offer the better understanding of the landscape state. AW-MPS in the entire area was 8998.87 ha in 2000 and increased to 16685.13 ha in 2013. The extremes of AW-MPS in 2000, in order, were zone 4 (with a value of 13328.09 ha) and zone 2 (2915.71 ha), which changed to zone 1 (with a value of 11104 ha) and zone 2 (with 3476.89 ha) in 2013. Conclusion: Generally, the landscape indices of NP, CAP-Btii, AW-MPS, TE, PARA and MNND had increasing trend during this period, but MPS, MNND, CAP-Veg and CAP-Opn declined from 2000 to 2013. MNND-Veg and MNND-Opn rose over time. This indicates the highest degree of fragmentation, but MNND-Bui is decreased showing that connectivity is increased. In the whole area NP-Veg, NP-Opn and NP-Bid had increased value between 2000 and 2013, which is a sign of fragmenting. The results of this research show that 32.93 percent of the ecotonal zone has changed during 13 years (2000 to 2013). Vegetation covers and open spaces were the main source of land cover conversions and built area was the ultimate sink of conversions. The explosive trend of urbanization in the ecotonal zone signifies that regional inter-relations have been altered within upland-lowlands continuum. Local scale changes could only be perceived if the wider geographical context and its choric relations are taken into account. Broad scale monitoring with satellite images can be linked to a local scale monitoring to form a monitoring network of environment on many scales. Monitoring of landscape condition and its changes over time is a necessary tool for land use decision and spatial planning. Determining the state and trends of landscape elements are necessary for a better understanding of the ecological resources.

TI  - Atlantic flower-invertebrate interactions: A data set of occurrence and frequency of floral visits.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Encounters between flowers and invertebrates are key events for the functioning of tropical forests. Assessing the structure of networks composed of the interactions between those partners leads to a better understanding of ecosystem functioning and the effects of environmental factors on ecological processes. Gathering such data is, however, costly and time-consuming, especially in the highly diverse tropics. We aimed to provide a comprehensive repository of available flower-invertebrate interaction information for the Atlantic Forest, a South American tropical forest domain. Data were obtained from published works and \"gray literature,\" such as theses and dissertations, as well as self-reports by co-authors. The data set has ~18,000 interaction records forming 482 networks, each containing between one and 1061 interaction links. Each network was sampled for about 200 h or less, with few exceptions. A total of 641 plant genera within 136 different families and 39 orders were reported, with the most abundant and rich families being Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Rubiaceae. Invertebrates interacting with these plants were all arthropods from 10 orders, 129 families, and 581 genera, comprising 2419 morphotypes (including 988 named species). Hymenoptera was the most abundant and diverse order, with at least six times more records than the second-ranked order (Lepidoptera). The complete data set shows Hymenoptera interacting with all plant orders and also shows Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera to be important nodes. Among plants, Asterales and Fabales had the highest number of interactions. The best sampled environment was forest (~8000 records), followed by pastures and crops. Savanna, grasslands, and urban environments (among others) were also reported, indicating a wide range of approaches dedicated to collecting flower-invertebrate interaction data in the Atlantic Forest domain. Nevertheless, most reported data were from forest understory or lower strata, indicating a knowledge gap about flower-invertebrate interactions at the canopy. Also, access to remote regions remains a limitation, generating sampling bias across the geographical range of the Atlantic Forest. Future studies in these continuous and hard-to-access forested areas will yield important new information regarding the interactions between flowers and invertebrates in the Atlantic Forest. There are no copyright restrictions on the data set. Please cite this data paper if the data are used in publications and teaching events.

TI  - An approach for analyzing resources metabolism of industrial ecosystems
PY  - 2012
AB  - Industrial ecosystems are complex social-economic-environmental systems that are comprised of industrial communities(a group of industrial enterprises),resources and environment.Resources metabolism is an important support for industrial ecosystem function.Resource depletion and metabolism blocking on both temporal and spatial scale is the major causes of eco-environmental stress.Based on the ecological principles and MFA methodology,this paper analyzed the structure of industrial ecosystems′ material flow,energy flow and money flow,and suggested the framework model of resources metabolism for industrial ecosystems.This model consists of six sub-modules including a resources exploitation module,a raw material production module,a product exchange center module,a consumption module,a waste collection and control module.To complement this model,an analysis indicator system based on input-use-output-circular symbiosis for resources metabolism was also proposed.The indicator system includes four categories of indicators: resource input,resource use,environmental stress and circular-symbiosis.Resource input indicators include raw material input,water resource input and energy input;resource use indicators include raw material use,water resource use,energy use and product use;environmental stress indicators include waste discharge and specific material discharge;circular symbiosis indicators include cleaner production,waste control and sustainable use of resources and symbiosis potential.Based on the indicator system,an assessment method by using Fuzzy Analysis and Problems Tree tool for resources metabolism analysis was explored.In addition,an ecological management model was established based on a circular-symbiosis network consisting four modules: a main community module including associated factories;an upstream community module including the factories associated with the main community;a downstream community module including the factories and consumers associated with the main community;a reuse community module including collection,category,process and control factories.The four modules are connected by material flow so that the entire system forms a singular network.By implementing metabolism analysis,the major issues occurring at individual modules or connections can be identified.In turn,the network structure may be optimized through industrial symbiosis management. The following conclusions were drawn:(1) Circular function is weak in traditional industrial ecosystem in comparison to natural ecosystems.Environmental stress comes from resource overuse and excessive waste emissions.(2) Based on the material flow process,the indicator system can effectively reflect the characteristics of resources metabolism.Thus this system can be used as a guide for improving the efficiency of resources use and reducing environmental stress.(3) The method analyzing metabolism effectiveness based on the indicator system and Problems Tree tool is efficient and practical.It can allow decision makers to immediately understand the major problems within different processes and thus make suitable decisions to solve them.(4) The ecological management model based on the ecological networks provides a feasible method to identify and address issues associated with resources metabolism.Applying this model can allow identified stresses on the eco-environment to be released.(5) The approach for resources metabolism analysis proposed in this paper focuses more on processes in comparison to the MFA methods that are implemented at the national and urban scale.This approach may complement MFA methodlogy. This method has been applied in the resource flow analysis of the pulp and paper industry in Wuhan,China.Ongoing work will focus on the research of corresponding policies and databases.

TI  - Susceptibility to rock landslides in the La Teresona-Zopilocalco Norte suburb of Toluca: Assumptions for community development
PY  - 2019
AB  - In the last half-century, the world scientific community, government authorities, and civil society have paid particular attention to environmental management, land-use planning, use of alternative energies, and many other guidelines, seeking to safeguard and improve environmental quality, preserve biodiversity, and ensure sustainable development. This vision of development requires consistent policies, where all urban development, land-use management, productive, and social actions, among many, focus on meeting the needs of the current population and future generations, in a way that is harmonized with the natural conditions and resources, especially at the local level. In this regards, it is understandable that the analysis of the dangers of natural genesis, including mass removal processes, is a prerequisite to achieving sound land-use and urban-planning policies for the establishment and development of safer communities, where the free fall of rocky debris through steep slopes do not threaten the physical and social vulnerability of these communities. At the international level, authors like Tanarro and Muñoz (2012) have elaborated geo-referenced inventories of rock falls in the Duero river basin for comparison with other geological-geomorphological parameters, and like Antoniou and Lekkas (2010), who used engineering and geological information, structural analysis, and geomorphology to elaborate maps on the likelihood of reach of boulders and determine the susceptibility of at-risk human activities. The growth of settlements in urban outskirts in Mexico has led to the occupation of land of complex geomorpholo-gical and geological conditions, specifically in mountainous systems in volcanic buildings. This is the case of the central-north suburbs of the city of Toluca (La Teresona-Zopilocalco Norte), where 21687 inhabitants currently live. This urban sector occupies a stretch of 4.0 km along Paseo Matlazincas, a roadway used as reference to delimit the area of study, from the highest mountain tops located to the north of the roadway; to the south, the limit was drafted at 2690 m a.s.l., which marks a significant difference on terrain slope. Along this corridor, cracks in the asphalt layer of some roadways, cracking of household walls, and fallen rocky blocks of approximately 2.5 m in diameter that at times have impacted Paseo de los Matlazincas, the main communication roadway. Given this situation, it is essential to the elaborate maps on the degrees of susceptibility to rock landslides to make decisions for the implementation of prevention or mitigation measures within a context of local planning addressing the most threatened priority sites. The research process for the analysis of susceptibility to rock landslides is carried out in three phases: 1. Data collection and analysis of information directly related to rock landslides; 2. Elaboration of the thematic cartography on the determinants of this geomorphic process and its integrated analysis; and 3. Validation of field results. The analysis of susceptibility to rock landslides includes criteria related to lithology, morphostructure, occupation, and land use, which were inventoried. The inventory form used allowed the tabulation of physical elements that are key for the interpretation of gravitational processes, with an emphasis on rock landslides, namely: (1) location, including the geographic coordinates; (2) description of the geological material; (3) structural analysis of slopes, including measurements of dip direction and angle of lava flows or strata, as well as structural measurements of planes of failures; (4) type of event (detachment, sliding, overturning, or flow); (5) current state of the event (active or inactive); and (6) damage caused. The integration of these variables revealed five levels of rock landslide susceptibility: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. The results obtained show the unfavorable characteristics of the area for the development of urban infrastructure. The susceptibility analyses conducted clearly show that this urban area is unfavorable for the development of large infrastructures, such as hospitals, schools, shopping malls, and even for household development and roadways. Currently, poor urban planning and disregard of the geo-morphological conditions in the site have led to a scenario of building vulnerability, with 4270 households under conditions of medium, high, and very high susceptibility to landslides, which are home to 15796 persons. This degree of exposure causes a systematic impact on local development, as observed in this study, with damages to both buildings and roadways. © 2019 Instituto de Geografia. All rights reserved.

TI  - Responses of soil microbial communities and their network interactions to saline-alkaline stress in Cd-contaminated soils
PY  - 2019
AB  - Land degradation by salinization and sodification changes soil function, destroys soil health, and promotes bioaccumulation of heavy metals in plants, but little is known about their fundamental mechanisms in shaping microbial communities and regulating microbial interactions. In this study, we explored the impact of saline-alkaline (SA) stress on soil bacterial and fungal community structures in different Cd-contaminated soils of Dezhou, Baoding, Xinxiang, Beijing and Shenyang cities from the North China Plain, China. Increased soil salinity and alkalinity enhanced Cd availability, indicated by significant increases in available Cd2+ in soil solution of 34.1%–49.7%, soil extractable Cd of 32.0–51.6% and wheat root Cd concentration of 24.5%–40.2%, as well as decreased activities of antioxidative enzymes of wheat root when compared with CK (no extra neutral or alkaline salts added). Soil bacteria were more active in response to the SA stress than fungi, as the significant structural reorganization of soil bacterial microbiota rather than fungal microbiota between SA and CK treatments was illustrated by principal component analysis. Adding neutral and alkaline salts enriched oligotrophic and haloalkaliphilic taxa in the Sphingobacteriaceae, Cellvibrionaceae, and Caulobacteraceae bacterial families, but decreased some Acidobacteria such as subgroup 6_norank, which was a sensitive biomarker that responded only to Cd contamination in CK-treated soils. Conversely, fungi were more sensitive to soil differences than bacteria: the composition of the fungal community was significantly different among different soil types. Phylogenetic molecular ecological network (pMEN) analysis further indicated that the microbial community structure and network interactions were altered to strengthen the adaptability of microorganisms to SA stress; the changes in structure and network interactions were proposed to contribute to competitive interactions. Most of the keystone genera identified in SA-treated soils, such as Blastococcus, Gemmatimonas, RB41, or Candida, had relatively low abundances (&lt;1%), indicating their disproportionate ecological roles in triggering resistance or tolerance to SA stress and Cd toxicity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Green roofs for sustainable water management in urban areas
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: New housing developments and city infrastructures have led to a predominance of impervious areas in the urban environment and rainwater can no longer percolate naturally in the soil, leading to changes in the ground-water balance. Green roofs, green streets, and vegetated walls are increasingly addressed and studied as elements that help cities to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change, achieve environmental benefits, enrich architecture and life quality. At the same time the principle of green corridors, till nowadays an element of the suburban territory, is reaching the urban environment because of its benefits in improving the microclimate and the urban quality of life. Although many urban green technologies require availability of land space which is usually not available in densely built downtown urban areas (Berndtsson, 2010; Gambi et al., 2011), in every city, however, there is an abundance of roof area. Moreover turning the roofs green through covering them with soil and vegetation is widely believed to contribute to achieving numerous hydrological benefits: studies show that, compared to traditional hard roofs, green roofs decrease runoff peak discharge, delay peak runoff and reduce runoff volume. Furthermore, green roofs and vegetated walls are beneficial for buildings, reducing noise levels, energy consumption and providing a better indoor comfort for their inhabitants (Berghage et al., 2010; Carter and Rasmussen, 2006; VanWoert et. al., 2005). Green roofs are therefore being more and more installed by constructors and designers, but often it is just an aesthetical matter, and their scientific performance is still not known in detail. In fact their performance is site specific, and taking other project as references is fine, but especially in different climatic areas it could lead to mistakes. This is why it is very important the monitoring of pilot projects for an effective design and correct building codes for green roofs in a specific climatic area. Objectives: This paper presents the description of a pilot green roof on the engineering laboratories of University of Bologna, Italy. The first results of the monitoring and simulation phase of the green roofs project that has been carried out by University of Bologna in collaboration with the Columbia University of New York aim at providing more evidence on green roof stormwater performance. This project is the first green roof in the city of Bologna as no green roofs have been monitored for annual stormwater retention in this area. Only one green roof in City of Genova, belonging to north Italian climate (the specific climatic context of the Mediterranean region: areas with this climate receive almost all of their precipitation during their winter season, and may go anywhere from 4 to 6 months during the summer without having any significant precipitation.) has been monitored and gave a 70 percent result in retention of the annual runoff (Palla et al., 2009). The main objective was to compare this result to the Bologna pilot green roof and see how it differs from the other climatic area results. Outline of the work: This work is divided in two main parts: - the first part describes a literature review on green roofs and the characteristics of the green roof built in Bologna; - the second part presents the experimental data collected on the pilot green roof project. Methods: We have many different design choices in realizing a green roof on flat or tilted roofs, garages, basement parkings. Green roofs are made of different overlapping layers: essentially a waterproofing layer is right above the structural roof part. Then a root protection sheet, a drainage panel and a fabric filter go next, and at the end the growing medium and the plants. The growing medium thickness determines the type of roof, and if it's moderate, we can talk about an extensive green roof. There is still ambiguity in literature about the exact thickness borderline between extensive and intensive green roofs, but usually we can say that extensive ones are 8-15 cm high, above that range we have an intensive green roof. Extensive roof means low build-up height (80-150 mm), low load (from 80 kg/m2) and low-growing plant, thus we usually have low care and maintenance. On the other hand an intensive roof means higher build-up (250-500 mm), heavier load (300-600 kg/m2), larger plant selection but also more care and maintenance. The advantage is that it can be utilizable and walkable, so it can constitute a green garden within the city. In both cases the growing medium can host a variety of plants. For the Engineering School of Bologna University the choice was driven by the structural constraints on site: the existing roofs had a load capacity that was able to host only an extensive roof, without the costly need of being reinforced. In the extensive roof type the vegetation is usually very drought resistant and plants can adapt to difficult environmental conditions. Therefore sedum was chosen for the pilot green roof in Bologna and the sedum shoots were scattered on the growing medium during the construction that was held in June 2013. As the construction ended in summer good watering was important after the planting, and the substrate was always kept moist during the first few weeks thanks to the sprinkler irrigation system installed. The full scale installation of the sedum extensive green roof in the city of Bologna, Italy provided an experimental green roof area of about 50 m2. Moreover as the starting roof had a square shape, it was divided in two equal areas by a steel median divider: in one half the experimental green roof of 50 m2 (substrate depth 10 cm) was installed while on the other half the conventional roofing assembly with bituminous membrane was left as reference twin roof. The entire surface went under maintenance of the bituminous membrane on both parts (total of 100 m2) (Fig. 1). Both roof sections (green and black) were instrumented to monitor runoff profiles within the roofing systems using a hydraulic device made in the DICAM-CIRI laboratory. On the perimeters of the roof there is a gravel strip: 30 cm wide - grain size 18/30 mm. (Figure Presented) Fig 1. Extensive green roof with sedum plants and twin reference roof; Layers for green roof (* Elements constituting the SEIC green roof system): 1.Extensive vegetation - Sedum; 2.SEIC extensive substrate - growing medium; 3.Optional anchoring system for tilted roofs; 4.MediFilter MF1 - filtering mat; 5.MediDrain MD 25 - drainage element; 6.MediPro MP300 - root protection fabric; 7.Waterproofing root barrier membrane; 8-9-10.Structural elements. The hydraulic device for the water flow monitoring consists of a transparent low-density polyethylene (LDPE) rectangular channel equipped with a 90o V-notch weir and an ultrasonic level measurer placed above the instrument. The dimension of the V - notch orifice has been designed to be able to calculate the flow rates with a conversion formula from the water level. The equation (Eq. 1) adopted for the conversion from the water level measured and the flow is the following one:Q = 1 42 h2 5 (1) where: Q is the flow in m3/s, h the water depth in m.This is measured on both twin roofs: this set-up allows direct comparison of the performance and benefits of the green roof and the impervious reference roof.(figure presented.) Results and discussion: Green roof stormwater performance is affected by regional climatic conditions, storm size, rain intensity, frequency, and duration, antecedent moisture in the soil, transmissivity of drainage layer, vegetation species and diversity, length of flow path, roof size, growing medium composition and depth, and roof age. In this paper the following factors affecting runoff dynamics from green roofs were considered: type of green roof and its geometrical properties; soil depth and moisture characteristics; season, weather and rainfall characteristics; vegetation. All these aspects were controlled and monitored thorough the design and construction process and then through specific environmental sensors which were installed on the prototyped extensive green roof located in Bologna, Italy, on the roof of the DICAM Department laboratory. Given the fact that an irrigation system was installed, it was possible to run rain simulations at specific external conditions. Therefore a compared study of the delay in time between the simulated rain event and the real rain event registered in a period of a month was studied. For example the time delay for the green roof for the last week of July, after the 2 daily irrigation sessions, at 5:00 am and at 9:00 pm, was recorded with the instrumentation put in place. The duration of one irrigation is 20 minutes and the total flow is about 360 liters. The results showed a different behaviour of the roof for the irrigation at 5:00 am (substrate still wet) and the 9:00 pm one (soil dried during the hot day). For the irrigation at 5 am the flow to the pluvial vertical pipe started after about 18 minutes from the start of the irrigation, while for the irrigation that started at 9:00 pm there is flow to the vertical pluvial pipe after about 34 minutes. During rainfall events it is possible to study the behaviour of the impervious roof compared to the green roof. For example the rainfall event recorded on August 20th, 2013 (Fig. 3) is characterized by 2 rainfall peaks, the first with a maximum intensity of about 54 mm/hour, and, after one hour, the second peak of a maximum intensity of about 18 mm/hour and the total rainfall is about 9.7 mm.

TI  - Evaluation of development scenarios of ecological connectivity in Ahvaz city to improve the ecosystem services and biodiversity stage
PY  - 2016
AB  - Introduction: Ecosystem services are the benefits that human derives from the ecosystems. These are services such as goods and products (e.g., fresh water, fuel), regulation of natural processes (e.g., climate, flooding, erosion), and nonmaterial benefits (e.g., recreation, aesthetic enjoyment). Many cities are located in the important ecological areas. Currently 29 out of the 825 ecological zones of ecological areas are under urban development in the world so that more than one-third of the areas have been human constructed. It is predicted that by 2030, 15 other ecological areas of 118 vertebrate species specific and rare, at least the about 5% of the total area, will be built. On the other hand, the reflections have led to the phenomenon of urbanization in the world in terms of environmental considerations. The two look quite the opposite in such a way that they are as a challenge for the ecosystem or an opportunity. On the one hand, this phenomenon eliminates natural ecosystems or at least makes it apart. It promotes non-native species, changes and reduces ecosystem and eventually disrupts normal diet. The urbanization can create some social and economic opportunities, connection of people and nature, unique environmental areas and increase ecosystem services based on the principles of sustainable planning and design. In the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), three roles have been defined for cities: 1-Maintaining ecosystem goods and services in towns and cities 2-protecting biological diversity in cities and towns and promoting sustainable planning and design at various scales to maximize self-reliance of these areas 3-Promoting effective policy to create a livable, not only for humans, but plants and animals in man-made environments. Accordingly, it can be said that urban biodiversity points to all communities, plants, animals and microorganisms that live in and around the city. Howard achieved this goal outside of the cities and new cities. While today's computing ecosystem services and biodiversity studies are in different scales of global, national, regional, urban-rural, and even at the district levels, block design and spatial resolution has had an important role in maintaining and improving the ecological balance. To achieve a sustainable level, we consider the performance of public services, urban management. To develop patterns that emerged from the concept of sustainable development, the New Urbanism, pedestrian areas and TOD are examples of it. The concept of ecological cities and villages were discussed as a tool to achieve sustainable development in three areas: (A) As a tool to open the original settlement structure, increased density around the center, restoration of the natural environment and agricultural landscapes in the spaces. (B) City network: a new model for open collaborative development in the surrounding areas that leads to the formation of the city's network and metropolitan area network. The spatial pattern, the area between the green and blue urban centers will be assigned to the matrix. (C) In conjunction with landscape architecture and planning development ecosystem. The tools, designed by James Corner and Charles Vadhaym landscape architecture in urban scale in the United States and in Europe Krysynz expanded major role. Studies of ecosystem services and biodiversity in cities are considered in the past two decades. The importance of this issue in urban planning has been observed in the world major cities, including Frankfurt. The studies have been conducted in the three-phase investigation, representation, and control of the land to be annexed to the application process. A recent evaluation of policies, particularly in the area of urban green spaces, green corridors, green belts and important results in maintaining and even improving the ecosystem of valuable resources and the conservation of biodiversity are represented in urban and land use planning reform measures. As one of the most important urban green space to urban habitats, it provides humans with unique perspective to a variety of flora and fauna, as well as direct access to nature. Keeping in touch with nature citizens is a basic need and a criterion for quality of life. Ecosystem services and biodiversity are high quality urban green areas, environmental benefits, economic, and psychological offers. Studying the process of planning and development and the spread of the best practices based on the minimization of ecosystem services and urban development can be realized as two seemingly contradictory trends and competitor. Thus, an optimal choice is to provide policy development, conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity in general elections. This research answers to three important questions. First, what type of services does ecosystems, general in cities and specifically in urban management, have and what types of the strategies have been used to maintain and improve these services? Second, what are the main criteria and methods of analysis of planning and design of urban development in terms of ecosystem services and biodiversity considerations? Third, what kinds of processes in the ecological integrity of space are seen in the city of Ahvaz and what is the priority of strategic choice to increase the connectivity of the areas? Materials and methods: There are two basic types of metrics at the patch level: (1) indices of the spatial character and context of individual patches, and (2) measures of the deviation from class and landscape norms; that is, how much the computed value of each metric for a patch deviates from the class and landscape means. The deviation statistics are useful in identifying patches with extreme values on each metric. There are two basic types of metrics at the class level: (1) indices of the amount and spatial configuration of the class, and (2) distribution statistics that provide first- and second-order statistical summaries of the patch metrics for the focal class. Like class metrics, there are two basic types of metrics at the landscape level. Landscapes are composed of elements-the spatial components that make up the landscape. A convenient and popular model to conceptualize and represent the elements in a categorical map pattern (or patch mosaic) is known as the patch-corridor-matrix model. Under this model, three major landscape elements are typically recognized, and the extent and configuration of these elements defines the pattern of the landscape. While individual patches possess relatively few fundamental spatial characteristics (e.g., size, perimeter, and shape), collections of patches may have a variety of aggregate properties, depending on whether the aggregation is over a single class (patch type) or multiple classes, and whether the aggregation is within a specified subregion of a landscape (e.g., the neighborhood of each focal cell) or across the entire landscape. Consequently, landscape metrics can be defined at four levels corresponding to a logical hierarchical organization of spatial heterogeneity in patch mosaics. It is important to note that while many metrics have counterparts at several levels; their interpretations may be somewhat different. Cell metrics represent the spatial context of local neighborhoods centered on each cell. Patch metrics represent the spatial character and context of individual patches. Class metrics represent the amount and spatial distribution of a single patch type and are interpreted as fragmentation indices. Landscape metrics represent the spatial pattern of the entire landscape mosaic and generally interpreted more broadly as landscape heterogeneity indices because they measure the overall landscape structure. Hence, it is important to interpret each metric in a manner appropriate to its level (cell, patch, class, or landscape). Aggregation refers to the tendency of patch types to be spatially aggregated; that is, to occur in large, aggregated or \"contagious\" distributions. This property is also often referred to as landscape texture. We use the term \"aggregation\" as an umbrella term to describe several closely related concepts: 1) dispersion, 2) interspersion, 3) subdivision, and 4) isolation. In these exercises, future scenarios are constructed by making different assumptions on the underlying driving forces, and hence on the magnitude of land use change processes. For instance, Khajeh Borj Sefidi and colleagues built different land use scenarios by varying the rates of agricultural, river, vacant and urban expansion. Less attention has been devoted so far to the effects on ecosystem services of different spatial arrangements of land uses. The effects of spatial patterns on ecological processes represent one of the central themes of landscape ecology. Scientists have tried to understand these effects for a broad range of ecosystem services, such as habitat provision, pollination and water purification. According to a recent article, the capacity of a land system to deliver ecosystem services is determined by the kind, magnitude and spatial patterns of land uses. Research on land use change and ecosystem services has widely addressed the first two attributes but has disregarded so far the third one, spatial patterns. To the best of our knowledge, none of the studies presented in the literature considered scenarios that differ only in the distribution of land use types, rather than in their relative proportions. The paper presents case-study research aimed at empirically exploring how the implementation of different land use zoning policies can affect the future supply of ecosystem services. The term 'land use zoning policy' is used here to indicate regulations concerning permitted, prohibited or preferred land uses.

TI  - Synthetic analysis of urban landscape pattern and environmental impact based on Remote Sensing - A case study of Xuzhou City
PY  - 2009
AB  - Taking Xuzhou City as a case, the studies of landscape classification, pattern analysis and eco-environmental impacts evaluation are made using Landsat TM/ETM+ images in this paper. For this purpose, firstly urban landscape information is extracted from Landsat TM/ETM+ images using C5.0 decision tree classification method based on spectral features, texture features and shape information. The results prove that the classification accuracy can meet the requirements of landscape patterns analyzing and evaluating. Then according to classified images, urban landscape pattern is analyzed based transfer matrix and landscape pattern metrics at the scale of landscape and class. Finally, based on the analysis, urban landscape pattern impacts on environment are evaluated qualitatively from three angles: heterogeneity, fragmentation, and edge effect. The results, which indicate that the level of fragmentation, diversity and connectivity of Xuzhou landscape in 2005 is higher than in 1987, but the level of congregation in 2005 is lower than in 1987, can reflect the urban expansion and the change of landscape patterns effectively. ©2009 IEEE.

TI  - Ecological corridor
PY  - 2019
AB  - Habitat fragmentation leads to decrease in biodiversity and to damage of ecological functions. Construction of ecological corridors can connect separated landscapes elements, which plays an important role in protecting and restoring of biodiversity and in maintaining and delivering of ecological functions. The concept, origin and development of ecological corridor are introduced and the ecological functions of the ecological corridor are analyzed with respect to biodiversity protection, environmental protection of ecological resources, development of ecological security and suitable responses to global climate change. Furthermore, methods of construction of ecological corridors are examined based on the minimum cost distance model and the circuit theory, and the influences of the biotic habitat and the length and quality of the corridor on the effectiveness of the ecological corridor are discussed. Research on ecological corridors had a late start in China, and has been limited to the topics of urban afforestation, landscape aesthetics and small-scale ecological protection. By analyzing the basis for, the approaches to and the existing cases of the construction of large-scale international ecological corridors in an international setting, references for the construction of ecological corridors in China are provided. It is concluded that in China the construction of ecological corridors should be focused on their ecological functions at the landscape and regional scale and could be based on the existing ecological planning. © 2019, China Environmental Science Press.

TI  - Integrating age structured and landscape resistance models to disentangle invasion dynamics of a pond-breeding anuran
PY  - 2017
AB  - Modelling population dynamics of invasive species may help to propose effective management countermeasures. Invasion dynamics generally show recursive patterns across species and regions, where initial lag is followed by spread and eventual dominance phases. However, timing and modes of these phases are highly variable, emerging from the interplay between traits of the invader and characteristics of the invaded landscape. Disentangling this interplay is particularly arduous in species with complex life-histories, where an individual passes through different life stages that alter physiology, behaviour and interactions with the environment. Here, we describe an age structured model that can be utilized to simulate population dynamics of invasive pond-breeding anurans. The model follows a spatially structured population approach, each pond representing a discrete habitat patch that exchanges individuals with other similar patches, and simulates change in survival and dispersal behaviour as a function of age. It also integrates dispersal with landscape complexity through landscape resistance modelling to depict functional connectivity across the pond network. Then we apply the model to a case study, the invasion of the guttural toad Sclerophrys gutturalis in Cape Town, first detected in 2000. Age-structured demographic and spatial dynamics of the focal population are reconstructed in a network of 415 ponds embedded in a heterogeneous landscape. Parameterization is conducted through field and laboratory surveys, a literature review and data collected during an ongoing extirpation from 2010. We use the model to explore: i) occurrence and duration of lag phase; ii) whether the spatial spread fits an accelerating or a linear trend; iii) how simulated dynamics match field observations. Additionally we test model sensitivity to demographic and behavioural traits. We found a lag phase in both demographic and spatial dynamics; however the lag duration of these dynamics does not coincide, where invaders start to spread across the pond network five years before the demographic explosion. Also, we found that the spatial spread fits an accelerating trend that causes complete invasion of the network in six years. Such dynamics noticeably match field observations and confirmed patterns previously detected in other invaders characterized by high dispersal abilities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that it would have been preferable to quantify initial propagule size and post-metamorphic survival in the field; both timing and modes of invasion are particularly sensitive to these parameters. We conclude that the model has potential to forecast amphibian invasion dynamics and test management countermeasures. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Biodiversity in cities needs space: A meta-analysis of factors determining intra-urban biodiversity variation
PY  - 2015
AB  - Understanding varying levels of biodiversity within cities is pivotal to protect it in the face of global urbanisation. In the early stages of urban ecology studies on intra-urban biodiversity focused on the urban-rural gradient, representing a broad generalisation of features of the urban landscape. Increasingly, studies classify the urban landscape in more detail, quantifying separately the effects of individual urban features on biodiversity levels. However, while separate factors influencing biodiversity variation among cities worldwide have recently been analysed, a global analysis on the factors influencing biodiversity levels within cities is still lacking. We here present the first meta-analysis on intra-urban biodiversity variation across a large variety of taxonomic groups of 75 cities worldwide. Our results show that patch area and corridors have the strongest positive effects on biodiversity, complemented by vegetation structure. Local, biotic and management habitat variables were significantly more important than landscape, abiotic or design variables. Large sites greater than 50 ha are necessary to prevent a rapid loss of area-sensitive species. This indicates that, despite positive impacts of biodiversity-friendly management, increasing the area of habitat patches and creating a network of corridors is the most important strategy to maintain high levels of urban biodiversity. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.

TI  - Classes of protection in urban forest fragments are effectiveless in structuring butterfly assemblages: landscape and forest structure are far better predictors
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization is a major cause of biodiversity loss and disconnection between people and nature. For this reason, the creation and maintenance of green areas as part of the urban landscape is a common practice in cities around the world. These green areas are generally a result of particular public policies regarding how these areas can be accessed, maintained, and how they are connected to other natural fragments in the city. In an effort to investigate aspects of the ecology of such green areas of the city of Curitiba, southern Brazil, the present study measured distinct parameters of the structure of butterfly assemblages from 19 forest fragments of distinct classes of protection, testing the influence of different policies (protection category) on butterfly assemblages. Comparatively, we also tested the predictive power of landscape variables (at distinct scales) and fragment quality (e.g. diameter at breast height, density of vegetation) using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Overall, 14,596 individuals belonging to 412 butterfly species were recorded, but values of species diversity and composition are very heterogeneous, indicating that the protection categories do not significantly interfere with the structure of the butterfly assemblages. More important than the protection category is the forest fragment quality and landscape connectivity. Our models showed that degraded fragments tend to present a specific butterfly composition, whereas the more urbanized landscape have poor butterfly species richness. These results reinforce the importance of implementing public policies that prioritize the conservation of the quality of forest fragments in every class of protection, as well as the conservation of forest fragments throughout the urban landscape. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Effects of urbanization on Song Sparrow (Melospiza melodia) population connectivity
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urbanization may affect genetic differentiation among animal populations because it converts native vegetation to novel land cover types that can affect population connectivity. The effect of land cover change on genetic differentiation may vary among taxa; mobile birds may be least affected. Regardless, genetic differentiation between populations should be best predicted by measures of distance that incorporate the effect of land cover on movement. We studied the relationship between land cover and genetic differentiation in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) at eighteen sites in the Seattle metropolitan region. We generated a series of hypothetical \"resistance surfaces\" based on land cover and development age, calculated \"resistance distances\" between pairs of sampling sites, and related them to pairwise genetic differentiation. Genetic differentiation was best described by a multiple regression model where resistance to gene flow (1) linearly increased with age of development and (2) was greater in high- and medium-density urbanization than in native forest land cover types (R2 = 0. 15; p = 0. 003). The single variable with the highest correlation with genetic differentiation was derived from a linear relationship between development age and resistance (R2 = 0. 08; p = 0. 007). Our results thus suggested that urban development reduced population connectivity for Song Sparrows. However, the relation of development age to genetic differentiation suggested that equilibrium was not yet reached. Hence, the effects of lost connectivity will increase. Our understanding of the landscape genetics of this recently anthropogenically modified landscape benefited from considering population history. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Movement responses of common noctule bats to the illuminated urban landscape
PY  - 2020
AB  - Context: Cities are a challenging habitat for obligate nocturnal mammals because of the ubiquitous use of artificial light at night (ALAN). How nocturnal animals move in an urban landscape, particularly in response to ALAN is largely unknown. Objectives: We studied the movement responses, foraging and commuting, of common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) to urban landscape features in general and ALAN in particular. Methods: We equipped 20 bats with miniaturized GPS loggers in the Berlin metropolitan area and related spatial positions of bats to anthropogenic and natural landscape features and levels of ALAN. Results: Common noctules foraged close to ALAN only next to bodies of water or well vegetated areas, probably to exploit swarms of insects lured by street lights. In contrast, they avoided illuminated roads, irrespective of vegetation cover nearby. Predictive maps identified most of the metropolitan area as non-favoured by this species because of high levels of impervious surfaces and ALAN. Dark corridors were used by common noctules for commuting and thus likely improved the permeability of the city landscape. Conclusions: We conclude that the spatial use of common noctules, previously considered to be more tolerant to light than other bats, is largely constrained by ALAN. Our study is the first individual-based GPS tracking study to show sensitive responses of nocturnal wildlife to light pollution. Approaches to protect urban biodiversity need to include ALAN to safeguard the larger network of dark habitats for bats and other nocturnal species in cities. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Identification and prioritizing the sustainable urban landscape design factors: Case study of district 22 in tehran
PY  - 2016
AB  - This research conducted to Identify and prioritize the sustainable urban landscape design factors indistrict 22 in Tehran. FuzzyAHP method has been used foridentifying and prioritizing the sustainable urban landscape design factors. Based on the literature review seven qualitativecriteria were identified. These factors including: sustainability, aesthetic, safety, connectivity and accessibility, legibility, desirability, dependency, adaptability, biodiversity. Inthe research process, firstly the criteria are compared together and given suitable weight to them based on experts opinions. The results showed that comparison between six sites based on criterions, Site 2 has priority and site 3 and site 1are next in priority respectively. The biggest difference among these was \"Biodiversity\" with a difference of approximately 0.20. Site 2 was superior to site1 on 6 factors as well, with the biggest difference being \"Biodiversity\" with a difference of 0.123. Site 3 was superior to site 1 in 5 factors, with the biggest difference being \"Safety\" where the difference was 0.112. In this analysis, different perspective and experts' choice are used. Due to the diversity of opinions, the analysis of prioritize of the factors should will be done in various aspects. Also this analysis, potentially, shows the unspecified relations of use of integrated and formulated strategies in different time intervals. In fact, it operates as a determining route for the location decisions using the urban landscape designers. Also it increased ability to identify factors, priorities, and ultimately it leads to a suitability choice among various alternative. © International Science Press.

TI  - IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF TERRITORIAL AND LANDSCAPE PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO PROMOTE URBAN LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN BRAZIL
PY  - 2021
AB  - Connectivity plays an essential role in the urban landscape, facilitating the movement of organisms, genetic exchange, and other ecological flows that are fundamental to the survival of species and the provision of ecosystem services on which humans depend. To promote and restore connectivity and efficiently protect biodiversity, it is necessary, among other things, to develop and apply tools, which, when it comes to territorial and landscape planning and management, can be of various natures and have various classifications in terms of their potential to influence the activities of the agents that shape the territory and the landscape. Based on these premises, this article aims to identify and analyze, through bibliographic and documentary research, some of these instruments, especially those that can contribute to maintaining and restoring the connectivity of the urban landscape and the conservation of Brazilian biodiversity. It is hoped that this study can help public managers, urban planners, landscape architects and other related professionals to develop and implement instruments for this purpose in the practice of territorial and landscape planning and management. © 2021 Universitat Rovira i Virgili.

TI  - Stepping stones: Assessing the permeability of urban greenspaces to climate-driven migration of trees
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose: Large-scale urbanisation has become a significant barrier to the natural migration of tree species, which is being exacerbated by accelerated climate change. Within this context, improving the permeability of urban landscapes is expected to be an effective strategy to facilitate the process of forest migration through cities. The purpose of this paper is to develop a method to assess the permeability of urban green spaces as stepping stones for forest migration, from the perspective of seed dispersal. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed method combines a least-cost path (LCP) model and a graph theory-based approach. The LCP model is applied to map the potential pathways of seed dispersal at multiple spatial and temporal scales, based on which graph theory-based indices are used to quantify the accessibility of urban landscapes for seed dispersers. This method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK. Eurasian jay, Eurasian siskin, coal tit and grey squirrel are selected as the main seed dispersers in the study area. Findings: The results provide a comparison of the landscape permeability maps generated from different seed dispersers and identify key areas likely to facilitate the process of forest migration. Recommendations regarding landscape management for improving permeability are also discussed. Originality/value: This method allows designers to re-visualise highly modified and fragmented urban landscapes as stepping stones for seed dispersal, which in turn allows for a more piecemeal form of landscape design to optimise urban landscapes for climate adaptation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - A habitat island approach to conserving birds in urban landscapes: Case studies from southern and northern Europe
PY  - 2001
AB  - Wildlife conservation in urban habitats is increasingly important due to current urbanization trends. We review the different approaches to studying birds in urban landscapes, and point out the importance of the habitat island ecological theory as a research framework for the management and conservation of urban birds. Based on two comprehensive research projects conducted at urban parks in Spain (Madrid) and Finland (Oulu and Rovaniemi), several different issues related to bird conservation in cities are discussed, main findings of these projects are presented, and future research needs are suggested. Urban parks are important biodiversity hotspots in cities. Fragmentation conditions have the same deleterious effects to urban birds as in other fragmented landscapes. Park size accounts for species accumulation in urban parks; this pattern being highly nested. Urban parks of 10-35 ha would contain most of the species recorded in cities, but other indicators related to the probabilities of persistence of the target species should be obtained. Wooded streets can increase urban landscape connectivity by providing alternative habitat for feeding and nesting during the breeding season. Because increasing the size of parks is difficult in cities, enhancement of habitat diversity and resource availability for birds within parks (e.g. nest boxes, winter feeding tables, etc.) appears to be a straightforward way of increasing urban bird diversity. However, human disturbance (pedestrians) should be controlled since it can negatively influence many urban birds. We present a conceptual model for urban bird conservation, which includes three aspects (management, environmental education and research) and new alternatives to promote the involvement of different sectors of the society.

TI  - Urban landscape genetics: Canopy cover predicts gene flow between white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations in New York City
PY  - 2012
AB  - In this study, I examine the influence of urban canopy cover on gene flow between 15 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations in New York City parklands. Parks in the urban core are often highly fragmented, leading to rapid genetic differentiation of relatively nonvagile species. However, a diverse array of 'green' spaces may provide dispersal corridors through 'grey' urban infrastructure. I identify urban landscape features that promote genetic connectivity in an urban environment and compare the success of two different landscape connectivity approaches at explaining gene flow. Gene flow was associated with 'effective distances' between populations that were calculated based on per cent tree canopy cover using two different approaches: (i) isolation by effective distance (IED) that calculates the single best pathway to minimize passage through high-resistance (i.e. low canopy cover) areas, and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR), an implementation of circuit theory that identifies all low-resistance paths through the landscape. IBR, but not IED, models were significantly associated with three measures of gene flow (Nm from F ST, BayesAss+ and Migrate-n) after factoring out the influence of isolation by distance using partial Mantel tests. Predicted corridors for gene flow between city parks were largely narrow, linear parklands or vegetated spaces that are not managed for wildlife, such as cemeteries and roadway medians. These results have implications for understanding the impacts of urbanization trends on native wildlife, as well as for urban reforestation efforts that aim to improve urban ecosystem processes. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Enlisting an underappreciated clientele: Public participation in distribution and evaluation of natural enemies in urban landscapes
PY  - 1997
AB  - Since the turn of the century, there has been a significant shift in the population of the United States from a rural to a predominately urban and suburban society. The process of urbanization created new landscapes to replace the natural areas or farms that previously occupied the land. To a great extent, these landscapes are artificial communities comprised of diverse assemblages of native and exotic species that may be comparable in diversity to tropical rain forests (Owen 1983). With respect to woody ornamental plants alone, Frankie and Ehler (1978) reported 322 species (132 species of trees, 147 species of shrubs, and 53 species of vines and ground covers) were planted in Austin, TX, and 123 species of trees were planted in Berkeley, CA. In total, 318 plant species, including 143 native and 175 non-native, exotic species, were planted in a single study garden in Leicester in the United Kingdom (Owen 1983). These urban landscapes, which include both annual and perennial species planted at densities or separations not normally found in natural habitats, also are characterized by high levels of patchiness and structural diversity (Owen 1983, Flanders 1986). In addition, the physical barriers associated with buildings, transportation corridors, parks, and industrial complexes add significant levels of artificial spatial complexity to the environment (Frankie and Ehler 1978). © 2018 Entomological Society of America.

TI  - Factors affecting the permeability of transportation and riparian corridors to the movements of songbirds in an urban landscape
PY  - 2009
AB  - Linear features associated with transportation and riparian corridors are known to inhibit the mobility of birds and other wildlife, yet the factors contributing to their barrier effects are poorly understood. The diversity of roads in urban landscapes provides an opportunity for elucidating the relative importance of factors such as noise, traffic volume, gap width and adjacent vegetation on animal movement. 2. Using an avian mobbing call as a lure, we tested the willingness of forest songbirds to cross four types of linear features in the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada: (1) roads of varying widths and traffic volumes, (2) conventional railways and light transit lines, (3) transportation bridges across riparian corridors, and (4) rivers. 3. Using mixed effects logistic regression, we found that the size of the gap in vegetation was the most important determinant of movement (P < 0·001). As the gap in vegetation exceeded 30 m, the likelihood of movement decreased dramatically and by 45 m, birds were only half as likely to move across gaps as they were to move an equivalent distance in continuous tree cover. Traffic volume also had a significant dampening effect on movement (odds ratio = 0·952 per 1000 vehicle per day increase; P < 0·001) and generally explained more variation in the data than noise levels. 4. Railroads proved to be the most permeable of the features we tested, probably owing to their relatively narrow width, which never exceeded 30 m. Surprisingly, rivers were less permeable than the anthropogenic linear features we tested, with a significant barrier effect evident even at widths <50 m. 5. The birds in our study showed a marked preference for flying over, rather than under, transportation bridges, particularly when adjacent vegetation was available. 6.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that linear features, both anthropogenic and natural, can significantly impede the movements of forest songbirds and that managing adjacent vegetation is a potentially effective way to mitigate these barrier effects in cities and other fragmented landscapes. © 2009 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Urbanization reduces genetic connectivity in bobcats (Lynx rufus) at both intra- and interpopulation spatial scales.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization is a major factor driving habitat fragmentation and connectivity loss in wildlife. However, the impacts of urbanization on connectivity can vary among species and even populations due to differences in local landscape characteristics, and our ability to detect these relationships may depend on the spatial scale at which they are measured. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are relatively sensitive to urbanization and the status of bobcat populations is an important indicator of connectivity in urban coastal southern California. We genotyped 271 bobcats at 13,520 SNP loci to conduct a replicated landscape resistance analysis in five genetically distinct populations. We tested urban and natural factors potentially influencing individual connectivity in each population separately, as well as study-wide. Overall, landscape genomic effects were most frequently detected at the study-wide spatial scale, with urban land cover (measured as impervious surface) having negative effects and topographic roughness having positive effects on gene flow. The negative effect of urban land cover on connectivity was also evident when populations were analyzed separately despite varying substantially in spatial area and the proportion of urban development, confirming a pervasive impact of urbanization largely independent of spatial scale. The effect of urban development was strongest in one population where stream habitat had been lost to development, suggesting that riparian corridors may help mitigate reduced connectivity in urbanizing areas. Our results demonstrate the importance of replicating landscape genetic analyses across populations and considering how landscape genetic effects may vary with spatial scale and local landscape structure.

TI  - SMOOTH-COATED OTTER Lutrogale perspicillata (GEOFFROY, 1826) IN THE URBAN LANDSCAPE OF VISAKHAPATNAM, ANDHRA PRADESH, INDIA
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Smooth-coated otter, for the first time, is photographed in the Kondakarla Ava (Ava means lake) located within the urban landscape of Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh, India. In the Ava, otter-human relations, especially with the local fishing community, are strained with conflicts. Otters feed on commercially farmed and valuable wild fish in the Ava, such as snakehead fish, carp, catfish, and damage fish traps. The perceived financial loss of fish and the damage to equipment anger the fishermen, and they retaliate by opportunistically killing otters and the pups. Despite human retaliation, otters continue to survive in the human-dominated wetland ecosystem of Vizag. Their resilience and survival ability posts a solid case to support the conservation prospects of the species within this rapidly developing and proposed metropolitan region of Visakhapatnam. Future investigations to support effective otter conservation planning in the Visakhapatnam district should include 1) Inter-connectivity of the various local streams and water bodies and if otter movement across the larger landscape is supported. 2) Investigate the human-dimension aspect, such as local practices of local communities using the streams and water bodies and their impact on wetlands and local fauna, and understanding wildlife conflicts.

TI  - Ecological corridors system for birds and large mammals integrated to the urban landscape of the São Paulo greenbelt biosphere reserve
PY  - 2012
AB  - Ecosystem destruction, isolating and reducing the available habitats, in addition to hunting, road kill and wildlife trafficking, is among the major threats to birds and mammals in the RBCV, Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. Threatened animals and their ecological importance are listed and discussed in this study, as well as the need to include information about the wildlife in landscape projects and environmental restoration plans, as shown here in an ecological corridor plan proposal. Larger mammals and birds of probable occurrence in this area were characterized through secondary data analyses. Using these data, we could assess the implications of the remains of the landscape ecological structure and their role in wildlife survival. This information was gathered through surveys conducted in seven preserved areas. The scenario was defined taking into account the landscape units of higher ecological value and their overall ecological structure, considering their potential for conservation and recovery. As a result, we set the number of birds and mammals species recorded in the studied track, and the possible response of some animal groups to the key corridors elements. Considering the corridor system, we chosed the Morro Grande-Taboão Corridor, where the wildlife would likely be most benefited from local specific projects. The bird species found in the western part of the RBVC, as well as the environment they are living in, are in a good state of preservation. Thus, the ecological corridors need to have an ecological structure similar to those of the sampled areas in order animals species with higher sensitivity can move to other areas. With respect to mammals, a significant number of large mammals are dependent on forest habitats, proving to be extremely susceptible to loss of connectivity and fragmentation. Regarding barriers, specially roads, they have to be planned allowing the crossing of fauna.

TI  - Matrix configuration and patch isolation influences override the species-area relationship for urban butterfly communities
PY  - 2012
AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the role of urban public parks in maintaining connectivity and butterfly assemblages. Using a regression framework, we first test the relative importance of park size and isolation in predicting abundance and species richness of butterfly assemblages across a set of 24 public parks within a large metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France). Then, we focus on landscape features that affect diversity patterns of the recorded butterfly communities. In this second part, the urban landscape surrounding each park is described (within a 1 × 1 km window) according to two major components: vegetated areas (habitat patches) and impervious or built areas (matrix patches). Specifically, we aim to test whether the incorporation of this built component (matrix) in the landscape analysis provides new insights into the understanding of ecological connectivity in the urban environment. We found a significant effect of both matrix configuration (shape complexity of the built patches) and distance from regional species pool (park isolation) on diversity of butterflies that overrides park size in their contribution to variation in species richness. This result suggests that many previous studies of interactions between biodiversity and urban landscape have overlooked the influence of the built elements. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Long-term declines of a highly interactive urban species
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urbanization generates shifts in wildlife communities, with some species increasing their distribution and abundance, while others decline. We used a dataset spanning 15 years to assess trends in distribution and habitat dynamics of the black-tailed prairie dog, a highly interactive species, in urban habitat remnants in Denver, CO, USA. Both available habitat and number of prairie dog colonies declined steeply over the course of the study. However, we did observe new colonization events that correlated with habitat connectivity. Destruction of habitat may be slowing, but the rate of decline of prairie dogs apparently remained unaffected. By using our estimated rates of loss of colonies throughout the study, we projected a 40% probability that prairie dogs will be extirpated from this area by 2067, though that probability could range as high as 50% or as low as 20% depending on the rate of urban development (i.e. habitat loss). Prairie dogs may fulfill important ecological roles in urban landscapes, and could persist in the Denver area with appropriate management and habitat protections. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Avian characteristics of an urban riparian strip corridor
PY  - 1999
AB  - Riparian strip corridors bordered by agricultural fields and forest clearcuts have a distinct, induced-edge habitat with greater density and diversity of birds and denser vegetation than large, contiguous forests. No studies have determined if similar relationships exist for stream corridors in urban landscapes where habitat interfaces are different. The ability of urban corridors to maintain the ecological integrity of riparian systems is relatively unexplored. This paper compares avian density, diversity, and richness of an urban stream corridor with that found along a stream system in a large rural habitat block in Alachua County, Florida.

TI  - Urban forests form isolated archipelagos
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urbanization decreases native species diversity by converting natural landscapes to anthropogenic cityscapes, and it indirectly degrades native species diversity in remaining natural patches by fragmenting and isolating them. Remnant forest patches embedded in an urban matrix may act as 'islands' separated from large populations of trees in rural 'mainland' forests. As such, native species richness should increase with forest patch size within the urban landscape and increased connectivity to other urban forest patches and rural forests. Our objective was to link urban land cover with forest patch richness and recruitment. We used U.S. National Park Service (NPS) data from parks in the Eastern USA to examine forest patchiness and connectivity in relatively large, intact landscapes.We applied a similar approach to field data collected along an urban-rural gradient in Western New York (WNY). We predicted that urban forest patches are isolated habitats with tree seedling and canopy richness driven by patch size and connectivity with surrounding forest patches. The WNY forest patches were surrounded by much less forest cover compared to NPS forests, and native tree species richness and abundance were negatively impacted by urban land cover. In all parks, we found increased tree seedling richness with park area, and decreasing species richness with the incursion of non-native species. Urban land-limited forest patch connectivity, particularly with rural forests, and the patches were increasingly limited to bird-A nd wind-dispersed trees with distance from rural areas. Our data support a conceptual model of urban forest patches behaving as island archipelagos in an anthropogenic ocean of less suitable habitat. ©The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - Least-cost path analysis for urban greenways planning: A test with moths and birds across two habitats and two cities
PY  - 2021
AB  - 1.One of the major planning tools to respond to urban landscape fragmentation is the development of ecological corridors, that is, interconnected networks of urban green and blue spaces. Least‐cost paths (LCP) appear to be an easy and appropriate resistance‐based modelling method to respond to urban planners’ needs. However, the ecological validation of urban corridors using LCP is rarely performed and needs to be generalized to different species, habitats and cities.2.We developed an experimental design to test the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts that facilitate individual movements compared to movements in less connecting landscape contexts. We deliberately assigned LCP analysis parameters based on the scientific literature and expert knowledge to test a method potentially easy to use for urban stakeholders. To extend the validation, we applied our LCP model to two biological taxa with different habitat requirements: grassland‐dwelling moths and forest‐dwelling passerines, and to two medium‐sized cities.3.We used mark–release–recapture (MRR) methods for moths and playback recall protocols for passerines to compare the patterns of individual movement between two contrasted connectivity contexts determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. MRR protocol estimated movement rates between herbaceous patches and the two contrasted connectivity contexts. Playback recall protocol consisted in attracting individuals from wooded patches to the two contrasted connectivity contexts. A movement was considered facilitated, when displacement was rapidly engaged and individuals moved a long distance from their wooded patch.4.Moth and passerine movement patterns differed between the two connectivity contexts: moth recapture rates were higher in highly connecting contexts than in less connecting contexts. For passerine birds, responses to playback recalls were faster and movement distance longer in highly connecting contexts. All results support the hypothesis that both taxa were more prone to move in corridors modelled by LCP.5.Synthesis and applications. The convergence of the results for different biological models and across cities strengthens the relevance of LCP analysis for planning urban greenways and provides guidelines for landscape planners in the development of these corridors to favour the movement and survival of multiple urban species.

TI  - Green infrastructures and ecological corridors shape avian biodiversity in a small French city
PY  - 2021
AB  - In the context of increasing urbanization, preserving urban biodiversity has become a priority because biodiversity appears to be a key element when evaluating the well-being of urban residents. Recently, urban management has relied on a ‘renaturing’ strategy to improve biodiversity, but the benefits of these policies remain debated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of urban land use and green corridors on (1) urban avian biodiversity, and (2) the presence of the most common (top 70%) and least common (bottom 30%) bird species. We surveyed bird diversity at 102 sites during the Spring in a small French city, and performed a PCA on several habitat structures (e.g. roads, houses, grassy areas) to determine the level of urbanization of each site. Then, we tested with GLMMs the effects of land use (PC1), distance to the edge of the city, and distance to the corridor on bird diversity. We found a positive effect of green infrastructures on bird species richness, and this effect was reinforced by the proximity to the green corridor. Thus, bird species richness and the presence of common species were positively impacted by the presence of green areas, the proximity to the city edge and the proximity to the green corridor. The presence of the green corridor contributed significantly to the presence of rare species, which emphasizes its role in promoting avian biodiversity. Green corridors are a key element of the urban landscape because they allow less common species to colonize cities, and thus enhance urban biodiversity.

TI  - Anuran species in urban landscapes: Relationships with biophysical, built environment and socio-economic factors
PY  - 2011
AB  - Urbanisation is a significant threatening process for amphibians, causing loss of habitat, altered hydrology and increased mortality. Impacts operate at different spatial scales and consequences vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. Most studies of the impact of urbanisation on anurans have occurred in large metropolitan cities. There is a paucity of research in smaller urban settlements where the impacts of development may be less pronounced. We examined the richness and occurrence of anuran species in wetlands in regional towns in south-eastern Australia as a factor of natural and built features occurring at multiple spatial scales, and the socio-economic characteristics of surrounding neighbourhoods. Anuran species richness declined with increasing isolation of wetlands and reduced cover of terrestrial vegetation. The occurrence of two wide-spread anuran species was negatively related to level of urban intensity and positively related to neighbourhood vegetation cover, whereas the converse was true for a third common species. Vegetation cover was greater in neighbourhoods with 'higher' socioeconomic status (e.g. more disposable income). These less developed neighbourhoods occurred on the fringes of towns, often in elevated locations, and tended to support more anuran species. The level of urban intensity increased closer to town centres and more developed neighbourhoods with lower socio-economic status were often built in low-lying areas where wetlands tend to form naturally. Yet, these neighbourhoods harboured few anuran species. Our study suggests that careful planning of low-lying neighbourhoods near town centres and periurban neighbourhoods on town fringes is required to ensure anuran conservation in urban settlements. © 2011.

TI  - Green corridors in urban landscapes, case study nicosia pedieos river
PY  - 2020
AB  - Due to increasing population and expansion of cities, urban planning issues are becoming more important worldwide. It is realized that biological methodologies ought to be coordinated into urban arranging activities. Particularly in European cities, creating greenways and green corridors is a very recent phenomenon. The advancement of green space along urban waterways could moderate urban warmth island impacts, improve the physical and mental prosperity of city occupants, improve flood resilience and could also sustain biodiversity. The Pedieos River is the longest river in Cyprus. Like most of streams on the island, it is a non-enduring waterway, of fleeting nature that for the most part streams during the blustery winter months or after overwhelming precipitation occasions. A literature review was undertaken to discover the importance of rivers within the urbanized areas. It is known that the Pedieos River is firmly connected to the historical backdrop of Nicosia as it is one reason for the city's presence at the site. The increase of impermeable areas as a result of urbanization is also one of the main causes for flooding in recent years. In this research, the current situation of the river was investigated and its possible rehabilitation discussed for more sustainable city. The aim of this study is to recommend a feasible proposition by examining green territory zones and reason green passages along the Pedieos River so as to improve the living condition of Nicosia city. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Cougar space use and movements in the wildland-urban landscape of western Washington
PY  - 2011
AB  - The wildland-urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes, creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Because wildlife ecology, behavior, and evolution at this interface are shaped by both natural and human phenomena, this requires greater understanding of how diverse factors affect ecosystem and population processes. We illustrate the challenge of understanding and managing a frequent and often undesired inhabitant of the wildland-urban landscape, the cougar (Puma concolor). In wildland and residential areas of western Washington State, USA, we captured and radiotracked 27 cougars to model space use and understand the role of landscape features in interactions (sightings, encounters, and depredations) between cougars and humans. Resource utilization functions (RUFs) identified cougar use of areas with features that were probably attractive to prey, influential on prey vulnerability, and associated with limited or no residential development. Early-successional forest (+), conifer forest (+), distance to road (-), residential density (-), and elevation (-) were significant positive and negative predictors of use for the population, whereas use of other landscape features was highly variable. Space use and movement rates in wildland and residential areas were similar because cougars used wildland-like forest patches, reserves, and corridors in residential portions of their home range. The population RUF was a good predictor of confirmed cougar interactions, with 72% of confirmed reports occurring in the 50% of the landscape predicted to be medium-high and high cougar use areas. We believe that there is a threshold residential density at which the level of development modifies the habitat but maintains enough wildland characteristics to encourage moderate levels of cougar use and maximize the probability of interaction. Wildlife managers trying to reduce interactions between cougars and people should incorporate information on spatial ecology and landscape characteristics to identify areas with the highest overlap of human and cougar use to focus management, education, and landscape planning. Resource utilization functions provide a proactive tool to guide these activities for improved coexistence with wildlife using both wildland and residential portions of the landscape. ©2011 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Construction methods of urban ecological corridor for birds: A review
PY  - 2021
AB  - The ecological corridors considering bird movement characteristics and habitat requirements would mitigate species extinction caused by habitat loss or habitat fragmentation and facilitate species gene dispersal and exchange. These functions may in turn benefit urban residents' physical and mental health as well as appreciation of real estates. Nonetheless, main ecological corridor construction methods developed by foreign scholars have not internally considered the movement and habitat characteristics of birds, while corridor research for birds by domestic scholars have focused on explorations of foreign technical methods yet lacked enough knowledge on studied birds' characteristics. Therefore, there is still much room for improvement in the study of urban ecological corridor construction from the perspective of birds. Based on the analyses of domestic and foreign related research from 1975 to 2020, we identified seven corridor construction methods and three corridor optimization methods within which bird ecology can be integrated. The advantages, drawbacks, and applicable scenarios of all the methods were explored accordingly. Finally, we argued that the development of computational models, which could not only combine bird species' observation data and spatial movement data with landscape structures but could also possess efficient computation power as well as simulate corridor's ecological benefits, would be a trend for constructing ecological corridor for birds. © 2021, Science Press.

TI  - Land use planning and wildlife maintenance: Guidelines for conservingwildlife in an urban landscape
PY  - 2008
AB  - The study of plants and animals on islands, both natural and artificial, has produced a body of generalizations immediately useful to land use planners concerned with minimizing the impacts of habitat destruction on the environment. A case study of 37 isolated chaparral fragments in San Diego, California, demonstrates the consequences of habitat fragmentation, including rapid and predictable extinctions of native birds in isolated canyons. This study and others can be used to generate planning guidelines for the prevention of such disappearances. Among the most important measures that can be taken are consolidation of open space set-asides and the provision of corridors linking habitat patches. Corridors can mitigate some of the negative effects of development on wildlife, especially where they facilitate the movement of large predators. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Urban evolution comes into its own: Emerging themes and future directions of a burgeoning field
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization has recently emerged as an exciting new direction for evolutionary research founded on our growing understanding of rapid evolution paired with the expansion of novel urban habitats. Urbanization can influence adaptive and nonadaptive evolution in urban-dwelling species, but generalized patterns and the predictability of urban evolutionary responses within populations remain unclear. This editorial introduces the special feature \"Evolution in Urban Environments\" and addresses four major emerging themes, which include: (a) adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity via physiological responses to urban climate, (b) adaptive evolution via phenotype-environment relationships in urban habitats, (c) population connectivity and genetic drift in urban landscapes, and (d) human-wildlife interactions in urban spaces. Here, we present the 16 articles (12 empirical, 3 review, 1 capstone) within this issue and how they represent each of these four emerging themes in urban evolutionary biology. Finally, we discuss how these articles address previous questions and have now raised new ones, highlighting important new directions for the field.

TI  - Dispersal in the urban matrix: Assessing the influence of landscape permeability on the settlement patterns of breeding songbirds
PY  - 2017
AB  - The ability of organisms to disperse across urban landscapes is theorized to be constrained by habitat fragmentation. While previous research has shown the distribution of forest patches is a determinant of dispersal patterns among forest-obligate bird species, the impacts of habitat distribution on the dispersal of \"urban-adapted\" species, has yet to be examined. Here, we use capture-reencounter data of birds banded over a 9-year period at six banding stations in greater Washington, DC to assess dispersal in four species of songbirds and a translocation experiment to examine the influence of land cover on movement. Point count and land cover data were used to construct habitat suitability and landscape permeability surfaces, with the latter representing potential travels costs from the capture location to the surrounding landscape. To assess how dispersal processes are affected by urban land cover, we searched for previously banded birds at sampling locations within 1.5 km of each banding station and compared the distribution of sampling locations with and without observations of previously-banded birds. We found evidence that settlement of two of four focal species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), was more likely in sites with high relative permeability. To experimentally explore the consequences of the urban matrix habitat on movement, we attached radio transmitters to male Cardinals, translocated individuals 1.5 km across high-intensity urban, suburban, and forested landscapes, and recorded the time to return to their territory. Return time was dependent on land cover with Cardinals translocated across suburban habitats returning significantly faster than those moved across the other two land use classes. Combined, our findings suggest that, even among some \"urban-adapted\" species, dispersal within urban environments may be influenced by landscape structure and composition. © 2017 Evans, Kilpatrick, Hurlbert and Marra.

TI  - Pathways through the Landscape in a Changing Climate: The Role of Landscape Structure in Facilitating Species Range Expansion through an Urbanised Region
PY  - 2016
AB  - AbstractUnder climate change many species may need to shift polewards to track suitable bioclimatic conditions. This movement is likely to be impeded by intensively modified landscapes, but little is known in practice about how species undergo range expansion in these conditions. Using biological record data, this paper explores the occurrence of five butterfly species undertaking range expansion in the UK through an urbanised landscape to better understand the ‘pathways’ or landscape features used to expand their distributions. The findings demonstrate that the two most adaptable species were able to navigate well through the urban matrix. Significantly, the remaining three species used more rural pathways, with two using stepping stones of habitat patches and landscape corridors and the final, most specialised species using near-connected chains of woodland habitat. These findings emphasise the importance of retaining corridors of open land around hostile matrices and in this instance, a planning design...

TI  - Movements and habitat choice of resident and translocated adult female grass snakes (Natrix natrix) during the egg-laying period herpetol
PY  - 2019
AB  - We used externally applied transmitters to study movements of female grass snakes (Natrix natrix) during the egg-laying period in a near-urban landscape in Sweden. Half of the studied snakes were residents while the other half were translocated individuals with no previous experience of the area. As predicted, resident females moved more goal-oriented and shorter distances than did translocated individuals. Habitat use did not differ between resident and translocated snakes; they were typically found in bushes, reeds, and tall vegetation. Habitat preference (use in relation to availability) showed that bushy habitats, tall grassy vegetation and reedbeds were over-used in proportion to availability, whereas forest and open grass lawns were used less than expected based on availability. Our study highlights the importance of preserving and restoring linear habitat components providing shelter and connectivity in conservation of grass snakes. We suggest that externally applied transmitters are a better option than surgically implanted ones in movement studies of grass snakes, and that translocation as a conservation method for snakes has drawbacks. © 2019, British Herpetological Society.

TI  - Short-distance pollen dispersal by bats in an urban setting: monitoring the movement of a vertebrate pollinator through fluorescent dyes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Pollen dispersal in tropical seed plants is established mainly by biotic vectors, both in intact and fragmented environments. In urban landscapes, the segregation of natural remnants by an artificial matrix can reduce pollinator foraging efficiency. It is unknown how nectarivorous bats, regarded as long-distance pollen dispersers, respond to such habitat structure combined with city-related factors. Here, we investigated the pollen dispersal pattern between spatially segregated individuals of the bat-pollinated Bignoniaceae Crescentia cujete within an urban environment. From 2015 to 2017, we assessed their spatiotemporal structure, breeding system and annual fruit set in order to relate these factors to the bat activity in the region. We employed fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues to infer the role of bats in pollen flow. Adding to the low density of individuals, we found a low daily flower emission and low flowering synchrony (S = 0,092), all of which are traits that favor outcrossing. Individuals were distributed in two distant groups (>600 m), with no occurrence of dye flow between them. In contrast, flow within the same individual was intense, which points toward bats’ territorial behavior. C. cujete is self-compatible, but not autogamous; therefore, despite few outcross events, bats could be ensuring the plant’s year-round fruit production mainly through self-pollination. Our findings show restricted bat foraging extent, which affects overall pollen dispersal distance and population connectivity. These results can be extrapolated to natural metapopulations inserted in an urban matrix and serve as a groundwork for studying directly the effect of city-related factors on pollinator behavior.

TI  - Using thresholds to determine priorities for apex predator conservation in an urban landscape
PY  - 2022
AB  - As landscapes are increasingly modified due to anthropogenic processes such as urbanisation or development for agriculture, the need to understand wildlife habitat requirements is imperative. This is particularly pertinent for species that are threatened, or apex predators with specific nest, den, or food requirements. Identifying responses to habitat with thresholds can provide an understanding of what resources species are using or avoiding, and their interactions with the surrounding environment. In this research we investigated space use and habitat requirements of the threatened apex predator, the powerful owl (Ninox strenua) in Greater Melbourne, Australia. We deployed GPS devices to 21 urban powerful owls over five years and found owls had an average home range size of 397 ha, and an average core-range of 84 ha. Home range size and positioning was driven by tree cover and urban land cover, while core ranges were restricted to treed environments with a limited area of impervious surfaces and housing. We used thresholds to identify-three priorities for powerful owl conservation in Melbourne. Priority 1: Ensuring river corridors and public open spaces are adequately protected. Priority 2: Limit property densities near rivers and protected areas. Priority 3: Finding opportunities for revegetation to expand and enhance habitat over time. Our research demonstrates how species-specific thresholds can inform land use planning to ensure wildlife species are maintained within highly modified environments. © 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Habitat and landscape characteristics underlying anuran community structure along an urban rural gradient
PY  - 2008
AB  - Urbanization has been cited as an important factor in worldwide amphibian declines, and although recent work has illustrated the important influence of broad-scale ecological patterns and processes on amphibian populations, little is known about the factors structuring amphibian communities in urban landscapes. We therefore examined amphibian community responses to wetland habitat availability and landscape characteristics along an urban-rural gradient in central Iowa, USA, a region experiencing rapid suburban growth. We conducted call surveys at 61 wetlands to estimate anuran calling activity, and quantified wetland habitat structure and landscape context. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to examine patterns in anuran community structure and identify the most important variables associated with those patterns. Urban density at the landscape scale had a significant negative influence on overall anuran abundance and diversity. While every species exhibited a decrease in abundance with increasing urban density, this pattern was especially pronounced for species requiring post-breeding upland habitats. Anurans most affected by urbanization were those associated with short hydroperiods, early breeding activity, and substantial upland habitat use. We suggest that broad-scale landscape fragmentation is an important factor underlying anuran community structure in this region, possibly due to limitations on the accessibility of otherwise suitable habitat in fragmented urban landscapes. This study underscores the importance of a regional approach to amphibian conservation in urban and urbanizing areas; in fragmented landscapes, a network of interconnected wetland and upland habitats may be more likely to support a successful, diverse anuran community than will isolated sites. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Using GIS-linked Bayesian Belief Networks as a tool for modelling urban biodiversity
PY  - 2019
AB  - The ability to predict spatial variation in biodiversity is a long-standing but elusive objective of landscape ecology. It depends on a detailed understanding of relationships between landscape and patch structure and taxonomic richness, and accurate spatial modelling. Complex heterogeneous environments such as cities pose particular challenges, as well as heightened relevance, given the increasing rate of urbanisation globally. Here we use a GIS-linked Bayesian Belief Network approach to test whether landscape and patch structural characteristics (including vegetation height, green-space patch size and their connectivity) drive measured taxonomic richness of numerous invertebrate, plant, and avian groups. We find that modelled richness is typically higher in larger and better-connected green-spaces with taller vegetation, indicative of more complex vegetation structure and consistent with the principle of ‘bigger, better, and more joined up’. Assessing the relative importance of these variables indicates that vegetation height is the most influential in determining richness for a majority of taxa. There is variation, however, between taxonomic groups in the relationships between richness and landscape structural characteristics, and the sensitivity of these relationships to particular predictors. Consequently, despite some broad commonalities, there will be trade-offs between different taxonomic groups when designing urban landscapes to maximise biodiversity. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using a GIS-coupled Bayesian Belief Network approach to model biodiversity at fine spatial scales in complex landscapes where current data and appropriate modelling approaches are lacking, and our findings have important implications for ecologists, conservationists and planners.

TI  - Implementing low impact development in urban landscapes: A policy perspective
PY  - 2015
AB  - Low Impact Development (LID) is a strategically sound approach to mitigate stormwater pollution and restore landscape hydrology in urbanized watersheds. Since it promotes preserving and enhancing vegetation, open spaces, and soil integrity to mimic natural processes, it provides a myriad of benefits including flood control, habitat protection, climate change mitigation and adaptation, greater livability, greater social connectivity, energy savings, smog reduction, enhanced community aesthetics, and many other ecosystem services. A great number of LID tools are available such as green roofs, raingardens, tree planters, bio swales, which are efficient, simple, and cost effective. Some pioneer cities are successfully implementing this technology in development and redevelopment projects. However, a wide spread adoption has not occurred. This paper explores the barriers prevailing in the U.S. cities, with a focus on legal and policy aspects. The analysis will focus on the city codes, ordinances, regulations, and other legal and policy documents related to stormwater and other land development activities of select cities. Finally a policy framework conducive to LID implementation will be presented. © 2015 ASCE.

TI  - Density of marmosets in highly urbanised areas and the positive effect of arboreous vegetation
PY  - 2022
AB  - City life is harsh and inhospitable for many animal species, particularly for non-volant mammals that face increased mortality risks in urban settings. Yet, studies on non-volant city mammals are limited and mostly restricted to temperate regions. Here, I evaluated the density and adaptability of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a species with a series of advantageous pre-adaptations that could facilitate city life, in highly built up urban environments of a tropical city Joao Pessoa (&gt;800,000 people), in NE Brazil. I surveyed a total of 56 streets from seven randomly chosen districts within the city. I used multiple linear regression to determine the factors that could influence marmoset abundance. I found a total of 53 tree species of which half could be used as food resources. To reach food resources marmosets moved along and crossed streets using insulated power lines and phone cables. Marmoset density (66.9 ind/km2) was significantly low compared to populations inhabiting forest remnants. Nevertheless, along streets with high canopy cover, their density was similar to that reported for forest fragments. Canopy cover and trees providing food resources were key predictors of marmoset abundance. The presence of an exotic tree species (Terminalia catappa) that provides gum, showed to be key for groups persisting in extremely urbanized areas. Planting more of this species and increasing connectivity between forested areas are management strategies that might help long term persistence of marmosets in highly built up areas. Marmosets are common in Brazilian cities and could provide opportunities for contact with nature and increased well-being of human urban dwellers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Review of the ecology of Australian urban fauna: A focus on spatially explicit processes
PY  - 2006
AB  - Cities have a major impact on Australian landscapes, especially in coastal regions, to the detriment of native biodiversity. Areas suitable for urban development often coincide with those areas that support high levels of species diversity and endemism. However, there is a paucity of reliable information available to guide urban conservation planning and management, especially regarding the trade-off between investing in protecting and restoring habitat at the landscape level, and investing in programmes to maintain the condition of remnant vegetation at the local (site) level. We review the literature on Australian urban ecology, focusing on urban terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate fauna. We identify four main factors limiting our knowledge of urban fauna: (i) a lack of studies focusing at multiple ecological levels; (ii) a lack of multispecies studies; (iii) an almost total absence of long-term (temporal) studies; and (iv) a need for stronger integration of research outcomes into urban conservation planning and management. We present a set of key principles for the development of a spatially explicit, long-term approach to urban fauna research. This requires an understanding of the importance of local-level habitat quality and condition relative to the composition, configuration and connectivity of habitats within the larger urban landscape. These principles will ultimately strengthen urban fauna management and conservation planning by enabling us to prioritize and allocate limited financial resources to maximize the conservation return.

TI  - Local quality versus regional connectivity-habitat requirements of wintering woodpeckers in urban green spaces
PY  - 2017
AB  - In urban landscapes, city parks represent strongholds of avian biodiversity. Hence, understanding which variables promote species richness of bird communities has major implications for urban planning in order to sustain high biodiversity in an increasingly urbanised environment. From a management perspective, three options are available: Increase park area, increase habitat quality within parks and increase connectivity between parks. We used two woodpecker species, a generalist species (Great Spotted Woodpecker) and a habitat specialist (Middle Spotted Woodpecker), as indicators to identify key variables promoting biodiversity in the city parks of Vienna. Bird surveys were carried out during winter time between 2005 and 2015 in 29 urban parks. An information theoretic approach based on generalised linear models identified park area as the most relevant local variable, positively affecting the occurrence of both species. The variable was included in all best ranked models of the two woodpecker species (based on Akaike's information criterion corrected for small-sample sizes). Other local scale variables as well as the position of city parks within the urban matrix and their connectivity were of minor importance. Our results also provide some evidence that city parks may act as refuges for birds during cold winters. The park occupancy of the Great Spotted Woodpecker increased significantly with decreasing mean winter temperatures. The management of existing parks and the planning of new parks represent opportunities to improve the ecological conditions for nature development in addition to their principal function to provide recreational, cultural and aesthetic values. ©The Author 2017.

TI  - Focal Nodes Identification Using Habitat Availability Concept for Simulation of Ecological Connectivity Network of Quezon City, Philippines
PY  - 2020
AB  - Anthropocentric orientation of urban development processes leads to deficiency of areas with significant environmental values in the urban landscapes. As landscape planners try to increase the quality of living in the urban environment, efforts are focused only on the hot spots which often cater only to the recreational needs of urban dwellers. In Quezon City, the local government unit plans to create the Green Lung Network featuring a chain of developments linking La Mesa Nature Reserve, the largest green space in Metro Manila, to all the open spaces and parks in the city. However, the chosen areas to be connected are based only on area size of green spaces and opportunities for economic development. To support and enhance the connectivity plan of the city government, this study aims to identify the focal nodes which represent the key habitat patches of interest on the landscape between which flows are modelled in circuit analysis for simulating an ecological connectivity network. Parameters are based on empirical habitat-use data on the preference of biological indicators/focal species. For computational feasibility, instead of treating every occurrence of suitable habitat on the landscape as a focal node, this study applies the Habitat Availability (reachability) concept using the GIS tool Conefor Sensinode. This allows ranking habitat patches (patches prioritization) by their contribution to landscape connectivity, which provides objective criteria for the selection of the most critical habitat areas for conservation planning purposes. Not only the spatial arrangement of the habitat is considered (structural connectivity), but also the dispersal distances and the behavioural response of species to the physical structure of the landscape (functional connectivity) is taken into account in the analysis. The results revealed that focal nodes of Quezon City include not only the ecological cores but also other tiny patches of green spaces. Moreover, a more surprising result is that some highly vegetated nodes did not qualify as priority nodes for conservation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Anthropogenic impact on the distribution of the birds in the tropical thorn forest, Punjab, Pakistan
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract The present research was conducted to assess the anthropogenic impacts on avian diversity around the river Chenab, Pakistan. The avian diversity was recorded on different landscapes along the river Chenab, that is, forest, agricultural, rural, and urban habitats. The data on diversity and distribution of various avian species were collected through linear count along with direct count methods viz. personal observations and sound records and indirect count methods viz. presences of carcasses and meeting with local communities. The habitat preferences of birds varied significantly. A decline in avian diversity was observed from forest habitat to urban landscapes. One year of bird surveys compiled a total of 150 species from all habitats along the river Chenab. Computed statistical data show that Shannon's index provides a quantitative report of diversity which was highest at forest habitat (4.261) followed by rural forest habitat (3.746), agri–rural habitat (3.746), agriculture habitat (3.623), WLH (2.723), urban vegetative habitat (3.215), and very least at urban nonvegetative habitat (2.247). It can be concluded from the present study that many of the avian species have specific habitats and also noted that corridors and connections among different landscapes are important for the conservation of avian diversity.

TI  - Anthropopressure gradients and the population genetic structure of Apodemus agrarius
PY  - 2015
AB  - We have attempted to describe the genetic structure and variability of the striped field mouse population inhabiting 17 locations in and around Warsaw, Poland, within a gradient of anthropopressure and discuss the possible factors that could potentially form the observed pattern. Ecological characteristics of the striped field mouse prevent decreases in genetic variability within local urban populations. High population density, ability to cross environmental barriers and to use “green corridors” allows this species to maintain gene flow in fragmented urban landscape. However, genetic variability and gene flow were efficiently reduced in the central part of the city. The results indicated that the degree of human pressure, defined based on the level of vegetation cover, is a good indicator of isolation. In the studied striped field mouse population, genetic interactions among particular locations (local populations) are modified in comparison with populations inhabiting natural areas, by replacement of the isolation-by-distance pattern of differentiation with the “isolation-by-infrastructure” pattern. As indicated by Bayesian analysis, the urban population from the right side of the Vistula river form common genetic cluster with ex-urban population located northward from the city, while the population from the left side of the river probably exchanges genes with neighbouring northern and southern ex-urban populations. However local populations at locations within the highest zone of anthropopressure are clearly isolated, and presently constitute separate genetic units.

TI  - A study on linear plant compositions' functionality, visuality and species diversity assessment in Trabzon City
PY  - 2009
AB  - Linear plant compositions establish a connection between rural and urban landscapes. The green fields, which are abundant in rural areas, are diminished in urban spaces due to rapid urbanization. This problem can be solved by using linear planting techniques in urbanized places. Nearby establishing green corridors in cities, linear planting serve as very nice visual compositions and provide functionalities. Linear plant compositions, which are quite important for the city, were examined owing to 3 different purposes. The first is the identifying of the plants having been used in linear green compositions. The second is the determining of the functional differences while the last one is preference and visual perception differences depending on users. In this study, totally 32 species were identified. Ligustrum japonicum, Biota orientalis and Hydrangea macrophylla were recorded as the most common species. These linear compositions were used as barrier with the rate of 78% in residential areas and 50% in open green spaces, as border with the rate of 40% in public spaces, as curtain with the rate of 86 in public areas, as separator with the rate of 87% in transportation areas. Visual quality of linear compositions was assessed by using analysis. Statistically reliable (%95) P<0.005 results were found between user and visual quality. As a result, linear plant compositions in Trabzon possess evergreen plant species by 70%. In addition, the linear plant compositions looking aesthetic were identified to be preferred more according to Semantical Differential Technique.

TI  - Decline in the diversity of willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) as a result of urban expansion in Beijing, China
PY  - 2011
AB  - Beijing, the capital and second largest city of China, expanded in a typical concentric pattern. The urbanized area consists of five concentric zones, which are based on the city's ring road system. Willow trees (Salix spp.) are commonly planted and abundant in the city. In this study, we determined the effects of urbanization on willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) in a 3-year survey. Our results indicated that species richness and abundance decreased from outskirts to the urban center. It was estimated that within a 30-km limit, species richness and abundance might be reduced by 0.9 species and 59.3% of individuals per 5 km toward urban center. Landscape variables (e.g., the proportion of impervious surface and distance to urban center) explained 59.4% of species richness and 43.9% of species abundance. Local variables (e.g., plant resources and site size) explained only 4.9% of species richness and 4.7% of species abundance. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between urban expansion and weevil diversity. There are several ways in which such detrimental effects on biodiversity could be mitigated: (1) Optimization of urban landscape structures, as well as vegetation planting; (2) increasing connectivity between urban remnants and natural landscapes in the outskirts of the city; and (3) limiting the proportion of impervious surface in inner urban zones. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Permeability of the urban matrix to arboreal gliding mammals: Sugar gliders in Melbourne, Australia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Habitat corridors that facilitate functional connectivity are a fundamental component of wildlife conservation in fragmented landscapes. However, the landscape matrix separating suitable habitat is not uniformly impermeable to movement and management to increase matrix permeability could be an alternative means to maintain connectivity. Gliding mammals are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because their movements are constrained by glide distance thresholds. Populations of gliders in cities are at risk of being isolated by increasing habitat loss and urban development, yet little is known about how the urban matrix affects glider movement. Here we investigate how the level of urbanization and tree cover in the matrix influence matrix permeability to sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) within suburban forest reserves. Twenty-two sugar gliders were radio-tracked over winter and summer at four reserves. Boundary crossing behaviour was measured as the number of times each glider crossed into the matrix, and matrix permeability was determined as the maximum distance travelled by gliders into the matrix. The majority of gliders (81%) were located in the matrix at least once, and rates of boundary crossing were consistent across urbanization and tree cover levels. Matrix permeability was negatively affected by matrix urbanization, but not by matrix tree cover, and no interaction effects were found. Although distances travelled by gliders into the matrix did not exceed 180m, they were comparable with typical movement distances by gliders in reserves. Our results demonstrate that the urban matrix can provide suitable habitat for gliding mammals to move and forage, but that increased urbanization may inhibit glider use of the matrix irrespective of tree cover. This finding has implications for conservation planning and suggests that structurally connected areas may not be used if movement behaviour is inhibited. Conversely, management of matrix permeability could be used to maintain connectivity without needing to construct physical corridors. © 2012 Ecological Society of Australia.

TI  - Connectivity assessment and prioritization of urban grasslands as a helpful tool for effective management of urban ecosystem services
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban grasslands are usually managed as short-cut lawns and have limited biodiversity. Urban grasslands with low-intensity management are species rich and can perform numerous ecosystem services, but they are not accepted by citizens everywhere. Further, increasing and/or maintaining a relatively high level of plant species richness in an urban environment is limited by restricted plant dispersal. In this study, we examined the connectivity of urban grasslands and prioritized the grassland patches with regard to their role in connectivity in an urban landscape. We used high-resolution data from a land use system to map grassland patches in Wroclaw city, Silesia, southwest Poland, Central Europe, and applied a graph theory approach to assess their connectivity and prioritization. We next constructed a model for several dispersal distance thresholds (2, 20, 44, 100, and 1000 m), reflecting plants with differing dispersal potential. Our results revealed low connectivity of urban grassland patches, especially for plants with low dispersal ability (2-20 m). The priority of patches was correlated with their area for all dispersal distance thresholds. Most of the large patches important to overall connectivity were located in urban peripheries, while in the city center, connectivity was more restricted and grassland area per capita was the lowest. The presence of a river created a corridor, allowing plants to migrate along watercourse, but it also created a barrier dividing the system. The results suggest that increasing the plant species richness in urban grasslands in the city center requires seed addition. © 2020 Mollashahi et al.

TI  - Mapping the flow of forest migration through the city under climate change
PY  - 2019
AB  - Rapid climate change will create extreme problems for the biota of the planet. Much of it will have to migrate towards the poles at a rate far beyond normal speeds. In this context, the concept of assisted migration has been proposed to facilitate the migration of trees. Yet current practices of assisted migration focus on “where tree species should be in the future” and thus have many uncertainties. We suggest that more attention should be paid on the flow of forest migration. Therefore, this study develops a three-step methodology for mapping the flow of forest migration under climate change. Since the migration of trees depends on the activities of their seed dispersal agents, the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents is mainly considered in this study. The developed method combines a least-cost path model, a graph-based approach, and a circuit theory-based model. The least-cost path model is applied to map the movement of dispersal agents, based on which graph-based indices are used to evaluate the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents, which in turn is used as the basis for circuit theory-based modelling to map the flow of forest migration. The proposed method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK. The resulting maps identify areas with high probability of climate-driven migration of trees.

TI  - Exploring plant species richness along the Tiber River within the city of Rome
PY  - 2021
AB  - The Tiber River stretch crossing the metropolitan area of Rome (Italy) is regarded as one of the main biological corridors of the city, as it diversifies the urban landscape while contributing to the plant diversity. This paper aims to document the current plant richness occurring along the Tiber within the city by providing a comprehensive inventory of the spontaneous vascular flora and an overview of its composition, and structural, chorological and ecological features. This flora lists 493 species and it is characterized by: i) high species richness (more than 30% of Rome’s flora), ii) presence of species with naturalistic value, as rare or included in Red List IUCN categories, iii) high number of ruderal and multizonal species (including several aliens) that have well adapted to human disturbance, and have partially replaced the typical riverine plants, iv) wide spread of eutrophic aquatic species, and rarefaction of those species that are more sensitive to eutrophication and water pollution. The dataset and the overview reported in this study can be useful for future research, with a special focus on a better naturalistic management of the urban river ecosystem, and the conservation of the floristic heritage within the city of Rome.

TI  - Small mammal use of suburban and urban parks in central Pennsylvania
PY  - 2005
AB  - To assist land managers responsible for park management, we conducted a pilot study to examine small mammal assemblages at 7 riparian parks in suburban/urban landscapes and at 1 riparian site in mature forest, all located in central Pennsylvania. Species richness and diversity were lowest in parks containing manicured habitats and surrounded by human-modified landscapes. However, parks managed for passive recreation supported mammalian assemblages that were similar in richness and diversity to our mature riparian forest site. The mature riparian forest site contained four species of small mammals (eastern chipmunks [Tamias striatus], white-footed mice [Peromyscus leucopus], deer mice [P. maniculatus], and woodland jumping mice [Napeozapus insignis]), and Spring Creek Nature Park, a park managed to promote natural and native habitats, contained five species (short-tailed shrews [Blarina brevicauda], eastern chipmunks, white-footed mice, meadow voles [Microtus pennsylvanicus], and meadow jumping mice [Zapus hudsonius]). In contrast, parks located in more urban settings and consisting primarily of mowed habitat contained only 1 or 2 species of small mammals. We did not capture non-native species in our study. Based upon this study, we recommend locating parks along streams or other natural corridors, leaving unmowed 10-15-m buffers along streams, and planting native trees along stream corridors in order to encourage diversity of small mammals in suburban and urban parks.

TI  - Density Dependent Refueling of Migratory Songbirds During Stopover Within an Urbanizing Coastal Landscape
PY  - 2022
AB  - Refueling performance is the primary currency of a successful migration as birds must maintain energy stores to achieve an optimal travel schedule. Migrating birds can anticipate heightened energy demand, not to mention increased uncertainty that energy demands will be satisfied, especially within an urbanizing landscape following long-distance flights. We tested the expectation that refueling performance of songbirds is reduced as densities increase at stopover sites in an urbanizing coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. We measured the density of migrating birds, their refueling performance, and arthropod abundance in two large tracts of contiguous forest paired with two small isolated patches embedded within residential settings throughout spring migration over the course of 2 years. Refueling performance declined with increasing migrant densities, even though the overall daily densities of birds stopping in these landscapes were relatively low and arthropod densities were low throughout. Habitat patch size alone did not account for differences in refueling performance, but smaller habitat patches more often concentrated migrants in higher densities where they experienced reduced refueling performance. We found support for density-dependent refueling performance during spring migration through a region where overall passage and stopover densities are low; suggesting that larger contiguous forest tracks within urban landscapes provide higher quality habitat for refueling and that effect is likely even more pronounced in landscapes within higher density migratory corridors. The nutritional challenges encountered during migration influence the overall pace of migration and changes in access to food resources due to increasing urbanization may ultimately impact optimal travel schedules.

TI  - Wide outcrossing provides functional connectivity for new and old Banksia populations within a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2019
AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects landscape connectivity, the extent of which is influenced by the movement capacity of the vectors of seed and pollen dispersal for plants. Negative impacts of reduced connectivity can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br. (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations had greater allelic diversity (Ar = 8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations (Ar range = 6.49–7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between restored and adjacent remnants (FST = 0.03 and 0.10) than all other pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean FST = 0.01 ± 0.01; n = 16 P = 0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity (rp = 0.06–0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances (< 1.7 km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape. Due to long-distance pollination events, the physical size of these sites underestimates their effective population size. Thus, they are functionally equivalent to large populations, integrated into a larger landscape matrix.

TI  - Park size and prey density limit occurrence of Eurasian Sparrowhawks in urban parks during winter
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Eurasian Sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) increasingly represent successful city-dwellers. Thereby, a rich food supply indicated by high numbers of small birds is believed to be the key driver for this bird-eating raptor species to settle in urban environments. However, as small passerine birds show particularly strong antipredator responses, sparrowhawks may not simply focus on patches of highest prey densities, but rather respond strategically to prey behavior, raising the importance of other parameters in determining the occurrence within urban landscapes. Methods: To deepen our knowledge on habitat requirements of urban sparrowhawks, bird surveys were carried out during winter between December 2005 and January 2017 in 36 city parks in Vienna, Austria. Besides food supply also park size, canopy heterogeneity and the connectivity with other green spaces were considered. Results: Occurrence of sparrowhawks was positively affected by increasing park size, prey density and the interaction between both. Bird feeder density and park connectivity with other green spaces were of minor importance in explaining the presence of this species. Canopy heterogeneity didn't affect city park occupancy by Eurasian Sparrowhawks. Conclusions: Our results suggest that large city parks, particularly when characterized by high prey densities, substantially contribute to protect and preserve ecologically important bird species such as raptors within the urban environment-a landscape already struggling with biodiversity losses and functional homogenization. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Promoting biodiversity values of small forest patches in agricultural landscapes: Ecological drivers and social demand
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Small forest patches embedded in agricultural (and peri-urban) landscapes in Western Europe play a key role for biodiversity conservation with a recognized capacity of delivering a wide suite of ecosystem services. Measures aimed to preserve these patches should be both socially desirable and ecologically effective. This study presents a joint ecologic and economic assessment conducted on small forest patches in Flanders (Belgium) and Picardie (N France). In each study region, two contrasted types of agricultural landscapes were selected. Open field (OF) and Bocage (B) landscapes are distinguished by the intensity of their usage and higher connectivity in the B landscapes. The social demand for enhancing biodiversity and forest structure diversity as well as for increasing the forest area at the expenses of agricultural land is estimated through an economic valuation survey. These results are compared with the outcomes of an ecological survey where the influence of structural features of the forest patches on the associated herbaceous diversity is assessed. The ecological and economic surveys show contrasting results; increasing tree species richness is ecologically more important for herbaceous diversity in the patch, but both tree species richness and herbaceous diversity obtain insignificant willingness to pay estimates. Furthermore, although respondents prefer the proposed changes to take place in the region where they live, we find out that social preferences and ecological effectiveness do differ between landscapes that represent different intensities of land use. Dwellers where the landscape is perceived as more “degraded” attach more value to diversity enhancement, suggesting a prioritization of initiatives in these area. In contrast, the ecological analyses show that prioritizing the protection and enhancement of the relatively better-off areas is more ecologically effective. Our study calls for a balance between ecological effectiveness and welfare benefits, suggesting that cost effectiveness studies should consider these approaches jointly.

TI  - Effect of habitat fragmentation on seed dispersal ability of a wind-dispersed annual in an agroecosystem
PY  - 2020
AB  - Deficient dispersal ability due to habitat fragmentation adversely impact demographic connectivity and gene flow among population in a metapopulation, and therefore potentially leads to local extinction. A rich body of theoretical work provides distinct predictions regarding the distribution of dispersal abilities in relation to fragmentation gradient. Yet, empirical data remains elusive in general, and it is lacking for anthropogenic-induced landscapes in particular. We collected 9884 seeds of a wind-dispersed annual species Geropogon hybridus (Asteraceae) from 807 individual plants of 55 populations spanning three landscapes in a fragmented agroecosystem and measured four major dispersal-related traits at the landscape, population, plant and seed levels. Contrary to previous studies that were based on island or urban landscapes and where fragmentation was associated with reduced dispersal, we revealed increased seed dispersal ability in the more fragmented patches. However, the specific relationships between dispersal-related traits and fragmentation characteristics varied with ecological scale. The discrepancy between our results and those from previous studies may be explained by the milder contrast between the fragmented patches and the surrounding matrix in our system, which is a common feature in many agroecosystems. The findings add to the accumulating evidence that different selection pressures and constraints act on seed dispersal evolution under the global land use change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Conservation corridors in the United States: Benefits and planning guidelines
PY  - 1999
AB  - The landscape of rural America is changing. Wildlife habitats are being converted to agricultural uses, corridors (linear patches that differ from their surroundings) are removed to expand fields, and urban development spreads across farms, forests, and prairies. The result is a fragmented landscape with fewer, smaller, less-connected patches of wildlife habitat and increasingly-degraded water quality that stresses aquatic ecosystems. The landscapes capacity to sustain a diversity of plant, animal, and aquatic species is declining at an accelerating rate. The loss of biodiversity has become a national concern. Land use planners are increasingly advocating the use of conservation corridors, including riparian buffers, windbreaks/shelterbelts, filter strips, field borders, and grassed waterways to improve water quality and wildlife habitat. Since many of the ecological functions of conservation corridors operate more efficiently at scales larger than an individual corridor, planning at the watershed scale offers the best opportunity to optimize these functions.

TI  - Environmental and landscape factors influencing ant and plant diversity in suburban riparian corridors
PY  - 2011
AB  - Urban riparian zones are highly valuable for a range of environmental, social and economic reasons. Despite their ecological complexity, legislative instruments underpinning riparian protection focus predominantly on minimum corridor widths required to fulfill environmental functions. This study sought to identify the dominant environmental variables that influence riparian corridor biodiversity in northern Sydney, Australia. Ant and plant assemblages were sampled from 18 riparian corridors of various widths. Environmental data pertaining to each corridor were collected using field and desktop surveys. Generalised Linear Modelling found perimeter:area ratio and the gradient of the slope perpendicular to the stream to predict significantly ant and plant richness. Plant richness was also influenced by vegetation community type and corridor width. When streamside vegetation communities were considered in isolation, many of the same factors were found to influence species richness. Likewise, Distance-based Linear Modelling identified vegetation community type and landscape connectivity as significant predictors of ant composition both in streamside habitats and those located across the full width of each riparian corridor sampled. While width was the best predictor of plant assemblage composition across the whole riparian corridor, streamside vegetation was influenced more significantly by soil pH. This result arose principally due to a dominance of exotic plants in alkaline soils. Although wider corridors were likely to encompass a greater variety of biotic assemblages, landscape and site scale environmental characteristics appeared to be of greater ecological significance. Environmental managers should therefore consider these factors and target weed invasion when seeking to enhance biodiversity in urban riparian corridors. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of LUCC on landscape pattern in the Yangtze River Basin during 2001–2019
PY  - 2022
AB  - Evaluating the influences of LUCC (Land Use/Land Cover Change) on landscape pattern is significant for understanding and improving ecological environment system management. This study used landscape pattern as an important indicator to estimate the impacts of the LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin from 2001 to 2019. Based on the remote sensing images of LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) in the Yangtze River Basin in 2001–2019, the dynamic attitude and transfer matrix of LULC, and landscape pattern indices were employed to analyze the LUCC and the impact of LULC on the landscape pattern of the Yangtze River Basin. The results of LUCC show that the main LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin during 2001–2019 is mainly manifested by the increase of water body, forest, wetland, crop/natural vegetation mosaic (NVM) and urban, among which the forest increased the most by 62,635 km2. The areas of grassland and cropland are decreasing, with the grassland decreasing the most. Forest, crop/NVM and cropland are transformed into grassland, which complements the lack of grassland to some extent. LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin is most intense between grassland and forest. Landscape pattern shows: Grassland occupies an important advantage in the whole landscape structure. Forest, grassland and urban landscapes are seriously fragmented, and their LSI (Landscape Shape Index) is more complex than others. The connectivity between various landscape types is weakened, and the degree of landscape fragmentation is increased, but the LULC structure is becoming more and more abundant. The areas with high landscape fragmentation value have richer landscape diversity and diverse LULC types. There is a strong correlation between grassland and the four landscape pattern indices. The change of landscape pattern in the Yangtze River Basin is influenced by natural factors and LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin, and the change caused by human activities is the main driving factor of LUCC. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Promoting climate-driven forest migration through large-scale urban afforestation
PY  - 2021
AB  - Anthropogenic climate warming is expected to shift the geographical distribution of forest trees worldwide. Urbanization-induced landscape fragmentation represents a considerable impediment to species’ range shifts. Large-scale afforestation is often suggested to be an effective measure to mitigate the negative impacts of landscape fragmentation. However, the effectiveness of afforestation on climate-driven forest migration has rarely been evaluated in urban environments. Here, we tested the effectiveness of two common afforestation strategies in promoting the migration of bird-dispersed tree species in Greater Manchester, UK: (A) planting trees in private gardens and roadsides and (B) establishing large woodlands in public lands. A modelling approach combining graph and circuit theory was used to assess the improvement in landscape connectivity after urban afforestation and to analyze how the two strategies promote the process of forest migration under climate change. Our results suggested that planting trees in gardens and streets could improve the spatial patterns of forest migration by forming stepping stones for the movement of birds across the urban matrix; establishing large woodlands in public areas could enhance the probability of forest migration between urban woodlands by providing population hubs. We found that the effectiveness of urban afforestation was strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of trees and the physical characteristics of local bird species. The study offers new insight into the biodiversity benefits of urban landscapes, encourages tree-planting programs in urban environments, and calls for close cooperation between urban foresters, designers, and managers to cope with the changing climate. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Home-range use patterns and movements of the Siberian flying squirrel in urban forests: Effects of habitat composition and connectivity
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: Urbanization causes modification, fragmentation and loss of native habitats. Such landscape changes threaten many arboreal and gliding mammals by limiting their movements through treeless parts of a landscape and by making the landscape surrounding suitable habitat patches more inhospitable. Here, we investigate the effects of landscape structure and habitat availability on the home-range use and movement patterns of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) at different spatial and temporal scales. We followed radio-tagged individuals in a partly urbanized study area in Eastern Finland, and analysed how landscape composition and connectivity affected the length and speed of movement bursts, distances moved during one night, and habitat and nest-site use. Results: The presence of urban habitat on movement paths increased both movement lengths and speed whereas nightly distances travelled by males decreased with increasing amount of urban habitat within the home range. The probability of switching from the present nest site to another nest site decreased with increasing distance among the nest sites, but whether the nest sites were connected or unconnected by forests did not have a clear effect on nest switching. Flying squirrels preferred to use mature forests for their movements at night. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the proximity to urban habitats modifies animal movements, possibly because animals try to avoid such habitats by moving faster through them. Urbanization at the scale of an entire home range can restrict their movements. Thus, maintaining a large enough amount of mature forests around inhabited landscape fragments will help protect forest specialists in urban landscapes. The effect of forested connections remains unclear, highlighting the difficulty of measuring and preserving connectivity in a species-specific way. © 2016 Mäkeläinen et al.

TI  - Edge effects in fire-prone landscapes: Ecological importance and implications for fauna
PY  - 2018
AB  - Edges are ecologically important environmental features and have been well researched in agricultural and urban landscapes. However, little work has been conducted in flammable ecosystems where spatially and temporally dynamic fire edges are expected to influence important processes such as recolonization of burnt areas and landscape connectivity. We review the literature on fire, fauna, and edge effects to summarize current knowledge of faunal responses to fire edges and identify knowledge gaps. We then develop a conceptual model to predict faunal responses to fire edges and present an agenda for future research. Faunal abundance at fire edges changes over time, but patterns depend on species traits and resource availability. Responses are also influenced by edge architecture (e.g., size and shape), site and landscape context, and spatial scale. However, data are limited and the influence of fire edges on both local abundance and regional distributions of fauna is largely unknown. In our conceptual model, biophysical properties interact with the fire regime (e.g., patchiness, frequency) to influence edge architecture. Edge architecture and species traits influence edge permeability, which is linked to important processes such as movement, resource selection, and species interactions. Predicting the effect of fire edges on fauna is challenging, but important for biodiversity conservation in flammable landscapes. Our conceptual model combines several drivers of faunal fire responses (biophysical properties, regime attributes, species traits) and will therefore lead to improved predictions. Future research is needed to understand fire as an agent of edge creation; the spatio-temporal flux of fire edges across landscapes; and the effect of fire edges on faunal movement, resource selection, and biotic interactions. To aid the incorporation of new data into our predictive framework, our model has been designed as a Bayesian Network, a statistical tool capable of analyzing complex environmental relationships, dealing with data gaps, and generating testable hypotheses. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Alternative 2070: Mitigating the effects of projected sea level rise and urbanization on Florida black bear and Florida panther habitat
PY  - 2021
AB  - Historically ubiquitous throughout the state, Florida's only two extant large carnivores, the federally endangered Florida panther and black bear, are now geographically restricted with small populations. Rapid human population growth and sea level rise (SLR) threaten to diminish these species’ habitats. To aid landscape-scale conservation efforts, we estimated changes in habitat across a set of alternative future land-use and SLR projections. Intermediate-high (0.9 m) to extreme (1.8 m) SLR projections inundated 2.2–4.8% of panther and 3.3–5.4% of bear habitat by 2070. Unmitigated urban sprawl with minor protection policies (a Trend 2070 land-use projection) eliminated 8.8% of panther and 11.3% of bear habitat but increased protected habitat by 3.3%. In contrast, increased urban densities coupled with extensive land protection policies (an Alternative 2070 land-use projection) eliminated 4.1% of panther and 7.3% of bear habitat, and it increased protected habitat 52.1% for panther and 64.1% for bear. In combination, the Trend 2070 and extreme SLR projections reduced protected habitat 3.4% for panther and 6.6% for bear. However, the Alternative 2070 projection offset habitat area lost to extreme SLR, increasing protected habitat 45.3% for panther and 51.6% for bear. Protecting land along the Caloosahatchee River may accommodate panther dispersal to large habitat patches in northern Florida, while protecting inland habitat corridors may compensate for black bear habitat connectivity lost to inundation along the Gulf Coast. These alternative future projections prognosticate the impacts of climate and land-use change on the viability of Florida's two large carnivores. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Assessing the efficacy of bee promoting measures (Hymenoptera, apiformes) along an urban-rural gradient
PY  - 2020
AB  - Cities are emerging as refugia for pollinators, among which bees play a pivotal role for maintaining ecosystem functioning in agricultural and urban settings. While measures to promote bees have been investigated pre-dominantly in the agricultural or rural context, a wide knowledge gap persists with regard to the effectiveness of such measures within urban landscapes. In order to guide research addressing this lack of knowledge, the aim of this perspective paper is to give an overview of the recent research activities based on the published peer-re-viewed literature. While research on flower seed mixtures in general focuses on nutritional aspects, studies on plantings of perennial herbs are relatively limited to few plant taxa. Implementation of comparable case studies investigating the effects of tree plantings on bee populations is hampered by a lack of methodological standard-ization. The conservation value of providing nesting sites in cities needs to be further investigated, in particular concerning ground-nesting bee species. While several case studies indicate a nutritional supporting function of green roofs for urban bee populations, findings with regard to vertical isolation remain equivocal. Various factors driving bee diversity and population structure in the urban context at the local and landscape scale have been identified, the reported relevant landscape scale being represented by radii between 500 and 1000 m in most cases. Future study designs reflecting a continuous and complete gradient of urbanization will be helpful in com-paring results on bee promoting measures in agricultural landscapes (which are numerous) to urban settings (which are still encountered much less frequently). Studies looking into the genetic structure of bee populations with regard to urbanization so far represent only a tiny fraction of bee diversity, and the further development of molecular methods could yield novel tools for assessing the success of bee promoting measures in terms of habitat connectivity in the near future. © The Author(s) 2020.

TI  - Rethinking a rare-species conservation strategy in an urban landscape: The case of the valley elderberry longhorn beetle
PY  - 2007
AB  - Reflecting the lack of critical information for most protected species, recovery plans for organisms listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act tend to oversimplify habitat descriptions. Here we present our approach for improving the definition of habitat for rare and patchily distributed listed species. The valley elderberry longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) occurs in riparian and scrub communities in California's Central Valley. Habitat quality for the species currently is defined essentially exclusively in terms of presence and abundance of its larval host plant, elderberry (Sambucus spp.). Using detailed measures of physical and biological attributes at diverse sites occupied by the beetle, we characterized and defined habitat quality on the basis of not only host plants, but on an array of biotic and abiotic environmental characteristics. We identified four geomorphically distinct habitat associations: alluvial plain, narrow riparian corridor, upper riparian plain, and non-riparian scrub. Depending on habitat type, the environmental characteristics most strongly associated with beetle presence were host plant availability, topography and proximity to habitat edge. Increased local population size of beetles was associated with higher elderberry density and the presence of larger, more mature plants. Stochasticity in site occupancy over space and time confounds our ability to identify sites that are most able to contribute to long-term beetle survival, while underscoring the importance of unoccupied habitat to the beetle. Adopting a multivariate definition of habitat may facilitate more effective identification of locations critical to the recovery of the valley elderberry longhorn beetle, and prioritization of those management actions that can contribute effectively to meeting conservation goals for the species. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Multi-scale characterisation of stream nutrient and carbon dynamics in sandy near coastal catchments of south-western Australia
PY  - 2020
AB  - Managers tasked with repairing degraded stream ecosystems require restoration strategies that are tailored to local and regional characteristics. Emerging evidence suggests that local reach-scale approaches may be as effective, if not more so, than catchment-scale actions in highly permeable coastal landscapes, particularly if there is hydraulic connectivity to shallow groundwater and where recharge is strongly seasonal. This study assessed the relative influence of catchment-scale land use and reach-scale vegetation structure on the distribution of carbon and nutrient concentrations of streams within urban and agricultural catchments of the Perth region of south-western Australia. We used linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the extent to which phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon concentrations in different stream zones (streamwater, and fluvial and parafluvial sediments) were explained by catchment and reach-scale attributes and moderated by high versus low-flow periods, i.e., in wet versus dry months. We found that reach-scale vegetation (woody plant cover, annual plant cover) was a better predictor of nutrient concentrations than catchment-scale land use, particularly total imperviousness, a common measure of urbanisation. Flow was also important, with carbon and nutrient concentrations better described by reach- or catchment-scale attributes during the low flow period. The extent to which individual catchment and reach attributes influenced the distribution of nutrients in different stream zones was complex. However, our results suggest that planting woody vegetation can reduce nitrogen concentrations in surface water and fluvial sediments. Reducing the abundance of weedy annual species and restoring woody perennial species may further reduce phosphorus concentrations in surface water. We conclude that local riparian restoration can be a cost-effective strategy for managing excess nutrients and carbon in flat and permeable urban landscapes, particularly during low flow periods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Long-distance seed dispersal by straw-coloured fruit bats varies by season and landscape
PY  - 2016
AB  - On-going fragmentation of tropical forest ecosystems and associated depletion of seed dispersers threatens the long-term survival of animal-dispersed plants. These threats do not only affect biodiversity and species abundance, but ultimately ecosystem functions and services. Thus, seed dispersers such as the straw-coloured fruit bat, E. helvum, which traverse long distances across fragmented landscapes, are particularly important for maintaining genetic connectivity and colonizing new sites for plant species. Using high-resolution GPS-tracking of movements, field observations and gut retention experiments, we quantify dispersal distances for small- and large-seeded fruits foraged by E. helvum during periods of colony population low (wet season) and high (dry season) in an urban and a rural landscape in the forest zone of Ghana. Gut passage time averaged 116 min (range 4-1143 min), comparable to other fruit bats. Movements were generally longer in the urban than in the rural landscape and also longer in the dry than in the wet season. As the majority of seeds are dispersed only to feeding roosts, median dispersal distances were similar for both large (42-67 m) and small (42-65 m) seeds. However, small seeds were potentially dispersed up to 75.4 km, four times further than the previous maximum distance estimated for a similar-sized frugivore. Maximum seed dispersal distances for small seeds were almost twice as long in the rural (49.7 km) compare to the urban (31.2 km) landscape. Within the urban landscape, estimated maximum dispersal distances for small seeds were three times longer during the dry season (75.4 km) compared to the wet season (22.8 km); in contrast, distances in the rural landscape were three times longer in the wet season (67 km) compared to the dry season (24.4). Dispersal distances for large seeds during the dry season (551 m) in the rural landscape were almost twice that in the wet season (319 m). We found no influence of food phenology on dispersal distances. The maximum likelihood for seed dispersal beyond feeding roosts (mean distance from food tree 263 m) was 4.7%. Small seeds were dispersed over even longer distances, >500 and >1000 m, with a likelihood of 3.0 % and 2.3 % respectively. Our data show that E. helvum retains ingested seeds for very long periods and may traverse large distances, probably making it an important long distance seed disperser in tropical Africa. We suggest E. helvumis important for ecosystem functioning and urge its conservation. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Field investigation of roadside vegetative and structural barrier impact on near-road ultrafine particle concentrations under a variety of wind conditions
PY  - 2012
AB  - Roadside barriers, such as tree stands or noise barriers, are prevalent in many populated areas and have been shown to affect the dispersion of traffic emissions. If roadside noise barriers or tree stands are found to consistently lower ground-level air pollution concentrations in the near-road environment, this may be a practical strategy for reducing exposures to air contaminants along populated traffic corridors. This study measured ultrafine particle (UFP) concentrations using an instrumented mobile measurement approach, collecting data on major roadways and in near-road locations for more than forty sampling sessions at three locations in central North Carolina, USA. Two of the sampling sites had relatively thin tree stands, one evergreen and one deciduous, along a portion of the roadway. The third sampling site had a brick noise wall along a portion of the road. At 10. m from the road, UFPs measured using a mobile sampling platform were lower by approximately 50% behind the brick noise wall relative to a nearby location without a barrier for multiple meteorological conditions. The UFP trends at the vegetative barrier sites were variable and the barrier effect is uncertain. In some cases, higher concentrations were observed behind the vegetative barrier, with respect to the clearing, which may be due to gaps in the thin tree stands allowing the transport of traffic-related air pollution to near-road areas behind the vegetation. On-road sampling revealed no consistent difference in UFP levels in on-road portions of the road with or without a roadside barrier present. These findings support the notion that solid roadside barriers may mitigate near-road impact. Given the co-benefits of vegetative barriers in the urban landscape, research regarding the mitigation potential of vegetative barriers of other configurations (e.g., greater density, wider buffer) is encouraged. © 2011.

TI  - Anurans of serra negra da mantiqueira, zona da mata of Minas Gerais, Brazil: A priority area for biodiversity conservation
PY  - 2017
AB  - Amphibians are identified as the group that presents the largest decline in recent years and fauna inventories are primary to map conservation strategies. The Serra Negra da Mantiqueira, which belongs to the mountain complex of the Serra da Mantiqueira and is part of the Mantiqueira’s Ecological Corridor, has high species diversity and represents a priority area for biological conservation. We present the first systematic anurofauna inventory for Serra Negra da Mantiqueira in the Municipalities of Rio Preto, Santa Bárbara do Monte Verde, Olaria and Lima Duarte, located in the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais. We conducted 12 collections during two rainy seasons, from October 2013 to March 2014 and from October 2014 to March 2015. We inventoried 13 sampling sites through night active search over five days per month. The anurofauna of Serra Negra da Mantiqueira presented 48 species in ten families, Hylidae family being the richest (24 species), followed by Leptodactylidae family (eight species). In addition, we recorded two endemic species, Hylodes perere and Hypsiboas cambui. This study revealed a higher richness of anuran species in the Serra Negra da Mantiqueira than the anurofauna from adjacent regions such as the Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca and the city of Juiz de Fora. © 2017, Societas Europaea Herpetologica.

TI  - GREEN STREETS: THE OPPORTUNITY TO DESIGN RESILIENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT IN THE CITIES OF THE FUTURE
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban environments are under natural stresses such as typhoons and droughts whilst concurrently being threatened by stresses produced by human activities. Creating impermeable swaths across large areas in our cities is one of the most well-known anthropogenic impacts; with impervious surfaces occupying up to 80 - 90% of the urban land area, increasing the risks of flooding and diffuse pollution. Strategic urban planning incorporating innovative systems and policies is necessary to mitigate the deleterious human health and environmental impacts of urbanization. Impervious areas in the city are comprised mostly of streets, sidewalks, roads, roofs and parking areas. All of them have the potential to be designed as source control stormwater techniques, and therefore, the potential to restore the natural water cycle in the urban environment. Thus, the future of stormwater management in cities lies in the development of an urban network of green and blue spaces that deliver ecosystem services. Green infrastructure is at the forefront of stormwater management techniques in urban environments, being used as multifunctional, nature-based solutions, mimicking processes of the natural environment. They can be used not only to design new areas within the city, but also to retrofit urban environments, enhancing biodiversity, providing amenity to the citizens, improving urban runoff management and increasing flood resilience amongst other benefits. Many municipalities have realized the opportunities available to implement green infrastructure within the right-of-way transportation corridor as a means to comply with regulations while also improving urban livability. Green Street Programmes across the globe, containing green stormwater infrastructure (GSI), have been successfully applied, contributing to the generation of better spaces and a rise of a new industry around sustainable stormwater management as a wider benefit to society. Green Streets takes the opportunity to re-design the urban landscape by employing GSI solutions instead of the previously-built impervious surfaces. Green Streets also create more secure spaces for pedestrians and their interaction with urban traffic. This book chapter is a review of the scientific knowledge on Green Street design through the use of GSI; this is the future pathway to design cities resilient to flood and urban pollution, thereby creating better urban spaces to live. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Habitat evaluation for Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Lincang: Conservation planning for an extremely small population of elephants in China
PY  - 2016
AB  - Fewer than 250 Asian elephants remain in China, occupying fragmented habitats of Yunnan Province. One such fragmented population of 18-23 individuals occupies the Nangunhe Nature Reserve Area in Lincang City, Yunnan Province, China. The greatest threat to the survival of this population is the loss and fragmentation of habitat. In this study, we applied an ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) model to evaluate the habitat suitability of Lincang City for Asian elephants based on geographical factors, vegetation type, and human disturbance. Optimal, relatively suitable, and marginal habitat accounted for 0.16% (38.45 km2), 0.61% (150.00 km2), and 3.34% (817.26 km2) of the total study area, whereas non-suitable habitat accounted for 95.89% (23,463.29 km2) of this area. The marginality of Asian elephant habitat in Lincang was 1.954, indicating nonrandom selection of various eco-geographical variables in the environment. The primary factor affecting Asian elephant habitat quality was vegetation type, followed by geographical factors and human disturbance. A habitat quality map for the total distribution of Asian elephants remaining in China (i.e., Yunnan Province: Xishuangbanna, Lincang, and Pu'er) based on our current and previous study showed that just 1400.57 km2 and 2689.62 km2 relatively suitable and optimal habitat is available, owing to significant deforestation. In addition to reintroduction programs, conservation strategies should focus on improving the quality of marginal habitats for elephants, in parallel to placing ecological corridors through non-suitable habitat to connect all suitable habitats for this and other extremely small elephant populations in China to reduce genetic isolation and secure long-term survival for the species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Methodology proposed for photogrammetric monitoring of the exotic species Hovenia dulcis Thunb. in the Green Belt area surrounding the city of Santa Cruz do Sul, RS, Brazil
PY  - 2020
AB  - The spread of the exotic species Hovenia dulcis known as Japanese raisin tree, coming from Asia, detected in a protected area of 465.0 ha surrounding the city of Santa Cruz do Sul, RS, Brazil, named “Green Belt.” In this context, this research aimed at developing an aerial monitoring system able to identify and quantify the extension in the Green Belt area that this species invaded, as well as describing the impacts caused on the local forest community. We collected data from an ultralight Flyer GT aircraft equipped with a vertical camera. The images were taking in June and July 2015, when H. dulcis trees have shed their leaves, displaying a gray color, and September and October 2015, when the leaves are young and with a light green color. Based on the methodology proposed trough aerial monitoring by photogrammetry, the results indicated that the total invaded area by H. dulcis in the Green Belt of Santa Cruz do Sul County, RS, was 131.8 ha, corresponding to 20.9% of the total area. To validate this method, a quantitative comparison between the result from a terrestrial fieldwork carried out and the proposed method showed no significant differences in the estimated area occupied by H. dulcis. We concluded that these results validate the proposed aerial assessment method.

TI  - Joining the dots: How does an apex predator move through an urbanizing landscape?
PY  - 2019
AB  - Examining the movement of apex predators is difficult in urban environments due to private land ownership; however, understanding their movement is critical given the current and rapidly increasing rate of urbanization globally. Of equal importance is the understanding of what landscape factors allow these movements to occur. We used the powerful owl (Ninox strenua), an urban apex predator in Melbourne, Australia, as a case study to understand their movement ecology in urban environments. Owl movement was recorded using automated GPS logging devices deployed on ten powerful owls, resulting in 10870 GPS locations. In combination with these positions, four environmental covariates, and a priori understanding of owl ecology were used to assign movements to three different states (prey handling/eating, foraging and transitory) based on step length and turning angles between sequential locations in a hidden Markov model. We demonstrate that the environmental covariate combination of time of night, Euclidean distance to riparian vegetation, and NDVI best described movement states. Owl movement states changed across the night. Shorter movements with many turns were made towards the beginning of the night in riparian areas with high NDVI. This behavior is most likely linked to prey handling, suggesting powerful owls are more likely to hunt early in the evenings and as such travel short distances while carrying large prey items. Transitory movements with limited changes in turning angles were the dominant movement state towards the end of the night. As owls leave areas of high NDVI, they quickly travel long distances across cleared land and impervious surfaces to connect to the next habitat patch where they then transition back into shorter step lengths where NDVI is higher. This research highlights the critical importance of riparian vegetation and high NDVI areas in driving powerful owl movement and foraging in urban landscapes. Conservation priority should be placed on retaining and restoring riparian corridors as areas not only for powerful owls and their prey, but also for many other species that utilize similar resources. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - Creating Effective Urban Greenways and Stepping-stones: Four Critical Gaps in Habitat Connectivity Planning Research
PY  - 2019
AB  - Research in the field of ecology suggests that two main strategies, corridors and stepping-stones, can enhance urban habitat connectivity. While highly relevant to planning, no synthesis of this literature addresses planning research or implications. This review describes the effectiveness of corridor and stepping-stone strategies, actions that could enhance their ability to support animal movement, and the state of knowledge on connectivity planning, implementation, and outcomes. It concludes by identifying four significant gaps in our knowledge of planning for urban connectivity. Most critically, few studies assess the on-the-ground results of habitat connectivity planning and none examine the long-term outcomes. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - The thermal environment landscape pattern and typical urban landscapes effect linked with thermal environment in Beijing
PY  - 2010
AB  - Study on thermal environment and thermal effect is one of the most important topics in city climate and environment researches. The paper integrates some theories of ecology landscape, geostatistics technology and spatial analysis technology of GIS into the research on thermal environment issues, and explores the thermal landscape pattern, the thermal effect of parks landscape and road corridors in Beijing. As retrieving land surface temperature (LST) and analysis of its distribution is of great efficiency to research thermal environmental problems of earth surface, two ASTER imageries are used for the LST retrieval by TES algorithm. Fitting of the whole day's continuous ground temperature with meteorological observations data at the same date when the satellite transit using sinusoidal function is utilized, and the following interpolation generates ground temperature at satellite transit time to verify the retrieved LST. The overall temperature accuracy is less than 0. 5X. Basing on the LST variable, the thermal landscape pattern is studied by calculating landscape pattern indices under different grid size in Fragstats software. Considering the scale effect of thermal landscape heterogeneous pattern, the largest sampling scales are determined by the semi-variant function. The results show that the largest sampling scale is 818.392m and 778. 520m in the urban scene and the suburb scene, respectively. Suburban thermal landscape patches are continuous, while the urban thermal landscape patches are relatively dispersed. This illustrates that thermal landscape has a closerelationship with built-up levels of urban development and construction. With the increase of sampling particle size, the patch density and contagion index show a downward trend, and the average patch area increases exponentially, while the diversity index changes little. Except the diversity index, the other three indices vary with different grain size. In addition, the great importance of choosing appropriate resolution should be noted for the thermal landscape studies. Studies have shown that large area of vegetation cover and water can relieve and regulate the thermal environment. What's more, the urban parks is the assemblage of green space and water bodies. Therefore, park is undoubtedly the city's ' cold island'. In contrast, due to the physical properties and heat emissions from vehicles, road corridor is the relative heat strip'. For studying thermal environment effect which is of great significance for urban planning, park and road landscape are chosen for the study of thermal environment effect, by constructing the models between landscapes patches characteristics and the corresponding average LST, and by calculating the LST varies in the buffer zones of landscapes themselves. The thermal environment effect analysis draws the conclusion that generally the average LST decreases with the increase of area, perimeter of park, and the decrease of ratio of perimeter to area. In areas further away from the parks, the LST raised, and the raising trend slowed down. Specifically, the average LST increase is 0. 5366°C from the 0 -90m buffer zone to 90 - 180m buffer zone outside the park, while the one is 0. 3258°C from the 90 - 180m buffer zone to the 180 - 270m buffer zone. As road density increases, the average of LST increases and standard deviation of LST decreases significantly. The correlation coefficient between the road density ranks and LST of roads was 0. 8021. The average LST of the buffer zone decreased slightly with distance from the road centerline. Therefore, more attention is ought to paid to the rational distribution of urban roads and the landscape park for the sake of easing the implication of urban heat environment pressure.

TI  - Comparison of the interest of four types of organic mulches to reclaim degraded areas: a field study based on their relative attractiveness for soil macrofauna
PY  - 2020
AB  - The study focused on the attractiveness of mulches (consisting of the addition of a layer material to the soil surface) and their efficiency to promote recolonization by pedofauna of isolated and degraded areas. The experimental study was set up in the former coal mining area of Northern France. This area is particularly disturbed and fragmented by land-use change, urbanization, industry, intensive agriculture and metal pollution. To examine the movements of pedofauna, four kinds of mulches were applied: (i) Ramial Chipped Wood (RCW), (ii) chopped Miscanthus, (iii) dead leaves and (iv) wheat straw as well as plastic sheeting, a material often used in green spaces. A negative control consisted in soil without mulch addition. The experimental set-up consisted of a set of 18 bands of mulch (6 m long x 0.5 m width x 8 cm thick, i.e. a volume of 0.04 m3 per band) installed on three adjacent plots on a surface area which stretch on 4400 m2: (i) plot F1, a mixed plantation, (ii) plot M consisted of three rows of maples (both considered to be the reservoir of biodiversity) and (iii) plot BF, an ash plantation (with lower biodiversity). Faunistic communities of soil present within the mulches were monitoring using pitfall traps for four months (April to July), at a rate of eight surveys for each of the 90 traps installed, i.e. 720 samples. Different life traits and indices of diversity were studied, more specifically on carabid beetles. The main objective of the study was first to check whether mulches could or not reconnect different planted plots in a peri-urban landscape highly modified by human activities. The second aim was to find which type of mulch had the best efficiency in the recovery of the connectivity between plots. The last questions were which type of zoological groups could be favoured by the use of mulches and which benefits for ecosystem functioning. The main hypotheses of this study were: (i) Organic mulches would act as dispersal corridors and refuge zones to the soil organisms; (ii) organic mulches would be attractive to many organisms with various ecological needs. This study highlighted the potential benefits of using the mulching technique to support ecological connectivity in disturbed environment since this method highlighted the presence of individuals with different diets (saprophagous, predators, phytophagous and so forth), small and large size species which do not have the same dispersal capacities as well as species that are more dependent on forest environments and others that depend on more open environments. The study concluded that organic mulches are more favourable to pedofauna than soil without mulch or plastic sheeting. With regard to organic mulches, no difference was noted, either in terms of cumulative abundance or monthly monitoring. However, for carabids, it should be noted that dead leaves and wheat straw have higher specific richness than Miscanthus and RCW. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Dispersal-based species pools as sources of connectivity area mismatches
PY  - 2022
AB  - Context: Prioritising is likely to differ depending on the species considered for connectivity assessments, leading to a lack of consensual decisions for territorial planning. Objectives: The objective was to assess the relevance of identifying priority areas for connectivity for groups of species based on common dispersal abilities. We aimed to assess the impact of target groups choices on predicted priority areas. Method: The study was located at the Thau Lagoon territory to demonstrate the methodological approach. Ecological niche modelling was used to quantify species resistance and to identify suitable habitat patches. We coupled the least-cost path methodology with circuit theory to assess species connectivity. We classified connectivity from high to low levels and averaged the results by dispersal groups. Results: We found important differences in identified priority areas between groups with dissimilar dispersal abilities, with little overlap between highly connected areas. We identified a gap between the level of protection of low dispersal species and highly connected areas. We found mismatches between existing corridors and connectivity in low dispersal species, and a greater impact in areas of expected urban sprawl projects on favourably connected areas for species with high dispersal capabilities. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that a diversity of dispersal capacity ranges must be accounted for in order to identify ecological corridors in programmes that aim to restore habitat connectivity at territorial levels. Our findings are oriented to support the decisions of planning initiatives, at both local and regional scale. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Wetland and aquatic habitats
PY  - 1992
AB  - Ripariain wetland areas often represent critical corridors for animal and plant dispersion in wildland watersheds and downstream river systems. Integrated management of riparian wetland areas should be developed to reverse the loss of biological diversity. Agricultural and urban uses, and related water developments, have led to a marked decline of stream-side wetland habitats. Six major ways are discussed in which conventional agriculture alters wetlands and aquatic habitats: wetland drainage, water diversions, stream channelization, bank stabilization, grazing, and the release of agricultural pollutants. Aquaculture is discussed as a new force which affects the diversity of aquatic organisms. -from Authors

TI  - Shangri-La county ecological land use planning based on landscape security pattern
PY  - 2011
AB  - Landscape security pattern refers to the spatial pattern of potential in landscape, which can play a potential decisive impact and constitute a pattern of controlling the security landscape. Between the different security situations through the establishment of model, you can minimize the cost to achieve win-win results. Ecological land is defined as the ecosystem (land unit) and its spatial position that have important significance in safeguarding critical ecological processes and providing critical ecosystem services. To achieve the biodiversity conservation objectives, we constructed different levels landscape security pattern, and it can provided corresponding countermeasures for ecological land use planning in the research area. The research area of this paper is Shangri-La County that located in the northwest of Yunnan Province, longitude 99 ° 20′-100 ° 19′, latitude 26 ° 52′-28 ° 52′, and located in Yunnan, Sichuan and Tibet intersection of the triangular area, total area is 11,613 square kilometers. Due to many natural and historic and other reasons, social and economic development was slow. With the Shangri-La economic development, the emerging eco-tourism area, national park tourism development, and construction of large water conservancy projects,all of this become the driving forces for the change of the spatial pattern of urban landscape,such as a great quantity of the natural habitats disappear, landscape fragmentation increase, landscape accessibility reduce in the region. Obviously, Shangri-La's ecological security has become the bottleneck of sustainable development of the county already. Select five nature reserves and scenic spots as the \"source\" from the research area, at the same time, to achieve the biodiversity conservation objectives, choose and analysis the type of surface landscape, slope and the corresponding coefficient of these two factors. With spatial analysis tools of ArcGIS calculated and established two single-factor cumulative resistance surfaces. On this basis, it was constructed using the weighted superposition of two factors the minimum cumulative resistance surface. Then building the corridor among the \"source\" and the key strategic points, finally,the construction of landscape security patterns has been formed completely. Based on landscape security pattern analysis, in the ecological land planning, it will propose high, medium and low three different levels of safety, then the reference will provide for the ecological security strategy in the study area. In the study area, the ecological land use at low, medium and high security levels occupied 12. 82%, 44. 1% and 80. 3% of the total, respectively. The ecological land use at low security level that is reserved minimum land base line for hold natural ecosystem service function. Research shows,the analysis which is based on Shangri-La County's landscape security pattern will be the key ecological process when it's applied on ecological land planning. The methods possess reference value for to formulate urban planning and land planning. Furthermore, how to construct landscape security pattern is the mainly factor, especially in the traditional national culture protection, the research of cultural landscape security pattern is much more necessary. Simultaneously, farther study will also valuable that the comprehensive landscape security pattern's form has taken multiple natural and humanistic single factor into the ecological security pattern.

TI  - Promoting functional connectivity of anthropogenically-fragmented forest patches for multiple taxa across a critically endangered biome
PY  - 2019
AB  - Connectivity, the degree to which the landscape structure allows movement between resource and habitat patches, is vital for facilitating a wide range of ecological processes across transformed and anthropogenic landscapes. Connectivity is critical for dispersal of individuals from natal sites, colonisation of patches across a landscape by populations, the structuring of populations, and their persistence across metacommunities. Here, we present a replicable methodology for conservation and land-management practitioners to promote maximal functional connectivity for multiple taxa across a mixed land-use mosaic containing natural habitat patches. We used the maximal functional diversity present in three key taxa (trees, birds, and mammals) responsible for the persistence of forests and the provisioning of ecosystem function and services, in a mosaic landscape of natural, agricultural, and urban land-use practices to map probabilistic connectivity corridors. We used a hybrid of Circuit Theory, least-cost resistance pathways and pinch-points based on the traits and ecological parameters of a surrogate taxon to map functional connectivity across an anthropogenically-fragmented and critically endangered forest biome, the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest of South Africa. By using functional diversity measures, rather than taxonomic species richness, we ensured that maximal ecosystem services were safeguarded, concurrently achieving high-priority conservation goals of protecting specialist, endangered, and range-restricted species and traits that may otherwise be lost through high turnover of generalists at the expense of specialist species. Mapping circuit/least-cost corridors and critical pinch-points in remnant natural, yet unprotected forested patches, highlighted priority habitat to be conserved for promoting maximal functional connectivity, cognisant of the restricted budgets available for conservation planning and landscape-level protection. Our approach simultaneously protects ecosystem services, threatened specialist species and traits, and range-restricted and endangered habitats, linking current Protected Areas while prioritising landscape features of connectivity importance to be conserved for land-management practitioners with limited budgets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Past and predicted future effects of housing growth on open space conservation opportunity areas and habitat connectivity around National Wildlife Refuges
PY  - 2016
AB  - Housing growth can alter suitability of matrix habitats around protected areas, strongly affecting movements of organisms and, consequently, threatening connectivity of protected area networks. Our goal was to quantify distribution and growth of housing around the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System. This is important information for conservation planning, particularly given promotion of habitat connectivity as a climate change adaptation measure. We quantified housing growth from 1940 to 2000 and projected future growth to 2030 within three distances from refuges, identifying very low housing density open space, “opportunity areas” (contiguous areas with <6.17 houses/km2), both nationally and by USFWS administrative region. Additionally, we quantified number and area of habitat corridors within these opportunity areas in 2000. Our results indicated that the number and area of open space opportunity areas generally decreased with increasing distance from refuges and with the passage of time. Furthermore, total area in habitat corridors was much lower than in opportunity areas. In addition, the number of corridors sometimes exceeded number of opportunity areas as a result of habitat fragmentation, indicating corridors are likely vulnerable to land use change. Finally, regional differences were strong and indicated some refuges may have experienced so much housing growth already that they are effectively too isolated to adapt to climate change, while others may require extensive habitat restoration work. Wildlife refuges are increasingly isolated by residential housing development, potentially constraining the movement of wildlife and, therefore, their ability to adapt to a changing climate.

TI  - Landscape impacts on pollinator communities in temperate systems: evidence and knowledge gaps
PY  - 2017
AB  - This review assesses current knowledge about the interplay between landscape and pollinator communities. Our primary aim is to provide an evidence base, identify key gaps in knowledge and highlight initiatives that will help develop and improve strategies for pollinator conservation. Human-dominated landscapes (such as arable land and urban environments) can have detrimental impacts on pollinator communities but these negative effects can be ameliorated by proximity to semi-natural habitat and habitat corridors. There is also evidence to suggest that increased landscape heterogeneity and landscape configuration can play an important role in the maintenance of diverse pollinator communities. Landscape characteristics have direct impacts on pollinator communities, but can also influence abundance and richness through interaction with other drivers such as changing climate or increased chemical inputs in land management. The majority of existing literature focuses on specific hymenopteran groups, but there is a lack of information on the impact of landscape changes on non-bee taxa. Research is also needed on the effectiveness of management interventions for pollinators and multiple year observations are required for both urban and rural initiatives. Current policies and monitoring schemes could contribute data that will plug gaps in knowledge, thus enabling greater understanding of relationships between landscapes and pollinator populations. This would in turn help design mitigation and adaptation strategies for pollinator conservation. A lay summary is available for this article. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Using bird-habitat relationships to inform urban planning
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urbanisation is a rapidly growing phenomenon that is affecting global biodiversity, but the integration of conservation goals into urban planning can minimise ecological damage. Conservation planning for birds can be informed by knowledge of species-habitat relationships, but opportunities for studying these relationships before urbanisation occurs are rare. Our study took place in the Molonglo Valley, southeastern Australia, where approximately 30% of the area will be developed for new human settlement over the next 30 years. We surveyed 80 sites for birds and used multiple regression to explore the role that land use, vegetation cover and structure play on total species richness, woodland species richness and prevalence (proportion of total species), and also on the presence of 10 woodland species. We found that total species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodland. Woodland species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodlands, and when leaf litter was present. Woodland species prevalence was higher in river corridors and when leaf litter and eucalypt regeneration were present. Individual woodland species showed a range of responses to five main structural and compositional categories: (1) land use, (2) tree cover and composition, (3) eucalypt regeneration, (4) shrub cover, and (5) ground cover attributes. We use these data on bird-habitat relationships to develop five recommendations on: (1) eucalypt woodland, (2) high quality riparian areas, (3) scattered trees, (4) eucalypt regeneration, and (5) structurally complex habitats, to aid policy makers, planners and developers to integrate conservation for woodland birds into their urban planning. © 2010.

TI  - Modelling the benefits of farmland restoration: Methodology and application to butterfly movement
PY  - 2003
AB  - The overall quality of the landscape is important for conserving biodiversity. In a fragmented landscape, movement and dispersal capacity are important factors in determining which species are able to persist. To examine the role of landscape structure and pattern on movement, we developed a simple model to predict the \"least-cost\" pathway a species would take through an agricultural landscape matrix between habitat fragments by assigning friction values to different habitat types. Our model was validated by using empirical data on inter-patch movement for two butterfly species. As a measure of the ecological distance between habitat patches, the least-cost path model was a better predictor of butterfly movement than Euclidean distance. Ranking several hypothetical management scenarios, illustrated the potential of the model as a decision-support tool. Removal of all infrastructure from within arable fields would significantly reduce rates of inter-patch movement. However, if all boundaries between arable fields were restored to grassy banks this would significantly increase the connectivity between sub-populations. Planners widely recommend using corridors to connect fragments of remnant habitat despite relatively little empirical evidence to show that dispersal of individuals is enhanced by this practice. Our model showed that important aspects of species movement and, hence, survival can be expressed in models suitable for area planning and management. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Helminth communities of sigmonontine rodents in cocoa agroforestry systems in Brazil
PY  - 2020
AB  - Agroforestry is an alternative kind of land use where the native vegetation is surrounded or intercalated by crops of economic interest. This system may maintain species richness by promoting the habitat heterogeneity or serving as ecological corridors. The aim of this study was to describe the gastrointestinal helminth fauna and to analyse the parasitological parameters of the helminth communities of six sigmodontine rodents in a cocoa agroforestry system in the municipality of Ilhéus, state of Bahia, Northeast Brazil. This is a novel study of helminth fauna in this kind of agroforestry. Rodents were captured in live-traps and euthanised for helminth recovery. Specimens were counted and identified to the species level whenever possible. Helminth abundance, intensity, and prevalence were calculated for each species and each host. The total abundance and prevalence of helminths were compared among localities and three attributes of the host: species, gender and age using generalised linear models. Considering all rodents, 52.14% of them were parasitised with at least one helminth species. Eight nematode species were identified and another seven morphospecies were identified to the genus level. The most abundant species were Hassalstrongylus epsilon, Stilestrongylus eta, Guerrerostrongylus zetta, and Syphacia alata. The opportunistic host species Oligoryzomys nigripes and Akodon cursor, besides the water rat Nectomys squamipes, were the most infected species for helminth parasites. Hylaeamys seuanezi was also an important host with the highest helminth species richness. This is the first report of the helminth fauna for this host. The locality most distant from the native vegetation and closest to the city had the highest helminth prevalence and mean species richness. The species richness in the helminth communities of Euryoryzomys russatus, N. squamipes and O. nigripes in these Cabruca agroforestries were within the range found in studies carried out in Atlantic Forest areas. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - Empirical selection between least-cost and current-flow designs for establishing wildlife corridors in Gabon
PY  - 2019
AB  - Corridors are intended to increase species survival by abating landscape fragmentation resulting from the conversion of natural habitats into human-dominated matrices. Conservation scientists often rely on 1 type of corridor model, typically the least-cost model or current-flow model, to construct a linkage design, and their choice is not usually based on theory or empirical evidence. We developed a method to empirically confirm whether corridors produced by these 2 models are used by target species under current landscape conditions. We applied this method in the Gamba landscape between 2 national parks in southwestern Gabon. We collected signs of presence of African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and 2 apes, western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), on transects. We used patch-occupancy models to identify least-cost and current-flow corridors for these 4 species. On average, 28.7% of current-flow corridors overlapped with least-cost corridors, confirming that the choice of corridor model can affect the location of the resulting linkage design. We validated these corridors by monitoring signs and examining camera detections on new transects within and outside modeled corridors. Current-flow corridors performed better than least-cost corridors for elephants, whereas the opposite was found for buffalo and apes. Locations of the highest priority corridors for the 3 taxa did not overlap, and only 18.3% of their combined surface was common among 2 species. We used centrality metrics to calculate the average contribution of corridor pixels to landscape connectivity and derived an index that can be used to prioritize corridors.

TI  - Gap crossing decisions by forest songbirds during the post-fledging period
PY  - 1997
AB  - Gaps in forest cover, created by agriculture, forestry, and other anthropogenic activities, are assumed to impede the movements of many forest songbirds. Little is known, however, about the reluctance of different species of birds to cross habitat gaps. We studied this by inducing birds in the post-fledging period to cross gaps of varying widths and to choose between routes through woodland or across open areas by attracting them to a recording of mobbing calls by Chickadees (Parus atricapillus). In 278 experiments conducted in boreal forest and agricultural landscapes near Quebec city, 157 birds or flocks of birds of five species were attracted. Overall, birds were twice as likely to travel through 50 m of woodland than through 50 m in the open to reach the recording. When given a choice of traveling through woodland or across a gap, the majority of respondents preferred woodland routes, even when they were three times longer than shortcuts in the open. However, species differed greatly in their response to gaps. Our results show that woodland links significantly facilitate movements of birds across fragmented landscapes.

TI  - A historical outline of the development of the Warsaw stretch of the Vistula valley and corridor
PY  - 2000
AB  - Offering an abundance of both drinking water and fauna, the primaeval Vistula played a major role in attracting nomadic tribes to the area. It also provided them with an important line of settlement and communications. By the early Middle Ages, the main zone of the development of settlement had become the left bank of the Vistula. Construction relatively close to the river's edge was favoured by its character (with widelyspread water in the Valley and consequent limited seasonal variations in level). However, large-scale deforestation and an increase in the quantity and unevenness of atmospheric precipitation resulted in an ever-faster runoff of water into the river as the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries came and went. The result was more and more frequent flooding and hence regular change in the course of the main current. Forest- Or scrub-covered river islets separated from the original shoreline were created. The importance of the Vistula as a communications artery increased from the 15th century onwards, though the partitioning of the country several centuries later led to a regression of the economic use made of it. It was therefore only in the 1820s that the river was cleaned and banks built to prevent or protect against flooding. A system of pipelines and sewerage was installed in Warsaw in the late 19th century. The inter-War period saw only limited regulatory work, mainly deepening of the channel and further construction of floodbanks. The first mechanised dredging along the Warsaw-Modlin section came as late as in 1923, and the immediate aftermath of the War saw work confined to the renovation essential in the wake of all the devastation. The Vistula corridor became a dumping ground for rubble from the ruined city and this had a major effect in the shaping of the left bank, as well as the between-floodbanks area. A post-War plan for the regulation of the Vistula envisaged the obtainment of a three-element river cross-section: 225 m for the width of the corridor at mean annual levels of flow, 400 m for the width between banks and 1000 m for the optimal placement of floodbanks. Further regulatory work around Warsaw began as recently as in 1962, and it was to take many years for the entire section between the confluence points with the Pilica and Narew to gain floodbanks on both sides. Today, the left-bank part of Warsaw city centre is fully furnished with parkland, promenades and cycle tracks, while right-bank regulation involving stone fascines has allowed the small flood terrace to become overgrown with scrub and trees. This ensures the continuity of the ecological corridor that is the Vistula Valley. In the light of the above we anticipate: The maintenance of the existing regulatory structures and limitations on further work within the river corridor; appropriate shaping of the green space within the between-floodbanks area; and management of the land in line with proposals from specialists in nature conservation, landscape architecture and plant and animal ecology. Equally, we acknowledge the need for section regulation of the river to the extent necessary for the elimination of ice-jams. In establishing principles for the management and maintenance of the between-floodbanks area account should be taken of its three basic functions: The throughput of high water levels and consequent safeguarding against flooding, the role played as an ecological corridor of considerable natural value and the importance to those making economic and recreational use of the river.

TI  - Increasing the conservation value of powerline corridors for wild bees through vegetation management: an experimental approach
PY  - 2018
AB  - Mounting evidence suggests declines in the abundance and diversity of wild bees. Increasing habitat that provides forage and nesting sites could boost struggling populations, particularly in urban, suburban and agricultural landscapes. The millions of acres beneath aerial electric transmission lines, sometimes referred to as easements or rights-of-way, must be kept free of tall-growing vegetation and hence have the potential to provide suitable habitat for many native species. Prior work has demonstrated that bee communities in easements managed using alternatives to episodic mowing were more diverse than in nearby open areas, however true control sites within the easements were unavailable. In order to compare vegetation management protocols, we conducted a two-year study which enabled us to directly compare transmission line easements in three locations currently undergoing Integrated Vegetation Management—a dynamic form of management involving spot removal and herbicide treatment of unwanted species (treatment) with nearby sites undergoing standard management protocols of yearly or biyearly mowing (control). Results show that treatment sites had significantly higher abundance and species richness than controls. Seasonal differences were pronounced, with the spring fauna most affected by differences in vegetation management. In addition, the older treatment sites house more social bees, more parasitic species and a more even distribution of bees across nesting guilds. Finally, we established that treatment sites had distinct bee communities, further increasing their value as sources for native bee populations in the landscape. Overall, the data clearly show the value of implementing alternative active vegetation management in the land under powerlines to achieve an increase in the abundance and diversity of wild bees.

TI  - The function of a set-aside railway bridge in connecting urban habitats for animals: A case study
PY  - 2020
AB  - As elements of green infrastructure, railway embankments are important corridors in urban environments connecting otherwise isolated habitat fragments. They are interrupted when railways cross major roads. It is not known whether dispersing animals use railway bridges to cross roads. We examined the function of a set-aside iron-steel railway bridge crossing a 12 m wide road with high traffic density in Basel (Switzerland) for dispersing animals. We installed drift fences with traps on a single-track, 32 m long and 6 m wide railway bridge with a simple gravel bed, and collected animals daily for 9 months. We captured more than 1200 animals crossing the bridge: small mammals, reptiles and amphibians as well as numerous invertebrates including snails, woodlice, spiders, harvestmen, millipedes, carabids, rove beetles and ants. For some animals it is likely that the gravel bed, at least temporarily, serves as a habitat. Many animals, however, were apparently dispersing, using the bridge to cross the busy road. We found season-and daytime-dependent differences in the frequency the bridge was used. Our findings indicate an important function of a set-aside railway bridges for connecting urban habitats. As most animal dispersal was recorded during the night, railway bridges with no (or little) traffic during the night may also contribute to animal dispersal. As important elements of green infrastructure, set-aside railway bridges should be considered in future urban planning. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Comparison of Least-cost Path and UNICOR Cumulative Resistant Kernel Analyses in Mapping Ecological Connectivity Networks in Luohe Region, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - One of the greatest challenges China faces is how to conserve biodiversity during intensive urban and rural development. Ecological connectivity network modelling is a planning strategy that is increasingly used to achieve habitat and biodiversity conservation goals. Often, researchers have not given enough attention to the comparison of different methods for designing and mapping ecological connectivity networks in Chinese cities. In this study, we used least-cost path and UNICOR cumulative resistant kernel analyses to simulate the ecological connectivity network across the Luohe Region of China, and used the results to prioritize ecological connectivity network linkages and core areas. Our analysis produced three main results: (1) Least-cost paths passed through all the core areas because they did not consider species’ dispersal limits. (2) Species with dispersal abilities ≤ 2 km, conversely, were predicted by resistant kernel analysis to have highly fragmented functional connectivity networks in the Luohe region, while species with dispersal abilities between 4 km and 8 km were predicted to have moderate levels of functional connectivity, and species with dispersal abilities ≥ 16 km showed high connectivity across most of the study area. (3) We identified the areas of highest functional connectivity by intersecting >75th percentile of every resistant kernel surface. This identified an area in the Yan-cheng district as the zone of most complete and strong connectivity. The intersection of least-cost paths with the 2 km threshold scenario of factorial least-cost paths was the first protection priority, the intersection of least-cost paths with the 8 km threshold scenario of factorial least-cost paths was the second protection priority, 8 km threshold scenario of factorial least-cost paths without core areas was the third protection priority. Our comparison of methods in mapping ecological connectivity networks is generic and can be performed in any cities with landscape configuration and species information. © 2022, VDE VERLAG GMBH.

TI  - Modeling driving forces of avian diversity in a spatial configuration surrounded by farm ponds
PY  - 2016
AB  - Farm ponds provide a home for birds and numerous species of aquatic animals in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Urbanization and development of infrastructure resulted in the gradual disappearance of these ponds. Currently, only 3800 ponds originally approximately 15.4 % remain, and 84.6 % of the surface area of the ponds has vanished. Aiming to protect avian diversity, this study used logistic regression analysis and the geostatistical approach to analyze the relationship between avian diversity and landscape structure, in an effort to elucidate the spatial driving force of avian diversity. We detected that regression-kriging (RK) was even more accurate than logistic regression (LR). In addition, the value of diversity (H′) measures may decrease instead of increase when evenness (J′) is increased. The results of this study also indicated that an exceedingly strong relationship existed among avian diversity and landscape scale, agricultural landscape indices, and pond landscape indices. The models predict that preservation of large areas of waterscapes and paddy landscapes result in greater diversity of avian species. Spatial estimation of the research area indicated that human activity substantially affected avian ecology, leading to reductions in avian diversity. Thus, the reduction of the area of ecological corridors due to urban development is expected to further reduce avian diversity in the Taoyuan region. Our approach can be used to effectively analyze the correlations between characteristics of ecosystems and the environmental landscape, to ensure that pondscapes can be appropriately maintained and ecological reserves designated to prevent further decline in avian diversity.

TI  - The royal sites and their importance in the conservation of the soil
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Royal Sites have been studied and analysed from many points of view and there is an extensive bibliography regarding their historic, artistic and touristic heritage. However, their importance in the conservation of the environment, namely the conservation of soils and ecological corridors allowing the movement of animals and maintenance of biodiversity, has hardly been studied. Their high levels of protection, both as patrimony of the State and as ecological areas, have helped to preserve these natural landscapes even in areas close to big cities. In this paper we will analyse the importance that the Royal Sites, located in the northwest of the Autonomous Community of Madrid and in areas nearby in the Province of Segovia, have had in the conservation of the soils. © 2020, Universia.

TI  - Patterns in urban butterflies and spontaneous plants across a University campus in Japan
PY  - 2018
AB  - University campuses often contain contiguous areas of urban green space (UGS) which are otherwise scarce in large cities and, thus, may provide critical habitat for numerous species. In this study, we evaluate butterfly and plant diversity at Chiba University in Japan from five UGS types, including intensive green roofs, meadows, roadsides, open spaces, and community gardens. Surveying non-destructively every two weeks from June to November 2010, we identified 707 individual butterflies to 25 species from five families, including red-listed species (e.g. Parantica sita Kollar, 1844). However, one species, Pseudozizeeria maha Kollar, 1848, represented over 50% of all individuals surveyed. Butterflies in the family Papilionidae showed strong preference for roadside habitat, indicating the importance of 'butterfly flyways' and contiguous habitat corridors on University campuses. Butterfly richness and abundance was significantly different between UGS types and highest in the community garden and roadsides. We recorded 70 garden plant species and 117 spontaneous plant species (which grew opportunistically, without design input), of which 58% were native. Total plant richness was positively correlated with butterfly species richness, and non-native spontaneous plant species richness was positively correlated with butterfly richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness. Additionally, 76% of the spontaneous species identified were determined to be used by butterflies as larval hosts or for adult feeding. Identification of spontaneous plant species and use of selective weeding should be included in landscape management planning on campuses to promote butterflies, which can act as ambassadors for biodiversity conservation and help connect people to nature. © 2018 BioOne.

TI  - Social interaction among urban residents in greenspaces of New Township, Malaysia
PY  - 2011
AB  - Malaysia is currently developing into an urbanized country. Malaysian's severe loss and degradation of urban greenspace could adversely affect ecosystems as well as human social pattern. The aim of this paper is to discover the greenspace characteristics that contribute to the factors affecting level of social interaction among new township residents in Malaysia. This would reveal the unique characteristic of each greenspace eventually promotes or hinders social cohesion among new township residents. A raft of articles from various disciplines of urban and landscape planning, green infrastructure, human behavior and psychology, and ecological corridor engineering were reviewed to give an insight on what social interaction offers to human well-being, why do human need to socialize to gain wellness and how ecological setting influence the social-bonding quality. Result of the review suggests that social interaction is a mode that brings people together in community, particularly in the context of multi-cultural community. Mingling in subspaces of the greenspace permits relationship between users through spontaneous conversation. The park characters that afford the social interaction are diversity of subspaces, vegetation and animal populations, landforms and water bodies. Therefore, in planning of urban greenspace, it is necessary to interweave the boundary of a neighborhood with another to form a continuous community network. © International Postgraduate Conference on Infrastructure and Environment, IPC 2011.All right reserved.

TI  - Ecological corridors also operate in an urban matrix: A test case with garden shrews
PY  - 2013
AB  - The fragmentation of landscapes, induced by the growing urbanisation, is a major cause of biodiversity loss. Ecological corridors are landscape elements that make up for the negative effects of habitat fragmentation in agricultural or natural landscapes. However, their effectiveness have been rarely assess in an urban context. To do so, we analysed shrews in woodlots, corridors and domestic gardens that are connected or disconnected from a corridor. Indeed, these mammals are very sensitive to fragmentation and could play an important ecological role even in small and isolated areas such as domestic gardens. Ninety-seven shrews, from three species were trapped. In our study, Sorex coronatus, Sorex minutus and Crocidura russula were not widely distributed and mainly occurred in woodlots, corridors and connected gardens. In gardens, shrew occurrences were mainly determined by landscape configuration with negative effects of the distance to the corridor and the distance to the woodlot, stronger for C.russula than Sorex species. At the local scale, garden management and vegetation showed a positive effect mainly for Sorex species. The quality of gardens seems good enough to permit the co-occurrence of several species of shrews and thus competition was not identified as a major process for determining the occurrence. We showed that, as in other ecosystems, ecological corridors in urban context can play an effective role for the distribution of organisms with low dispersal capabilities and should be develop in planning strategies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Insights into identifying habitat hot spots and migratory corridors of green turtles in the South China region
PY  - 2018
AB  - Sea turtles are globally endangered, and face daily anthropogenic threats, such as direct take, by-catch, and habitat degradation. Current research efforts on sea turtles in the South China region mainly focus on captivity and husbandry, haematology and blood chemistry, and nesting ecology. Published information on the marine habitat use of wild populations is limited. This situation therefore creates a pressing need for scientific research on free-ranging sea turtles as a foundation for habitat management and species protection in South China. In this study, habitat use and oceanic movement of nesting, and by-catch or stranded green turtles, were determined by satellite tracking combined with home-range analysis. Coupled with previous findings, the foraging grounds of several sea turtle species (green turtle Chelonia mydas, hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata and loggerhead Caretta caretta) were mainly distributed along the coasts of Hainan Island Province and Guangdong Province, mainland China, as well as Taiwan and the Philippines, and the outlying islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Habitat hot spots and migratory corridors of green turtles, in particular nesting turtles in South China, were identified. Coastal waters near Wanning City of Hainan Island, the eastern Leizhou Peninsula, Iriomote-jima and Ishigaki-shima of the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, and Dao Bach Long Vi of Vietnam serve as foraging grounds for nesting green turtles from different origins in South China. Moreover, the Paracel (Xisha) and the Pratas (Dongsha) Islands in the South China Sea, Huidong Gangkou, and its vicinity in mainland China, and Liouciou Island and Penghu Island of Taiwan contain both nesting sites and foraging grounds for green turtles. The sites that are associated with migratory corridors, in particular Hainan Island, eastern Leizhou Peninsula, and Liouciou Island, which currently lack conservation plans for sea turtles, should be given higher priority for habitat and species protection. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Effects of town planning in the protection of natura 2000: Andalusia, Castile-La Mancha, Extremadura and Madrid
PY  - 2016
AB  - The objective of this article is to evaluate the reality of the integration of the organizational policies of the territory and the protection of nature areas in Andalusia, Castile-La Mancha, Extremadura and Madrid. The work is based on the quantification of the city limits which do not have their planning adapted in order to prevent the possible occupation of their protected areas, and specifically those of Natura 2000. This situation occurs in a high percentage of municipalities of Castile-La Mancha, Extremadura and Madrid, and may entail an infringement of the EU Directives in this regard. The effective protection of the ground through its adequate classification would entail greater legal security both for the administrations and for possible investors, besides guaranteeing effective protection of the natural habitats and the wild flora and fauna.. The Priority Spanish Action Framework brings together the possibility of financing the measures required to ensure the correct management of Natura 2000. Among these measures are included the integration of the conservation objectives in town planning, opening up a possible financing channel for the revision of the planning instruments or the drafting of territorial organisation plans at regional or sub-regional level, which would make it possible to rectify this situation. © 2016, Ministerio de Fomento.

TI  - Ecological connectivity in the three-dimensional urban green volume using waveform airborne lidar
PY  - 2017
AB  - The movements of organisms and the resultant flows of ecosystem services are strongly shaped by landscape connectivity. Studies of urban ecosystems have relied on two-dimensional (2D) measures of greenspace structure to calculate connectivity. It is now possible to explore three-dimensional (3D) connectivity in urban vegetation using waveform lidar technology that measures the full 3D structure of the canopy. Making use of this technology, here we evaluate urban greenspace 3D connectivity, taking into account the full vertical stratification of the vegetation. Using three towns in southern England, UK, all with varying greenspace structures, we describe and compare the structural and functional connectivity using both traditional 2D greenspace models and waveform lidar-generated vegetation strata (namely, grass, shrubs and trees). Measures of connectivity derived from 3D greenspace are lower than those derived from 2D models, as the latter assumes that all vertical vegetation strata are connected, which is rarely true. Fragmented landscapes that have more complex 3D vegetation showed greater functional connectivity and we found highest 2D to 3D functional connectivity biases for short dispersal capacities of organisms (6 m to 16 m). These findings are particularly pertinent in urban systems where the distribution of greenspace is critical for delivery of ecosystem services. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Green space: A new tool of public health policy?
PY  - 2015
AB  - In France, green spaces are currently the easiest way to approach the issues of nature in the city. To consider the relation between urban planning and public health, which was the topic of the November 2014 SFSE symposium, we began by performing a systematic review of the literature in 2009, for Plante et Cité. Next we asked city-dwellers about this topic directly. Between 2009 and 2013, we questioned a sample of 428 people during 23 participative workshops as part of 7 urban planning projects intended to draft local urban plans (PLU) and prepare urban development. We asked them about their uses of green spaces and examined the representations of the environment that underlie these practices. Our findings showed the diversity of the social expectations of nature as well as the level of societal acceptability of the link between urban planning and public health. In conclusion, the cross-reading of these two sources leads us to suggest a framework for designing a tool to provide public decision-making support. Operationally, we think this research-action should be integrated into the current French urban planning structure (PLU, PLUi, SCOT), within which fit the key concepts of green and blue belts and ecological corridors. We propose the elaboration of a \"Plan for Health, Mobility, and the Environment\" for urban and rural municipalities, based on global greening. Copyright © 2015 John Libbey Eurotext.

TI  - Circuit theory emphasizes the importance of edge-crossing decisions in dispersal-scale movements of a forest passerine
PY  - 2014
AB  - Measuring landscape connectivity in ways that reflect an animal’s propensity or reluctance to move across a given landscape is key for planning effective conservation strategies. Resistance distance, based on circuit theory, is one such measure relevant for modeling how broad-scale animal movements over long time periods may lead to gene flow across the landscape. Despite the success of circuit theory in landscape genetic studies, its applicability to model finer-scale processes such as the movement patterns of individual animals within their breeding grounds (e.g., while prospecting for territories) has yet to be tested. Here, we applied both circuit models and least-cost models to understand the relationship between landscape connectivity and return time of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) that had been translocated at least 20 km from their home territory near Quebec City, Canada. Using an iterative optimization process, we derived resistance values for three cover types (forest, edge, and open) that resulted in resistance distance values that best explained Ovenbird return times. We also identified the cover-type resistance values that yielded length of least-cost path estimates that best explained return times of the translocated birds. The circuit theory and least-cost path methods were equally supported by the data despite being based on different sets of resistance values. The optimal resistance values for calculating resistance distance indicated that for Ovenbirds, traversing a given distance of edge habitat presented a substantially greater resistance than that of open areas. On the other hand, optimized resistances of edge and open were very similar for calculating length of least-cost path. The circuit theory approach suggested that for an Ovenbird moving through fragmented habitat, the number of forest-open transitions (i.e., edge-crossings) that an individual must make is critical to understanding return times after translocation. The least-cost path approach, on the other hand, suggested that the birds strongly avoid all open areas, regardless of size. Circuit theory offers an important new approach for understanding landscapes from the perspective of individuals moving within their breeding range, at finer spatial scales and shorter time scales than have been previously considered.

TI  - A GIS methodology for assessing ecological connectivity: Application to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area
PY  - 2005
AB  - We developed a new methodology for the assessment of landscape and ecological connectivity at regional scale. This method has been entirely formalized using mathematical language, is supported by a topological analysis of a 1:25,000 scale land use map, and has been developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The method allows the elaboration of a diagnose of the connectivity of terrestrial landscape ecosystems, on the basis of a previously defined set of ecological functional areas, and a computational cost-distance model which includes the barrier effect. This last component takes into consideration the type of barrier, the distance impact, and the adjacent land use and vegetation type. We defined two new compound indices: one for ecological connectivity and another for the barrier effect. The practical interest of our model is that it not only allows a cost-effective assessment of the current situation, but it has predictive capabilities, allowing the quantitative assessment and comparison of the impacts resulting from different planning scenarios or different infrastructure alternatives on the landscape and ecological connectivity. The application of this model to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA), 16% of which is currently classified as urban, showed that 65% of the BMA area is currently occupied by functional ecological areas, and that 18% is covered by artificial barriers, although they have a direct negative impact on 56.5% of the area. The model also allowed the identification of vulnerable spots, including 1.7% of the BMA that has a critical importance for ecological connectivity, as well as the network of landscape linkages and ecological corridors that offer a high restoration potential. Further applications of this methodology assessing the impacts of regional and urban plans on ecological connectivity, suggest than it could easily be extrapolated to other regions. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Do landscape factors affect brownfield carabid assemblages?
PY  - 2006
AB  - The carabid fauna of 28 derelict sites in the West Midlands (England) were sampled over the course of one growing season (April-October, 1999). The study aimed to investigate the relationship between carabid assemblages and five measures of landscape structure pertinent to derelict habitat. At each site measurements of landscape features pertinent to derelict habitat were made: (i) the proximity of habitat corridors; (ii) the density of surrounding derelict land; (iii) the distance between the site and the rural fringe; and (iv) the size of the site. Concurrent surveys of the soil characteristics, vegetation type, and land use history were conducted. The data were analysed using a combination of ordination (DCA, RDA), variance partitioning (using pRDA) and binary linear regression. The results suggest that:1.There is very little evidence that the carabid assemblages of derelict sites were affected by landscape structure, with assemblages instead being principally related to within-site habitat variables, such as site age (since last disturbance), substrate type and vegetation community.2.No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that sites away from railway corridors are more impoverished in their carabid fauna than sites on corridors.3.There are some suggestions from this study that rarer and non-flying specialist species may be affected by isolation, taking longer to reach sites. We infer from this that older sites with retarded succession, and sites in higher densities of surrounding derelict land may eventually become more species rich and that these sites may be important for maintaining populations of rarer and flightless species.4.Conservation efforts to maintain populations of these species should focus principally on habitat quality issues, such as maintaining early successional habitats that have a diversity of seed producing annuals and perennial plants and enhancing substrate variability rather than landscape issues. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Communicating clearly about conservation corridors
PY  - 2001
AB  - Conflicting definitions lead to confusion when people communicate about 'corridors', particularly when they come from different disciplinary backgrounds. Usage of 'corridor' in game management, island biogeography, and metapopulation literature focused on function, namely, the movement of flora and fauna from one area to another. A structural usage of the term arose in the field of landscape ecology as it developed in North America with the matrix-patch-corridor paradigm of landscape structure. 'Corridor' is now used to describe both the structural and functional aspects of linear landscape features, often implicitly, in a wide range of disciplinary literature. Lack of a clear and consistent terminology leads to confusion about the goals Or implied functions of corridors. Consequently, the manner in which corridors should be designed, managed, and evaluated is also unclear. Proper design and management of a corridor depends critically on a clear and explicit statement of its intended functions. If corridors are not designed to perform well-defined functions, the outcome may be disappointing, or even deleterious. The roles Corridors play derive from six ecological functions: habitat, conduit, filter, barrier, source, and sink. These ecological functions have been recognized widely and adopted by a number of disciplines, including conservation biology, wildlife management, landscape ecology, and landscape planning. We review briefly the history of the term 'corridor' in the context of conservation, catalog some of its definitions and uses, review the functions of corridors, and differentiate between the structural and functional aspects of corridors. We reject the notion of defining 'corridor' succinctly, because of the complex and multiple functions a corridor may serve. Instead, we suggest that conservationists and planners consider and document explicitly all of the possible functions of corridors when designing them. Addressing explicitly these functions when designing a corridor should eliminate much of the confusion surrounding their roles, and focus attention on establishing design criteria for corridors that function as intended. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Green roofs and greenwalls for biodiversity conservation: A contribution to urban connectivity?
PY  - 2018
AB  - Green roofs and walls have recently emerged as conservation tools, and they offer promising additional opportunities to enhance biodiversity in cities. However, their ecological conditions remain poorly considered when planning wildlife corridors. To discuss the role of vegetated buildings in landscape connectivity, we reviewed the ecological and technical specificities of green walls and green roofs in light of the key factors concerning urban wildlife (patch size, quality, abundance, and isolation). Green roofs and walls show limited patch sizes, distinct habitat quality at the building scale, and limited redundancy of patch quality within the landscape. We also highlight that the abundance of roof and wall patches is often low. Future research is needed to establish if walls can be vertical corridors for wildlife, thereby reducing the isolation of green roofs. We argue that creating 3D ecological connectivity within the city requires substantial modifications of the design and maintenance of existing green building systems. We suggest that research is needed to integrate the biotic and abiotic characteristics of green buildings to make them more closely resemble those of open green spaces. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Human-elephant conflict in Xishuangbanna Prefecture, China: Distribution, diffusion, and mitigation
PY  - 2018
AB  - The conflict between humans and wild animals is a special type of phenomena between human development and wild animal conservation, not only leading to massive economic loss to local residents, but also imposing severe impacts upon the production and living activities and even personal safety of the residents. Human-elephant conflict has existed as a phenomenon of human settlement development for more than 20 years in Xishuangbanna, China. There are periodic incidents of wild elephants hurting/killing people as well as feeding on and destroying subsistence and cash crops. It is an increasingly urgent and important issue for China to resolve while protecting and managing Asian elephants. Our study employed an Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis model to perform a risk assessment of areas where the Asian elephant currently is distributed and to predict future risks. It employed a Circuit Theory model based on random walk theory to predict multiple potential movement or migration pathways of Asian elephants within Xishuangbanna. The results indicated that: (1) the regions with human-elephant conflict risk in Xishuangbanna Prefecture had an area of about 4349.08 km2, accounting for 22.77% of the total prefecture area, with the risk regions primarily present in the middle and north parts of Menghai County and Jinghong City and in Mengla County in which there was a wide geographical distribution covering from the south to the north; (2) The regions of agriculture and garden that were close to Asian elephant distribution and roads were likely occurring risk; (3) There were more potential movement paths of elephants within Mengyang and Menghai distribution regions, which indicated that the connection of these areas was better. While the potential movement paths of elephants within Mengla and Shangyong were little; (4) There were some potential movement paths between different distribution areas of Asian elephant, but the migration possibility of elephants in different distribution areas was decreasing due to natural barriers (Mengyang-Menghai has Lancang river) and discontinuous potential paths between Mengla and Shangyong. Additionally, we discussed that created ecological corridors between different natural reserves to allow more dispersal and gene flow of elephants and diminish conflict between human and elephant. We also put forward compensation suggestions in different risk area. We hope our analytical methods can be applied, improved and expanded to other areas with similar wildlife damage. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - The use of bushland, corridors, and linear remnants by birds in southeastern Queensland, Australia
PY  - 1997
AB  - Within the southeastern region of Queensland, Australia, native forest cover (bushland) has been greatly reduced and fragmented, and clearing is still occurring. Many of the region's bird species are being increasingly restricted to isolated habitat remnants. However, little is known about the habitat value of these remnants and whether their value is influenced by their degree of connection. We investigated bird use of riparian corridors in pastoral and urban surroundings and riparian linear remnants within an urban context. We compared the avifauna of these remnants with dryland and riparian sites within continuous bushland. We also assessed their use by previously derived response-guilds of birds to bushland clearing. We counted 3567 individuals of 102 bird species. Riparian bushland supported more species and had greater bird abundances than dryland bushland. Corridors and linear remnants supported densities of many bushland-dependent species similar to those in bushland; this varied with species' patterns of large-scale migration and residency. Bushland-dependent winter migrants used both corridors and linear remnants extensively. Bushland-dependent residents were most abundant in continuous bushland and least abundant in linear remnants, possibly reflecting the constraints of central place foraging. Effects of isolation were only evident in resident bushland-dependent species. Local habitat variables were significantly associated with vacation in abundance of some types of birds within corridors and linear remnants; however, the differences in bird abundances attributable to spatial characteristics were greater than those attributable to habitat characteristics. The effects bushland fragmentation and isolation were mediated by the extent to which species are dependent upon bushland and their patterns of large-scale migration or residency. Local habitat, and possibly more importantly altitude, may influence site use by winter migrants and generalist species.

TI  - Corridors for large mammals in Slovakia -contribution to the establishment of trans-european wildlife networks
PY  - 2009
AB  - Many of the large terrestrial mammals have vast home ranges. When migrating between suitable core habitats their movements encompass several square kilometres, without stops at national boundaries. For their long-term survival the populations need the genetic exchange between sub-populations. Therefore migration and movement over longer distances is essential, and the permeability of the landscape is a basic requirement. Urban structures like settlements and transport infrastructure are blocking the natural mobility of terrestrial species. This effect is augmented by growing traffic on roads and railways and by the corresponding expansion of transport infrastructure. The animals have increasing problems to cross the traffic lines and are at a high risk to be killed. High traffic volumes even prevent them from crossing the roads and tracks, and then they are cut off from their core populations. In Slovakia all large European mammals are presently still occurring in sufficiently large numbers of individuals, particularly predators such as the brown bear, the wolf and the lynx. Due to the accession of the country to the European Union in 2004 and the consequent traffic increase the country is pressed to develop its traffic infrastructure. This development might cause the fragmentation and isolation of habitats throughout the country. The project \"Wildlife Corridors in Slovakia as a Contribution to the Creation of Trans-European Wildlife Networks (TEWN)\" identifies critical sections of the existing and planned road network in Slovakia. On this basis it shows options to improve security for both wildlife and people by identifying wildlife migration routes as well as necessary overpasses and underpasses in the road system. The paper describes the methodology of the project and presents solutions how to avoid accidents.

TI  - Managing landscape connectivity for a fragmented area using spatial analysis model at town scale
PY  - 2009
AB  - Urban growth has great effect on land uses of its suburbs. The habitat loss and fragmentation in those areas are a main threat to conservation of biodiversity. Enhancing landscape functional connectivity is usually an effective way to maintain high biodiversity level in disturbed area. Taking a small town in Beijing as an example, we designed potential landscape corridors based on identification of landscape element quality and \"least-cost\" path analysis. We described a general approach to establish the corridor network in such fragmented area at town scale. The results showed that landscape elements position has various effects on landscape suitability. Small forest patches and other green lands such as meadow, shrub, even farmland could be a potential stepping-stone or corridor for animal movements. Also, the analysis reveals that critical areas should be managed to facilitate the movement of dispersers among habitat patches. © 2009 SPIE.

TI  - Selection of distance thresholds of urban forest landscape connectivity in Shenyang City
PY  - 2010
AB  - By using the QuickBird remote sensing image interpretation data of urban forests in Shenyang City in 2006, and with the help of geographical information system, this paper analyzed the landscape patches of the urban forests in the area inside the third ring-road of Shenyang. Based on the habitat availability and the dispersal potential of animal and plant species, 8 distance thresholds (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 m) were selected to compute the integral index of connectivity, probability of connectivity, and important value of the landscape patches, and the computed values were used for analyzing and screening the distance thresholds of urban forest landscape connectivity in the City. The results showed that the appropriate distance thresholds of the urban forest landscape connectivity in Shenyang City in 2006 ranged from 100 to 400 m, with 200 m being most appropriate. It was suggested that the distance thresholds should be increased or decreased according to the perfomiability of urban forest landscape connectivity and the different demands for landscape levels.

TI  - How can wastelands promote biodiversity in cities? A review
PY  - 2014
AB  - Urbanisation leads to natural habitats being fragmented with various effects according to the species and their ecological characteristics. Paradoxically, the urbanisation process creates relatively unused environments, wastelands, habitats which could contribute to biodiversity conservation in urban regions. In this review we examined the role of wastelands in maintaining biodiversity in the city and assessed the different factors responsible for wasteland biodiversity. 37 articles were suitable for our aim. Most of the studies have been conducted in large cities in Western and Central Europe. A wasteland is defined as an abandoned site with spontaneous vegetation (i.e. wild grown vegetation). In most cases, wastelands harbour more species than other urban green spaces. The processes which affect the biodiversity of wastelands operate on two different levels. Locally, the area size, age, soil, microclimate and the vegetation structure are the dominant factors. As in other environments, the species richness increases with the size of the wasteland. Wastelands of different ages include different stages of vegetation, ranging from pioneer to pre-forest stages, and consequently harbour different communities of plants and animals. The diversity of anthropogenic soil substrates leads to different plant communities. At the landscape scale, matrix composition and geographic connectivity between wastelands influence the biodiversity of wastelands, although to a lesser extent than the local features. We show that wastelands have a real potential to contribute to biodiversity conservation in urban regions. At the city scale, they represent habitats which urban planners need to take into account and include in dynamic urban planning. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Classification of urban forest fragments based on landscape metrics
PY  - 2019
AB  - The urbanization in Campinas, Sao Paulo state, and the surrounding region had occurred in a fast and intensive way, causing big changes in the landscape and resulting in an expressive devastation of the forest areas and its natural vegetation cover. This circumstance had given rise to the forest fragmentation process. Therefore, mapping these fragments and evaluating them according to some environmental indicators is very important because it allows to evaluate the basin conditions and to identify the priority areas for the implementation of recovery and management actions. Thus, this work presents a classification of the forest fragments identified in ‘Ribeirao Anhumas’ watershed, Campinas, SP state, using as indicators the following landscape metrics: size, nuclear area and circularity index. Therefore, a Group Analysis was carried out using the statistical software XSTAT, as a way to identify the similarities between the fragments, considering the aforementioned indicators, and grouping them into classes. A correlation between them has also been developed in order to identify possible relationships of interdependence. It was found that this river basin is highly urbanized, where there are fewer fragments with smaller sizes and in most cases isolated. Although the fragments were generally classified as good, there is a considerable aggravating factor for the environmental quality of these fragments: the nuclear area index was quite low, about 25%, this implies that much of the area covered by fragments is subject to edge effects. Furthermore, through the cluster analyses the fragments had been grouped into three classes, where the size had been one of the most determinant factor. It was also identified the sub-basin of the low course as the less urbanized region, with larger fragments and greater potential for the implementation of management and recovery actions on the forest fragments, such as ecological corridors.

TI  - Avian ecological diversity as an indicator of urban forest functionality. Results from two case studies in northern and southern Italy
PY  - 2009
AB  - Greenspaces and forest trees contribute to a number of environmental functions in urban environments, such as the survival of urban-dwelling species (e.g., bird species). This paper analyzes the relationship between greenspace characteristics (structural and spatial attributes) and the diversity of avian ecology species. This provides research findings coming from two studies conducted in Italy. Using point-count method, a quantification was done of the abundance and diversity of bird species in a number of greenspaces having different structural attributes (e.g., vegetation type, tree height) and spatial characteristics (e.g., location, connectivity). Results showed positive correlations between greenspaces with a more diverse and mature forest vegetation and the number of specimens and species observed in the two studies. A positive correlation appeared also between distance to the city centre and richness and abundance of bird species. Finally, we discuss some of the main implications for enhancing the functional attributes of greenspaces by using avian ecological indicators to inform ecologically sound urban planning and design.

TI  - Eco-estates: Diversity hotspots or isolated developments? Connectivity of eco-estates in the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Population expansion and land transformation reduce biodiversity, potentially reducing environmental functionality. These effects are evident globally, and specifically in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, where land cover is being transformed for urbanisation. However, much of the urbanised areas incorporate differing levels of urban greening, which is improving local species and functional diversity. In recent years, a new form of urban greening in the form of eco-estate development has increased, which improves biodiversity and functional diversity. However, it has not yet been determined whether these eco-estates are connected to one another and the surrounding natural landscapes, allowing for natural species’ colonisation, immigration and dispersal. In this study, we assessed whether eco-estates along the coast of KZN were ecologically connected to a) one another, and b) the surrounding natural landscape. Using a hybrid Least-cost Pathway/Ecological Circuit Theory approach, we modelled habitat suitability and dispersal requirements of a forest-specialised bird species in an effort to provide future development and management plans for eco-estates. Connectivity throughout coastal KZN was evident, with increased connectivity in areas of natural and urban indigenous forest and coastal thicket/dense bush and river systems (riparian zones), within which existing eco-estates were subsequently developed. Eco-estates were well connected to one another and surrounding natural landscapes, emphasising their importance as patches containing endangered indigenous forest and unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush and of increased species and functional diversity, improving local ecosystem functioning. We recommend that eco-estate development primarily focus on areas which have previously been transformed, to increase natural land cover. The intention to preserve, rehabilitate, and conserve natural land cover is fundamentally important if development is to take place within and surrounding areas of high connectivity to assist in increasing and conserving suitable habitats, improving functionality and connectivity in KZN, and assisting in offsetting the deleterious effects of future climate change.

TI  - Movement of feeder-using songbirds: The influence of urban features
PY  - 2016
AB  - Private gardens provide vital opportunities for people to interact with nature. The most popular form of interaction is through garden bird feeding. Understanding how landscape features and seasons determine patterns of movement of feeder-using songbirds is key to maximising the well-being benefits they provide. To determine these patterns we established three networks of automated data loggers along a gradient of greenspace fragmentation. Over a 12-month period we tracked 452 tagged blue tits Cyantistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major moving between feeder pairs 9,848 times, to address two questions: (i) Do urban features within different forms, and season, influence structural (presence-absence of connections between feeders by birds) and functional (frequency of these connections) connectivity? (ii) Are there general patterns of structural and functional connectivity across forms? Vegetation cover increased connectivity in all three networks, whereas the presence of road gaps negatively affected functional but not structural connectivity. Across networks structural connectivity was lowest in the summer when birds maintain breeding territories, however patterns of functional connectivity appeared to vary with habitat fragmentation. Using empirical data this study shows how key urban features and season influence movement of feeder-using songbirds, and we provide evidence that this is related to greenspace fragmentation. © The Author(s) 2016.

TI  - The influence of patch area and connectivity on avian communities in urban revegetation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Landscape restoration through revegetation is being increasingly used in the conservation management of degraded landscapes. To effectively plan restoration programs information is required on how the landscape context of revegetation influences biodiversity gains. Here, we investigate the relative influence of patch area and connectivity on bird species richness and abundance within urban revegetation patches in Brisbane, Australia. We carried out bird surveys at 20 revegetation sites, and used hierarchical partitioning and model selection to test the relative importance of patch area (the area of revegetation including all directly connected remnant vegetation) and landscape connectivity (the vegetated area connected by less than 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m cleared gaps). We controlled for a number of possible confounding variables within the hierarchical partitioning procedure. Both the hierarchical partitioning and model selection procedures indicated that connectivity had an important influence on bird species richness. Patch area in combination with connectivity were important influencing factors on overall bird abundance. We also carried out the hierarchical partitioning procedure for bird abundance data within a range of feeding guilds, yielding results specific to species groups. Overall our data suggest that greater connectivity enhances the habitat area that colonists can arrive from (resulting in greater species richness), whereas increased patch area allows for increased abundance by expanding the habitat available to species already present in a patch. A combined approach where connectivity and overall habitat area is enhanced across the landscape is likely to be necessary to meet long-term conservation objectives. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Impacts of roads on woodland landscape connectivity: A case study of Gongyi city, Henan province
PY  - 2014
AB  - Landscape connectivity, defined as the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes the movement of organisms or ecological processes among patches, has been widely recognized as one of the key objectives in studies of forest landscape management, ecological conservation and construction. The dispersal ability of organisms across changing landscapes is critical for long-term biodiversity conservation, and successful dispersal of organisms always depends on the landscape connectivity. The landscape fragmentation caused by roads has significant effects on the landscape pattern and ecological processes, such as the migration of species and biodiversity maintenance in different ecosystems of landscape. This paper aims to analyse the road impact on forest landscape connectivity in mountain area of Gongyi City, Henan Province, China. The landscape connectivity is evaluated based on a graph-theory framework, in which a graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally. Both the graph structure and the habitat availability metrics provide significant improvements for analyzing landscape connectivity and decision making in conservation planning of different ecosystems or landscapes. The geographic data sets for the study area, such as DEM, landuse, soil, vegetation and hydrology, were collected and managed in GIS. Two connectivity indicators, the probability index of connectivity (PC) and the importance value (Percentage of the variation in PC, dPCk), were calculated. Considering the dispersal distances for different organisms, we examined the variation of landscape connectivity of the woodland in the low and middle mountainous areas according to five distance thresholds: 0.5 km, 1 km, 2.5 km, 5 km, and 10 km. The importance values of the woodland patches were calculated in the scenarios with roads and without roads in different dispersal distances. In addition, the impact of roads on the landscape connectivity of five selected woodland patches was elucidated in detail. The results shows that: (1) the woodland landscape PC values tend to increase with the distance thresholds from 0.5 km to 10 km, in both scenarios of with roads or without roads; (2) there are few patches with larger area, and in the “very high” and “high” categories of contribution to woodland landscape connectivity; (3) the dPCk values of woodland landscape patches gradually decrease with the segmentation of roads, especially for some small patches. We conclude that the roads have important effects on the forest connectivity in the study area. The landscape indexes (such as distance threshold, node position of forest patch and forest area) and the topographical factors (elevation and slope) should be comprehensively considered when analyzing the relationships between roads and forest connectivity. Moreover, the case study also proves that the analysis of landscape connectivity could and should be used as a criterion for selecting important patches in woodland restoration planning. The analytical methods used in this paper are relatively easy to implement, and thus have application potentials in ecological restoration management and landscape planning. © 2014, Science Press.

TI  - A framework to identify priority wetland habitats and movement corridors for urban amphibian conservation
PY  - 2022
AB  - Cities worldwide are expanding in area and human population, posing multiple challenges to amphibian populations, including habitat loss from removal of wetlands and terrestrial upland habitat, habitat fragmentation due to roads and the built environment, and habitat degradation from pollutants, extensive human use and introduced species. We developed an eight-step urban amphibian conservation framework based on established monitoring, analytical methods and community engagement to enable amphibian conservation in a large urban centre. The framework outlines a process used to conserve biodiversity in a complex landuse and decision-making environment supported by a series of successive complementary modelling techniques to measure amphibian presence, priority habitat and functional connectivity. We applied the framework in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to illustrate its potential. Here, urbanization has reduced wetlands by 90% and ecological knowledge on amphibians was poor. We improved knowledge on amphibian diversity and distribution, identified core wetlands and movement pathways for amphibian species and identified barriers in the wetland network where construction or restoration measures could re-establish amphibians or increase their densities. This knowledge was shared with ecologists and city planners for implementation through appropriate policies and plans. Our framework provides a series of stepwise products to improve an urban municipality's ability to restore or conserve priority habitat and movement pathways necessary for amphibian survival under pressure from multiple land uses. The framework provides a platform to identify city plans, policy and or programmes and to derive necessary information to support amphibian conservation. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Response of bats and nocturnal insects to urban green areas in Europe
PY  - 2021
AB  - Animal biodiversity in cities is generally expected to be uniformly reduced, but recent studies show that this is modulated by the composition and configuration of Urban Green Areas (UGAs). UGAs represent a heterogeneous network of vegetated spaces in urban settings that have repeatedly shown to support a significant part of native diurnal animal biodiversity. However, nocturnal taxa have so far been understudied, constraining our understanding of the role of UGAs on maintaining ecological connectivity and enhancing overall biodiversity. We present a well-replicated multi-city study on the factors driving bat and nocturnal insect biodiversity in three European cities. To achieve this, we sampled bats with ultrasound recorders and flying insects with light traps during the summer of 2018. Results showed a greater abundance and diversity of bats and nocturnal insects in the city of Zurich, followed by Antwerp and Paris. We identified artificial lighting in the UGA to lower bat diversity by probably filtering out light-sensitive species. We also found a negative correlation between both bat activity and diversity and insect abundance, suggesting a top-down control. An in-depth analysis of the Zurich data revealed divergent responses of the nocturnal fauna to landscape variables, while pointing out a bottom-up control of insect diversity on bats. Thus, to effectively preserve biodiversity in urban environments, UGAs management decisions should take into account the combined ecological needs of bats and nocturnal insects and consider the specific spatial topology of UGAs in each city. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Complex effects of fragmentation on remnant woodland plant communities of a rapidly urbanizing biodiversity hotspot
PY  - 2014
AB  - In many cities worldwide, urbanization is leading to the rapid and extensive fragmentation of native vegetation into small and scattered urban remnants. We investigated the effects of fragmentation on plant species richness and abundance in 30 remnant Banksia woodlands in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, located in the southwestern Australian global biodiversity hotspot. We considered a comprehensive set of factors characterizing landscape fragmentation dynamics (current and historical remnant area and connectivity, time since isolation, and trajectories of landscape change), disturbance regimes (fire frequency, grazing, and intensity of human activities), and local environmental conditions (soil nutrient status and litter depth). We used generalized linear mixed models to determine the interactive effects of time since remnant isolation and remnant area on plant species richness, and structural equation models to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of landscape and local factors on plant species richness and abundance. Fragmentation impacts were most rapid in smaller remnants. Indeed, in the small remnants, native plant species richness was halved in only a few decades after isolation, suggesting an underlying rapid loss of habitat quality. We found that richness and abundance of woody species were higher in historically large remnants and lower in the rural areas, despite these rural remnants showing greater connectivity. Richness of native herbaceous species declined with time since isolation, mainly in the smaller remnants, and this was associated with altered soil properties. Furthermore, increased litter depth (possibly indicating higher productivity) and increased abundance of nonnative herbaceous species in the older and smaller remnants was associated with a decline in the abundance of native herbaceous species. Our study suggests that in rapidly expanding cities, landscape fragmentation can have major and complex effects on remnant vegetation. Yet these impacts might take several decades to manifest themselves. Hence, understanding the long-term conservation capacity of newly formed remnants, which is key to setting conservation priorities, requires consideration of landscape fragmentation and land use history. Moreover, the smaller and older remnants may already display changes due to fragmentation, providing clues for urban planning and ecosystem management that help to protect urban remnant plant diversity. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Identifying Potential Connectivity for an Urban Population of Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) in a Canadian Park System
PY  - 2020
AB  - In the face of ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, maintaining an adequate level of landscape connectivity is needed to both encourage dispersal between habitat patches and to reduce the extinction risk of fragmented wildlife populations. In a developing region of southwestern Ontario, Canada, a declining population of Eastern Massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) persists in fragmented remnants of tallgrass prairie in an urban park system. The goal of this study was to identify potential connectivity pathways between habitat patches for this species by using a GIS least-cost permeability swath model, and to evaluate the outputs with snake road mortality data. Results identified seven pathways between five core habitat blocks, a subset of which were validated with aerial imagery and mortality data. Four high-ranking pathways intersected roads through or near road mortality hotspots. This research will guide conservation interventions aimed at recovering endangered reptiles in a globally rare ecosystem, and will inform the use of permeability swaths for the identification of locations most suitable for connectivity interventions in dynamic, urbanizing landscapes. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Multiscale effects of habitat and surrounding matrices on waterbird diversity in the Yangtze River Floodplain
PY  - 2021
AB  - Context: With the expansion in urbanization, understanding how biodiversity responds to the altered landscape becomes a major concern. Most studies focus on habitat effects on biodiversity, yet much less attention has been paid to surrounding landscape matrices and their joint effects. Objective: We investigated how habitat and landscape matrices affect waterbird diversity across scales in the Yangtze River Floodplain, a typical area with high biodiversity and severe human-wildlife conflict. Methods: The compositional and structural features of the landscape were calculated at fine and coarse scales. The ordinary least squares regression model was adopted, following a test showing no significant spatial autocorrelation in the spatial lag and spatial error models, to estimate the relationship between landscape metrics and waterbird diversity. Results: Well-connected grassland and shrub surrounded by isolated and regular-shaped developed area maintained higher waterbird diversity at fine scales. Regular-shaped developed area and cropland, irregular-shaped forest, and aggregated distribution of wetland and shrub positively affected waterbird diversity at coarse scales. Conclusions: Habitat and landscape matrices jointly affected waterbird diversity. Regular-shaped developed area facilitated higher waterbird diversity and showed the most pronounced effect at coarse scales. The conservation efforts should not only focus on habitat quality and capacity, but also habitat connectivity and complexity when formulating development plans. We suggest planners minimize the expansion of the developed area into critical habitats and leave buffers to maintain habitat connectivity and shape complexity to reduce the disturbance to birds. Our findings provide important insights and practical measures to protect biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Remnant vegetation provides genetic connectivity for a critical weight range mammal in a rapidly urbanising landscape
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most pervasive agents of contemporary landscape change globally. Rapid land use change and competing land uses pose multiple challenges for biodiversity conservation, particularly in peri-urban fringe areas where suburban development encroaches into natural habitats. The quenda (Isoodon fusciventer) is one of the very few ground-dwelling critical weight range mammals to persist in the peri-urban fringe of the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We investigated the genetic connectivity of 42 populations of quenda across the Greater Perth metropolitan region using microsatellites and generalised dissimilarity modelling to evaluate the impact of landscape elements on functional connectivity. Spatially-explicit Bayesian cluster analysis indicated quenda exhibit significant population structure across the Perth region, which, at the broadest scale, was associated with hydrological and topographical features. Inter-population genetic connectivity was facilitated by the presence of native vegetation, particularly low vegetation (<1.4 m height) that is the species’ preferred habitat. Surprisingly, measures of urbanisation were not significant predictors of gene flow, potentially as quenda show some characteristics of urban utilizers. Given the rapid pace of development in the region, knowledge on the distribution and population structure of quenda, and understanding the processes that contribute to them, provides a basis for a landscape conservation approach to urban planning. Retention of suitable habitat that facilitates persistence of this important mammal is critical. © 2019

TI  - Urban vegetation and songbird nesting guilds: Relationships and implications for conservation and management
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban environments are heavily anthropogenic and often species depauperate. Many bird species, however, persist in cities, facilitated in part by the vegetated habitats cities provide. Urban vegetation management is likely to be key to bird conservation in cities, but supporting such conservation requires a more complete understanding of the relationships between urban birds and different aspects of urban vegetation than we currently possess. We sought to identify relationships between the species richness and abundance of songbird nesting guilds and attributes of urban vegetation to help build this understanding. We used guild richness and abundance and urban vegetation data compiled via point-count and urban-forest surveys in the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City corridor of Iowa, USA to construct binomial N-mixture models. We used our models to evaluate relationships between the abundance and richness of native songbird nesting guilds and different attributes of urban forests and understory vegetation. Relationships between nesting guilds and urban vegetation differed among guilds, although relationships with some attributes of urban vegetation (e.g., impervious and lawn cover) were more similar. Our models indicate that some characteristics of urban vegetation (e.g., tree height, evergreen trees, standing dead trees) are related to the richness or abundance of only one guild, while others (e.g., low vegetation) are important predictors for multiple guilds, but with different relationships. These findings suggest that some attributes such as lawn and impervious cover could be managed city-wide to support conservation, but few vegetation management approaches could be applied uniformly across cities to support species in all nesting guilds. These results thus indicate that urban conservation in the study area and beyond is likely to require vegetation management that is targeted to specific settings within cities and to the requirements of different groups of species that occur within those settings to support a diversity of bird species. © 2021

TI  - Habitat effect on vegetation ecology and occurrence on urban masonry walls
PY  - 2010
AB  - Cities contain a diverse range of habitats that support plant establishment and persistence. This study focuses on a particular vertical artificial habitat: masonry retaining walls in Hong Kong. We explored the diversity and co-existence of different plant growth forms, synoptic assessment of habitat conditions, and relationship between habitat factors and vegetation occurrence. Some 270 walls with notable plant colonization in old districts were studied. We surveyed intrinsic wall fabric, extrinsic site condition, tree species and abundance, and other types of plant cover. The data were evaluated with the help of principal component and multiple regression analyses. A wide assemblage of species and growth forms have established spontaneously on walls. The tree flora is dominated by Moraceae (Mulberry family) members, genus Ficus (figs or banyans), and particularly Ficus microcarpa. Trees with strangler characteristics pre-adapted to grow on the vertical habitat are strongly favoured, followed by ruderals and garden escapees. Natives outnumber exotics by a large margin. Multiple wall attributes could be condensed into four factors, classified as water-nutrient supply, habitat connectivity, structure-maintenance, and habitat size. The action of habitat factors on vegetation occurrence hinges on plant growth form and dimension. The occurrence of diminutive lichen-moss is related to the fundamental sustenance water-nutrient factor. The bigger mature trees are more dependent on the larger-scale habitat size factor. The medium-sized plants, including herbs, shrubs and tree seedlings, are contingent upon the dual influence of water-nutrient and habitat connectivity. Spatial contiguity with natural ecosystem can secure continual supplies of seeds, water, nutrient, genial microclimate, and clean air to foster wall vegetation growth. The conservation of walls and their companion flora could avoid degrading or reducing these critical enabling factors. The urban ecological heritage deserves to be protected from unnecessary, misinformed and harmful impacts. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - The history and future directions of greenways in Japanese New Towns
PY  - 2006
AB  - A number of societal changes such as an ageing population and a lack of economic prosperity mean that Japanese greenway planners will be faced with a number of new challenges in the coming decades. These societal changes will be particularly dramatic in the Japanese New Towns, which were constructed in the late 1950s. Some of these New Towns marked a departure for Japanese planning by including a network of greenways, which were planned to provide pleasant corridors for pedestrians and bikers. Around 30 years have passed since these areas were developed; today the greenways in these New Towns have become corridors with dense and rich greenery. Such matured greenways, which were supposed to provide an amenity for local residents, have increasingly come to be regarded as a cause of fear of crime. To try and mitigate this, trees and shrubs along the greenways are now closely trimmed or even removed. However, such mature vegetation along the greenways may be regarded as a feature that maintains the history of the town. Such vegetation is also expected to provide ecological corridors that accommodate wildlife species which were abundant in the rural areas surrounding these New Towns. Within the context of proposing an optimum management scheme for Japanese greenways, the following study aims to explain and discuss how the fear of crime on greenways can be prevented whilst maintaining their ecological and historical functions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Combining the preferences of residents for neighborhood green spaces and conservation of avian diversity: Case study from Beijing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Cities in China support higher human population densities compared to those in western countries; consequently, the high pressure placed on cultural ecosystem services (CES) provision of residential green spaces might hinder overall human wellbeing and the maintenance of avian diversity. Thus, this study aimed to identify how to meet the main preferences of citizens for residential green spaces while simultaneously enhancing bird diversity in city neighborhoods, generating a win-win scenario for human needs and biodiversity. This study was implemented using 568 questionnaires for residents and GLMM for bird-environment statistical analyses. Residents in Beijing preferred higher levels of bird species richness than individual abundance in neighborhoods. Residential green space appeared to serve as the movement corridor for some rare species, indicating the importance of promoting the presence of migrant bird guilds, which is currently incidental. The cultivation of fruit-bearing shrubby plants was supported by most city residents, and would also promote the presence of migratory birds in green spaces. In contrast, while increasing the width of residential green spaces would benefit migratory birds, it had less public support. This multi-disciplinary study clearly demonstrated that both the quality of life of humans in cities and biodiversity conservation could be efficiently incorporated in green space plans, even under highly urbanized circumstances. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Evidence of genetic connectivity between fragmented pig populations in a tropical Urban City-State
PY  - 2019
AB  - Forest fragmentation as a result of urbanisation can adversely affect gene flow between wildlife populations. Although gene flow among fragmented populations has been investigated for many species, there has been little research into the effects of urbanisation on gene flow in large mammals. Singapore is a small, densely urbanised tropical city-state where more than 99% of its original forest has been cleared. The wild pig is currently the largest native terrestrial mammal in Singapore and has important roles in maintaining plant diversity and seed dispersal. Pigs are widespread and present in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR) as well as other forest patches in Singapore. Due to the extent of urbanisation, it is unclear if genetic connectivity exists between the CCNR and other forest fragments. In this study, genome libraries from 48 samples of pig blood were collected from two sites: 1) the CCNR and 2) forest fragments in the northeast of Singapore. Genome-wide SNP loci were used to understand the population genomics of the two pig populations. The results indicated that the pig populations formed two distinct genetic clusters that did not align with the respective sites. Both sites included individuals with signatures from both genetic clusters, although with different frequencies. This suggests that pigs can move across heavily urbanised landscapes. Future studies should involve long term collaring studies to identify specific corridors used by the pigs for dispersal, and a larger population genomic assessment to understand pig dispersal and gene flow to and from forest patches other than the CCNR and the Northeast. © National University of Singapore.

TI  - Effects of habitat fragmentation and black-tailed prairie dogs on urban avian diversity
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urbanization and habitat fragmentation have the potential to influence bird communities. In addition, these phenomena, as well as ongoing lethal control measures, have also greatly reduced the range of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) since the beginning of the 20th century. Although prairie dogs are highly interactive species that can influence avian communities, few studies have investigated whether these interactions persist in urban settings. Our goal was to investigate the relative impacts of habitat fragmentation and prairie dogs on bird communities within an urban matrix. We performed bird surveys on 20 habitat fragments (10 colonized by prairie dogs, 10 uncolonized by prairie dogs) distributed throughout the Denver metropolitan area, and calculated Shannon-Weiner diversity and richness of all birds and native species, as well as total counts of grassland birds and raptors. Diversity, richness, and counts of many species increased with increasing fragment connectivity, and decreased on fragments isolated for longer periods of time. Avian diversity and richness did not differ between fragments with and without prairie dogs, suggesting that this element of the ecological role of prairie dogs is not fully retained in urban habitat. Future studies of the role of prairie dogs as keystone species in urban systems should include other taxa as well as consider the influence of the urban matrix surrounding prairie dog habitat. Our results emphasize that conservation of urban avian diversity should focus on landscape connectivity as well as local habitat features. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Perceived species-richness in urban green spaces: Cues, accuracy and well-being impacts
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Evidence that urban green-space promotes health and well-being of urban residents is increasing. The role of biodiversity is unclear: perceived biodiversity may be important, but how accurately it is perceived and the factors influencing this accuracy are poorly understood. We use experimental perennial urban meadows in southern England to investigate the impact of creating biodiverse habitats on green-space users’ i) physical and mental health, psychological well-being, ii) factors moderating health and well-being outcomes (site satisfaction and nature connectedness), and iii) perceived biodiversity. We explore whether ‘nature dose’ (time spent at a site) influences these relationships. We then assess whether green-space users can estimate botanical diversity accurately across meadow treatments differing in plant species richness and vegetation structure, and determine the environmental cues and personal characteristics associated with these estimates. Sites with experimental meadows did not increase respondents’ perceptions of site level biodiversity, their self-rated physical and mental health or psychological well-being relative to control sites lacking meadows. However, there were significant associations between perceived site level biodiversity per se, and site satisfaction and feeling connected to nature. Moreover, we observed a positive association between nature dose and self-estimated mental health. We found that actual and perceived botanical richness in individual meadow plots were strongly positively correlated. Perceived richness was positively associated with vegetation height, evenness, and colourfulness suggesting that these are cues for estimating species richness. The accuracy of estimates varied, but respondents with higher levels of eco-centricity were more accurate than people who were less connected to nature.

TI  - Urbanization is associated to a loss of phylogenetic diversity of birds in a medium size city on the Andes of Colombia, South America
PY  - 2021
AB  - Accelerated rates of urbanization negatively impact natural habitats and biodiversity. Studies of the effects of urbanization on fauna have emphasized taxonomic diversity, but this does not necessarily reflect effects on the evolutionary history of assemblages. Here, we study how urbanization influences phylogenetic diversity (PD) of bird assemblages in a small–medium city in the Central Andes of Colombia. Between 2016 and 2017, we performed bird surveys in 76 urban cells and 23 rural cells around the city. Then, we measured habitat characteristics (e.g. anthropogenic noise level, impervious and forested area) in sampled cells. PD of birds was between 1.37–1.42 MY higher in the rural than in the urban habitat. Within the urban habitat, the PD of birds reduces as impervious area and noise levels increase, while in the urban cells with most forested areas reach the highest PD values. Most of these differences and relationships disappear when we performed similar analysis controlling for differences in species richness. A low turnover of PD between assemblages of birds recorded inside Armenia and its less urbanized surroundings suggest green areas in the study area could mitigate the effects of urbanization in native fauna, and ameliorate connectivity between urban cells. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Planning and Design Considerations for Birds and Butterflies´ Diversity of Small Urban Parks: A Case of Petaling Jaya, Malaysia
PY  - 2020
AB  - While most previous research has been conducted in large urban parks, the potential of small parks as urban habitats remains largely unexplored, particularly in tropical regions. The purpose of this paper is to provide landscape architects, planners, park managers and municipalities with recommendations for planning, design and management with the aim to enhance small urban parks’ biodiversity. Physical characteristics, vegetation and human factors are the important features that were highlighted using empirical data from nine small urban parks in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia sized between 0.5-3.5 hectares. Birds and butterflies are used as ecological indicators because they are relatively easy to identify and show clear responses to environmental change. Pearson’s correlations and multiple regressions, followed by an analysis of the Akaike’s Information Criterion were conducted to study the relationships between the measured variables, and to identify which of the variables have a significant effect on bird and butterfly species richness and abundance. The results demonstrate that the percentage of canopy cover, park size and native vegetation are the best predictors of bird species richness and abundance. Meanwhile, the butterfly species richness and abundance can be best predicted by the percentage of canopy cover, shrub species and native vegetation. Based on these results and the identification of key features for bird and butterfly richness and abundance, nine recommendations are provided to improve biodiversity of small urban parks: (1) set minimum areas for a small urban park; 2) inclusion of water elements to support a wider range of species; (3) the application of internal patch-corridor-matrix features; (4) attention to the aspect of cleanliness and appearance of small parks; (5) the proportion of open and shaded areas; (6) the planting composition of trees, palms and shrubs should be designed not only with aesthetic functions, but also for biodiversity; (7) the vertical and horizontal layers of vegetation structures; (8) providing natural buffers for wildlife protection; and (9) creating unmanaged patches in sunny areas by using wildflowers. © 2020.

TI  - Construction technology of amphibian habitat and the evaluation of its effectiveness
PY  - 2018
AB  - Drastic decline and extinction of amphibian species occurred around the world. Human-induced habitat loss and degradation are major threats to amphibians. Repairing or rebuilding amphibian habitat is an important way for amphibian restoration. During the process of urbanization, the construction of appropriate habitats is the key measure for amphibian conservation. In this study, construction technique and assessment of the reform amphibian habitat was carried out. To match the habitat requirements of five common amphibian species in Shanghai, Luhui seedling base in Pujiang Town (Minhang District, Shanghai, China) was selected as an experimental site from May 2014 to September 2016. We used ecological engineering measures that could provide amphibian habitat, such as changing topographic, adjusting water systems, vegetation restoration, and so on. To explore how these new technologies benefited amphibians' biodiversity, five sampling lines (100 m × 5 m) were selected and amphibians were monitored during the breeding period (May-June) and non-breeding period (August-September), once in each period in 2014 and 2016. A total of four species were recorded with a density of (164.0±63.7) ind•hm-2 in the breeding period in 2014, and four species with a density of (160.0±29.7) ind•hm-2 in the non-breeding period in 2014, whereas five species with a density of (560.0±159.3) ind•hm-2 in the breeding period in 2016, and five species with a density of (628.0±186.2) ind•hm-2 in the non-breeding period in 2016. Our results suggested that this technology could significantly increase amphibians' biodiversity in the degraded amphibian habitat, which might be applied in other similar habitats in China. © 2018, Science Press.

TI  - Avian species richness and numbers in the built environment: Can new housing developments be good for birds?
PY  - 2006
AB  - Bird species richness (S) and numbers (N) were studied in the breeding season in housing developments of different ages in a small English town and compared with village sites, urban green corridors and adjacent arable farmland. S and N were highest in village and green corridor sites. S in urban plots ranged from 13 to 18 species, similar to farmland, but N was much lower in farmland. Marked differences in the number of individual species between plots were recorded. S and N were independent of age of development and area of gardens within plots but both were correlated with the area of greenspace. Greenspace alone and combined with gardens was correlated with the numbers of several individual species. The results are discussed in relation to proposed new large-scale housing developments in England. © 2006 Springer.

TI  - Natural and anthropogenic landscape factors shape functional connectivity of an ecological specialist in urban Southern California
PY  - 2022
AB  - Identifying how natural (i.e., unaltered by human activity) and anthropogenic landscape variables influence contemporary functional connectivity in terrestrial organisms can elucidate the genetic consequences of environmental change. We examine population genetic structure and functional connectivity among populations of a declining species, the Blainville's horned lizard (Phrynosoma blainvillii), in the urbanized landscape of the Greater Los Angeles Area in Southern California, USA. Using single nucleotide polymorphism data, we assessed genetic structure among populations occurring at the interface of two abutting evolutionary lineages, and at a fine scale among habitat fragments within the heavily urbanized area. Based on the ecology of P. blainvillii, we predicted which environmental variables influence population structure and gene flow and used gravity models to distinguish among hypotheses to best explain population connectivity. Our results show evidence of admixture between two evolutionary lineages and strong population genetic structure across small habitat fragments. We also show that topography, microclimate, and soil and vegetation types are important predictors of functional connectivity, and that anthropogenic disturbance, including recent fire history and urban development, are key factors impacting contemporary population dynamics. Examining how natural and anthropogenic sources of landscape variation affect contemporary population genetics is critical to understanding how to best manage sensitive species in a rapidly changing landscape. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Green streets as habitat for biodiversity
PY  - 2018
AB  - Reflections Green streets incorporate multiple elements with the potential to offer a diverse range of habitats to greatly increase urban biodiversity. Habitat types include trees, wetlands and pools, and vegetated areas; these can be incorporated into a relatively small area and offer a potential habitat to microbes, invertebrates, herpetiles, mammals, and birds including some of our rare or protected species. Biodiversity value of a green street increases with the inclusion of wildflowers and materials of local provenance and incorporation of diverse microhabitats (such as varied ground topography, planting, and water availability). Due to the linear connected nature of green streets they offer potential to facilitate movement of species within the green street itself and even across landscapes when incorporated into a network with other green streets or green infrastructure. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Bee species recorded between 1992 and 2017 from green roofs in Asia, Europe, and North America, with key characteristics and open research questions
PY  - 2018
AB  - Green roofs, which have become mandatory on new flat-topped buildings in many cities, increase habitat connectivity for wildlife and have contributed to a boom in urban beekeeping. The ecological benefits or risks of green roofs for wild bees (bee species other than the domesticated honey bee, Apis mellifera), however, have not been comprehensively analyzed. We therefore reviewed studies on insects caught on green roofs in Asia, Europe, or North America between 1992 and early 2017 and extracted information on wild bees. The resulting species list includes 236 Apidae identified in 35 studies, with thermophilic species probably overrepresented because roofs provide warm and dry habitats. The percentage of cavity-nesting bees on roofs is higher than that on nearby ground, while the percentage of pollen specialists is lower. Data are almost completely lacking on the reproductive success of bees on green roofs, the effect of roof age on bee diversity, and the genetic or demographic benefits of increased habitat connectivity. Our list of the bee species so far reported on green roofs will help in the selection and implementation of suitable soils, nesting aids, and plantings. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - A landscape ecology assessment of land-use change on the Great Plains-Denver (CO, USA) metropolitan edge
PY  - 2018
AB  - For better or worse, in those parts of the world with a widespread farming, livestock rising, and urban expansion, the maintenance of species richness and ecosystem services cannot depend only upon protected natural sites. Can they rely on a network of cultural landscapes endowed with their own associated biodiversity? We analyze the effects of land-cover change on landscape ecological patterns and processes that sustain bird species richness associated to cropland-grassland landscapes in the Great Plains-Denver metropolitan edge. Our purpose is to assess the potential contribution to bird biodiversity maintenance of Great Plain’s cropland-grassland mosaics kept as farmland green belts in the edge of metropolitan areas. We present a quantitative landscape ecology assessment of land-cover changes (1930–2010) experienced in five Great Plains counties in Colorado. Several landscape metrics assess the diversity of land-cover patterns and their impact on ecological connectivity indices. These metrics are applied to historical land-cover maps and datasets drawn from aerial photos and satellite imagery. The results show that the cropland-grassland mosaics that link the metropolitan edge with the surrounding habitats sheltered in less human-disturbed areas provide a heterogeneous land matrix were a high bird species richness exists. They also suggest that keeping multifunctional farmland-grassland green belts near the edge of metropolitan areas may provide important ecosystem services, supplementing traditional conservation policies. Our maps and indicators can be used for selecting certain types of landscape patterns and priority areas on which biodiversity conservation efforts and land-use planning can concentrate.

TI  - The weekend effect on urban bat activity suggests fine scale human-induced bat movements
PY  - 2020
AB  - In the urban environment, wildlife faces novel human disturbances in unique temporal patterns. The weekend effect describes that human activities on weekends trigger changes in the environment and impact wildlife negatively. Reduced occurrence, altered behaviors, and/or reduced fitness have been found in birds, ungulates, and meso-carnivores due to the weekend effect. We aimed to investigate if urban bat activity would differ on weekends from weekdays. We analyzed year-round bat acoustic monitoring data collected from two sites near the city center and two sites in the residential area/park complex in the city periphery. We constructed generalized linear models and found that bat activity was significantly lower on weekends as compared to weekdays during spring and summer at the site in the open space near the city center. In contrast, during the same seasons, the sites in the city periphery showed increased bat activity on weekends. Hourly bat activity overnight suggested that bats might move from the city center to the periphery on weekends. We demonstrated the behavioral adaptability in urban wildlife for co-existing with human. We recommend that urban planning should implement practices such as adding new greenspaces and/or preserving old-growth vegetation to form continuous greenways from the city center to the city periphery as corridors to facilitate bat movements and reduce possible human-wildlife conflict. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Climate connectivity of the bobcat in the Great Lakes region
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River are imposing barriers for wildlife, and the additive effect of urban and agricultural development that dominates the lower Great Lakes region likely further reduces functional connectivity for many terrestrial species. As the climate warms, species will need to track climate across these barriers. It is important therefore to investigate land cover and bioclimatic hypotheses that may explain the northward expansion of species through the Great Lakes. We investigated the functional connectivity of a vagile generalist, the bobcat, as a representative generalist forest species common to the region. We genotyped tissue samples collected across the region at 14 microsatellite loci and compared different landscape hypotheses that might explain the observed gene flow or functional connectivity. We found that the Great Lakes and the additive influence of forest stands with either low or high canopy cover and deep lake-effect snow have disrupted gene flow, whereas intermediate forest cover has facilitated gene flow. Functional connectivity in southern Ontario is relatively low and was limited in part by the low amount of forest cover. Pathways across the Great Lakes were through the Niagara region and through the Lower Peninsula of Michigan over the Straits of Mackinac and the St. Marys River. These pathways are important routes for bobcat range expansion north of the Great Lakes and are also likely pathways that many other mobile habitat generalists must navigate to track the changing climate. The extent to which species can navigate these routes will be important for determining the future biodiversity of areas north of the Great Lakes. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Conservation of biodiversity in urban environments: Invertebrates on structurally enhanced road islands
PY  - 2002
AB  - Urbanization has resulted is severe alteration and destruction of natural habitats. Durban, South Africa, is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and the demand for land is increasing. The Durban Metropolitan Open Space System (D'MOSS) was created for both ecological and social enhancement through an integrated approach to urban open space establishment and management. We assessed a subsection of the D'MOSS for its contribution to biodiversity enhancement. Invertebrates were selected as indicators of diversity. Pitfall trapping was conducted on a seasonal basis on traffic islands from two landscaping management regimes: extensive mown areas (i.e. limited structural diversity) and the inclusion of indigenous and exotic shrubs, herbs and trees (i.e. structurally enhanced). The influence of adjacent remnant natural areas as a source for these islands was also assessed. Species-area and species-distance predictions based on island biogeography theory were tested to determine whether they apply at this small scale. In this study, urban traffic islands accommodated 232 invertebrate morphospecies, i.e. 71% of the estimated species richness for a larger sampling effort. A total of 23 881 individuals were sampled, 81% of which were a single species of ant and a collembolan. Species abundance followed expected seasonality (high in summer and low in winter) irrespective of island treatment. While enhanced islands supported a higher richness during spring, as well as a greater number of unique species overall, our results were not conclusive in their support of either the movement of invertebrates along corridors of semi-natural vegetation, or the value of larger areas of urban open space. The lack of independence between distance and area in this study, the limited scale over which diversity was measured, and the influence of multiple sources of emigration are discussed.

TI  - Analysis of the non-native flora of Ensenada, a fast growing city in northwestern Baja California
PY  - 2009
AB  - Urbanized areas show a high proportion of non-native plants and can work as dispersal points to the surrounding areas. Ensenada is a fast growing city located in the northwestern peninsula of Baja California (Mexico). It is the southern extreme of a binational, coastal urban corridor that extends from Los Angeles, California south to Ensenada. This corridor is part of the biodiversity hotspot of the California Floristic Province. The aim of this study was to analyze the composition and distribution of the spontaneous flora in the city of Ensenada. We systematically sampled two differentiated urban environments, vacant lots and arroyos, in 2006 and 2007. We found a total of 158 plant species, 61% of them were non-native species. Arroyo areas showed higher non-native species richness than vacant lots (21.9 vs. 13.6 species/transect) and could be potential dispersal vectors for non-native species to natural areas outside of the city, or in the reverse direction also. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.

TI  - Reducing management intensity and isolation as promising tools to enhance ground-dwelling arthropod diversity in urban grasslands
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urbanisation is a growing global phenomenon having multiple ecological consequences. However, the effects of urbanisation on biodiversity remain ambiguous, and some evidence exists that cities provide valuable secondary habitats for many species, possibly mitigating regional biodiversity loss. Therefore, the value of urban sites for biodiversity depends on local habitat conditions and the configuration of the surrounding landscape. We aimed to disentangle the effects of local habitat parameters (management, plant diversity) and urban matrix variables (urbanisation, isolation) on carabid beetle and spider diversity and traits in informal urban green spaces in Berlin, Germany. Habitat management and isolation were the most important influences on carabid beetle and spider species and trait compositions. Spider communities of irregular managed sites contained 2.5 times more species of conservation concern than extensive (regular) managed sites. Moreover, irregular managed sites contained larger species (both for carabid beetles and spiders) and affected the hunting mode of spiders. Isolated sites tended to have lower spider species richness and number of spider species of conservation concern. Moreover, isolated sites were characterised by small, mobile and herbivorous carabid beetles. In contrast, urbanisation and local plant diversity had no effect on carabid beetles and spiders. We conclude that urban grasslands within residential areas – even if not targeted for conservation plans – can provide important habitats for conserving biodiversity, including species of conservation concern. Reducing the intensity of habitat management and increasing the connectivity of urban grassland sites can promote diverse arthropod communities and should therefore be considered in urban planning.

TI  - Drivers of fish assemblage structures in a Neotropical urban watershed
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization results in major changes in stream morphology, hydrology, and water quality; the consequences on fish assemblage of Neotropical urban streams remain poorly understood. Due to the importance of better understanding fish assemblage responses towards urbanization in biodiversity hotspots, we evaluated the factors structuring the fish assemblages in a Neotropical medium-sized city. Additionally, we evaluated possible differences in fish diversity and biotic homogenization between the urban and control streams. To do so, fish were sampled along with physical habitat and water quality parameters in 16 urban streams in southern Brazil. Multiple regression and distance-based linear models (DistLM) were used to assess the importance of predictor variables in determining species richness and fish assemblage composition, respectively. The fish abundance rank curves were plotted to evaluate graphic differences in fish diversity between urban and control streams, while the relationship between distance and similarity (Bray-Curtis index) was used to evaluate biotic homogenization. The results revealed the importance of variables linking habitat diversity and basin connectivity to fish assemblage richness and structure. In addition, riparian vegetation was the main driver of fish assemblages, explaining 78% of abundance variation. We identified lower diversity and higher biotic homogenization in urban streams, with higher dominance of the non-native species Poecilia reticulata. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the physical and biotic variables of streams outside of water pollution levels alone. Finally, it is necessary to support urban planning practices that recover riparian vegetation, avoid canalization, and promote connectivity along stream networks as well as the removal of artificial structures in urban basins. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Biodiversity and ecosystem services in urban green infrastructure planning: A case study from the metropolitan area of Rome (Italy)
PY  - 2019
AB  - Target 2 of the European Biodiversity Strategy promotes the maintenance and enhancement of ecosystem services <(ES) as well as the restoration of at least 15% of degraded ecosystems by creating green infrastructure (GI). The purpose of the this research is to present a GI proposal that combines the delivery of regulating services with the restoration and ecological reconnection of urban forests and trees in a densely urbanised context. The project area covers about 3 000 ha in the urban sector of the metropolitan area of Rome and the GI components consist of 533 ha of areal green spaces and of more than 500 km of road verges. Planned interventions include forest restoration and tree plantations, with a varying service supply according to type and condition of the different components. Potential natural vegetation (PNV) models and dispersal potential of representative forest species, together with structural and functional vegetation models for the enhancement of air pollutants removal, guided the selection of the species to be promoted and of the planting pattern. Environmental benefits of the proposal include more than 30 ha of restored urban forests, about 15 000 planted individuals of native oaks, a sevenfold improvement in ecological connectivity and halved isolation between green spaces. On the other hand, the expected socio-economic benefits include almost 300 000 potential beneficiaries of the improved air quality and avoided costs for damages to human health that range between 40 700 and 130 200 EUR per year. Notwithstanding their preliminary character, these estimates allowed the proposal to highlight the relationship between GI and public health. Moreover, they showed the economic and social effectiveness of nature-based solutions in comparison with further development of grey infrastructure. These results promote the definition of a national GI strategy in Italy. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Spatiotemporal assessment and trade-offs of multiple ecosystem services based on land use changes in Zengcheng, China
PY  - 2017
AB  - Driven by rapid urbanization, land use change has become a significant factor influencing ecosystem services (ESs). To support the decision-making process of city planners and policy makers, assessing the spatiotemporal changes associated with multiple ESs is vital. In this study, we developed a general structure to assess the changes of multiple ESs in Zengcheng, China. A new index also was developed to measure the comprehensive ecosystem service (CES). Trade-offs of various ESs were analyzed by using correlation analysis. We then designed four alternate scenarios to explore the optimal land use strategies to increase the CES value and minimize trade-offs among various ESs. Results demonstrated that rapid expansion of built-up land and traffic land resulted in a decrease of CES in Zengcheng from 2003 to 2013. Although the water supply, water purification, and vegetable and fruit production services increased, the climate regulation, soil conservation, biodiversity protection, recreation opportunity and grain production services decreased during the ten-year period. Government should implement land use policies and ecological engineering measures to improve soil conservation in the northern region; recreation opportunity in the central region; and carbon storage, water purification, biodiversity protection and recreation opportunity in the southern region. Among all alternative scenarios, woodland buffer and soil conservation scenarios exhibit the highest CES values, indicating that policies such as the \"Ecological corridor construction\" project and the \"Grain for Green\" project should be implemented. However, a caveat is that these policies improve the ESs at the expense of food production due to significant trade-off relationships. To minimize the trade-offs, a more sustainable intensification of agriculture should be adopted to increase food production without decreasing other ESs or occupying additional land. The land use strategies and ecological engineering measures in this study can provide a reliable reference for sustainable development of other urbanized regions in China.

TI  - Islands, mainland, and terrestrial fragments: How isolation shapes plant diversity
PY  - 2017
AB  - The fragmentation of natural habitats is a major threat for biodiversity. However, the impact and spatial scale of natural isolation mechanisms leading to species loss, compared to anthropogenic fragmentation, are not clear, mainly due to differences between fragments and islands, such as matrix permeability. We studied a 500km(2) Mediterranean region in France, including urban habitat fragments, continuous habitat, and continental-shelf islands. On the basis of 295 floristic releves, we built species-area relationships to compare isolation in fragments after urbanization, with continuous habitat and continental-shelf islands. We assumed either no dispersal, infinite dispersal, or estimated intermediate levels of habitat reachability through graph theory. Isolation mechanisms occurred in fragments but with a lower strength than in near-shore islands, and most importantly affected perennial plants. Annual plants were less affected, probably due to their smaller size and shorter life cycle. Isolation occurred at landscape level in fragments and at patch level in islands. The amount of reachable habitat (accounting for spatial configuration) explained local species richness in both systems, but the amount of habitat (no consideration of spatial configuration) was already a good predictor. These results suggest an important role of habitat amount around fragments in mitigating the isolation effects observed in near-shore islands, and the importance of carefully considering different functional groups.

TI  - Influence of land use on avian diversity in north African urban environments
PY  - 2021
AB  - Land cover and use changes are important to study for their impact on ecosystem services and ultimately on sustainability. In urban environments, a particularly important research question addresses the relationship between urbanization-related changes and biodiversity, subject to controversies in the literature. Birds are an important ecological group, and useful for answering this question. The present study builds upon the hypothesis according to which avian diversity decreases with urbanization. In order to answer it, a sample of 4245 observations from 650 sites in Annaba, Algeria, obtained through the point abundance index method, were investigated by computing Shannon-Wiener’s diversity index and the species richness, mapping them, and analyzing the results statistically. The findings confirm the study hypothesis and are relevant for planning, as they stress the role of urban green spaces as biodiversity hotspots, and plead for the need of connecting them. From a planning perspective, the results emphasize the need for interconnecting the green infrastructure through avian corridors. Moreover, the results fill in an important lack of data on the biodiversity of the region, and are relevant for other similar Mediterranean areas. Future studies could use the findings to compare with data from other countries and continents.

TI  - The 15-minute city: Urban planning and design efforts toward creating sustainable neighborhoods
PY  - 2023
AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the 15-minute city concept's underlying principles, sustainability contributions, and implementation challenges. We show that it relies on the seven basic principles of human-scale urban design, density, diversity, flexibility, proximity, digitalization, and connectivity. These principles can contribute to social, economic, and environmental sustainability in various ways. However, the 15-minute city can also been criticized for being physically deterministic, failing to take into account the needs of different social groups, biodiversity, energy-efficiency, clean energies, and culture and heritage. © 2022

TI  - Collembola dispersion, selection, and biological interactions in urban ecosystems: a review
PY  - 2022
AB  - Environmental and ecological degradation can be monitored by biological indicators such as plants, yet little research has been done using subterranean organisms such as collembola, especially in cities. Collembola, a soil fauna group, can be used to assess soil quality and to decipher assembly rules of soil organisms in cities. Here, we review 75 articles on soil collembola in an urban context. We found that soil properties and landscape characteristics influenced soil communities. There is a need for more connectivity between green urban spaces to allow the dispersion of collembola. Little information is available on the assembly of collembola communities, on biotic interactions and on dynamics of colonisation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Evaluation method for landscape connectivity based on graph theory; a case study of natural forests in Minqing county, Fujian province
PY  - 2016
AB  - The loss of natural habitat and habitat fragmentation, caused by climate change and human activities is a seriously threat global biodiversity. Maintaining landscape connectivity of natural habitats is one of the most effective methods for alleviating these related problems. Landscape connectivity describes the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes ecological flow and movement among habitat patches. By integrating information related to landscape structure and ecological processes, landscape connectivity describes the effects of habitat fragmentation on the organisms living within the landscape. Graph theory provides powerful tools for assessing landscape connectivity, and has become a popular research method in recent years. However, some issues related to the application of graph-based methods still need to be discussed and analyzed, such as choosing a proper threshold distance and gaining an understanding of various connectivity indices. This study used the graph theory method to assess the landscape connectivity of natural forest in Minqing County, Fuzhou City, China. A comprehensive method was utilized to assign a reasonable threshold distance, which consisted of three steps; namely, determining the range of the maximum dispersal distance of a focal species, enumerating a gradient distance value, and an experiment using link thresholding. Six indices were used to assess the landscape connectivity of the study area; number of links (NL), number of components (NC), Harary index (H), area-weighted flux (AWF), integral index of connectivity (IIC), and probability of connectivity (PC). We harvested data related to the natural commonweal forests of Mingqing County from the data of 2010 National Forest Resource Inventory using ArcGIS 10.2 to define habitat patches in the study area. The six landscape connectivity indices were calculated using Conefor Sensinode 2.6 software. Using the comprehensive method, 1 km was found to be the optimal threshold distance that best presented the structure of the landscape. A medium-level structure, consisting of 56 components was detected using the NL and NC indices. Based on the binary (H, IIC) and probability (AWF, PC) indices, the level of landscape connectivity of the natural forests in Minqing is comparatively low. The patch importance indices (dIs) aided in identifying the most important patches that could potentially affect the overall level of connectivity. We determinded that the main component provided 90% of the connecting functions in maintaining the landscape connectivity; however, losing a single critical patch could significantly reduce overall connectivity. The results indicated that this new method involving evaluation of the threshold distance could help researchers determine more accurate distance values for landscape connectivity, and therefore, this method would be applicable for both scientific research and planning. In addition, binary and probability indices could be used together to reveal landscape structure and the spatial patterns of patch importance. In our analysis, we found that the values of dI are generally proportional to the area of patches; however, patch area is not the dominate element that determines the dI values of the most critical patches. Other patch features, such as patch position, may have greater influence on the dI values for the extremely important patches. This may be caused by a commonly used but inaccurate method of evaluating patch attributes. This topic required further investigation and improvement in future studies. In conclusion, this study will help promote the application of graph theory in research studies related to landscape connectivity, and can provide guidance for land managers tasked with conserving biodiversity. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - The impacts of agricultural and urban land-use changes on plant and bird biodiversity in Costa Rica (1986–2014)
PY  - 2021
AB  - Costa Rica is recognized worldwide for its nature conservation policy following the traditional land-sparing approach. However, concerns have been raised about the opposite trends of the agricultural land cover changes driven by the option to expand old and new export crops after the country’s external debt crisis of the 1980s. We study what happened during the last 20 years by applying landscape ecology metrics to the REDD+ land cover maps of 1986, 2001, and 2014, and statistically testing these indicators with the locations of species richness of plants and birds recorded by INBio. Our results confirm that deforestation has been reversed and most of the biodiversity considered is housed in forestland, but also that the expansion of export monocultures and urban sprawl have fragmented and isolated these tropical forests. Ecological connectivity values decreased 13% across the territory, all crops are negatively correlated with bird and plant locations, and the metropolitan expansion caused a detrimental impact on coffee agroforestry. All these outcomes are consistent with the growing deficit of the Costa Rican physical trade balance due to a faster increase of tropical exports than the growing imports of staple food, with a loss of soil organic matter filled by high doses of agrochemicals imported. Overcoming these environmental problems require a new land-sharing approach to nature conservation aimed at improving ecological connectivity through an agroecology approach combined with land-use planning to preserve the remaining green belt of the shade coffee plantations as a buffer green infrastructure in the metropolitan area.

AB  - The Paul R. Noland Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is owned by the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, and CH2M HILL operates and maintains the facility. The 15 acres surrounding the WWTP formerly were a hay farm and invasive vegetation had choked out native flora which, in turn, reduced animal, bird, and reptile biodiversity. The city places a strong emphasis on sustainability and intelligent environmental practices and encourages its residents and contractors to do the same. CH2M HILL staff undertook a major habitat restoration to restore native flora, increase species diversity, and install a one-acre xeriscape garden. The restoration proved successful as numerous native species have been seen on WWTP grounds. Additionally, students, environmental groups, and University of Arkansas scientists frequently visit the restoration area and xeriscape garden for research, training, and recreation.

TI  - Synthesizing habitat connectivity analyses of a globally important human-dominated tiger-conservation landscape
PY  - 2022
AB  - As ecological data and associated analyses become more widely available, synthesizing results for effective communication with stakeholders is essential. In the case of wildlife corridors, managers in human-dominated landscapes need to identify both the locations of corridors and multiple stakeholders for effective oversight. We synthesized 5 independent studies of tiger (Panthera tigris) connectivity in central India, a global priority landscape for tiger conservation, to quantify agreement on landscape permeability for tiger movement and potential movement pathways. We used the latter analysis to identify connectivity areas on which studies agreed and stakeholders associated with these areas to determine relevant participants in corridor management. Three or more of the 5 studies' resistance layers agreed in 63% of the study area. Areas in which all studies agree on resistance were of primarily low (66%, e.g., forest) and high (24%, e.g., urban) resistance. Agreement was lower in intermediate resistance areas (e.g., agriculture). Despite these differences, the studies largely agreed on areas with high levels of potential movement: >40% of high average (top 20%) current-flow pixels were also in the top 20% of current-flow agreement pixels (measured by low variation), indicating consensus connectivity areas (CCAs) as conservation priorities. Roughly 70% of the CCAs fell within village administrative boundaries, and 100% overlapped forest department management boundaries, suggesting that people live and use forests within these priority areas. Over 16% of total CCAs' area was within 1 km of linear infrastructure (437 road, 170 railway, 179 transmission line, and 339 canal crossings; 105 mines within 1 km of CCAs). In 2019, 78% of forest land diversions for infrastructure and mining in Madhya Pradesh (which comprises most of the study region) took place in districts with CCAs. Acute competition for land in this landscape with globally important wildlife corridors calls for an effective comanagement strategy involving local communities, forest departments, Appendix 1 and infrastructure planners.

PY  - 2021
AB  - This article summarizes the data of a survey of flowering plants in 80 sites in five European cities and urban agglomerations (Antwerp, Belgium; greater Paris, France; Poznan, Poland; Tartu, Estonia; and Zurich, Switzerland). Sampling sites were selected based on a double orthogonal gradient of size and connectivity and were urban green areas (e.g. parks, cemeteries). To characterize the flowering plants, two sampling methodologies were applied between April and July 2018. First, a floristic inventory of the occurrence of all flowering plants in the five cities. Second, flower counts in sampling plots of standardized size (1 m2) only in Zurich. We sampled 2146 plant species (contained in 824 genera and 137 families) and across the five cities. For each plant species, we provide its origin status (i.e. whether the plants are native from Europe or not) and 11 functional traits potentially important for plant-pollinator interactions. For each study site, we provide the number of species, genera, and families recorded, the Shannon diversity as well as the proportion of exotic species, herbs, shrubs and trees. In addition, we provide information on the patch size, connectivity, and urban intensity, using four remote sensing-based proxies measured at 100- and 800-m radii. © 2021

TI  - Habitat fragmentation and structure and composition of tree populations in a agroforestry landscape (southern Québec, Canada)
PY  - 2018
AB  - A number of forests in agroforestry environments are at risk due to urban development or agricultural expansion. These forests often consist of patches of wooded areas scattered in the agricultural and urban grid, and often constitute green corridors that enable a flow between animal and plant species (migration corridors). This study evaluates the composition and structure of riparian forests in agroforestry areas that are subject to various natural and anthropogenic disturbances. This study aims to understand the dynamics of these riparian forest populations and evaluate the effects of the disturbances on the tree stands (e.g. floods, partial cutting), while taking into account their development over space and time based on a diachronic assessment from 1945 to 2010. Although these woodlands are subject to various disturbances, a fairly large diversity of tree species can be noted, and the regeneration of the saplings and small trees follows a normal growth curve (asymmetric) with a high contingency of young tree population comparable to a typical reverse-J distribution. However, lower densities are observed for riparian stands subject to frequent flooding, which could over time compromise recruitment and forest regeneration for some tree species (e.g. woody plants with weak adaptive strategies). The multivariate analyses (Redundancy Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis) conducted over all the soil, environmental and forest data reveal that some variables are more strongly related to the composition of the forest populations, including pH, ground litter and soil drainage. However, these variables must still be considered as being part of a set of interacting soil conditions. Lastly, the future of these woodlands may appear uncertain because there are no government policies or measures to ensure their protection and preservation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Birds and roads: Reduced transit for smaller species over roads within an urban environment
PY  - 2017
AB  - Roads provide humans with a means of mobility between destinations, be it for transportation of goods and services or as a means of connecting with others. However, roads are also known to contribute toward a number of deleterious landscape processes, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, pollution (e.g., chemical, noise and light) and animal mortality. Few studies however have investigated their effects on avifauna. We investigated the influence of road width on movements of nearby bird assemblages in Australia by comparing crossing counts of four species guilds and sizes over roads of varying widths in Southern Brisbane. In addition, we also sought to determine the association of seasonality with species crossing richness and abundance. Species guild affiliations were based on definitions from previous literature: small forest dependent, large forest dependent, honeyeater, and urban tolerant; whereas body size classifications were arbitrarily defined: small (< 20 cm), medium (20-29 cm), and large (>30 cm). Road sites were selected based on their vegetation likeness, both within and between sites, and this was assessed using the Specht classification system. We detected strong, negative correlations between road width and forest species richness, crossing species richness and species crossing abundance. In particular, analysis of species guild classifications revealed species richness and crossing likelihoods of the small forest dependent guild to be consistently lower than those of large forest dependent, honeyeater and urban tolerant guilds. Analysis of species by body size classification yielded similar outcomes: small birds were consistently less likely to be present nearby and cross over roads of all widths compared to medium and large birds. We believe gap permeability, particularly changes in vegetation structure and complexity that may restrict a species ability to access to the gap, as well as competition and predation, play an important role in determining species presence and crossing likelihood. Dense vegetation is known to benefit smaller species due to the provision of foraging resources and shelter from larger, more aggressive species. © 2017 Johnson, Evans and Jones.

TI  - Forest fragment and breeding habitat characteristics explain frog diversity and abundance in Singapore
PY  - 2010
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can have severe negative and irreversible effects on biodiversity. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on frog diversity in Singapore because of its high rates of deforestation and the demonstration that frogs are some of the most sensitive species to habitat degradation. We surveyed frog species in 12 forest fragments varying from 11 to 935 ha. We compared differences in species richness, abundance, and Shannon's index in relation to forest fragment size, connectivity (distance between fragments), and breeding habitat heterogeneity. A total of 20 species from 12 genera and five families were encountered in 12 fragments. Larger fragments and those closer to larger fragments had higher species richness. Abundance, however, was not correlated with forest area or connectivity, but we found fewer individual frogs in the larger fragments. We also found that breeding habitat heterogeneity best explained frog species diversity and abundance in forest fragments. Fragments with a high diversity of breeding habitats had more species. We found no evidence to suggest that abundance and diversity are strongly correlated, particularly in disturbed areas, but that breeding habitat heterogeneity is an under-appreciated factor that should be considered when prioritizing areas for anuran conservation. Enriching breeding habitat heterogeneity, creating corridors between fragments, and reforesting degraded areas are some of the most beneficial strategies for preserving urban frog biodiversity. © 2009 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

TI  - Effects of habitat disturbance from residential development on breeding bird communities in riparian corridors
PY  - 2006
AB  - This study assessed the relationship among land use, riparian vegetation, and avian populations at two spatial scales. Our objective was to compare the vegetated habitat in riparian corridors with breeding bird guilds in eight Rhode Island subwatersheds along a range of increasing residential land use. Riparian habitats were characterized with fine-scale techniques (used field transects to measure riparian vegetation structure and plant species richness) at the reach spatial scale, and with coarse-scale landscape techniques (a Geographic Information System to document land-cover attributes) at the subwatershed scale. Bird surveys were conducted in the riparian zone, and the observed bird species were separated into guilds based on tolerance to human disturbance, habitat preference, foraging type, and diet preference. Bird guilds were correlated with riparian vegetation metrics, percent impervious surface, and percent residential land use, revealing patterns of breeding bird distribution. The number of intolerant species predominated below 12% residential development and 3% impervious surface, whereas tolerant species predominated above these levels. Habitat guilds of edge, forest, and wetland bird species correlated with riparian vegetation. This study showed that the application of avian guilds at both stream reach and subwatershed scales offers a comprehensive assessment of effects from disturbed habitat, but that the subwatershed scale is a more efficient method of evaluation for environmental management. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

TI  - Urban Ecological Restoration: Setting Priorities for Restoring Native Vegetation in Lava Field Remnants in Mexico City
PY  - 2021
AB  - As cities overgrow, the need for ecological restoration is becoming increasingly urgent, especially in densely populated areas. Urban ecological restoration represents the best approach to undertake damages to restore native ecosystem remnants fulfilling biodiversity but also social goals in dense urban settings such as Mexico City. The feasibility of restoring unique xerophytic scrub vegetation in lava field remnants was evaluated in a portion of a university campus in Mexico City. Here we present an index (Need and Feasibility of Restoration Index, NFRI) for such purpose. The NFRI was designed through multicriteria analysis and considered ecological, economic, and social indicators. Cluster and principal components analysis were carried out to identify different groups of lava field remnants with similar characteristics and to point out critical variables that in turn would support management strategies. The outcomes made evident the necessity of restoring native vegetation for all of the evaluated remnants; however, the group containing the largest ones obtained the highest values for restoration feasibility and NFRI. The recovery of the rest of the remnants is critical to support the ecological restoration of the area as this may provide connectivity with better-preserved ecosystem remnants. When the restoration is unaffordable due to financial constraints, it is highly recommended to direct efforts towards ecological rehabilitation actions. The establishment of native xerophytic gardens is promoted when remnants cannot support a self-sustainable plant community. It is crucial to include the diversity of views and values of the community and the economic and ecological aspects to guarantee the sustainability of the landscape, especially in the urban context. The latter can provide better planning and design processes, ensuring benefits for humans and nature. Copyright © 2021 Bonilla-Rodríguez, Arroyo-Lambaer, Castillo, Zambrano and Cano-Santana.

TI  - Abundance and diversity of pollinators on green roofs are affected by environmental factors
PY  - 2019
AB  - Bees provide a variety of ecological services for urban ecosystems, while green roofs can also be of high value to bees through providing habitats and foraging sites. In this study, four hypotheses about impacts on abundance and diversity of pollinators were proposed from the roof and the surrounding environment. The evidences revealed that the height of the building affected the diversity of some bee species; increasing proportions of surrounding green space helped to increase abundance of bees and wasps; the colonies of bees were significantly affected by habitat connectivity, a frequent movement of bees and other mobile insects between roofs and ground guaranteed pollination of plants; plentiful plants combination was better than a single species in roof ecosystem services, and native forbs were beneficial for pollinations and foraging of pollinators; using fine substrate on green roofs may have a greater ecological value than common soil. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Evaluating the distribution of invasive woody vegetation around riparian corridors in relation to land use
PY  - 2018
AB  - Invasive species have been causing important and irreversible impacts to native species and communities of ecosystems. They distort ecosystem functions by degrading forest lands, wetlands, and agricultural habitats and replace the native vegetation and reduce biodiversity, forest productivity, and suitable wildlife habitat. To address disturbances caused by invasive species occurrence, further information is needed regarding the occurrence, extent, and dispersal of invasive species and how land use may increase the spread of these species. The objective of this study was to find the frequency and dominance of three invasive species common to riparian areas of east Alabama: Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet), Elaeagnus pungens (silverthorn), and Triadica sebifera (Chinese tallow tree). Surveys of these species in riparian forests in and around Auburn, Alabama were conducted to show the relative extent of these shrubs and their relation to urban land use. It was expected to see the highest levels of invasive species in the city center with decreasing levels radiating outward into rural areas. Another objective was how urban land use may affect the presence-absence and prevalence of these non-native plant species within study sites. The results showed that around the city center and suburban lands, cover of both Chinese privet and silverthorn tended to increase. In contrast, Chinese tallow tree density percent cover showed an opposite trend with landscapes close to city center often having slightly less cover. This study shows that urban land use may be an important association with distribution of invasive plant species. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Ecological effect of land consolidation: An assessment based on landscape connectivity
PY  - 2012
AB  - In recent years, the biodiversity conservation and landscape maintenance in land consolidation areas have received widespread concern. Taking the Luolong Town in Daozhen County of Guizhou Province, Southwest China as a case, this paper studied the ecological effect of land consolidation at landscape level, by using the landscape connectivity model (integral index of connectivity, IIC; and probability of connectivity, PC) to calculate the importance of habitat patches to landscape connectivity before and after land consolidation, to identify the change range of important patches, and to assess the ecological effect after land consolidation from a functional point of view under the background of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 m population dispersal potentials. It was observed that the connectivity indices could better identify the important types of all habitat patches and their changes before and after land consolidation. Giant patches had the largest area, occupying 57.0% and 57. 2% of the total before and after land consolidation, respectively, while the number of small patches accounted for 48. 0% and 48. 9% of the total patch number before and after land consolidation, respectively. Spatially, the importance distribution of habitat patches also had some changes. As compared with that before land consolidation, the connectivity of habitat patches after land consolidation had somewhat decrease, the average values of IIC and PC were 0.434 and 0.680, respectively, and the connectivity of habitat patches increased gradually with the increase of distance threshold. Giant patches had the maximum relative importance value to the landscape connectivity of habitat patches, followed by medium and large patches, and small patches. It was suggested that during land consolidation, large area habitat patches and \"stepping- stone\" patches played important roles in maintaining the ecological effect of land consolidation.

TI  - Nectar gardens on school grounds reconnect plants, birds and people
PY  - 2021
AB  - Pollinators are among the first to be lost when natural habitat is reduced to small patches and this can have cascading effects on multiple plant species. Simultaneously, the loss of natural habitat cuts people off from nature and, when people are out of touch with nature they do not care for biodiversity, resulting in further losses. Theoretically, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on pollinators can be mitigated by reconnecting isolated conservation areas with stepping stones and, if these are located in an urban matrix, they offer opportunities for people to reconnect with nature. Here we assess the effect of creating stepping stone habitats for nectar-feeding birds across Cape Town, South Africa. With the help of pupils, we planted gardens of indigenous, bird-pollinated plants at eight schools in the urbanized matrix between two conservation areas. To test for change in the bird community on school grounds we conducted 398 bird observation sessions over a seven-year period. Changes in attitudes and knowledge were assessed with questionnaires distributed to 176 pupils. We found that, as gardens matured, nectar availability increased and the probability of observing a Southern Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris chalybeus) on school grounds during a 30 min period increased from 10% to 50%. Bird species richness increased from ~5 to ~7 species. Questionnaire scores increased by 30% in participating pupils versus 8% in non-participating pupils. Although effects were small, the results suggest that it is possible to restore the bird-pollination mutualism in cities and in the process reconnect people with nature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effects of landscape context on mammal richness in the urban forest mosaic of EThekwini Municipality, Durban, South Africa
PY  - 2020
AB  - The loss and fragmentation of natural habitats is a major threat to biodiversity globally. In fragmented landscapes, species are not only affected by patch-level attributes but also by the influence of the whole mosaic of landscape elements surrounding habitat patches. Therefore, it is important to understand the simultaneous effects of local and landscape-level attributes on biodiversity. In this study, we determined the influence of landscape context on species richness of forest mammals in an urban-forest mosaic of the EThekwini Municipality Area, Durban, South Africa. We determined presence/absence of mammals in 28 patches using remote-triggered camera traps over two sampling periods. We applied generalised linear modelling within an information-theoretic framework to quantify the effects of within-patch, isolation, matrix, and landscape level attributes on species richness. The results showed the importance of landscape context for occurrence patterns of mammals in fragmented landscapes. In particular, they showed that patch size, shape complexity, habitat amount in the immediate environment, habitat proximity and road density were the most important factors influencing mammalian richness patterns. Overall, the results stressed the importance of habitat area (patch size, habitat amount in the immediate environment, and habitat proximity) and its spatial configuration to faunal preservation and suggest that management efforts in this landscape should be aimed at protecting fragments from further loss and disturbance and matrix improvement to increase landscape connectivity. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - Bird use of rural and urban converted railroad rights-of-way in southeast Nebraska
PY  - 2000
AB  - Recent interest in converting abandoned railroad lines to public recreation trails holds the potential to conserve and restore wildlife habitat along these corridors, but questions emerge about wildlife use and how best to manage for the multiple interests of wildlife and people. We evaluated the use by birds of 2 abandoned railroad rights-of-way in southeast Nebraska, one a partially converted 42-km urban-rural corridor and the other a converted urban recreational trail. We surveyed birds from 1992 to 1994 in 22 400-m transects (14 rural, 8 urban) that had either continuous woody vegetation (woody) or a more open mixture of grasses and forbs with scattered trees or shrubs (mixed). Of the 112 bird species (99 rural, 77 urban) observed, 47% were neotropical migrants, 38% short-distance migrants, and 15% permanent residents. Overall abundance was generally greater in rural woody and urban mixed transects, but there was no clear urban versus rural difference. Overall mean species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index were generally greater in urban transects during autumn and winter but shifted to greater in rural woody transects during spring and rural during summer. Abundance, richness, and diversity for permanent residents were generally greater in urban transects than in rural through all seasons, but for neotropical migrants they were greater in rural woody (spring) or rural (summer). Richness and diversity of short-distance migrants were generally greater in rural transects during spring and summer, but abundance did not differ. For some species, abundance in urban versus rural transects changed seasonally and such patterns in mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) numbers support the concept that doves may behave as migrants in rural segments but as permanent residents in urban. Within the rural right-of-way, woody transects, compared to mixed, had greater total mean bird abundance during spring, summer, and winter and greater species richness and diversity during all seasons. However, these differences did not hold in urban transects, probably because of influences from surrounding suburban landscaping. We found 5 species to be more abundant overall in woody transects and one in mixed during one or more seasons, and within rural transects an additional 7 species more abundant in woody and 2 in mixed. Management along such rights-of-way should consider potential differences among migratory guilds and species in their response to right-of-way vegetation and urban versus rural surrounding land use.

One hundred-meters long samples were taken at one km intervals on three parallel strips: (a) the roadside shoulder adjacent to the pavement, (b) the intermediate berms, and (c) the almost natural, lightly pastured, steppe. An additional survey, beyond the airport, was also performed along a dirty road. Total plant species richness decreases from the city to the airport along the shoulder and the natural steppe, but not along the intermediate berm. The berm, forested with exotic trees, seems to function as a corridor for weed dispersal. Beyond the airport, the number of native species tends to increase and the number of exotics to decrease in the steppe. A more detailed study, including the soil seed bank, was made at km 5 where an enclosure was wire fenced against livestock grazing. In this case, the berm contained higher species richness than the other two strips, thus supporting the \"intermediate disturbance hypothesis\". On the contrary, berms not contiguous to the enclosure do not differ in species richness with respect to the lightly pastured steppe. Compared to observations made 18 years ago, the road verge and the steppe show signs of increasing \"species pollution\".

TI  - The impact of low-head dams on fish species richness in Wisconsin, USA
PY  - 2004
AB  - Communities that live in linear systems such as streams or riparian zones may be particularly sensitive to changes in habitat connectivity. I examined the relationship between environmental variables, the number of low-head dams downstream of each reach, and fish species richness in first-order streams in Wisconsin, USA. The analysis was based on an extensive database of 13 628 localities and ∼180 000 individual collection records. The environmental variables included climate, elevation, distance from nearest town, and network-specific measures such as link number (the number of first-order tributaries upstream of the current reach), downstream link number, stream order, and fractal dimension. The link number of the downstream reach was the strongest broad-scale correlate of fish species richness in first-order streams. Path analysis of a simple directed graph suggested that, although downstream dams have a significant effect on fish species richness, this effect is small by comparison to the influence of...

TI  - From the range to the forest to the city: A case study collecting experts' perspectives on the status of landscape connectivity in the pikes peak region
PY  - 2012
AB  - There are two widely-used methods of achieving connectivity in a fragmented landscape. The first is to protect larger-scale landscape linkages, which allow for the sharing of a multitude of ecological processes. The second method is conservation or construction of corridors, which are linear formations intended to accommodate the movement of specific species between larger habitat patches. Because the effect of habitat isolation proved detrimental on habitat populations, priority shifted to connecting habitats both large and small. The premise was that many different habitats joined together would lead to an increase in landscape function and suitability of habitat for wildlife. The targeted region for this case study was the Pikes Peak Region of Colorado. Located in central Colorado along the Front Range, the Pikes Peak Region contains extensive areas of rangelands, forests, and urban development.

TI  - Structure and heterogeneity of urban vegetation landscape in Shenyang
PY  - 2003
AB  - Studies on the structure and heterogeneity of urban vegetation landscape in Shenyang city showed that the most vegetation patches were in the street corner, accounted for more than 50% of the total vegetation patch, and their area was only 4.45% of the total vegetation area. In terms of the size of the patches, the average area of shelter vegetation and park vegetation was 66.97 hm2 and 59.31 hm2, respectively, while that of street corner vegetation and garden vegetation was 0.71 hm2 and 0.38 hm2, respectively. Street corner vegetation had the highest index of landscape diversity, while park vegetation had the lowest one. In the seven districts of Shenyang city, all types of vegetation had a small landscape dominance and evenness, but patch vegetation had a more than 10 time of landscape dominance than corridor vegetation, indicating that there was somewhat imbalance in the allocation of different vegetation patch types. It's suggested that the quantity of patch vegetation should be increased, and the public vegetation should be distributed evenly. Increasing vegetation corridor is also important because it can link the downtown area to the suburb natural vegetation ecosystems. For example, the South Canal Belt Park of Shenyang is a good vegetation corridor, which can beautify Shenyang city, discharge sewage, drain flood, and improve microclimate.

TI  - Incorporating spatio-temporal connectivity for prioritized conservation of individual habitat patches in a dynamic landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - Habitat fragmentation has largely reduced biodiversity in the urban fringe. The prioritization of individual habitat patches can provide spatially explicit guidance for ecological conservation and restoration. Numerous studies discussed the effectiveness of purely spatial connectivity metrics to rank the conservation priority of habitats, but hardly resolved this issue in a dynamic landscape context. Meanwhile, spatio-temporal connectivity metrics were usually applied at the landscape scale, but are rarely extended to determine habitat priority at the patch scale. As such, we extend a generalized betweenness centrality metric into spatio-temporal connectivity networks to evaluate conservation priorities of individual habitat patches from a dynamic landscape perspective. The contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are examined at varying dispersal distances of the target species. Caidian District, the fringe of Wuhan City in central China, is taken as a case study. The results illustrate that a net decrease in habitat amounts and quality from 2005 to 2015 was mainly caused by urban expansion and agricultural production. The positive contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are observed at distance thresholds exceeding 200 m at the landscape scale, which allows us to capture the response of habitat priority to landscape dynamics. Accordingly, we develop a balanced conservation strategy for multiple species and the targeted conservation measures based on the coupled analysis of quality and conservation priority of habitat patches. Our findings are expected to provide solid support for biodiversity conservation in urban growth. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - We surveyed the composition of large and medium-sized mammals in the urban park Cinturão Verde in the city of Cianorte, Paraná, Brazil. This urban reserve is an important regional corridor for wildlife. Data were collected monthly during seven months for six days with track plots, camera traps, and visual searches for animals and sign. Richness estimates were calculated using Chao 2 and ICE estimators. Nineteen species of mammals in seven orders and 14 families were recorded. Although the area displays a high degree of disturbance, it supports the presence of important species for the fauna of northwestern Paraná, including state, regional and globally threatened species. © 2016 Check List and Authors.

AB  - There are classic studies on Herring Gulls in animal behavior and evolutionary biology, but more recently Herring Gulls receive attention for their dramatic population changes they are undergoing. They were close to extinction at places at the end of the 19th century but then showed spectacular popualtion recoveries in the first half of the 20th century only to decline again more recently. The exact causes for these population changes are unclear but it is unlikely one cause that affect all populations similarly. Herring Gulls started recently to move into cities, possibly because of a deterioration of their traditional habitats, causing a human-wildlife conflict. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Selection of important ecological source patches base on Green Infrastructure theory: A case study of Wuhan city
PY  - 2018
AB  - Selecting urban ecological patches is of great significance for constructing urban green infrastructure network, protecting urban biodiversity and ecological environment. With the support of GIS technology, a criterion for selecting sources of patches was developed according to existing planning. Then ecological source patches of terrestrial organism, aquatic and amphibious organism were selected in Wuhan city. To increase the connectivity of the ecological patches and achieve greater ecological protection benefits, the green infrastructure networks in Wuhan city were constructed with the minimum path analysis method. Finally, the characteristics of ecological source patches were analyzed with landscape metrics, and ecological protection importance degree of ecological source patches were evaluated comprehensively. The results showed that there were 23 important ecological source patches in Wuhan city, among which Sushan Temple Forest Patch, Lu Lake and Shangshe Lake Wetland Patch were the most important in all kinds of patches for ecological protection. This study can provide a scientific basis for the preservation of urban ecological space, the delineation of natural conservation areas and the protection of biological diversity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The importance of urban backgardens on plant and invertebrate recruitment: A field microcosm experiment
PY  - 2010
AB  - Private backgardens in cities have the capacity to enhance ecological function and connectivity. The importance of increased habitat availability was tested experimentally using microcosms with soil or with soil and vegetation added into Toronto backgardens. Local attributes of the backgardens were recorded, and within the microcosms, recruitment of seeds, plants, and winged and wingless invertebrates were recorded. Natural recruitment by all organisms was significant into the microcosms in the 20 backgardens tested. Invertebrate abundance and diversity, incidental seed recruitment, and aboveground vegetation growth was enhanced regardless of whether only bare soil was added or soil with vegetation. The number of woody plants (non-herbaceous plants with hard lignified tissues or woody parts e.g., stems and are adapted to survive from one year to the next i. e., through winter) in the backgardens predicted seed recruitment and number of plant species predicted winged invertebrate abundance. Hence, simple augmentation of private backgardens-even at an ecologically small-scale-can enhance the capacity of urban systems to provide appropriate habitats for organisms within a difficult matrix for many species. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Bee Guilds’ Responses to Urbanization in Neotropics: A Case Study
PY  - 2021
AB  - The consequent deforestation of urban sprawl is one of the causes of the decline of wild bee communities. In this context, urban green areas (UGA) may play an important role and constitute refuge areas for bees. This study analyzed the influence of UGA conditions and their surroundings in bee guilds’ responses in a medium-sized Brazilian city (Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ). The bees were sampled for 12 months (2017–2018) in 12 UGAs, and bee abundance and species richness were evaluated in guilds considering: nesting behavior, nesting site, and trophic specialization. We used as explanatory variables conditions of UGAs—the number of trees (NT), diameter at breast height (DBH), flower cover (FC), plant richness (PR), percentage of paving (PV)—and of their surroundings—paving (SPV) and the number of buildings (NB). Results showed 80% of eusocial bees, 82% nest in cavities, and 99% were generalists. FC, DBH, and NB mainly explained the responses of different guilds in study areas from all explanatory variables. Thus, this study confirms different responses associated with bee guilds’ attributes. In order to conserve bee diversity, city planning must include more green areas with large flower covers and avoid long corridors of high buildings that can impact bee dispersion.

TI  - Biodiversity and urban design: Seeking an integrated solution
PY  - 2009
AB  - Life on earth is remarkably diverse. Plants, animals, and microorganisms, in response to local and regional environmental conditions have created distinct adaptations that collectively form the interconnected web of life. This biological diversity and its associated ecological processes represent the planet's natural capital that underpins human activities, providing us with the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the materials that clothe and shelter us, countless medical remedies, and the cathartic psychological relief green spaces provide for us. This biological diversity also helps shape our sense of place. There is a growing awareness that the health of the planet's biological diversity will, to a large degree, determine our own destiny. There is also a growing sense of urgency that biodiversity requires substantially more protection than has occurred to date (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). The Convention on Biological Diversity (1992), adopted by over 150 countries, provided a strategy for addressing the decline in biodiversity around the world. The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development identified the centrality of biodiversity and the importance of setting conservation targets. And the IUCN's Countdown 2010 program was established to help monitor progress toward stemming biodiversity loss. In terms of urban biodiversity the Curitiba Declaration on Cities and Biodiversity (2007) affirmed the importance of biodiversity within cities, signalling the need to integrate biodiversity concerns into urban planning and development, with a view to improving the lives of urban residents. Yet, while enhancing biodiversity within cities is a laudable goal, it is a daunting challenge. The scale and pace of urban growth is responsible for the radical transformation of the spatial configuration and ecological processes of local and regional landscapes around the world (Alberti 2005, Dale et al. 2000, McDonnell et al. 1997, Dramstad et al. 1996, McDonnel and Pickett 1990). Natural areas are fragmented. Indigenous fauna are marginalised and extirpated. Hydrologic cycles are irrevocably altered while impervious surfaces increase. Productive soils, centuries in the making, are contaminated, compacted, and/or removed. One key challenge in addressing urban biodiversity is overcoming the misunderstanding that biodiversity conservation is an optional field of action, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Few local governments have dedicated resources to establishing planning frameworks and implementation strategies to explicitly address biodiversity. This complacency can be attributed, in part, to the complexity and abstraction as to what constitutes biodiversity. Consequently urban planners, elected officials, the development community, and the public continue to focus on land use, zoning, transportation, and infrastructure in isolation of their ecological consequences. Fortunately in North America some local governments have begun to engage the complexities of biodiversity conservation by developing regionally integrated spatial frameworks based in large part on Landscape Ecology's patch-corridor-matrix principles (Forman 1995). Simultaneously, proactive site planning and design practices at the neighbourhood and site scale are including biodiversity conservation as an essential program objective. Collectively these initiatives begin to illustrate how urban design can conserve and enhance biodiversity across a region.

TI  - Habitat use by mammals varies along an exurban development gradient in northern Colorado
PY  - 2014
AB  - Exurban development, defined as residential development outside of cities and towns, occupies nearly five times more land in the United States than urban and suburban development combined. Understanding the effects of exurban development on biodiversity thus has important and wide-ranging implications for the planning, construction and stewardship of sustainable communities and surrounding rural lands. To assess the impact of exurban development on mammalian habitat use, wildlife cameras were placed along a unique gradient of landscape permeability through varying densities and configurations of housing development in a rapidly growing rural region of Colorado. Multiple-season species occupancy and relative activity levels were measured in summer and winter seasons. The impacts of exurban housing on mammals were species specific and varied along the development gradient. Bobcats ( Lynx rufus), elk ( Cervus canadensis), and coyotes ( Canis latrans), showed decreased activity and occupancy levels in more developed areas, whereas red foxes ( Vulpes vulpes) occurred more frequently in these areas. Other species did not show significant responses to exurban development. In addition, black bears ( Ursus americanus) used embedded greenbelts more frequently in high-density exurban subdivisions. Using our development gradient provides ecologically relevant insight into how mammals respond to residential development, and our results demonstrate that some species respond positively to residential development, but that others decline or disappear as the development gradient intensifies. Incorporating well-designed and naturally vegetated open spaces into development projects and minimizing human disturbance could mitigate impacts to mid-large sized mammals in regions undergoing exurban expansion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

PY  - 2022
AB  - In the North-East region of the Indian subcontinent, there are seven contiguous states known as the “Seven Sisters.” Kohima, the capital of Nagaland, famous for its rich culture, traditions, and biodiversity, is settled in the picturesque hills. Despite the abundant natural resource endowments and geographical location, the lack of good connectivity and infrastructure, erratic power supply, and other institutional developments are central impediments to growth. This chapter explores the development context of Kohima by emphasizing the socioeconomic development, changes in the built environment, geographic condition, culture, and history of the Nagas and how it affected the urban development of the city. Under the smart city mission, the city is envisioned to have an immense urban transformation. This chapter also aims to apprehend the effects of the smart cities program in Kohima's urban development and planning. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Wild bees in urban grasslands: Urbanisation, functional diversity and species traits
PY  - 2020
AB  - While cities are known as important habitats for wild bees, a conceptual understanding of how assemblages of wild bee species are shaped by urban environments is limited. We applied a functional approach to test how taxonomic and functional diversity within wild bee communities of urban grasslands, and traits of bee species, related to local habitat features (e.g., management, species richness, flower coverage) and characteristics of the surrounding urban matrix (e.g., urbanisation, isolation). Surprisingly, urbanisation was not related to any diversity measure. Yet, taxonomic and functional diversity in bee communities, and proportion of endangered bee species, responded negatively to the isolation of grasslands within the urban matrix—but positively to flower coverage. Urbanisation, previous restoration efforts and site type filtered the functional composition of bee communities in terms of species traits related to diet and nesting. Results substantiate the role of urban habitats for functionally diverse bee communities, including Red-Listed species, and indicate pathways towards enhancing habitat functions of urban grasslands for wild bees by (i) improving the connectivity of urban grassland patches within the urban matrix, and (ii) more locally by adjusting management to maintain flower coverage in grasslands. These approaches can support efforts to develop pollinator-friendly greenspaces within the urban green infrastructure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Genetic distinction between contiguous urban and rural multimammate mice in Tanzania despite gene flow
PY  - 2016
AB  - Special conditions are required for genetic differentiation to arise at a local geographical scale in the face of gene flow. The Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, is the most widely distributed and abundant rodent in sub-Saharan Africa. A notorious agricultural pest and a natural host for many zoonotic diseases, it can live in close proximity to humans and appears to compete with other rodents for the synanthropic niche. We surveyed its population genetic structure across a 180-km transect in central Tanzania along which the landscape varied between agricultural land in a rural setting and natural woody vegetation, rivers, roads and a city (Morogoro). We sampled M. natalensis across 10 localities and genotyped 15 microsatellite loci from 515 individuals. Hierarchical STRUCTURE analyses show a K-invariant pattern distinguishing Morogoro suburbs (located in the centre of the transect) from nine surrounding rural localities. Landscape connectivity analyses in Circuitscape and comparison of rainfall patterns suggest that neither geographical isolation nor natural breeding asynchrony could explain the genetic differentiation of the urban population. Using the isolation-with-migration model implemented in IMa2, we inferred that a split between suburban and rural populations would have occurred recently (&lt;150 years ago) with higher urban effective population density consistent with an urban source to rural sink of effective migration. The observed genetic differentiation of urban multimammate mice is striking given the uninterrupted distribution of the animal throughout the landscape and the high estimates of effective migration (2NeM = 3.0 and 29.7), suggesting a strong selection gradient across the urban boundary. © 2016 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Butterfly communities of urban forest fragments in Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil: Structure, instability, environmental correlates, and conservation
PY  - 2002
AB  - A comparative study of butterfly communities in 15 urban/suburban remnants of tropical semideciduous forest in Campinas (São Paulo state, SE Brazil; 24°S, 47°W), with areas from 1.0 to 252 ha and widely varying histories and environments, shows that the most significant factors, besides area and sampling time, distinguishing the sites and influencing their diversity (80-702 species) and composition are connectivity, permanent water, vegetation, flowers, and human impact (negative, including pollution). The diversified Nymphalidae butterflies (38-213 species) and especially two fermented-bait-attracted groups (Satyrinae, 2-30 species, and Biblidini, 9-44 species), are among the more useful indicators of the quality and diversity of the environments in these fragments. Effective conservation of butterfly communities in tropical cities may be achieved by maintenance of arboreal green corridors along streets and watercourses between moderately large (>10 ha) humid areas, not near to the most built-up or polluted city centre(s), and the inclusion within these areas of ponds or streams, diversified native forest, and open vegetation including abundant nectar-rich flowers.

TI  - Can spatial form support urban ecosystem services: Representing patches and connectivity zones for bees using space syntax methodology
PY  - 2013
AB  - Within the broad research field of sustainable urban development, we can identify a movement from a first generation of research and practice, primarily addressing mitigation strategies, to a second generation, broadening the field to also encompass strategies of adaptation. Most sustainable urban growth concepts (e.g. new urbanism, urban containment and smart growth) built on the findings from the first generation of research and have a strong focus on the transport-land use relation, aiming at reducing private (car) mobility and related C02- emissions and air pollution. Research shows that higher density, land-use diversity and pedestrian-friendly designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-car mobility, although the results are still ambiguous (Colding et al, forthcoming). Creeping global environmental changes, natural catastrophes and volatile financial markets, highlight the need to put emphasis also on strategies of adaptation as a complement to environmental mitigation strategies of cities (Vale et al 2005). This type of research concerns the understanding of the resilience of urban systems in which urban systems are seen as integrated social-ecological systems, bridging the ancient dichotomy between human and ecological systems. Research shows that green spaces and its fragmentation are crucial for biodiversity and other ecosystem services. One of the most relevant variables affecting landscape fragmentation is population density (Jaeger 2000). Indeed, urban sprawl causes directly land cover changes at the urban fringe and impacts indirectly on the rural landscape progressively further away from the urban fringe by fragmenting both agricultural areas and woodlands (Salvati et al 2012). However, city compactness and higher densities decrease the amount and access to green space within cities (Pauleit et al 2005, Burton 2000). This paper especially focus on green space and its fragmentation and accessibility within cities and comlDine the human perspective on green space with the landscape ecological perspective in the aim to develop knowledge that opens for integration of ecosystem design in urban design, moving towards an expanded professional practice of social-ecological urban design. To include the ecological perspective we use effective mesh density, which is a direct quantitative expression of landscape connectivity (Jaeger 2000) and biotope diversity (Marini et al 2010). To include the human perspective we build on the methods to measure cognitive accessibility developed within Space syntax research (Hillier 1996) and especially the measures proposed by Stähle et al (2005, 2008) in which besides the measure of distance, also a measure of attraction is introduced. Through this we aim to include the described ecological measures in the framework of Space syntax, enabling us to use accessible green space both from a human and an ecological perspective. Important stepping-stone structures within the network (patches and links with more importance from one or both perspectives) can be traced and interventions can be proposed to improve (parts of) the system. This paper presents, firstly, a conceptual discussion on this topic and secondly, results from a study in Stockholm showing in principle the possibility of a spatial morphology of social-ecological urban systems.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of a safe harbor program for connecting wildlife populations
PY  - 2013
AB  - Conversion of lands to agriculture and development within remaining natural habitats have fragmented ecosystems and reduced wildlife populations. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has adopted an incentive-based conservation strategy known as the Safe Harbor Program (SHP) to reduce the vulnerability of federally protected species located on private properties. In addition to protecting populations, the SHP also strives to enhance species viability by devising strategies to (re)connect populations among habitat patches. We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the initial Safe Harbor agreement, developed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis, hereafter RCW) in the North Carolina Sandhills, in enhancing connectivity for that species. According to our results, breeding territories located on private properties enrolled in the SHP promoted dispersal of RCWs and enhanced overall population connectivity relative to otherwise similar territories located on non-SHP properties. Moreover, the SHP created extensive stepping-stone corridors throughout the region. Our analysis also showed that RCW connectivity will be negatively impacted directly and indirectly by encroaching urban growth. By combining an urban growth model with estimated connectivity, managers and conservation planners can identify which properties critical for connectivity are most threatened by urban encroachment. These results can help conservation planners develop strategic actions on private land based on the species specific movement ability, current landscapes and projected urban growth. © 2013 The Zoological Society of London.

TI  - Community-driven skyrise greenery in a dense tropical city provides biodiversity and ecosystem service benefits
PY  - 2018
AB  - Community-driven vertical greenery provides a previously under-appreciated resource that could be an important component of tropical urban ecology. While the corridors of buildings have been designed to facilitate the circulation of residents between spaces, this study shows that such corridors incidentally served as an informal space for community-driven vertical greenery. Across 1.86 ha of surveyed corridors, a total of 265 plant species and cultivars were present, with an average richness of 124 species per hectare. This is beneficial to urban ecology through its high species diversity, occurrence of endangered and vulnerable native species. Based on a classification of specific plant attributes referenced from literature, provision of food and medicinal resources (77.5%), and aesthetic benefits (72.3%) were the key ecosystem services provided by the species present. Community-driven vertical greenery could function as refugia for native species of conservation interest through providing an additional buffer against further losses in the wild. It also provides immediate opportunities for interactions between humans and nature. This study finds that corridors with larger areas and simpler geometries typically hold a higher abundance of plant pots. Future efforts to increase the abundance and diversity of vertical greenery, and its concomitant increase in the provision of ecosystem services, could be driven by local communities, rather than be formally planned by landscape architects, engineers and urban planners. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Urban open spaces from a dispersal perspective: lessons from an individual-based model approach to assess the effects of landscape patterns on the viability of wildlife populations
PY  - 2021
AB  - Green areas drawn on a city plan represent open spaces that have different meanings for humans and wildlife. Diverse kinds of green may influence species viability in urban environments. It is necessary to understand what those areas mean for wildlife populations and how land-use changes affect habitats and movements for making scientifically defensible planning and design decisions. My objective was to demonstrate how open space and urban development patterns affect the viability of wildlife populations in urbanizing landscapes from a movements perspective. Eight scenarios for 2060 for an urbanizing area near Portland, Oregon combined four open space (none, corridors, parks, and network) with two urban development patterns (compact and dispersed). Dispersal model HexSim simulated three target species – Red-legged frog (Rana aurora aurora), Western meadowlark (Sturnella neclecta) and Douglas squirrel (Tamasciurus douglasii) – movements on those scenarios to compare and contrast sustained populations to the ca. 2010 baseline landscape. Network scenarios presented the largest number of frog breeders. Greenway scenarios showed the largest populations of squirrels. Park and network scenarios sustained viable populations of meadowlarks, but park scenarios performed best. Compact development scenarios performed best for most indicators, while dispersed development scenarios performed better for meadowlarks. Network scenarios performed best when considering the collective of species. Networks presented more diverse habitats, sustaining higher diversity of species. For plans to sustain more species, more comprehensive and diverse habitats must be promoted, otherwise trade-offs should be expected – like the extinction of meadowlarks in greenway scenarios.

TI  - Species richness of urban and rural fish assemblages in the Grijalva Basin floodplain, southern Gulf of Mexico
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban sprawl poses a major threat to aquatic biodiversity. The species richness in fish assemblages of fifteen ecosystems with different degrees of hydraulic connectivity in the floodplain of the Grijalva River watershed has been analysed and described along five years. After human interventions, four lagoons are permanently disconnected and three are temporarily connected. The other three lagoons stay permanently interconnected. Native cichlids and poeciliids dominated in number of species, representing 24 of the 55 listed species. These 55 species include six non-native invasive species in the Usumacinta Province. The lowest number of species was recorded in urban lagoons, while they were similar in rural lagoons and rivers. In addition, 60% of the fish absent in the lagoons of the Metropolitan Area of Villahermosa (MAV) are species with a marine or an estuarine affinity; thus, the permanently disconnected MAV lagoons have seven species less than the permanently connected rural lagoons. Diversity corresponds to that reported in the literature. In urban lagoons, low diversity and the high percentage of lacking fish with a marine or an estuarine affinity indicate that ichthyological diversity is favoured by the interconnection of rivers and rural lagoons in the floodplain of the Grijalva River Basin. © 2019 Societe Francaise d'Ichtyologie.

TI  - Spatial population genetics in heavily managed species: Separating patterns of historical translocation from contemporary gene flow in white-tailed deer
PY  - 2021
AB  - Approximately 100 years ago, unregulated harvest nearly eliminated white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from eastern North America, which subsequently served to catalyze wildlife management as a national priority. An extensive stock-replenishment effort soon followed, with deer broadly translocated among states as a means of re-establishment. However, an unintended consequence was that natural patterns of gene flow became obscured and pretranslocation signatures of population structure were replaced. We applied cutting-edge molecular and biogeographic tools to disentangle genetic signatures of historical management from those reflecting spatially heterogeneous dispersal by evaluating 35,099 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived via reduced-representation genomic sequencing from 1143 deer sampled statewide in Arkansas. We then employed Simpson's diversity index to summarize ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub-sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of re-colonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a statewide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas is also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Lessons in ecology and conservation from a tropical forest fragment in Singapore
PY  - 2021
AB  - Forest fragments are increasingly common in the tropics as pristine forests are cleared. Fragments stranded within cities are especially stress-prone due to their greatly altered environment and high human impacts. We review biodiversity and ecological studies from Bukit Timah, a tropical forest fragment in Singapore, to ask how this forest has contributed to our understanding of tropical ecology and fragmentation effects, and list the conservation values of this forest. Evidence from Amazonian fragments predicts that losses in diversity and forest function follow fragmentation, and although Bukit Timah has adhered to some of those predictions, other aspects of the forest appeared remarkably resilient. As might be expected, declines in plant, invertebrate, bird, and mammal diversity occurred not only historically but also across two surveys made about 20 years apart. In other ways Bukit Timah proved surprising. Aboveground biomass fluctuated but did not plummet drastically, and was comparable to levels found in primary forests in the region. The extirpation of large fauna did not appear to reduce the dispersal of large seeded plant species, likely due to continued dispersal by small-mammals and birds. Exotic tree species are confined to recovering secondary forest fringes and do not threaten the primary forest, except for perhaps shade tolerant Pará rubber and a handful of cultivated fruit trees. Studies of birds and plants found that life history differences could account for differences in genetic connectivity or isolation for different species, with population genetic implications for other taxa. Despite being a small fragment, new species of plants and animals continue to be discovered or re-discovered. Clearly, there are reasons to celebrate Bukit Timah as a forest fragment that withstood two centuries of human impacts. Nonetheless, many measures can be implemented to better secure its future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Assessment of ecological passages along road networks within the Mediterranean forest using GIS-based multi criteria evaluation approach
PY  - 2015
AB  - Major roads cause barrier effect and fragmentation on wildlife habitats that are suitable places for feeding, mating, socializing, and hiding. Due to wildlife collisions (Wc), human-wildlife conflicts result in lost lives and loss of biodiversity. Geographical information system (GIS)-based multi criteria evaluation (MCE) methods have been successfully used in short-term planning of road networks considering wild animals. Recently, wildlife passages have been effectively utilized as road engineering structures provide quick and certain solutions for traffic safety and wildlife conservation problems. GIS-based MCE methods provide decision makers with optimum location for ecological passages based on habitat suitability models (HSMs) that classify the areas based on ecological requirements of target species. In this study, ecological passages along Motorway 52 within forested areas in Mediterranean city of Osmaniye in Turkey were evaluated. Firstly, HSM coupled with nine eco-geographic decision variables were developed based on ecological requirements of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) that were chosen as target species. Then specified decision variables were evaluated using GIS-based weighted linear combination (WLC) method to estimate movement corridors and mitigation points along the motorway. In the solution process, two linkage nodes were evaluated for eco-passages which were determined based on the least-cost movement corridor intersecting with the motorway. One of the passages was identified as a natural wildlife overpass while the other was suggested as underpass construction. The results indicated that computer-based models provide accurate and quick solutions for positioning ecological passages to reduce environmental effects of road networks on wild animals. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Host relatedness and landscape connectivity shape pathogen spread in the puma, a large secretive carnivore
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban expansion can fundamentally alter wildlife movement and gene flow, but how urbanization alters pathogen spread is poorly understood. Here, we combine high resolution host and viral genomic data with landscape variables to examine the context of viral spread in puma (Puma concolor) from two contrasting regions: one bounded by the wildland urban interface (WUI) and one unbounded with minimal anthropogenic development (UB). We found landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) spread in the WUI, but not in the unbounded region. The most important predictors of viral spread also differed; host spatial proximity, host relatedness, and mountain ranges played a role in FIV spread in the WUI, whereas roads might have facilitated viral spread in the unbounded region. Our research demonstrates how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread, providing a more nuanced understanding of host-pathogen relationships to inform disease ecology in free-ranging species. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Dispersal and wetland fragmentation
PY  - 2018
AB  - Wetlands provide habitat for a diverse array of aquatic and semiaquatic species, many of which provide direct economic and recreational value. Despite the ecosystem services provided by wetland fauna and flora, historical wetland loss has been dramatic. Wetland loss was >50% in the USA and 60-70% in Europe by the 1980s, with most losses resulting from agriculture and urban development. Although habitat loss can result from natural, stochastic events, anthropogenic habitat loss and subsequent fragmentation are among the most important drivers of biodiversity loss. One mechanism underlying the loss of biodiversity after habitat loss and fragmentation is the breakdown of wetland connectivity previ- ously maintained by dispersal. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018.

TI  - Vegetated fauna overpass enhances habitat connectivity for forest dwelling herpetofauna
PY  - 2015
AB  - The ecological impact of roads and traffic is now widely acknowledged, with a variety of mitigation strategies such as purpose designed fauna underpasses and overpasses commonly installed to facilitate animal movement. Despite often being designed for larger mammals, crossing structures appear to enable safe crossings for a range of smaller, ground dwelling species that exhibit high vulnerability to roads. Less attention has been paid to the extent to which fauna overpasses function as habitat in their own right, an issue particularly relevant to reptiles and amphibians. The Compton Road fauna array (Brisbane, Australia) includes a vegetated fauna overpass which connects two urban forest reserves and traverses a major four lane arterial road. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which colonisation of the Compton Road fauna overpass by reptile and amphibian species living in adjacent forests occurred. Pitfall sampling at seven sampling sites occurred between June 2005 and February 2010, starting approximately six months after overpass construction, with additional observational detections throughout this period. The overpass yielded higher species diversity and capture rates compared with the forest areas. Species accumulation curves demonstrated a strong and consistent colonisation rate of the overpass throughout the six year monitoring period, while persistent occupation by species on the overpass throughout the six years suggests permanent colonisation of the vegetated structure as an extension of the natural forest habitat. These outcomes demonstrate that the fauna overpass at Compton Road provides suitable habitat for diverse local herpetofauna communities and suggest enhanced habitat connectivity across the road. © 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Responses of anuran communities to rapid urban growth in Shanghai, China
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanization affects amphibian communities through habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat quality. The effects of these changes in habitat at different scales vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. We assessed the breeding distribution of anurans along an urban–rural gradient in Shanghai, China, a region experiencing intensive urbanization. Our results showed that urban density had a significantly negative influence on the overall anuran abundance and diversity and that the responses of individual species to urbanization varied. Pond age was an overall predictor in models describing the responses of Pelophylax nigromaculatus, Fejervarya multistriata, and M. fissipes and total anuran abundance. The quality of habitat at a pond was also important, and the high abundance of Bufo gargarizans and Pelophylax plancyi was associated with ponds with aquatic vegetation coverage. Urban density showed strong negative effects on B. gargarizans, total anuran abundance, and species richness. The broad-scale landscape variables associated with forests, agricultural fields, and wetlands surrounding breeding ponds have been shown to affect anuran abundance and species richness. The response of individual species, total abundance, and species richness to urbanization reflected differences in their ecological requirements. We quantified the effects of urbanization on frogs in a rapidly urbanizing region, and our results demonstrated that both multi-spatial and temporal variables affect anurans in Shanghai. Our results emphasized the importance of anuran conservation planning in urbanized areas to preserve and/or restore terrestrial habitat and to improve connectivity between ponds and other wetlands. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Functional and taxonomic perspectives for understanding the underlying mechanisms of native and alien plant distributions
PY  - 2018
AB  - Land-use changes often facilitate alien species invasion, impacting on biodiversity and ecosystem processes at the regional scale. Transport infrastructure is a potential corridor for biological invasion, but processes underlying invasion of alien species from human settlements along transport networks are uncertain. We surveyed alien and native plant species and their functional traits in roadside vegetation in Shiretoko National Park, Japan. The site is unique because there is a single invasion source (i.e., town). Vegetation, environmental and spatial factors were measured in 362 quadrats on two transects established along roads. Mean species richness within each quadrat (taxonomic α-diversity) was higher for alien assemblages, whereas mean functional richness (functional α-diversity) was higher for native assemblages. Alien species shared similar traits as generalists, which show lower functional diversity than specialists. Functional α-diversity of alien assemblages decreased with increasing distance from the source town, and the nestedness-resultant component of functional β-diversity of alien assemblages accounted for a relatively high proportion of their total functional β-diversity. Alien species with high dispersal ability were widely distributed, whereas other alien species were still limited to areas adjacent to the human settlement. Alien species showed a greater probability of having seed floss, lower percentage of perennial species, and lower seed dry mass than native species. Thus, alien species showed superior dispersal and competitive abilities compared with native species, and exclusion of all alien species is likely impractical. Consideration of functional traits may aid selection of alien species of particular concern for implementation of control and extermination measures. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - The Effect of NDVI and NDBI on Land Surface Temperature in Cirebon City 2015 and 2019
PY  - 2020
AB  - The development of a city is essentially influenced by the growth and development of the population, where the city as a physical container of urban community activity. Cirebon City is experiencing rapid regional development, such as the access of the Cipali highway which is connected directly to DKI Jakarta (Capital City). Therefore, the city of Cirebon has a relatively high connectivity where the cities cause a movement of people and goods to the city of Cirebon more quickly and more intensely. Since the middle of the 20th century, human activity has been closely linked to global warming that occurred from observations of rising global average temperatures. This study aims to analyze changes in LST in the city of Cirebon. LST was obtained from Landsat images and analysis spatially and temporally. This study also analyzes the effect of NDVI and NDBI with LST in 2015 and 2019 with 93 sample points selected by stratified random sampling and using multiple linear regression methods. Analysis of LST changes is done by overlay method. The analysis showed spatially the city center has a very high temperature. LST changes occur in the city center to the southern part of the city of Cirebon. The results of multiple linear regression tests of land surface temperature are influenced by vegetation density and building density. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

TI  - Influence of landscape matrix on urban bird abundance: evidence from Malaysian citizen science data
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Large cities in the tropics often comprise a myriad of manmade and natural elements that influence wildlife composition. Based on a citizen science–based project conducted in 2015, this study examined the combined effects of landscape factors on the bird assemblages in Kuala Lumpur and its conurbation, Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 48 species including 2,599 individual birds were recorded; the majority of which (>80%) were species of open habitat. Generalized linear mixed model indicated that the area of green cover had the strongest influence on number of individuals. Specifically, the abundance of individuals was increased by the presence of river corridors and roadside reserves. Areas located further away from water bodies and with less green cover had fewer birds. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating a varied landscape matrix into urban planning so as to maintain urban bird diversity and demonstrate the usefulness of citizen science in biodiversity monitoring.

TI  - Community assembly on extensive green roofs: Effects of dispersal-, abiotic- and biotic filtering on the spontaneous species- and functional diversity
PY  - 2019
AB  - QUESTIONS: Extensive green roofs (EGRs) are novel ecosystems and essential tools in mitigating the negative effects of urbanization. However, the extent to which traditional community assembly insights apply to spontaneous plant and trait diversity and composition on EGRs and novel ecosystems in general is unclear: (a) is a dispersal filter present because of EGRs’ fragmented nature (e.g., roof height, urban environment); (b) can we confirm the strong abiotic filtering due to extreme EGR conditions (e.g., limited substrate depth); and (c) does the presence of the planted vegetation lead to biotic filtering? LOCATION: The Flanders and Brussels region of Belgium. METHODS: The vegetation of 129 EGRs was sampled during a field campaign. Information on local (e.g., substrate, roof height) and regional characteristics (e.g., connectivity indices) were collected and species traits were collected from multiple databases. All data were used to construct (generalized) linear mixed models that tested the effects of the dispersal‐, local abiotic‐ and local biotic filters on plant community formation. Redundancy analysis was used to investigate predictor effects on functional composition and null models were constructed to assess trait divergence/convergence. RESULTS: Our results show that the spontaneous plant species diversity is not affected by their landscape context (dispersal filtering), while their functional composition is. Additionally, the importance of abiotic filtering is confirmed, as substrate depth and exposure have a strong impact on species diversity and decreasing substrate depth negatively impacts functional diversity. Finally, we show that biotic filtering by increased planted species cover leads to trait divergence, changes in functional composition and reduced cover of spontaneous species. CONCLUSIONS: We find that a broad perspective that includes the regional and local biotic and abiotic environment is needed to assess all factors that influence the vegetation on EGRs. As biotic interactions are present, EGRs should not be considered as static systems.

TI  - Sampling arthropod diversity for urban ecological landscaping in a species-rich southern hemisphere botanic garden
PY  - 1997
AB  - Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, sticky traps, sweep netting, Malaise traps and visual sampling at a national botanic garden, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the taxonomic impediment is great. The aims were to compare two sites, one of native vegetation and the other of mainly exotic plants, to determine the possible localized extent of biodiversity change across the land mosaic, and to test and compare methodologies and indicator taxa and to make recommendations for ecological landscaping of a botanic garden. Species richness and evenness varied considerably with sampling technique used. From results of a single replicate of data from all trapping methods including 821 arthropod species and 3831 individuals, a number of conclusions could be drawn. Trapping procedures such as sweep netting and pitfall traps, which focus on species with restricted mobility and/or host plant requirements, indicated greatest differences in diversity between two closely located sites. Taxa varied in sensitivity to microlandscape, again depending on the extent of their mobility. Cicindelid and carabid beetles were particularly good indicators of habitat disturbance and type. The management recommendations are that in a species-rich urban botanic garden such as this, as many ecotopes as possible should be preserved or created. These should vary in topography, landscape characteristics and vegetation composition, with as much connectivity as possible. This is a feasible blanket approach to give home to a large number of nameless species and morphs. Patches of different ecotopes should not be separated by more than a few metres by expanses of mown lawn which isolates much of the fauna.

TI  - Rapid conservation assessment for endangered species using habitat connectivity models
PY  - 2016
AB  - To avoid extinction of rare species in regions of active environmental change, strategic approaches are needed to manage remaining habitat. When observations of dispersal or metapopulation information are not available, habitat connectivity simulations may offer a valuable alternative source of information to assess threats and evaluate conservation options. For the Critically Endangered San Martin titi monkey (Callicebus oenanthe) in north central Peru, an updated distribution model was generated and land cover in the heavily deforested northern range of the species was mapped. The value of remaining forest fragments was characterized and threats from future land use change were assessed using complementary connectivity models. It is estimated that the species range is less than 14 000 km2. Remote sensing analysis reveals that at least 34% of lowland forest in the northern range has been lost, while nearly 95% of remaining habitat fragments are likely too small to support viable populations and less than 8% of this habitat lies within conservation areas. Areas with the highest modelled connectivity comprise only 10% of the remaining forest in the northern range and small patches may contribute disproportionately to movement; these lands represent opportunities for conservation and reforestation to prevent potentially significant impacts from future mining and urban development. This study prioritized remaining suitable habitat patches using modelled connectivity and local knowledge to gain insight into the status of an understudied species. This approach offers a relatively rapid method to identify potential land use conflicts, and to further focus research and locally appropriate conservation. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2016.

TI  - Detecting the response of bird communities and biodiversity to habitat loss and fragmentation due to urbanization
PY  - 2018
AB  - Birds are considered a good model for indicators of biodiversity response to habitat variations, as they are very sensitive to environmental change. However, continuous observations of habitat alterations from undisturbed landscapes to human-dominated ones, as well as the associated effects on bird biodiversity, are lacking. In this study, New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai, China was selected to illustrate the response of bird species, and thus biodiversity, to habitat loss and fragmentation. Land use/land cover (LULC) data and bird records from 2002 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. The results suggested that, due to urban sprawl, the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by 82.4% and 87.3% by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the landscape. To measure bird biodiversity, species richness and relative abundance were calculated, and they could account for the overall trend in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an indicator of biodiversity accounting, the mean species abundance (MSA) of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in its calculation, and its value decreased from 100% to 76.8% to 52.2% to 24.5% in the four corresponding stages. Finally, suggested by redundant analysis, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird biodiversity differed in various bird communities, and the area and connectivity of wetlands were the most significant variables. Our findings could provide important information to inform bird biodiversity protection and habitat restoration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Modeling connectivity to identify current and future anthropogenic barriers to movement of large carnivores: A case study in the American Southwest
PY  - 2017
AB  - This study sought to identify critical areas for puma (Puma concolor) movement across the state of Arizona in the American Southwest and to identify those most likely to be impacted by current and future human land uses, particularly expanding urban development and associated increases in traffic volume. Human populations in this region are expanding rapidly, with the potential for urban centers and busy roads to increasingly act as barriers to demographic and genetic connectivity of large-bodied, wide-ranging carnivores such as pumas, whose long-distance movements are likely to bring them into contact with human land uses and whose low tolerance both for and from humans may put them at risk unless opportunities for safe passage through or around human-modified landscapes are present. Brownian bridge movement models based on global positioning system collar data collected during bouts of active movement and linear mixed models were used to model habitat quality for puma movement; then, a wall-to-wall application of circuit theory models was used to produce a continuous statewide estimate of connectivity for puma movement and to identify pinch points, or bottlenecks, that may be most at risk of impacts from current and future traffic volume and expanding development. Rugged, shrub- and scrub-dominated regions were highlighted as those offering high quality movement habitat for pumas, and pinch points with the greatest potential impacts from expanding development and traffic, although widely distributed, were particularly prominent to the north and east of the city of Phoenix and along interstate highways in the western portion of the state. These pinch points likely constitute important conservation opportunities, where barriers to movement may cause disproportionate loss of connectivity, but also where actions such as placement of wildlife crossing structures or conservation easements could enhance connectivity and prevent detrimental impacts before they occur. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - The parana river delta
PY  - 2018
AB  - The Parana River Delta region is a huge mosaic of wetlands. It covers over 17,500 km2 on the final 330 km of the Lower Parana River basin, between 60390W, 3260S south of Diamante City, and 58300W, 34300S, next to Buenos Aires City, the Capital City of Argentina. This delta is formed in a complex littoral setting that developed mainly during the last 6,000 years BP although some former processes took place during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. This region is characterized by a high environmental heterogeneity which provides a variety of habitats, all freshwater wetlands, for a productive and rich biodiversity and a wealth of ecological functions. As for biodiversity, while the set of species comprises more than 700 vascular plants, just a few make up the majority of plant biomass. More than 80% of the surface is covered by herbaceous plant communities. Only 4% of the delta area is occupied by different types of native forests located in the less flooded places such as levees and meander spires. As for wildlife, 50 species of mammals, 260 species of non-passerine birds, 37 reptiles and 27 amphibians have been registered in the region. In addition, 200 species of fishes have been registered too, about 60% of the known to the Argentine sector of Parana-Paraguay River Corridor, the region with the richest freshwater fish in the country. Many wildlife and fish species found here are at the southern limit of their distribution and the Parana River Delta is an important area for several threatened species. The Parana River Delta wetlands provide a number of ecosystem functions (such as the reduction in water flow rate and turbulence, increased short-and long-term water retention and storage, and regulation of evapotranspiration) that ensure a good quality of life for local and neighboring areas' inhabitants. This Delta is no longer a pristine region since it has a long history of use by local people. Despite this, the region still has an important biological and functional diversity that should be preserved. There are varying degrees of threats that affect not only the conservation of wetland biodiversity but also the Delta culture. Some of these threats are regional or originate upstream, while others have local caracter (e.g., impacts of infrastructure, water pollution, urban development, and biological invasions). © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018.

TI  - Impact model of urban development on steppic birds in natura 2000 spaces
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization is one of the agents that contribute most to habitat fragmentation and is therefore a threat to biodiversity conservation. Connectivity improvement is the adaptation strategy most often cited to address species conservation in a changing environment. Many studies of protection at local and regional level zones usually show separate portions of habitat, defining the protected area, but they do not provide guidance on where and how to act to preserve the habitat quality and connectivity of the populations, on a consistent scale with planning units. In this paper, the analysis of fragmentation-connectivity focuses on cereal steppes of the Jarama and Henares rivers (Spain) to study the habitat and connectivity of steppic birds populations into protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, quantifying the effect on this protected area and on the species of interest caused by the massive development of infrastructure and urbanization due to the expansion of Madrid metropolitan area. In this sense, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) was used as a bioindicator, due to its high demand for habitat quality. The proposed methodology only needs to be based on data from wildlife sightings and land use. Once the variables (density, biophysics and urbanization) were defined, it was possible to determine the values of influence, applying them to generate the map of areas of probability of presence and movement of the Great Bustard. This can be used to support conservation plans based on habitat connectivity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Site selection for habitat restoration by multiple-criteria decision making approach
PY  - 2015
AB  - Urban development in recent years has caused a rapid decrease in wildlife habitat. The reduction in biological habitat will result in significant loss in biodiversity. Currently city developed does not use an overall comprehensive planning strategy but instead uses zone by zone development strategy. Using this type of development strategy, modern urbanization will face the issue of insufficient green space as well as unable to resolve the predicament of increasing green coverage. This study will use Taichung City Dadu platform as a case study. Satellite remote sensing technology will be used to explore the green space resource during the spring and winter season. We will use the geographic information systems to build a grid -like layer on the area to complete the analysis of habitat conditions, followed by the multiple-criteria evaluation of this grid to circle the patch. Selection criteria for this study will include many factors including surface landscape index, environmental factors, indicators of biological diversity, social factors. etc. ; in the study, there will be different levels for each factor weighted score, the scores will give different weight according to their scores in the area, Finally, the insert filter out unsuitable bloc. The results identify 27 patches, as a kind of regional planning studies of urban ecological green corridors candidate to address and to make recommendations on environmental protection zone. Finally, the research seeks to propose strategies on integrating the fragmented hillside vegetation areas for city habitat management.

TI  - Ecological security pattern of land use in a typical transect of Hebei Province
PY  - 2019
AB  - The \"Planning Outline of Hebei Xiong'an New District\", which has been published recently in full text, states that it is necessary to adhere to the priority of ecological protection and build an ecological corridor taking in \"Taihang Mountain Range-Bohai Bay\", and \"Jingnan Ecological Green Wedge-Juma River-Baiyangdian\". In view of this, this paper referred to the principle and basis of land sample selection, laid out the typical sample belt of Hebei Province, and used the minimum cumulative resistance model, with the forest land, grassland and wetland of the sample belt as the ecological source land, and the artificial surface as the source of urban expansion. In terms of attributes and external attributes, five indicators - elevation, land landscape type, soil type, ecological sensitivity, and ecosystem service value - have been selected to investigate the ecological security pattern of land use. The findings were as follows: five ecological safety areas were designated for the typical sample area in Hebei Province; these were ecological core area, ecological buffer area, ecological transition area, ecological occupation area, and ecological management area. The spatial pattern distribution of ecological source areas and urban expansion sources showed clear boundaries, all of which were concentrated and contiguous, though the ecological connectivity was weak. The ecological core area, which was the core area of the nature reserve, was at least 1 082.42 km2. The buffer area, which was the medium connecting the upper, middle and lower reaches, was as much as 6 943.63 km2. This area should be used rationally for protection. The ecological transition area, which was the key area for the development and construction of the reserve following the urban and rural construction, was 3 189.25 km2. The ecological occupation area, with an area of 5 835.34 km2, was distributed in the ecological transition area and the ecological governance zone. It was the main area of urban construction and economic development. The ecological management area was 1 710.70 km2; it was primarily an ecologically fragile area and was a key region for ecological restoration and future ecological industry development. In summary, There should be a large-scale planting of the ecological core area and the ecological buffer zone. The ecological transition area should be controlled strictly to expand to the ecological land, and the ecological occupation area should be developed according to the needs of the urban population and the economy. It is necessary to return farmland to the lake to restore the water surface, strictly to the soil environmental safety bottom line, and optimize the ecological safety barrier system. © 2019, Science Press.

TI  - Flooding-induced landscape changes along dendritic stream networks and implications for wildlife habitat
PY  - 2011
AB  - Severe low frequency natural disturbances along stream networks can substantially alter urban and rural landscapes and impact habitat and population dynamics of wildlife species. In 1978, severe flooding along the North Prong of the Medina River significantly altered the habitat for the Rio Grande wild turkey and may have contributed to the decreased abundance of this species observed during recent decades in the southeastern Edwards Plateau, TX, USA. The objective of our study was to examine the changes in landscape structure caused by this flooding event and their potential impact on wild turkey habitat. Aerial photography from 1972, 1984, and 1995 was used to quantify habitat changes in riparian zones and adjacent bottomlands along the Medina River. We documented substantial reductions in habitat suitability and connectivity caused by the flooding, followed by a partial recovery over 17 years. Analysis using patch-level metrics in conjunction with class-level metrics, provided insights to the pattern and possible mechanisms of the landscape changes. Habitat along higher-order streams was most affected, reducing not only the suitable habitat locally, but also the habitat connectivity throughout the riparian network. This loss of connectivity rendered numerous habitat patches along lower-order streams unavailable to Rio Grande wild turkeys as this species depends on riparian corridors for dispersal and movement among habitat patches. Our results illustrate the critical importance of multiple-scale analysis based on hierarchical dendritic structures of river networks when assessing habitat changes and their impact on populations of terrestrial wildlife species dependent on riparian habitats in semi-arid landscapes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Effects of habitat area, vegetation structure and insect richness on breeding bird populations in Beijing urban parks
PY  - 2015
AB  - Urban parks are isolated fragmentary areas within the urban environment, providing both recreational spaces for its citizens and habitat for birds. This study focuses on analyzing factors, which affect the richness of breeding bird communities in 26 urban parks within Beijing city. A bird census and a survey of biological factors were carried out from April to November, 2012. Simultaneously, non-biological factors were examined. A path analysis based on a structural equation model was carried out to explore biological and non-biological environmental variables affecting bird communities breeding in wooded habitats. In total, 38 species of wild breeding birds were observed in the 26 parks. Based on the results, we conclude that the size of green space in parks is the most significant variable affecting bird occurrence. Green spaces surrounding a park are positive and significant factors for breeding bird communities. Wild grasses/herbs are also crucial because they maintain a high level of insects. Omnivorous bird species and birds nesting in trees did benefit by an increasing area covered by coniferous trees, by increasing richness of grass/herb species and increasing richness of woody plant species. The richness of insect communities (phytophagous and pollinating insects) has a significant effect on the richness of breeding bird communities. This study confirmed the importance of connectivity that the parks are connected to surrounding green spaces, thus forming an integrated green system avoids impervious surfaces. Proper management of coniferous woody plants, promoting wild grasses/herbs, reducing the area of planted monocultures and minimizing the use of pesticides in urban vegetation management will contribute effectively to improve the quality of breeding bird habitats in urban parks. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Ecological traits and landscape characteristics predicting bird sensitivity to urbanization in city parks
PY  - 2022
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation caused by urbanization often have negative impacts on wildlife in cities. There are considerable studies investigating the relationship between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. However, so far, very few studies have examined the influence of species traits combined with landscape factors on vulnerability to urbanization in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we investigated how species traits and park characteristics influenced bird sensitivity to urbanization in the highly urbanized city of Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks. For each bird species, we collected data on nine life-history and ecological traits that are commonly assumed to influence urbanization vulnerability. For each park, we selected six landscape variables that are commonly considered to influence bird response to urbanization. After phylogenetic correction, the nine species traits were used separately and in combination to evaluate their associations with species abundance, an indicator of urbanization vulnerability. We then used the RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to test relationships between species traits and environmental variables. We found that the 75 species analyzed demonstrated considerable variation in vulnerability to urbanization. Using PGLS analyses and model averaging, we found that habitat specificity was the single best ecological predictor of urbanization vulnerability in birds in Nanjing city parks. The RLQ analysis showed that body size and habitat specificity were correlated with distance to city center and connectivity of the parks, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit species with smaller body mass and lower habitat specificity in urbanized landscape. Therefore, conservation efforts giving priority to species with high habitat specificity and to parks with high connectivity and far away from the city center may prove effective for the preservation of bird diversity in our highly urbanized system. Meanwhile, preventing future habitat loss and destruction in existing city parks may also effectively conserve these vulnerable species. © 2021

TI  - Invasion of freshwater ecosystems is promoted by network connectivity to hotspots of human activity
PY  - 2020
AB  - AIM: Hotspots of human activity are focal points for ecosystem disturbance and non‐native introduction, from which invading populations disperse and spread. As such, connectivity to locations used by humans may influence the likelihood of invasion. Moreover, connectivity in freshwater ecosystems may follow the hydrological network. Here we tested whether multiple forms of connectivity to human recreational activities promotes biological invasion of freshwater ecosystems. LOCATION: England, UK. TIME PERIOD: 1990–2018. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: One hundred and twenty‐six non‐native freshwater birds, crustaceans, fish, molluscs and plants. METHODS: Machine learning was used to predict spatial gradients in human recreation and two high risk activities for invasion (fishing and water sports). Connectivity indices were developed for each activity, in which human influence decayed from activity hotspots according to Euclidean distance (spatial connectivity) or hydrological network distance (downstream, upstream and along‐channel connectivity). Generalized linear mixed models identified the connectivity type most associated to invasive species richness of each group, while controlling for other anthropogenic and environmental drivers. RESULTS: Connectivity to humans generally had stronger positive effects on invasion than all other drivers except recording effort. Recreation had stronger influence than urban land cover, and for most groups high risk activities had stronger effects than general recreation. Downstream human connectivity was most important for invasion by most of the groups, potentially reflecting predominantly hydrological dispersal. An exception was birds, for which spatial connectivity was most important, possibly because of overland dispersal capacity. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that freshwater invasion is partly determined by an interaction between human activity and species dispersal in the hydrological network. By comparing alternative connectivity types for different human activities, our approach could enable robust inference of specific pathways and spread mechanisms associated with particular taxa. This would provide evidence to support better prioritization of surveillance and management for invasive non‐native species.

TI  - Landscape Context Influences the Abundance and Richness of Native Lady Beetles Occupying Urban Vacant Land
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban insect communities are structured by hierarchical filters including regional processes, human facilitation, and species interactions. We sought to inform future urban conservation endeavors by identifying how landscape composition and configuration as well as the management of vacant lot greenspaces affect native lady beetle (Coccinellidae) community structure within the city of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. We found no effect of habitat treatment on native lady beetle abundance when comparing vacant lots seeded with native wildflowers and those with naturally occurring weedy vegetation mown monthly or annually. Nonetheless, establishing conservation plantings that vary in plant height, biomass, and bloom abundance could aid in supporting a greater richness of coccinellid species, as these variables had differential effects on the abundance of fungivorous and aphidophagous feeding guilds. Further, we found that vacant lots embedded within landscapes with increased impervious surface and a high degree of greenspace isolation contained fewer aphidophagous native and exotic lady beetles. Our findings suggest that landscape context is a critical consideration when aiming to utilize vacant land as conservation habitat for coccinellids. Given their large holdings of vacant land, shrinking cities offer a unique opportunity to incorporate landscape-scale planning into future sustainable development initiatives. For instance, with over 27,000 vacant lots, the city of Cleveland could aid lady beetle conservation by electing to maintain vacant lots that promote greenspace connectivity while targeting isolated lots within intact neighborhoods for new residential development. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Recovering the landscape history behind a mediterranean edge environment (The Congost Valley, Catalonia, 1854-2005): The importance of agroforestry systems in biological conservation
PY  - 2014
AB  - The three main landscape dynamics now underway in Europe -urban sprawl, agricultural intensification and rural abandonment-are observed in a Catalan study area located in an edge environment between a metropolitan fringe and two natural protected sites. In this context, ecological connectivity becomes a key to host biodiversity. By applying to the available land cover maps several landscape metrics and modelling, we perform a historical landscape analysis of the changes experienced in land-use patterns and ecological processes. The results show up the relevant connectivity role played by the traditional agro-forest mosaics that linked both sides of the edge, providing a heterogeneous but continuous land matrix able to maintain high species richness. However these agro-forest mosaics are currently disappearing due to the ongoing urban sprawl and agricultural intensification in the plain, and reforestation leading to rural abandonment in the mountains. The current location of Mediterranean orchids in the study area is used to demonstrate that the results obtained through the ecological landscape assessment are not an analytical construct, but reflect the actual loss of meadows and open grazing spaces formerly created in woodland areas by a traditional multiple-use of forest and pastures now abandoned. The results show up that recovering the historical dynamics behind the current land-use patterns is a necessity for the emerging approaches to integrated biological conservation seeking a more complex and multidimensional management of sustainable cultural landscapes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Salt marshes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Salt marshes (also spelled saltmarshes) occur where fine sediments accumulate along sheltered shorelines of marine bays, saline lakes, and alkali sinks. Those in intertidal settings are well studied for two reasons (1) salinity reduces plant diversity and inundation/exposure regimes structure composition, facilitating manipulative studies of vegetation-elevation patterns and (2) large expanses of monotypic vegetation are amenable to analysis of ecosystem functions (productivity, nutrient dynamics, food web support, and landscape connectivity). Salt marshes continue to advance science in these areas. Several functions of salt marsh ecosystems are considered services of high value to society, for example, primary productivity, denitrification, and biodiversity support. In urban and agricultural areas, especially bays with major ports, up to 100% of salt marsh area has been destroyed or converted to human uses (e.g., salt ponds, fish ponds, diked and desalted lands for agriculture). Pollution, canals, subsidence, and increasing rates of sea-level rise (with global warming) continue to threaten salt marsh quantity and quality. Restoration efforts are underway in part to manage the retreat anticipated with rising sea level and to replace lost wetlands. Several innovative experiments in salt marshes are advancing both restoration practice and science. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Influence of human population size and the built environment on avian assemblages in urban green spaces
PY  - 2013
AB  - While studies of how habitat patch dynamics structures avian communities in urban environments has received some attention, there is considerably less known of how the built environment and human population size may influence the structuring of urban bird communities. We investigated bird populations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) through replicated point count surveys of breeding birds in 50 parks and cemeteries of varying sizes. We counted 4,435 individual birds in 441 counts. Of the 61 species detected, 27 were rare (detected at <8 points). Migratory species accounted for 46.1 % of all individuals, while 23.2 % of all individuals were of introduced species. Species richness increased significantly with green area size, as did the number of rare species. Species diversity decreased significantly with an increase in the proportion of individuals of introduced species; in particular, cavity nesters were less abundant when introduced species were present. Elements of the built urban environment including commercial development and transportation corridors were associated with significant reductions in park-wide species richness, mean number of species per point, and mean number of individual birds recorded per point. Human population size was positively related to increased numbers of individuals of introduced species, but a lower mean number of species per point. Ours is among the first to identify specific relationships between avian population characteristics and human population size, as few other studies have specifically incorporated human population size into a local, fine grain study design. Our data suggest that human population size is an important parameter that can be measured independently of characteristics of the built environment and the physical characteristics of the park itself as a correlate of avian diversity and abundance. Our study points to a variety of trade-offs needed to manage habitat for birds in urban settings. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for a wide range of ecological processes, including to disease spread, once it describes the degree to which landscapes facilitate or impede vector and hosts dispersion. Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. © 2021 British Ecological Society

TI  - Conservation where people live and work
PY  - 2002
AB  - Effective conservation planning requires information from well-designed studies across a spectrum of land uses, ranging from wildlands to highly modified production landscapes and large cities. There is currently a lack of such information about human settlement, even though this is a major source of land-use change with serious implications for biodiversity. Fewer than 6% of the papers in recent volumes of Conservation Biology described work conducted in urban, suburban, or exurban areas or studies in which human settlement was considered explicitly. For a variety of reasons, conservation has tended to focus on lands with a relatively small human presence, often dominated by resource extraction and agriculture. Urbanization is occurring in numerous biodiversity hotspots worldwide, however, and has been identified as a primary cause of declines in many threatened and endangered species. Suburban and exurban growth are affecting biodiversity in many places once thought of as too remote to attract such levels of development. Conservation biologists must address the issue of human settlement to enhance the habitat value of unreserved lands for native species, to increase landscape connectivity between reserves, and to mitigate adverse influences on reserves from adjacent lands. Conservation and restoration of native habitats in densely settled areas also have social and educational value. We therefore suggest a more balanced approach in conservation biology to addressing the effects of human land use through increased attention to areas where people live and work.

TI  - Butterflies of an Andean periurban cloud forest in the Aburrá valley, Colombia
PY  - 2014
AB  - Deforestation around large urban centers usually creates a fragmented landscape with reduced natural areas. Biodiversity studies in these forest remnants provide useful tools for designing conservation strategies that maximize the persistence of local diversity and promote their connectivity. Inventories focused on particular taxa have been proposed as a useful mechanism that allows a better knowledge of the state of biodiversity in a given area, the butterflies are one of the taxonomic groups more frequently used for these studies. In this paper, we study the diversity and composition of the butterfly community in the cloud forest of the reserve El Romeral located southwest of the Medellín City in the Aburrá Valley, Colombia. We recorded 75 species belonging to 5 butterfly families, more than recorded for similar forests associated with periurban areas. El Romeral shares only 50% of the species with the main periurban forest located east of the valley, indicating that each of the surrounding forest remnants of the city may have a unique composition of species being complementary and useful for regional conservation.

TI  - Environmental factors are primary determinants of different facets of pond macroinvertebrate alpha and beta diversity in a human-modified landscape
PY  - 2019
AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns and environmental drivers of freshwater diversity and community structure is a key challenge in biogeography and conservation biology. However, previous studies have focussed primarily on taxonomic diversity and have largely ignored the phylogenetic and functional facets resulting in an incomplete understanding of the community assembly. Here, we examine the influence of local environmental, hydrological proximity effects, land-use type and spatial structuring on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic (using taxonomic relatedness as a proxy) alpha and beta diversity (including the turnover and nestedness-resultant components) of pond macroinvertebrate communities. Ninety-five ponds across urban and non-urban land-uses in Leicestershire, UK were examined. Functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity were negatively correlated with species richness. At the alpha scale, functional diversity and taxonomic richness were primarily determined by local environmental factors while phylogenetic alpha diversity was driven by spatial factors. Compositional variation (beta diversity) of the different facets and components of functional and phylogenetic diversity were largely determined by local environmental variables. Pond surface area, dry phase length and macrophyte cover were consistently important predictors of the different facets and components of alpha and beta diversity. Our results suggest that pond management activities aimed at improving biodiversity should focus on improving and/or restoring local environmental conditions. Quantifying alpha and beta diversity of the different biodiversity facets facilitates a more accurate assessment of patterns in diversity and community structure. Integrating taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity into conservation strategies will increase their efficiency and effectiveness, and maximise biodiversity protection in human-modified landscapes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Principles for management of aquatic-breeding amphibians
PY  - 2000
AB  - Coordinated efforts by ecologists and natural resource managers are necessary to balance the conservation of biological diversity with the potential for sustained economic development. Because some amphibians have suffered world-wide declines during the last 20 years, it is important to consider biologically based management strategies that will preserve local and regional populations. This paper provides a brief overview of potential threats to local and regional populations, the state of knowledge on population and landscape processes, and the critical elements needed for an effective management plan for amphibians. Local population dynamics and ecological connectivity of amphibian metapopulations must be considered in effective management plans. There are 3 critical factors to consider in a management plan (1) the number or density of individuals dispersing from individual wetlands, (2) the diversity of wetlands with regard to hydroperiod, and (3) the probability of dispersal among adjacent wetlands or the rescue and recolonization of local populations. Wetland losses reduce the total number of sites where pond-breeding amphibians can reproduce and recruit juveniles into the breeding population. Loss of small, temporary wetlands (<4.0 ha) may be especially harmful to amphibians because of their abundance and high species diversity. Alteration of wetlands, particularly hydrologic cycles, can severely impair completion of larval metamorphosis through either early pond drying (if hydroperiod is shortened) or through increased predation (if hydroperiod is lengthened or connections made with fish-infested lakes, rivers, or canals). Wetland loss also increases the distance between neighboring wetlands that is critical to metapopulation source-sink processes. Reduction in wetland density reduces the probability that populations will be rescued from extinction by nearby source populations. Local populations cannot be considered independent of source-sink processes that connect wetlands at the landscape or regional level. Further, the fragmentation of natural habitats from timber harvesting, agriculture, roads, drainage canals, or urban development impedes or prevents dispersal and decreases the probability of wetland recolonization. If our goat is to maintain or enhance present levels of amphibian diversity, then resource managers must incorporate critical elements into plans that protect population and landscape processes thereby maintaining viable populations and communities of amphibians.

TI  - Land Cover Change in Colombia: Surprising Forest Recovery Trends between 2001 and 2010
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background: Monitoring land change at multiple spatial scales is essential for identifying hotspots of change, and for developing and implementing policies for conserving biodiversity and habitats. In the high diversity country of Colombia, these types of analyses are difficult because there is no consistent wall-to-wall, multi-temporal dataset for land-use and land-cover change. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address this problem, we mapped annual land-use and land-cover from 2001 to 2010 in Colombia using MODIS (250 m) products coupled with reference data from high spatial resolution imagery (QuickBird) in Google Earth. We used QuickBird imagery to visually interpret percent cover of eight land cover classes used for classifier training and accuracy assessment. Based on these maps we evaluated land cover change at four spatial scales country, biome, ecoregion, and municipality. Of the 1,117 municipalities, 820 had a net gain in woody vegetation (28,092 km2) while 264 had a net loss (11,129 km2), which resulted in a net gain of 16,963 km2 in woody vegetation at the national scale. Woody regrowth mainly occurred in areas previously classified as mixed woody/plantation rather than agriculture/herbaceous. The majority of this gain occurred in the Moist Forest biome, within the montane forest ecoregions, while the greatest loss of woody vegetation occurred in the Llanos and Apure-Villavicencio ecoregions. Conclusions: The unexpected forest recovery trend, particularly in the Andes, provides an opportunity to expand current protected areas and to promote habitat connectivity. Furthermore, ecoregions with intense land conversion (e.g. Northern Andean Páramo) and ecoregions under-represented in the protected area network (e.g. Llanos, Apure-Villavicencio Dry forest, and Magdalena-Urabá Moist forest ecoregions) should be considered for new protected areas. © 2012 Sánchez-Cuervo et al.

TI  - Diversity and specificity of host-natural enemy interactions in an urban-rural interface
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanisation and agricultural intensification cause the replacement of natural ecosystems but might also create novel habitats in urban and rural ecosystems promoting some insect communities by providing food and nesting resources. This study investigated how host-natural enemy communities change in urban and rural landscapes and their transitional zone, the urban-rural interface, by using trap nests for cavity-nesting Hymenoptera in gardens and rapeseed fields that were either isolated or paired in the urban-rural interface. Host dynamics were important for natural enemy occurrence, species richness and parasitism rates, and landscape effects were evident for natural enemy variables except for the richness of bee natural enemies. The number of parasitised brood cells was at its highest in the urban-rural interface, but the highest parasitism rates of bees were observed in isolated gardens. Parasitism rates of bees were negatively affected by host abundance, while parasitism rates of wasps were positively affected. Higher specialisation and lower connectivity of host-natural enemy interactions were found in paired habitats than in isolated habitats. This indicates that paired habitats comprise more specific natural enemies and vulnerable interactions, while isolated habitats comprise more generalist natural enemies, and thus interactions appear more stable. These results confirm that host dynamics play an essential role in the abundance and richness of natural enemies and drive parasitism. However, high habitat heterogeneity found in the urban-rural interface can also have an effect on host-natural enemy communities. This highlights that the provisioning of resources in the urban-rural interface can benefit insect communities in these areas. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society.

TI  - Desperately seeking stable 50-year-old landscapes with patches and long, wide corridors
PY  - 2012
AB  - gene flow and demographic movement among plants and animals connected by the corridors as intended. Nonetheless, it’s clear that swaths of land much smaller than conservation corridors and embedded in a matrix that is not intensely modified by human activities do support presence and movement of plants and animals [7,9]. These results suggest that corridors may be a useful conservation intervention. However, evidence that such movements occur often enough to promote genetic connectivity and patch occupancy across longer distances in human-dominated landscapes is generally lacking (but see [10]). Evidence is lacking primarily because most corridor studies have been conducted in landscapes that are vastly smaller and different than the landscapes conservation corridors are designed for and have measured species response variables weakly related to corridor utility. That’s why we’re issuing a call for help to identify appropriate sites to test the effectiveness of conservation corridors on a global scale.

TI  - Urban rivers as dispersal corridors: Which factors are important for the spread of alien woody species along the Danube?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Cities are hotspots of invasions, and this is particularly the case for urban rivers, which are known to serve as corridors for the spread of alien plant species to floodplain forests. Here, we present a case study on woody (shrubs, trees) species invasions across a gradient from a metropolis (Vienna) to rural regions along the Danube River in eastern Austria. In total, we identified 44 native and 25 alien woody species in 75 plots. Five alien woody species occur in at least 10 plots. The most wide-spread ones were species of floodplain forests (Acer negundo, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, and Populus x canadensis), while Ailanthus altissima and Robinia pseudoacacia-which prefer dry sites-were recorded substantially less often. The average level of invasion-i.e., the relative proportion of alien to native woody species in plots-was high across all three study regions. Still, there was a moderate decline of alien woody species richness along the urban-peri-urban-rural gradient. Generalized Linear Mixed Models showed that population density and the proportion of urban habitats in the environs of the plots is significantly positively correlated with the presence of Acer negundo and Ailanthus altissima. Conversely, the occurrence of Robinia pseudoacacia is negatively correlated with surrounding population density and urban habitats. Occurrence of Acer negundo is positively correlated with urban habitats. For Fraxinus pennsylvanica, we found no significant relationships. Our results confirm that gallery forests at river banks are highly susceptible to invasions. We argue that managing alien woody species in urban and peri-urban sites is not appropriate and useful, given that re-invasion is likely in most cases (from adjacent urban green spaces). We acknowledge that this recommendation entails the implicit recognition that gallery forests along urban sections of the Danube will contain a substantial-and likely further increasing-proportion of alien woody species. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Paths of coexistence: Spatially predicting acceptance of grizzly bears along key movement corridors
PY  - 2022
AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for conserving wildlife in spaces shared with humans. Yet, differences in human attitudes and behaviors within movement corridors can lead to spatial variation in the risks humans pose to wildlife. Mapping the spatial pattern of attitudes toward wildlife provides a useful tool for measuring this variation and promoting connectivity. We surveyed ranchers ( n = 505) in the High Divide region in eastern Idaho and western Montana (United States) about their attitudes toward grizzly bears ( Ursus arctos ) – a species that can pose risks to livestock and human safety. We assessed spatial variation in rancher acceptance of grizzly bears by combining survey and spatial predictors. Ranchers surrounded by more conservation easements and wildland-urban interface reported more positive attitudes toward grizzlies. Ranch size, experience with bears, and off-ranch income sources helped to further explain relationships between predictors and ranchers' acceptance of grizzlies. Our predictive map of acceptance provides spatially explicit information for targeted, pre-emptive conflict mitigation and a baseline for examining spatiotemporal changes in human attitudes as grizzly bear populations expand in the region. Integrating human social factors into spatial connectivity planning may better inform how organizations approach landowners and allow for a more strategic, sustainable approach to connectivity and conservation decision-making.

TI  - Consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation for wetland amphibian assemblages
PY  - 1999
AB  - Landscape-level variables operating at multiple spatial scales likely influence wetland amphibian assemblages but have not been investigated in detail. We examined the significance of habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as selected within-wetland conditions, affecting amphibian assemblages in twenty-one glacial marshes. Wetlands were located within urban and agricultural regions of central and southwestern Minnesota, USA and were distributed across two ecoregions: tallgrass prairie and northern hardwood forest. We surveyed amphibian assemblages and used a geographic information system to quantify land-use variables at three scales: 500, 1000, and 2500 m. Ten species of amphibians were detected, the most abundant being Rana pipiens, Ambystoma tigrinum, and Bufo americanus. Amphibian species richness was lower with greater wetland isolation and road density at all spatial scales in both ecoregions. Amphibian species richness also had a negative relationship with the proportion of urban land-use at all spatial scales in the hardwood forest ecoregion, and species richness was greater in wetlands with fish and Ambystoma tigrinum. These biotic relationships are less consistent and more difficult to interpret than are land-use relationships. The data presented here suggest that decreases in landscape connectivity via fragmentation and habitat loss can affect amphibian assemblages, and reversing those landscape changes should be an important part of a regional conservation strategy.

TI  - A preliminary assessment of green areas of Matera city and their potential role in climate change
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban greening offers a series of services including the improvement of air quality, water cycle, through several functions (e.g., absorption of air pollutants, increasing water catchment operated by soil). There is increasing attention to quantify urban green areas and the related benefits to the extent that the Italian National Statistics Institute (ISTAT) scores the \"green value\" of the main cities. There are still uncertainties on the classification of the green areas and their potential to provide services that collectively improve the urban life quality. This study analysed the green areas of the urban environment of Matera city, focussing on their category (private gardens, school gardens, green streets and urban parks) and size and their potential to serve as CO2 sink. The analyses were carried out on four representative areas and the size of the various categories was assessed through cadastral and other municipal data. The urbanization process had influences on urban ecosystems including plant biodiversity, increasing the abundance of plant alien species. Knowledge on the spread of alien plant species might help to prevent the biodiversity loss. Therefore, a qualitative survey of the existing alien plant species in the urban environment was performed. Preliminary results show that the urban green area calculated in this study is 90 ha. In addition, private gardens share a higher surface of urban green areas, reflecting a good greening aptitude of citizens. Considering that the green areas within built environment is most beneficial for human well-being, a possible scenario related to the carbon (C) sequestration by these areas in Matera city will be presented. A potential green corridor connecting some existing spot green areas to promote social aspects and improve well-being of citizens and environmental sustainability will also be discussed. This study might be supportive for urban planners and local policy makers, contributing to drive future decisions towards a greener built environment of Matera city. © ISHS.

AB  - In course of our survey of aquatic vegetation, 49 species (Table 1) in three different man-modified waterbodies - two altered river-arms of the Danube river and one seepage canal - in the area of Bratislava city were evaluated in 2000-2001. The greatest impact on the richness of species diversity was caused by the loss of connectivity with the Danube river system. A continuous type of macrophyte distribution prevailed in the canalised bed. Timing of flood disturbances and historical genesis of the habitats have reflected in proportion of growth forms. The submersed hydrophytes dominated in the most recently created aquatic habitat, alternating with the local patches of acro-pleustophytes. The higher presence of floating leaf rhizophytes was recorded in more advanced successive stages. To retard the process of succession towards the terrestrial ecosystem, future management should consider the restoration of flow conditions in analysed habitats.

TI  - Understanding the genetic effects of recent habitat fragmentation in the context of evolutionary history: Phylogeography and landscape genetics of a southern California endemic Jerusalem cricket (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae: Stenopelmatus)
PY  - 2007
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation due to urbanization are the most pervasive threats to biodiversity in southern California. Loss of habitat and fragmentation can lower migration rates and genetic connectivity among remaining populations of native species, reducing genetic variability and increasing extinction risk. However, it may be difficult to separate the effects of recent anthropogenic fragmentation from the genetic signature of prehistoric fragmentation due to previous natural geological and climatic changes. To address these challenges, we examined the phylogenetic and population genetic structure of a flightless insect endemic to cismontane southern California, Stenopelmatus 'mahogani' (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae). Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data suggest that diversification across southern California began during the Pleistocene, with most haplotypes currently restricted to a single population. Patterns of genetic divergence correlate with contemporary urbanization, even after correcting for (geographical information system) GIS-based reconstructions of fragmentation during the Pleistocene. Theoretical simulations confirm that contemporary patterns of genetic structure could be produced by recent urban fragmentation using biologically reasonable assumptions about model parameters. Diversity within populations was positively correlated with current fragment size, but not prehistoric fragment size, suggesting that the effects of increased drift following anthropogenic fragmentation are already being seen. Loss of genetic connectivity and diversity can hinder a population's ability to adapt to ecological perturbations commonly associated with urbanization, such as habitat degradation, climatic changes and introduced species. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of preserving and restoring landscape connectivity for long-term persistence of low vagility native species.

TI  - Mammalian fauna in an urban influenced zone of chandaka-dampara wildlife sanctuary in odisha, India
PY  - 2020
AB  - A camera trapping survey to estimate the species richness and relative abundance of different mammalian fauna and various anthropogenic activities was carried out for four months within an urban influenced zone of Chandaka-Dampara Wildlife Sanctuary, Odisha. The survey extended over 120 days in January-April 2019 over 10% of the total sanctuary area. With nine cameras and a total effort of 771 trap days, 2,855 independent photographs including 14 species of wild mammals and birds, human traffic, and movement of stray animals were captured. Among the mammalian fauna, Golden Jackal was the most photographed species whereas the Asian Elephant, Striped Hyaena, and Common Palm Civet were the least photographed species. Various anthropogenic activities like intensive movement of departmental vehicles, staff, feral livestock, and stray dogs and cats were also recorded and these activities need to be addressed in management activities for long term conservation of the area and its mammalian fauna. In order to enhance biological connectivity and improve movement of wildlife between the main part of the Chandaka Sanctuary and its near-detached reserved forests in Jagannathprasad-Bharatpur, the study recommends removal of feral cattle, extensive plantations, and construction of a fly-over for vehicular traffic. © Debata & Swain 2020.

TI  - Agricultural subsistence, land use and long-distance mobility within the Early Bronze Age southern Levant: Archaeobotanical evidence from the urban site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfī/Gath
PY  - 2021
AB  - The ongoing discussion on the nature of the organization of Early Bronze Age settlements and their social structure in an intensely settled part of the southern Levant (independent 'city-states' vs 'neither cities nor states') calls for data on which to base our understanding of shared economic patterns and regional connections. Here, we report the results of our macrobotanical investigation of the Early Bronze Age III (2,680–2,600 cal BCE) levels at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfī/Gath, a large fortified settlement in central Canaan. A dense residential neighborhood was sampled at high resolution for a multi-faceted analysis of plant use in order to address its economic strategies and regional relationships. The resulting rich and diverse plant assemblage enables reconstruction of the diversity of agriculture, fuel sources, land use practices, mobility, and connectivity. Results of the study provide, for the first time, direct botanical evidence for the structural patterns of an intensive localized agro-pastoral economy and enable comparative analysis of the regional diet. Moreover, the results shed light on rare yet continuous long-distance plant dispersal and human mobility across biogeographical boundaries within the southern Levant. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The context of the size and distance of Atlantic forest fragments in a small city in Southern Brazil
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is highly anthropized, this reduce the areas of native vegetation and impacts the biodiversity of the biome. The objective of this study is to analyze forest remnants with native vegetation characteristics using a free GIS. This analysis takes place using landscape metrics and was based on the supervised vectorization of land use in the municipality of California, PR. The area of the vectored polygons was obtained and a classified, and then the calculation was made with the nearest neighbor index, mean distance observed, Patton diversity index and the perimeter/area ratio of forest fragments. The results show that most of the fragments have an area smaller than 1 ha, the fragments with more significant area (<50 ha) represent more than 16% of the native vegetation area. The small fragments are important to maintain the connectivity, since the withdrawal of these increases the mean distance observed and nearest neighbor index. Most of the fragments are elongated and amorphous in accordance with the perimeter/area ratio and the Patton diversity index respectively, this may demonstrate the fragments may be subject to edge effects. Even with these characteristics, these fragments may be part of what is planned in public policy for preservation in the Atlantic Forest in the state of Paraná. Therefore, even small fragments with little core area are important for maintaining biodiversity, especially in a highly anthropogenic landscape. © 2019, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

TI  - Protected areas as a double edge sword: An analysis of factors driving urbanisation in their surroundings
PY  - 2022
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are the most effective tools to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. They have proven to be effective in stopping extensive land use conversion in well-conserved terrestrial ecosystems. However, land cover changes around PAs threaten biodiversity and ecosystem services within their limits and reduce ecological connectivity. In this study, we analysed the urban sprawls on the boundaries of 159 PAs (national, regional, and natural parks) in Spain, using 2.5 and 5 km non-protected buffer zones from 1990 to 2018. We clustered PAs based on biophysical and socio-economic characteristics and modelled urban sprawl in different buffers and periods. Hierarchical clustering revealed three groups of PAs: (a) proximate urban parks, (b) mountainous parks, and (c) parks in the Madrid autonomous region. We found that urbanisation in the surroundings of PAs in Spain has nearly doubled since 1990. General linear models explained a significant proportion of the urbanisation trends observed, with the number of municipalities in the boundary of the PA, the distance to a main road, and the distance to a big city acting as the most important drivers of urban sprawl. Our results also show that some PAs exert significant effects on urbanisation trends in their surroundings through the park-view effect. Finally, we highlight three coexisting phenomena that might explain the observed urban sprawl processes: (a) PAs attracting urbanisation in their surroundings due to the park-view effect, (b) PAs as a deterrent for urban sprawl within their limits, and (c) PAs occupying residual areas among previously urbanised lands. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Pollen dispersal in an insect-pollinated wet meadow herb along an urban river
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urban sprawl has led over wide areas to alteration and fragmentation of so many ecosystem types that it becomes essential to consider biodiversity conservation in urban planning. As the urbanisation is usually irreversible, the urban context has to be taken into account when defining appropriate management measures to sustain viable populations. Connectivity through pollen flow appears to be a key-factor for the long-term persistence of populations of insect-pollinated plant species. We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue in Lychnis flos-cuculi, an insect-pollinated wetland herb, along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with particles mainly deposited on neighbouring individuals and populations. The mean distance of dye transfer was 133.6 m, with a maximal distance of 523.7 m. Dye deposition was positively related to the number of potential recipient plants when distance to dye source was held constant. This may be associated with a higher flowering plant density across the flying distance that increases attractiveness and visitation rate of pollinators, and/or with secondary dye transfer. When connected, small and large populations only differed in response to the number of potential recipients. The small isolated population received little immigrant pollen flow, but remained a dye donor. Our study demonstrates that small populations of L. flos-cuculi along an urban river may still exchange pollen thanks to pollinator movements, and might therefore be regarded in management planning as potential connecting components between populations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Carabid communities in the spatio-temporal mosaic of a rural landscape
PY  - 2004
AB  - The effect of landscape dynamics on carabid communities was investigated using a chronosequence of managed grassland sites. A total of 52 carabid species was found. Species richness was significantly higher in early than in later stages of grassland succession. The change from an arable land to a grassland carabid community was almost complete 10 years after the conversion to grassland. The accompanying change in the dominant feeding mode indicates a marked shift in the functional structure of the carabid community from arable land to grassland. Correlation analysis revealed a positive response of phytophagous species to dense and species-rich grassland vegetation that was only loosely related to grassland age. Invasion of grassland species was largely confined to the early stages of carabid succession. On the other hand, loss of species continued until the latest stage of the chronosequence, though many species preferring arable land had already vanished a short time after the conversion to grassland. The species turnover was independent of the dispersal abilities of the carabid species involved. This is probably due to the high spatial connectivity of suitable habitats in the small-scale landscape mosaic of the Lahn-Dill-Bergland. It is concluded that the variety of land use (arable land versus grassland) contributes considerably more to the species richness of carabids at the landscape level than the simultaneous availability of grassland sites of different age, provided that areas converted to grassland are allowed to persist for at least 10 years. The missing invasion of additional species into later stages of grassland succession can partly be explained by the premature state that is maintained at the older sites by management. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - The connective potential of vertebrate vectors responsible for the dispersal of the Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis)
PY  - 2019
AB  - Accelerating human intervention has seen the creation of novel ecosystems through intentional planting and adventitious establishment of exotic species. One hundred and fifty years after its commercialisation by the horticultural industry, the Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) has become one of the most ubiquitous ornamental palm species throughout all temperate zones. Even though it has become naturalised in many parts of the world, colonising natural as well as managed landscapes, little is known about the vectors responsible for dispersal. This paper reviews the state of knowledge of vertebrate species utilising P. canariensis as habitat and those that feed on the palm's drupes and disperse their seeds. Globally, P. canariensis forms a major urban habitat for invasive species. The significant dispersers are canids and three families of larger volant birds (Artamidae, Columbidae, and Corvidae). The review demonstrates that the majority of vectors consume the fruit on the tree or on a close-by perch, thereby contributing little to medium or long range dispersal. A few avian and terrestrial species facilitate long-distance dispersal, even though they too deposit the majority of seed close to the source. The paper postulates a conceptual model where effective dispersal success of a horticultural plant is governed not only by the established factors of distance of dispersal quantity of seeds dispersed and seed viability, but significantly also by the ability of a vector species to span several habitat boundaries (e.g. from urban to production landscapes or remnant vegetation) and to deposit multiple seeds at tightly defined locations. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - The role of small secondary biotopes in a highly fragmented landscape as habitat and connectivity providers for dragonflies (Insecta: Odonata)
PY  - 2017
AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are considered major threats to freshwater biodiversity and to invertebrates in particular. These often irreversible processes may lead to local and regional extinctions of species, most notably of stenotopic taxa. In spite of this, a number of studies have shown that small habitat patches can sustain rich and abundant communities. The present work assesses the relevance of a group of four small man-made (secondary) wildlife ponds to Odonata species diversity and abundance. Results obtained on pond recruiting capacity, species richness, abundance and habitat use by means of exuviae collection and monitoring of adults using a capture–mark–recapture (CMR) method indicate the potential suitability of these small aquatic biotopes and the surrounding landscape as habitat providers and stepping stone connectors in the Valles lowlands (Catalonia, Spain). This region, close to the metropolitan area of Barcelona, has severely degraded natural habitats and high landscape fragmentation due to infrastructure, urban and industrial expansion. A comparison among a greater number of sites (ponds and sections of streams and rivers) distributed across the region showed that adequately managed small waterbodies harbour richer Odonata communities than others that are unmanaged or managed specifically for other types of fauna or uses. Appropriate care of these small biotopes avoids disturbance and keeps them free from vertebrates like fish and waterfowl which, under certain conditions, may have a strong influence on the invertebrate communities because, apart from feeding on larvae, they may have a negative impact on macrophyte development and water quality. While rivers and streams, the only natural aquatic habitats in the area, may be both expensive and technically challenging to restore and manage successfully, the creation and/or restoration of small ponds and short river sections in suitable locations can be a cost-effective method for enhancing freshwater vegetation and invertebrate diversity in this impacted landscape.

TI  - A multi-method approach for analyzing hierarchical genetic structures: A case study with cougars Puma concolor
PY  - 2014
AB  - Genetic data are increasingly used to describe the structure of wildlife populations and to infer landscape influences on functional connectivity. To accomplish this, genetic structure can be described with a multitude of methods that vary in their assumptions, advantages and limitations. While some methods discriminate distinct subpopulations separated by sharp genetic boundaries (i.e. barrier detection or clustering methods), other methods estimate gradient genetic structures using individual-based genetic distances. We present an analytical framework based on individual ancestry values that combines these different approaches and can be used to a) test for local barriers to gene flow and b) evaluate effects of landscape gradients through individual-based genetic distances that account for hierarchical genetic structure. We illustrate the approach with a data set of 371 cougars Puma concolor from a 217 000 km2 study area in Idaho and western Montana (USA) that were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci. Results suggest that cougars in the region show a complex, hierarchical genetic structure that is influenced by a local barrier to gene flow (an urban population cluster connected by high traffic volumes), different landscape features (the Snake River Plain, forested habitat), and geographic distance. Our novel approach helped to elucidate the relative influence of these factors on different hierarchical levels of population structure, which was not possible when using either clustering methods or standard genetic distances. Results obtained with our analytical framework highlight the need for multi-scale management of cougars in the region and show that landscape heterogeneity can create complex genetic structures, even in generalist species with high dispersal capabilities. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Short perceptual range and yet successful invasion of a fragmented landscape: The case of the red-bellied tree squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus) in Argentina
PY  - 2012
AB  - Dispersal is a key element of the invasion process for introduced species, and is influenced by landscape connectivity. The red-bellied squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus) was introduced to Argentina in 1970. Suitable forest habitat for this arboreal species is highly fragmented in a rural-urban matrix, but despite this, the squirrel population has spread. Squirrels disperse into new habitat patches using connective features such as forest corridors. They may also cross gaps but up to what extent is not known. Gap crossing success is influenced by perceptual range, which is the distance from which animals can perceive suitable habitat. Perceptual range has been previously estimated for vulnerable species, but not for introduced species. We used a model relating perceptual range to body mass to predict the perceptual range of the red-bellied tree squirrel in Argentina. We then tested our prediction of 202-221 m by releasing squirrels in an unfamiliar arable field at different distances (300, 200, 100 and 20 m) from woodland habitat. We assumed that if woodland could be perceived, squirrels would orientate toward it. We estimated perceptual range to be between 20 and 100 m, considerably lower than predicted. Our results indicate that squirrels can potentially cross small habitat gaps, but dispersal over greater distances lacking connectivity is less likely. Incorporating this information when modelling the spread of exotic squirrels in the Pampas Region can yield more accurate prediction of the invasion process and guide management practices to minimise their expansion. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Extensive agricultural and urban development has contributed to the decline of riparian forests across North America. An urban-rural gradient was used to identify species- and guild-level indicators of riparian forest degradation in southern Manitoba. Twenty-five sites were categorized according to urban, suburban, high-intensity rural, low-intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference land use. Generalists, which frequented all land use types, dominated (69%) the understorey community, whereas opportunistic (15%) and vulnerable (16%) species were relatively less common. Opportunistic species, which characterized city sites, tended to be exotic, woody and annual, and effective dispersers (i.e., endozoochores). In contrast, vulnerable species, which characterized non-city sites, tended to be native, perennial, and ineffective dispersers (i.e., barochores or anemochores). Indicators of disturbed forests were opportunistic and positively associated with disturbance measures including connectivity and cover of garbage, and negatively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included exotics Solanum dulcamara, Rhamnus cathartica, and Lonicera tartarica. In contrast, indicators of high-integrity forest were vulnerable, often excluded from urban sites and were negatively associated with disturbance measures and positively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included natives Rubus idaeus, Carex spp., and Galium triflorum. Our results suggest that opportunistic and vulnerable species, and their associated guilds, can be used as effective indicators of disturbance and forest integrity and to identify forest patches that warrant further protection or restoration. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Patch size does not always indicate bird species diversity: Case in peri-urban tropical habitat in Riau, Indonesia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Larger patches generally are inhabited by higher species richness, including birds, as predicted by the island biogeography theory. The objective of this research was to reveal the response of bird species richness in different patch sizes in peri-urban habitat. The study site area was five patches (2 large patches near human activities, remote large patch with a small lake, small patch, corridor patch) of disturbed secondary shrub-forest in Riau University, Sumatra. Birds were observed using the standard point-counts in early morning and late afternoon (8 points/patch, 3 replicates, total 40 observation-hour) in March-April 2021. Species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity indices (H'), Chao species prediction, and Bray-Curtis similarity indices (B) were calculated. Total of 979 individual birds were observed, consisted of 68 species from 28 families with B ranged from 0.573 to 0.846. Large patch with lake in remote area had the highest species richness (S:39 species, Chao:54) and H' (3.097). However, two large patches closed to human activities had the lowest number of species (S:27, Chao:30, H':2.908, and S:23, Chao:32, H':2.938, respectively), even lower than small patch (S:30, Chao:40, H':2.925) or corridor patch (S:34; Chao:51, H':2.724). Clearly human disturbance and micro-habitat diversity affect species richness in a local scale. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Ecological resistance in urban streams: The role of natural and legacy attributes
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanization substantially changes the physicochemical and biological characteristics of streams. The trajectory of negative effect is broadly similar around the world, but the nature and magnitude of ecological responses to urban growth differ among locations. Some heterogeneity in response arises from differences in the level of urban development and attributes of urban water management. However, the heterogeneity also may arise from variation in hydrologic, biological, and physicochemical templates that shaped stream ecosystems before urban development. We present a framework to develop hypotheses that predict how natural watershed and channel attributes in the pre-urban-development state may confer ecological resistance to urbanization. We present 6 testable hypotheses that explore the expression of such attributes under our framework: 1) greater water storage capacity mitigates hydrologic regime shifts, 2) coarse substrates and a balance between erosive forces and sediment supply buffer morphological changes, 3) naturally high ionic concentrations and pH pre-adapt biota to waterquality stress, 4) metapopulation connectivity results in retention of species richness, 5) high functional redundancy buffers trophic function from species loss, and 6) landuse history mutes or reverses the expected trajectory of eutrophication. Data from past comparative analyses support these hypotheses, but rigorous testing will require targeted investigations that account for confounDing or interacting factors, such as diversity in urban infrastructure attributes. Improved understanDing of the susceptibility or resistance of stream ecosystems could substantially strengthen conservation, management, and monitoring efforts in urban streams. We hope that these preliminary, conceptual hypotheses will encourage others to explore these ideas further and generate additional explanations for the heterogeneity observed in urban streams. © 2016 by The Society for Freshwater Science.

TI  - Ecosystem services provided by urban ponds and green spaces: a detailed study of a semi-natural site with global importance for research
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ponds and the adjacent green spaces are an important part of urban blue-green Infrastructure (BGI) and contribute to a number of ecosystem services, including alleviation of flood risk, amelioration of climatic fluctuations, and improvement of runoff water quality, as well as biodiversity and amenity values. Multiple benefits associated with urban ponds have only recently started to be appreciated, and examples of in-depth interdisciplinary insights remain rare. This paper gives an account of the ecosystem services provided by Blackford Pond, a semi-natural water body located within a nature reserve and nominated as a site globally important for scientific research. Despite elevated levels of polluting substances and eutrophication, the overall species richness of the site is high and the biodiversity of the locality is enhanced by the ecotone effect. The diversity of available plant hosts and substrates appears to benefit the fungal community and the abundance of aquatic invertebrate fauna appears to benefit the higher trophic levels. Hydrological modelling clearly shows that the pond increases the flood resilience of the surrounding area, despite not having been designed as a drainage feature. The application of the Natural Capital Planning Tool (NCPT) also reveals higher values (in relation to the values of amenity grassland) of such ecosystem services categories as biodiversity (þ4.76 per hectare), aesthetic values (þ4.67), flood risk regulation (þ0.41), air quality (þ0.28), local (þ0.6) and global (þ0.14) climate regulations. The discussion highlights a number of trade-offs among different ecosystem services (e.g. water quality vs. diatom research value, flood resilience vs. air quality and carbon capture, biodiversity of ectomycorrhizal vs. lichenised fungi), and considers which of the multiple benefits provided by the site may have not been fully reflected in NCPT calculations or the economic estimates obtained using contingent valuation (e.g. effects on hydrology, water quality, wildlife corridors, education and research value). The simultaneous consideration of biodiversity, hydrology, water chemistry and amenity, education, research and other values presented in this paper contributes towards a better understanding of the ecology and overall functioning of urban ponds, and helps to increase appreciation of their benefits and promote their public acceptability and further implementation. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Use of urban bushland remnants by the western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis): Short-term home-range size and habitat use in Albany, Western Australia
PY  - 2018
AB  - Management of wildlife in habitats fragmented by urbanisation requires an understanding of a species' habitat use. Known populations of the critically endangered western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis) are largely restricted to bushland remnants in rapidly urbanising areas of south-Western Australia. Habitat use is thought to be driven by nutritional content, structure and connectivity of canopy vegetation. At the southernmost extent of the species' range, habitat use is largely unknown, although it is expected to be different from previous descriptions due to differences in vegetation characteristics. We used VHF and global positioning system tracking collars to determine short-term home-range size, diurnal refuge use and night-time tree use of western ringtail possums in bushland remnants within Albany City. Possums had small home ranges (0.88 ha) that were negatively correlated with percentage canopy cover used a variety of daytime refuges (predominantly dreys) and preferentially utilised marri (Corymbia calophylla) and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) at night. These results confirm that differences in habitat use among populations exist and suggests that the species is reasonably flexible in its use of habitat. Management of western ringtail possums needs to be population specific and will benefit from further examination of habitat use in the variety of occupied habitats. © Australian Mammal Society.

TI  - Incorporating landscape diversity into greenway alignment planning
PY  - 2018
AB  - As an important factor of scenic quality and biodiversity along a greenway, landscape diversity has yet to receive as much attention as it deserves. In the practice of greenway alignment planning, it usually gives way to the primary consideration of land suitability. In this article, we aim to make up this missing link. Upon the new concepts and measurement of linear landscape diversity and cellular landscape diversity, we proposed greenway potential index incorporating land suitability and landscape diversity. The greenway potential index was combined with connectivity analysis to connect path between a future greenway's origin and destination that meets both land suitability and landscape diversity requirements. Specially, with Wuchang (Wuhan City, China) as a case study area, we proposed three greenway alignment planning scenarios respectively according to the criteria of suitability, diversity and the synthesis of them. Markedly differences were revealed between the results of suitability greenways and diversity greenways. The results indicate that the tripartite model we proposed is capable of planning a connecting path between a future greenway's origin and destination that not only meets land suitability requirements for greenway construction, but also incorporates as many landscape types of significant difference as possible. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Green economic growth based on urban ecology and biodiversity
PY  - 2020
AB  - This chapter has the objective to analyze the urban ecology, the biological diversity or biodiversity, and their adaptive cycle as the fundamentals of green economic growth. The analysis begins questioning the implications that some assumptions of urban ecology and biodiversity, such as the socio-ecosystems, resilience, ecosystem services, and adaptive cycle have on the creation of green economic growth. A series of different dimensions of resilience are proposed as subsystems that contribute to the general resilience of a system. The method used is the analytical based on a review of the conceptual and theoretical literature. This analysis concludes that the connectivity of processes and functions of urban ecology and biodiversity are relevant to the creation of green economic growth in terms of green economic value. © 2021, IGI Global.

TI  - Habitat recovery and restoration in aquatic ecosystems: current progress and future challenges
PY  - 2016
AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are degraded by a variety of pressures as a result of the growing human population. Global-scale impacts include homogenization of biological communities, removal of top predators and ecosystem engineers, chemical pollution by excess nutrients and contaminants as well as deteriorating structural diversity, connectivity and process dynamics. There is a pressing societal need to reverse the decline in biodiversity and replace lost ecosystem functioning and services in aquatic ecosystems by enabling natural recovery or by active restoration. Common concepts and approaches for conservation, recovery and restoration in freshwater and marine ecosystems, aided by recent advances in ecological theory, include decision criteria on priorities for conservation, harnessing natural recovery by cessation of impacts, restoring connectivity and meso-habitat diversity as well as the geomorphological structural template including hydrodynamic processes. Re-oligotrophication at catchment or regional sea-scale benefits from integrating freshwater and marine restoration. Species or assemblages that convey biogenic structure or act as ecosystem engineers and keystone species should be given priority. Top-down control can be reinstated in closed systems. Differences between freshwater and marine ecosystems include the greater spatial restriction of many species in fresh water, the importance of rooted vegetation and insects in freshwater, and the much greater dispersal and connectivity in marine systems. These differences dictate different approaches, with more scope for active restoration work in fresh water and harnessing natural recovery in marine systems. Restoration schemes need clearly defined target states. They should generally take a process-oriented and stepwise adaptive management approach judging success against reference or control sites. Societal and political expectations need to be managed and restoration schemes should not promise too much. Even minor rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems can put back some biodiversity and key services. Sometimes ´Ersatz´-ecosystems are better than nothing and the best that can be achieved, especially in urban settings. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Remote assessment of locally important ecological features across landscapes: How representative of reality?
PY  - 2015
AB  - The local ecological footprinting tool (LEFT) uses globally available databases, modeling, and algorithms to remotely assess locally important ecological features across landscapes based on five criteria: biodiversity (beta-diversity), vulnerability (threatened species), fragmentation, connectivity, and resilience. This approach can be applied to terrestrial landscapes at a 300-m resolution within a given target area. Input is minimal (latitude and longitude) and output is a computer-generated report and series of maps that both individually and synthetically depict the relative value of each ecological criteria. A key question for any such tool, however, is how representative is the remotely obtained output compared to what is on the ground. Here, we present the results from comparing remotely- vs. field-generated outputs from the LEFT tool on two distinct study areas for beta-diversity and distribution of threatened species (vulnerability), the two fields computed by LEFT for which such an approach is feasible. The comparison method consists of a multivariate measure of similarity between two fields based on discrete wavelet transforms, and reveals consistent agreement across a wide range of spatial scales. These results suggest that remote assessment tools such as LEFT hold great potential for determining key ecological features across landscapes and for being utilized in preplanning biodiversity assessment tools. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Local ecological knowledge reveals combined landscape effects of light pollution, habitat loss, and fragmentation on insect populations
PY  - 2021
AB  - Recent reports of drastic declines in insect populations have raised global concerns about their conservation. Light pollution is a near inseparable feature of human-altered landscapes and is a potential contributing factor to insect declines. However, despite the wide recognition of the deleterious effects of lights on insects, whether these effects scale up to impact insect populations remains unclear. Here, we relied on a combination of ecological niche modeling, geographical information systems, and interviews on local ecological knowledge to assess the synergistic effects of landscape light pollution and habitat loss and fragmentation on populations of the Chocó golden scarab Chrysina argenteola. Sightings of C. argenteola by locals revealed individuals are scarcer in areas with reduced forest cover and rely on inter-patch dispersal to cope with habitat fragmentation, where they were constantly attracted to urban lights. Increasingly lit landscapes had more individuals attracted to lights, but the opposite was true in areas with less than 4 km2 of remaining forest cover. We suggest this pattern arises as landscape light pollution intercepts individuals during inter-patch dispersal. This hinders habitat connectivity, potentially disrupting metapopulation dynamics, being populations inhabiting areas with scarce fragmented habitat more vulnerable to this process. We show light pollution acts in combination with habitat loss and fragmentation in detriment of insect populations at the landscape scale. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Location design of wildlife corridors based on animal movement path identification: A case study of the wuhan-shenzhen highway
PY  - 2016
AB  - Highways are an important landscape type and have brought significant economic benefits to communities. However, highway construction may adversely affect wildlife survival through habitat fragmentation, degradation, loss, and reduced connectivity. This can then lead to declines in wildlife populations and to the loss of biodiversity. Wildlife corridors are thought to be an efficient way to mitigate the isolation and fragmentation of habitat caused by highway construction and can provide safety avenues for wildlife movement between habitat patches, which facilitates gene dispersal and interflow. However, there has been little research on wildlife corridor design in China, compared to the western, developed countries. Most previous studies have focused on theoretical discussions on the types, size, design principles, and procedures for corridor construction, but the location, which is the key factor affecting corridor use by wildlife, has rarely been discussed. We propose a new method, based on animal movement path identification, for wildlife corridor design, and have undertaken a case study of the Wuhan-Shenzhen Highway. Based on previous studies and wildlife resources of the study area, six indicators, which have been shown to significantly affect wildlife habitat selection, were chosen for our habitat suitability model. We used the model and GIS to assess the suitability of wildlife habitat around the highway and then identified the potential movement path of wildlife by using hydrologic analysis. According to that, five ideal locations were suggested by overlaying the movement paths on the highway, and landscape pattern indices were used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed corridor location at the landscape level. Our proposed method could quantitatively reflect the ecological relationship between habitat characteristics and wildlife movement, and the critical areas used by wildlife to cross the highway could be precisely identified. Hence, the proposed corridor location could improve wildlife movement connectivity among spatially separated habitats and effectively alleviate the ecological pressure of habitat fragmentation caused by highway construction. Our proposed method could reduce the influence of subjective factors in the decision-making process, and make it possible to acquire and analyze a large amount of environmental data rapidly by using GIS and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Moreover, by analyzing the landscape patterns of suitable habitats, we could effectively assess the ecological function of the proposed corridor, which was often overlooked in previous studies. Thus, our study could fill a gap in wildlife corridor design, and provide insights for further research related areas, such as urban ecological planning and road network design. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - Threats and their relative severity to wildlife protected areas of Kenya
PY  - 2007
AB  - Little information is available on the threats against biodiversity in Kenya. This is critical in prioritizing conservation strategies and instituting mitigation procedures to contain and or eliminate these threats for the survival of biodiversity in protected areas. This study aimed at documenting relative severity of threats and how serious protected parks are threatened. Two hundred protected area officers were interviewed. The most relatively severe threat factors were bush meat trade; poaching for trophies; human - wildlife conflicts; human population encroachment; loss of migration corridors and dispersal areas. Thirty-two (64%) protected areas were susceptible to over half of the threat factors, while over 70% of them were threatened by an index over 0.5. All marine and nearly all forested/montane protected areas were highly susceptible to the identified threat factors. Further, protected areas popular with tourists were also highly susceptible and threatened. Protected areas around urban/industrial and agricultural areas were threatened mostly by a variety of threat factors. These findings imply that threats to Kenya's protected areas are serious. They are critical in helping the Kenya government to prioritize its strategies in protected areas management, rather than the current haphazard approach. © 2007, Penkala Bt.

TI  - Biodiverse urban forests, happy people: Experimental evidence linking perceived biodiversity, restoration, and emotional wellbeing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Here we investigate whether perceived biodiversity is linked to emotional wellbeing, taking into account the individual level of connection to nature, and whether such relationship is mediated by perceived restorativeness. We exposed participants to urban trails of different biodiversity levels and analysed the data using linear mixed-effects and structural equation models. Our results show that animal diversity and nature relatedness are positively linked to perceived restorativeness that, in turn, increases positive affect and decreases negative affect; thus suggesting that restoration mediates the effect of biodiversity on emotional wellbeing. We also found walk duration is linked to increased positive affect and reduced negative affect while crowdedness level in the trail has the opposite effect. Our results show an important link between urban biodiversity conservation and public mental health. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Urbanization affects oak–pathogen interactions across spatial scales
PY  - 2022
AB  - The world is rapidly urbanizing, thereby transforming natural landscapes and changing the abundance and distribution of organisms. However, insights into the effects of urbanization on species interactions, and plant–pathogen interactions in particular, are lacking. We investigated the effects of urbanization on powdery mildew infection on Quercus robur at continental and within-city scales. At the continental scale, we compared infection levels between urban and rural areas of different-sized cities in Europe, and investigated whether plant traits, climatic variables and CO2 emissions mediated the effect of urbanization on infection levels. Within one large city (Stockholm, Sweden), we further explored whether local habitat features and spatial connectivity influenced infection levels during multiple years. At the continental scale, infection severity was consistently higher on trees in urban than rural areas, with some indication that temperature mediated this effect. Within Stockholm city, temperature had no effect, while local accumulation of leaf litter negatively affected powdery mildew incidence in one out of three years, and more connected trees had lower infection levels. This study is the first to describe the effects of urbanization on plant–pathogen interactions both within and among cities, and to uncover the potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns at each scale.

TI  - Contrasting responses of vascular plants and bryophytes to present and past connectivity in unmanaged grasslands
PY  - 2023
AB  - The area of semi-natural grasslands has decreased dramatically causing many grassland specialist species to persist in small habitat fragments. Furthermore, ecological communities once shaped by disturbances related to traditional agriculture now face the impacts of modern agriculture and urbanization. Many of the species have become endangered due to the combined effects of habitat destruction and degradation. We studied the responses of vascular plants and bryophytes to present and past connectivity in semi-natural grasslands, while accounting for the effects of local environmental conditions. We conducted vegetation surveys in 33 fragmented, unmanaged dry grasslands in Southwest Finland. A total of 191 vascular plant species and 60 bryophyte species were recorded. Higher vascular plant diversity was associated with higher historical connectivity, whereas bryophyte diversity declined with increasing current connectivity. Edaphic conditions, microclimate and disturbances were found to structure both vascular plant and bryophyte communities, but the responses to individual environmental variables were very different. The contrasting responses could be explained by the differences between the typical life-history strategies in vascular plants and bryophytes as well as resource competition between the two groups. These results highlight the need to consider different species groups when planning conservation measures. Vascular plant richness may best be conserved in connected grasslands whereas bryophyte richness in isolated ones. The results also indicated that trampling by humans could result in positive disturbance and to some extent help maintain richness of grassland specialist species. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - History of water sensitive urban design/low impact development adoption in Australia and internationally
PY  - 2018
AB  - Since the 1980s, urban planning and development has increasingly taken account of natural water and nutrient cycles, with water flows managed as would have occurred on the original greenfield site, emulating the original ecosystem. However, other drivers deriving from the impact of urban development and increased human activity include • managing stormwater quality, • mitigating a risk of increased flooding, especially where there had been some previous history of them in the greenfield environment, • harvesting of rainwater and stormwater for potable and nonpotable use, • greening the urban environment to reduce the heat island effect generated by intensive urban development and increased pavements, and • improving the aesthetics of the urban environment to encourage a feeling of well-being in the community. These philosophies were developed in North America as Low Impact Development and later Green Infrastructure (which sometimes also assumes a consideration of energy management) in response to the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act (US). Planning may incorporate green roofs, rain gardens, swales, permeable pavements, wetlands, green spaces, and urban natural vegetation corridors. Britain adopted Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) techniques. In Europe, planners and local government respond to the European Union Water Management and Flooding Directives on a river basin basis. In Australia, similar policy developments took place under the philosophy of Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD). The components and drivers vary between communities, each choosing emphases appropriate to their catchments, infrastructure, seasonal climate, local water cycle, and social expectations. Cities in East Asia have been undergoing rapid urbanization over the past 40 years, often accompanied by increased flooding, especially in China. In 2013, China introduced new urban policies which included the concept of Sponge Cities where “stormwater can be naturally conserved, infiltrated, and purified” for potential reuse, thereby reducing flood risks and increasing water availability. Construction guidelines were issued. Thirty major cities are participating as pilot cities. Each is eligible for central government subsidies. In Africa, the term Water-Sensitive Settlements has been suggested as the WSUD approach as originally envisaged does not take cognizance of the “developmental” or “equity” issues, which are particularly important in developing countries that may have legacies from their colonial or apartheid past. Many countries are now beginning to consider the necessity for WSUD in their cities and settlements. Addressing technical integration problems, legislative constraints, social equity, and community acceptance will be necessary for them to develop Water Sensitive Cities. This chapter summarizes the history of WSUD adoption and examples of the approach that has been taken across the globe. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Acoustic diversity of forested landscapes: Relationships to habitat structure and anthropogenic pressure
PY  - 2022
AB  - Understanding how human-dominated landscapes affect biodiversity and ecosystems is essential for effective conservation planning. This work aims to understand the relationship between the acoustic diversity of forested landscapes, and descriptors of habitat structure, composition, and anthropogenic pressure, as well as to identify the characteristic scale at which acoustic community diversity relates to those metrics in central Massachusetts. Ten passive acoustic recorders were placed within forest areas in central Massachusetts, during the breeding season. Mono audio recordings were collected during the dawn chorus. The relationship between acoustic indices (AI), and core habitat quality, connectivity, vegetation productivity, percent tree cover, human edge, artificial illumination, and traffic noise were assessed. Significant relationships were found between AI and variables related to habitat structure and human pressure. Sounds related to biota (biophony) and acoustic complexity were positively correlated with core habitat quality, connectivity, and vegetation while negatively correlated with human pressure variables, including nighttime lights, traffic noise, and human edge. AI can therefore act as successful indicators of habitat quality in highly modified landscapes The highest correlations were found at buffers between 1.5 and 3 Km. This response of AI to the broad spatial context and not to the local site characteristics indicate that they can act as robust landscape-scale indicators. The large characteristic scale indicates that urban planning should consider potential impacts acting at scales beyond site planning. Moreover, conservation planning can benefit from managing the context matrix to support biodiversity, particularly traffic noise and artificial illumination reduction initiatives. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

PY  - 2020
AB  - Fragmented forests often have conservation value, serving as a refuge or corridors for small mammalian species. In the study, the diversity of mammals was studied within Mizoram University (MZU) campus. Forty-eight plant species from 25 families were recorded on different sites. Thirty quadrates were nested at the locations of occurrence of mammalian species for vegetation type analysis. Schima wallichi was the most dominant plant species with the highest IVI values of (31.7%), followed by Aporosa octandra (22.93%) and Castanopsis tribuloide (21.17%). Camera trap method was used to collect information about the mammalian diversity in the campus. The mammalian species recorded in this study makes 15% of mammalian fauna of the state of Mizoram. Twelve mammal species and six bird species were recorded by the camera traps. With proper awareness among residents of the campus and a planned approach for developmental activities, the findings of our study can make an important extension for the coexistence of mammalian species and long term survivability within MZU campus. © 2020.

TI  - Emerging practices in public space projects: The case of Via Argentina in Panama City
PY  - 2021
AB  - This article uses an urban intervention in Panama City to discuss fundamental concepts in public space projects from a critical and theoretical perspective. First, the functions of the street as a basic structure of public space are illustrated. Its importance is recognized not only as an element of urban connectivity, but also as a place of movement, encounter, support and creation of urban meanings and social identities. Secondly, our case study is contextualized: the urban renewal of via Argentina, a street in the urban center whose environment was in a state of degradation like most streets in the city, largely occupied by the presence of vehicles. The intervention is part of a series of urban projects aimed at improving the physical structure of the city. The third section begins a critical analysis of the actions on Via Argentina, starting with the redistribution of street space, the relationship between vehicles and pedestrians, and the consolidation of public space. Next, we discuss in detail the new primary elements used for the urbanization of the street. Curbs, fords, pavement, rigola, gutters, tree surrounds and bollards become part of a system that must maintain a coherent relationship between all its parts. In addition, emphasis is placed on the design of the ground and the application of the pavement as a tool for the construction of an urban image and identity. Finally, the article ends with an analysis of the parameters of accessibility in the project, relating the concept to the use of the pavement and the configuration in some sections of the street as a single platform. The article uses a wide repertoire of documentary photography to contextualize the case study. © 2021 Universidad de Alcala. All rights reserved.

TI  - How a riparian landscape finds form and comes alive
PY  - 2001
AB  - If we consider riparian areas as landscapes it means that we consider them as entities whose survival depends on ecological as well as on cultural sustainability. Ecological sustainability requires people's understanding of the role of both diversity and connectivity of riparian areas. Cultural sustainability requires people's attention and care towards diversity and connectivity. It is argued that interaction between ecological and cultural sustainabilities governs riparian management, and that we still have to promote such an interaction. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Urban rivers as dispersal corridors for primarily wind-dispersed invasive tree species
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urbanization may have a large affect on biodiversity patterns by enhancing biological invasions. Urban habitats harbour high numbers of introduced plant species and may function as starting points for invasions along urban-rural gradients. As information on underlying mechanisms is critical for managing biological invasions, we test the role of rivers as dispersal corridors for primarily wind-dispersed ornamentals. We released tagged fruits of three invasive tree species in the Spree River (Berlin, Germany) and directly observed the fate of the floating samaras. The number of floating samaras declined exponentially with distance from the release point. A quarter floated 1200 m within 3 h. Despite marked differences in fruit morphology, there were no interspecific differences in floating capacity. We showed hydrochory to be an effective dispersal agent in wind-dispersed tree species, extending wind-related transport distances by several times. In this way, rivers are expected to link urban propagule sources with natural habitats downstream. Our results suggest that planting native tree species along river corridors would help prevent invasion risks and contribute to implementing principles of ecological design in urban greenways and generally consider the importance of eradicating wind-dispersed invasive tree species in floodplains in early invasion stages to prevent further water-mediated dispersal. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Population Genetic Structure of Wild Boars in Poland
PY  - 2018
AB  - The analysis involved wild boars from the Lublin region, Warmia and Mazury, and Wielkopolska. The study material comprised muscle tissue samples collected from 100 wild boars. We analysed loci S0008, SW1129, SW986, SW1465, SW1492, SW1514, SW2532, SW461, SW841, SW2021, and SW2496 [1, 2]. The largest number of specific alleles, i.e. in six loci, was observed in wild boars from Warmia and Mazury; in turn, there were only two alleles in the group of wild boars from Lublin, and no alleles in individuals from Wielkopolska. The average value of the observed heterozygosity was Ho = 0.51, and the average value of expected heterozygosity was He = 0.63. PIC was another analysed indicator, with its lowest value determined for wild boars from the Wielkopolska region (0.53), and the highest value (0.62) was found for the animals from Warmia and Mazury. In the study population of wild boars, we also determined the FST index, which was 0.073, and Nm had a value greater than 3 (3.15); therefore, it can be concluded that the number of migrants per generation was 3. Both coefficients confirm the possibility of gene transfer and reproduction within and between the analysed populations of the wild boars. In our study, we observed a greater genetic distance between the wild boar populations from Wielkopolska and the Lublin and Warmia and Mazury regions in spite of the smaller geographical distance of these lands. This may be caused the less extensive network of ecological corridors as well as the occurrence of anthropogenic barriers e.g. large urban centres, an extensive network of roads, and the high volume of traffic in the direction of the capital. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

TI  - Responses of insectivorous bats and nocturnal insects to local changes in street light technology
PY  - 2019
AB  - Artificial light at night is a pervasive anthropogenic stressor for biodiversity. Many fast-flying insectivorous bat species feed on insects that are attracted to light-emitting ultraviolet radiation (10–400 nm). Several countries are currently focused on replacing mercury vapour lamps, which emit ultraviolet light, with more cost-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) lights, which emit less ultraviolet radiation. This reduction in ultraviolet light may cause declines in insect densities in cities, predatory fast-flying bats, and some edge-foraging and slow-flying bats. Capitalising on a scheme to update streetlights from high ultraviolet mercury vapour to low ultraviolet LED in Sydney, Australia, we measured the activity of individual bat species, the activity of different functional groups and the bat and insect communities, before and after the change in technology. We also surveyed sites with already LED lights, sites with mercury vapour lights and unlit bushland remnants. Species adapted to foraging in cluttered vegetation, and some edge-space foraging species, were more active in unlit bushland sites than in all lit sites and decreased in activity at lit sites after the change to LED lights. The change to LED streetlights caused a decrease in the fast-flying Chalinolobus gouldii but not Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis, the latter being more influenced by seasonal and environmental variables. Insect biomass was not affected by changing light types, but instead was negatively correlated with the moon's percentage illuminance. Changing streetlights to LEDs could result in a decline in some insectivorous bats in cities. This study confirms that unlit urban bushland remnants are important refuges for high bat diversity, particularly for more clutter-adapted species and some edge-space foraging species. Preventing light penetration into unlit bushland patches and corridors remains essential to protect the urban bat community.

TI  - Ten years of pulling: Ecosystem recovery after long-term weed management in Garry oak savanna
PY  - 2019
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is the practice of assisting recovery in degraded ecological com-munities. The aims of restoration are typically broad, involving the reinstatement of composition, structure, function, and resilience to disturbances. One common restoration tactic in degraded urban systems is to control invasive species, relying on passive restoration for further ecosystem-level recovery. Here, we test whether this is an effective restoration strategy in Garry oak savanna, a highly threatened and ecologically important community in the North American Pacific Northwest. In urban savanna pat-ches surrounding Victoria, British Columbia, community members have been actively removing aggressive invasive exotic species for over a decade. Based on vegetation surveys from 2007, we tested ecosystem changes in structure, composition, and resilience (i.e., functional redundancy and response diversity) across 10 years of varied management levels. We expected higher levels of invasive species management would correspond with improvements to these ecosystem metrics. However, management explained little of the patterns found over the 10-year-period. Woody encroachment was a complicated process of native and exotic invasion, while resilience and compositional changes were most closely tied with landscape connectivity. Thus, though invasive species management may prevent further degradation, active restoration strategies after removal are likely required for recovery of the ecosystem. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Establishing the ecological planning principles from empirical studies in agricultural environments of Taiwan
PY  - 2020
AB  - Studies have suggested that the heterogeneity and arrangement of landscape structures are influential to the faunal biodiversity of environments. How does the landscape structure in agricultural landscape arrangements improve the functions of the natural ecosystem? Previous research has uncovered a great amount of information on the relationships between landscape structure and wildlife; however, for landscape designers and planners, such information is site-specific and has limited utilization. Hence, this study aimed to organize and categorize the relationships between environments and biodiversity and transfer this information into design principles in agricultural landscapes. This study attempted to integrate aspects of previous research into a systematic framework. The current study searched literature between 2007 and 2016 from the following journals: Landscape Ecology, Landscape and Urban Planning, and Journal of Applied Ecology. In all, this study collected 58 empirical studies of agricultural environments similar to that of Taiwan and revealed the valuable relationship between wildlife and agricultural environments. The outcomes reviewed from the literature were categorized by semi-natural elements and divided into six sub-categories: forests, hedgerows, grasslands, flowers, water, and heterogeneity of the natural landscape. The landscape attributes that were frequently discussed included patch number, patch area, connectivity, species richness, edge area, distance from semi-natural elements, and complexity. The landscape attributes formed by these elements were organized into a table as a checklist for designers’ convenience. The checklist will help landscape planners and designers to create agricultural landscapes with integral ecosystems.

TI  - Spatial variation in the willingness to accept payments for conservation of a migratory wildlife corridor in the Athi-Kaputiei Plains, Kenya
PY  - 2014
AB  - To be effective in promoting the conservation of migratory wildlife, recipients of payment for ecosystem services (PES) must be willing to accept payment along the entire migratory corridor. This paper investigates spatial variation in willingness to accept (WTA) payments made by the Wildlife Conservation Lease Program in the Athi-Kaputiei plains of Kenya. The program, designed as an incentive to keep land open for wildlife and livestock, offers land owners 10 US$ per ha per year, irrespective of location. We model the relation between WTA and distances to roads, towns and rivers, annual precipitation and slope and display the predicted spatial variation in WTA. The results reveal significant spatial variation in willingness to accept payments for availing land for conservation, with higher WTA concentrated away from roads and also in the Southeast of the plains. The results further suggest that wildlife movement will be blocked due to low WTA in the proximity of towns and tarmacked roads. We conclude that an effective strategy to keep the land open for migratory wildlife should consider spatial variation in WTA payment for land lease. It is suggested to consider stratifying the lease rates geographically to reflect the underlying spatial variation in WTA. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A planning strategy to augment the diversity and biomass of roadside trees in urban Hong Kong
PY  - 1999
AB  - Hong Kong's urban environment has an extremely high development density pervasively filled by buildings and roads. Little ground-level space is left for amenity planting within and without town lots, resulting in a cramped city matrix with inadequate green cover. The community desires for more and better trees for cityscape enhancement and environmental amelioration. A city-wide roadside-tree census was conducted recently together with a survey of potential planting sites (PPS) with a view to augmenting tree biomass and diversity in the long run. Sites with a suitable plantable corridor were evaluated in detail in the field to glean data on growing-space geometry (configuration and dimensions) and qualitative attributes (adjacent land use, building setback, unpaved soil, and air quality). Some 1094 PPS with a total capacity for 12063 trees had been studied. Most PPS are spatially scattered and small, each with <14 trees capacity. A suite of 111 species had been selected for suitable dimensional and amenity attributes to fit the harsh and tight roadside sites, and to avoid the currently rampant discordance between trees and habitats. Environmental conditions within and in the vicinity of individual PPS, with an emphasis on plantable-space geometry, were matched with species characters. A strategy was adopted to maximize final biomass, floristic variety and ornamental functions especially attractive flowers and seasonal changes. A 5 year master planting plan was designed with site-specific species recommendations and a schedule giving priority to tree-deficient and readily-available localities. The landscape in 398 more streets will be improved with congruous trees. A similar green-planning strategy could be applied to other cities with a congested urban morphology.

TI  - LEFT—A web-based tool for the remote measurement and estimation of ecological value across global landscapes
PY  - 2018
AB  - The overall aim in the development of the Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT) was to design a web-based tool that could provide quickly obtained quantitative data on ecological risk to assist landowners when making land-use change decisions. The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool works for almost any region in the world and uses freely available satellite imagery, biotic and abiotic data from existing global databases, models and algorithms to deliver a customised report for a selected area within one hour of job submission. Biotic data automatically obtained for a selected landscape includes terrestrial vertebrate and plant species occurrence data, information on their conservation status and remotely sensed vegetation productivity. Abiotic information obtained includes temperature, precipitation, water availability, insolation, topography, elevation, distribution of urban infrastructure and location of wetlands. The tool performs a number of analyses on the biotic and abiotic data to produce maps for the selected area at a 30 m resolution depicting land cover type, numbers of globally threatened terrestrial vertebrate and plant species, beta-diversity of terrestrial vertebrates and plants, habitat intactness, wetland habitat connectivity, numbers of migratory species and vegetation resilience. Results are also aggregated to produce a summary map demonstrating areas of high and low ecological risk across the selected area. The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool has been designed to be intuitive to use, requiring no specialised software or user expertise. Input is extremely easy and requires the user to highlight the area of interest on a map or using grid co-ordinates. Output is delivered via the web application and comprises a customised PDF containing the maps and a zip file of geographical information system (GIS) data for the area requested. Users may run an unlimited number of LEFT analyses and download reports free of charge. In addition to the free tool described in this paper, there is also a paid service: individual LEFT analyses can be upgraded for a charge to allow access to the geographically subsetted datasets generated for each report. These data are supplied as a zip file containing raster datasets for the layers in the LEFT analysis in GeoTIFF format. These can be opened and queried in a GIS software package. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - A decision support tool for evaluating the wildlife corridor design and conservation performance using analytic network process (ANP)
PY  - 2022
AB  - A recent issue highlights the need for a wildlife corridor to mitigate habitat fragmentation and biodiversity degradation caused by intensive urbanization in the country, such as the development of infrastructure, roads, and highways. Indeed, the issues of frequent road and vehicle-animals collisions are ever-increasing in urban corridors. As a result, flora and fauna populations can become isolated, leading to an unbalanced ecosystem. This study developed the Wildlife Corridor Design and Conservation (WCDC) index, assessment model. The study has investigated the wildlife corridor design and conservation features through a systematic literature review, clustered them into three criteria (biophysical, structural, and environmental designs) and twenty-one sub-criteria. The study applied the Analytic Network Process method to measure the weights of features; habitat preservation (WC1.1 = 0.280), species varieties control (WC1.2.=0187), and conduit for movement (WC1.3. = 0.100) play critical roles in wildlife corridor design and conservation. The Weighted Sum Method verified the WCDC model through a case study (Red Earth overpass, Canada). The model assigns certification labels (Gold, Silver, Bronze, or not-certified); accordingly, it ranked the evaluated site as Gold, which means the Red Earth overpass performs intimately in biophysical, structural, and environmental preservation of mammal habitat. The study conducted regression analysis for model validation, determining a significant association between the base and case-study models. © 2022

TI  - Extent and connectivity of habitat for wolves in eastern North America
PY  - 1998
AB  - We evaluated the extent, distribution, and connectivity of potential habitat for wolves in eastern North America based on land cover and on upper thresholds of road density and human population density that were identified in the recovery plan for the subspecies. Further, we identified potential dispersal habitat for wolves and mapped the extent of connectivity among areas of potentially viable habitat in the eastern United States. We evaluated the extent that corridors link potential habitat in the eastern United States with potential and occupied habitat in eastern Canada (Que., Ont.). Maine and New Hampshire contain 48,787 km 2 of potential wolf habitat, which exceeds by 36% the area of habitat identified for further study in the recovery plan. Habitat in Maine and New Hampshire could support a minimum of 488 wolves, and habitat in the 2 states is contiguous with substantial areas that are suitable for wolves along the Maine border in Quebec, the Gaspe peninsula of Quebec, and New Brunswick. The Adirondack mountain region of New York contains 14,618 km 2 of potential habitat for wolves and would meet only 56% of the area considered necessary by the recovery plan to maintain an isolated wolf population. Habitat in New York is relatively isolated compared to occupied habitat in Canada and potential habitat in Maine and New Hampshire. Potential corridors of core and dispersal habitat may allow movement of wolves from the Saint Lawrence River to suitable habitat in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. However, the permeability of the river to dispersal is questionable and the potential number of dispersing wolves seeking to cross the river from occupied habitat north of Quebec City, Quebec seems limited (Wydeven et el. 1998). International cooperation, public education, public attitudes towards alternative strategies for reestablishing viable populations of wolves, and a better understanding of genetic issues related to the potential for hybridization among colonizing wolves and resident coyotes will be needed to develop a recovery strategy for the timber wolf in the eastern United States.

TI  - Flood control structures in tidal creeks associated with reduction in nursery potential for native fishes and creation of hotspots for invasive species
PY  - 2016
AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem processes yet globally is highly restricted by anthropogenic actions. Anthropogenic barriers are common in aquatic ecosystems; however, the effects of small-scale barriers such as floodgates have received relatively little study. Here we assess fish communities in ten tributaries over the spring–summer season of the lower Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada), five with floodgates and five reference sites without barriers, located primarily in agricultural land use areas. While the Fraser River supports the largest salmon runs in Canada, the lower Fraser river–floodplain ecosystem has numerous dikes and floodgates to protect valuable agricultural and urban developments. Floodgate presence was associated with reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, threefold greater abundance of invasive fish species, and decreased abundances of five native fish species, including two salmon species. These findings provide evidence that floodga...

TI  - Ecosystem services approach to public facility planning
PY  - 2009
AB  - For the City of Damascus, Oregon incorporated in 2004, achieving sustainability includes balancing the preservation of natural capital and ecological services with provision of public facilities and services to support new development. This rural, forested and agricultural rich City is set among volcanic buttes and a network of perennial and ephemeral streams and riparian corridors tributary to the Clackamas River. Current residents value the diversity of the natural landscape for its scenic beauty as well as for its contributions to biodiversity, clean water, clean air, and the rural character of the area, as well as for the opportunities for income from use of their lands from timber sales and agricultural endeavors. These agricultural endeavors range from organic vegetable farms to Christmas tree lots. Inclusion of this area into the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) in 2002 dramatically changed the land use regulations that had previously protected the forest and agricultural uses and opened the door to more intensive residential and commercial development. The focus of this paper is on the conceptual approach to identifying, assessing, and valuing ecosystem services; and on the development of approaches for managing natural capital to provide valued ecological services. ©2009 ASCE.

TI  - Private farmers' compensation and viability of protected areas: The case of Nairobi National Park and Kitengela dispersal corridor
PY  - 2012
AB  - Nairobi National Park (NNP) is unable to incorporate the spatial and temporal dynamics of many migratory mammals that rely on the area as a dry season refuge because of its small size. During the wet season, wildlife must be able to migrate to the south into the Kitengela dispersal area. This area is privately owned and rapidly undergoing land-use change, which affects the structure and function of the dispersal corridors, jeopardising the ecological sustainability of the park. Private landholders in Kitengela incur most of the costs of keeping the dispersal areas open, but do not receive any compensation or revenue from benefits derived from tourism in the park. Here we present an analysis of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for Nairobi and Kitengela residents for a new land management scheme in the dispersal area, in which local pastoralists leave their land open to wildlife and, by not engaging in fencing, land subdivision or poaching activities, receive monetary compensation for the incremental costs derived from use of their properties as a wildlife dispersal area. The results suggest that the aggregated financial support of urban residents might represent around $1.2 million per year for 5 years. This amount exceeds the economic losses caused by wildlife in the dispersal area, and different financial schemes of fund investment and the prioritisation of conservation regions could be implemented to ensure payments and keep the dispersal corridors open in perpetuity. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Matrix mediates avian movements in tropical forested landscapes: Inference from experimental translocations
PY  - 2010
AB  - Maintaining animal movement in fragmented landscapes depends upon the levels of connectivity among habitat patches, which in turn may depend upon the landscape matrix. Little is known about how the matrix affects dispersal abilities, in part because few experimental tests have been conducted. We experimentally translocated 142 migratory American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) and resident Jamaican Todies (Todus todus) 0.6-4 km from their territories across landscapes fragmented by peri-urban development and bauxite mining and continuous forest. Redstarts returned more rapidly and with greater success than todies across all landscapes, with 95% of redstarts returning in an average of 2.5 days versus 60% of todies in >20 days. Return success was best predicted by translocation distance for redstarts and by sex for todies, with a trend of fewer birds returning when released in bauxite landscapes. Return time was strongly affected by matrix type, with both species returning more rapidly in a forested relative to a bauxite matrix and intermediately in a peri-urban matrix. These findings provide strong experimental evidence that land cover surrounding forested habitat influences species mobility. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Social network analysis for poultry HPAI transmission
PY  - 2018
AB  - In this survey study, the networks among poultry farms and related poultry enterprises in two counties in China (Feixi County in Anhui Province and Beizhen city in Liaoning Province) were analysed and evaluated focusing on the connectivity of contacts, movements, and potential pathogen transmission. The Feixi County poultry production network exhibited greater connectivity, which incorporated approximately 94% of the farms interviewed in a major component (a set of connected farms not linked with each other), mainly due to linkages of backyard farms through local produce stores and individual agents, whilst the Beizhen City network was more fragmented owing to independent in-house operations (from breed, raise, to slaughter and process) of a few large companies, with multiple smaller components. A range of factors influencing the contacts/movements among farms (act as bridges) were identified in this study. Ability to predict the pathway with the network characteristics on the basis of the factors, such as entity type and geographic location, is useful for developing risk-based approaches for disease prevention, surveillance, early detection, and effective controlling. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

TI  - The Impact of Urban Expansion on Plant Diversity Change in Karst Regions of Southwest China
PY  - 2022
AB  - Biodiversity is vital for the integrity and stability of ecosystems and sustainable development. Karst regions of Southwest China is featured for undulating and broken karst terrain as well as high plant diversity. Land use changes induced by the growing population and expanding human settlement have threatened biodiversity preservation in this region. However, the impact of urban expansion on plant diversity remains unclear here. This study focuses on how expanding countryside landscapes affect the recovery rate of plant diversity and demonstrate how urban expansion affects plant diversity conservation in karst regions of Southwest China. In situ biodiversity investigations and multisource remote sensing images were combined to analyze the role of human settlement evolution in the conservation of plant diversity using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Unmanned vehicle images, historical aerial photographs, and long-term remote sensing images were used to observe the human settlement pattern changes over 40 yr and found that plant diversity is restored faster in countryside ecosystems than in island ecosystems restricted by water. Forests, however, contribute the most to plant diversity conservation in both ecosystems. While the forest area is stable during urban expansion, massive forest patches play an essential role in plant diversity conservation. Arable lands and grasslands shrank but with a fragmenting trend, which was conducive to preserving plant diversity, whereas increased and regularized large patches of built-up areas were not beneficial to plant diversity. Accordingly, forest protection should be prioritized to coordinate future socioeconomic development and plant diversity conservation in karst and broader regions. Furthermore, large built-up patches should be limited, and the irregularity should be improved during urban expansion. Irregular shaped cultivated land and grassland were suggested to promote biological information exchanges as landscape corridors. © 2022, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Informing conservation decisions to target private lands of highest ecological value and risk of loss
PY  - 2022
AB  - Natural habitats on private lands are potentially important components of national biodiversity conservation strategies, yet they are being rapidly lost to development. Conservation easements and other means of protecting these habitats have expanded in use and will be most effective if they target private lands of highest biodiversity value and risk of loss. We developed a Biodiversity Conservation Priority Index (BCPI) based on ecological value and risk of habitat loss for remaining areas of natural vegetation cover (NVC) in the northwestern United States and addressed two questions: (1) Which remaining NVC on private lands is the highest priority for biodiversity conservation based on ecological value and risk of development? And (2) are conservation easements in NVC placed preferentially in locations of high biodiversity conservation priority? Drawing on the concept of ecological integrity, we integrated five metrics of ecological structure, function, and composition to quantify ecological value of NVC. These included net primary productivity, species richness, ecosystem type representation, imperiled species range rarity, and connectivity among \"Greater Wildland Ecosystems.\" Risk of habitat loss was derived from analysis of biophysical and sociodemographic predictors of NVC loss. Ecological value and risk of loss were combined into the BCPI. We then analyzed spatial patterns of BCPI to identify the NVC highest in biodiversity conservation priority and examined the relationship between BCPI and conservation easement status. We found that BCPI varied spatially across the study area and was highest in western and southern portions of the study area. High BCPI was associated with suburban and rural development, roads, urban proximity, valley bottom landforms, and low intensity of current development. Existing conservation easements were distributed more towards lower BCPI values than unprotected NVC at both the study area and region scales. The BCPI can be used to better inform land use decision making at local, regional, and potentially national scales in order to better achieve biodiversity goals.

TI  - Ancient Burial Mounds – Stepping Stones for Semi-Natural Habitats in Agricultural Landscape
PY  - 2020
AB  - Recent agricultural intensification followed by land homogenization require for connectivity of remaining semi-natural habitats for biodiversity preservation. This study is the first attempt to assess the importance of Bulgarian ancient burial mounds (kurgans) as refuges for seminatural vegetation and for the connectivity to other semi-natural lands based on remote sensing data. A set of 509 kurgans were selected and their main vegetation cover and the landscape within 200 m surrounding buffer were studied. The general kurgan characteristics as height and diameter of the base resemble dimensions reported for Ukraine and Hungary. Our results show the high level of kurgan isolation in Bulgaria. More than the half of the studied kurgans surroundings are occupied by over 75% of agricultural and urban or other artificial landscape. This finding emphasizes the kurgans’ role for preservation of semi-natural habitats and their inhabitants. We highlight the importance of Bulgarian kurgans that save a cumulative area of semi-natural type equal to the 0.09% of the whole country territory. Kurgans could be treated as relictual landscape in highly modified matrix. The importance of kurgans for biodiversity conservation should encourage the local community to increase the education and activities for proper management ensuring their further protection. © 2020.

TI  - Fragment shape and size, landscape permeability and fragmentation level as predictors of primate occupancy in a region of Brazilian Cerrado
PY  - 2020
AB  - Human activities result in the formation of a mosaic of forest patches within a non-habitat matrix. The response of the local biodiversity to changes in land-use may occur at different scales. It is important to evaluate the effects of the attributes of both the patches and the surrounding landscape on the occupancy of forest patches by animal populations. Here, we assessed the predictive potential of local (basal area, tree density), patch (size, shape) and landscape scale (total area of forest, number of patches, matrix permeability, patch proximity) variables on the occupancy of forest patches by the syntopic primates Alouatta caraya, Sapajus libidinosus and Callithrix penicillata in the city of Goiânia in the Cerrado region of central Brazil. We used playback to survey primate populations in 22 focal patches and assessed the landscape within a 1000 m buffer zone around each site. In A. caraya, occupancy was influenced by the shape of the focal patches, the amount of forest and fragmentation level of the landscape. Focal patch size and the permeability of the matrix were the principal determinants of the occupancy of S. libidinosus. None of the predictors influenced patch occupancy in C. penicillata, and the structure of the vegetation did not influence occupancy in any of the species. The preservation of as many forest patches as possible, both large and small, as well as gallery forests, and the enhancement of matrix permeability will be essential for the long-term conservation of the syntopic primates of the Cerrado of central Brazil. © 2020, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

TI  - Butterfly extirpations, discoveries and rediscoveries in Singapore over 28 years
PY  - 2018
AB  - Habitat loss and urbanisation in the tropics have been recognised as major drivers of species extinctions. Concurrently, novel habitats such as urban parks have been shown to be important as habitats and stepping stones in urban ecosystems around the world. However, few studies have assessed long-term patterns of species extinctions and discoveries in response to these drivers in the tropics. We know little about long-term persistence and utility of novel habitats in tropical urban ecosystems. In this study, we produced an updated and exhaustive butterfly checklist of species recorded from Singapore till December 2017 to investigate trends in butterfly extirpations (local extinctions), discoveries (new country records) and rediscoveries and how these relate to land use change in 28 years (1990–2017) in Singapore. Up to 144 butterfly species were identified to be extirpated in Singapore by 1990. From 1990–2017, an additional nine butterfly extirpations have potentially occurred, which suggests a maximum of 153 butterfly extirpations to date. The rate of extirpations between 1990 to 2017 (< 0.33 extirpations per year) was much lower than the rate of extirpations between 1926 to 1989 (> 1.52 extirpations per year). The majority of potentially extirpated butterflies between 1990 to 2017 were species restricted to mature forests. Over this period, 51 new species were discovered, while 65 species were rediscovered, which collectively represent 24% of the total and 35% of the extant butterfly fauna of Singapore. Interestingly, 33% of discovered species were only observed in degraded secondary forests or urban parks in Singapore, the former maturing with age and the latter having increased in area during the same time period. We hypothesise that the current slowdown in butterfly extirpations may be representative of habitat recovery and/or improved habitat connectivity, lower undetected extirpations, and/or lengthening of extinction debts. A slowdown in extirpations and an increased utilisation of novel habitats by discovered species present a window of conservation opportunity to restore native habitats and increase habitat connectivity among existing patches of managed vegetation. © National University of Singapore.

TI  - Shrubby Tree Component Of Riparian Corridors In Restoration And Natural Remaining Areas Of Matrix Forestry, Rio Negrinho, SC State
PY  - 2014
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the shrubby tree component in riparian corridors in restoration process and natural remainders in a matrix forestry. We identified the richness, diversity, dispersal and pollination syndromes of the individuals and estimate the foristic similarity. The study was conducted at the producing farm of Pinus spp. wood Santa Alice, located in Rio Negrinho city, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. We adopted the center-quarter method for survey the shrubby tree component in four sample groups: CA (advanced stage of riparian corridors vegetation), CR (riparian corridors in restoration), MA (advanced stage of natural remaining), MI (intermediate stage of natural remaining). We found the highest richness and diversity index in MA and CR. Regarding the number of individuals, the dispersal and pollination syndromes predominant in all sample groups were zoochory and zoophilia. CR and CA had the highest percentage of floristic similarity while MA and MI did not form clusters. The sample group CR has composition, richness and diversity more similar to CA. This indicates that the restoration of riparian zones has conditions to rescue the components and the interactions of an ecological community.

TI  - Main roads and land cover shaped the genetic structure of a Mediterranean island wild boar population
PY  - 2022
AB  - Patterns of genetic differentiation within and among animal populations might vary due to the simple effect of distance or landscape features hindering gene flow. An assessment of how landscape connectivity affects gene flow can help guide management, especially in fragmented landscapes. Our objective was to analyze population genetic structure and landscape genetics of the native wild boar (Sus scrofa meridionalis) population inhabiting the island of Sardinia (Italy), and test for the existence of Isolation-by-Distance (IBD), Isolation-by-Barrier (IBB), and Isolation-by-Resistance (IBR). A total of 393 Sardinian wild boar samples were analyzed using a set of 16 microsatellite loci. Signals of genetic introgression from introduced non-native wild boars or from domestic pigs were revealed by a Bayesian cluster analysis including 250 reference individuals belonging to European wild populations and domestic breeds. After removal of introgressed individuals, genetic structure in the population was investigated by different statistical approaches, supporting a partition into five discrete subpopulations, corresponding to five geographic areas on the island: north-west (NW), central west (CW), south-west (SW), north-central east (NCE), and south-east (SE). To test the IBD, IBB, and IBR hypotheses, we optimized resistance surfaces using genetic algorithms and linear mixed-effects models with a maximum likelihood population effects parameterization. Landscape genetics analyses revealed that genetic discontinuities between subpopulations can be explained by landscape elements, suggesting that main roads, urban settings, and intensively cultivated areas are hampering gene flow (and thus individual movements) within the Sardinian wild boar population. Our results reveal how human-transformed landscapes can affect genetic connectivity even in a large-sized and highly mobile mammal such as the wild boar, and provide crucial information to manage the spread of pathogens, including the African Swine Fever virus, endemic in Sardinia. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Environmental indicators in forest fragments from urban watersheds
PY  - 2018
AB  - Accelerated urbanization in Brazil promoted the rapid growth of cities and, in most cases, was not based on adequate land use planning. The result was the intense fragmentation of the landscape, causing the destruction and fragmentation of forest habitats, which were restricted to small and isolated remnants. In this sense, the present study promoted an analysis of the environmental quality of vegetation fragments in the sub-basins of Ribeiraõ Anhumas, Campinas, Saõ Paulo, Brazil by calculating and interpreting the circularity index (CI), in order to define the format of the fragments, connectivity/isolation and the use and occupation of the environment as well as area and location, in order to promote the diagnosis and identification of priority areas for the implementation of restoration and environmental management actions. It was identified, therefore, that the remaining vegetation of the upper, middle and lower sub-basins is divided between small and medium unconnected fragments of which 56.2% and 24.2% presented an elongated and moderately elongated shape, respectively, and, therefore, high susceptibility to external interference and edge effects. On the other hand, high urbanization evidenced mainly in the high-level limits forest management projects, since the fragments are surrounded by built areas. © 2018 WIT Press.

TI  - The current use of indigenous trees on irish golf courses
PY  - 2010
AB  - In Ireland the profile of golf has increased significantly over the last decade. Today golf course superintendents are aware of the need to manage their golf courses in an environmentally friendly manner, to improve existing habitats, plant indigenous trees to increase biodiversity and create wildlife reservoirs. Four parkland golf courses comprising two rural (Gowran Park, \"K Club\") and two urban/ (Elm Park, and Rockmount) were selected to determine the range, selection, management and use of native Irish trees on Irish golf courses in 2005. The courses were selected on the basis of their age, location and land area. A system was developed to grade native material based on the number of insects that different trees support, thus valuing the potential of a particular tree species on its ability to increase biodiversity. Using this method, a table was developed to classify the biodiversity potential of the existing trees on each of the four golf courses. The results show that native Irish tree species such as Quercus, Salix and Betula support more than two hundred insect species while Fraxinus, Sorbus and Taxus support between ten and sixty nine. It was also found that the cultivation of native trees on Irish golf courses was low, with non-native material accounting for most of the tree species found in each of the golf courses thereby limiting the potential to enhance biodiversity. The haphazard nature of the plantings and the lack of connectivity between tree stands indicated little planning of new planting schemes. It is recommended that native trees with local provenance be planted on Irish golf courses to increase biological diversity to create an environment where land use and habitat work harmoniously.

TI  - To Preserve Green Buffer under Polarization and Diffusion Effects of a Fast-Developing Megalopolis
PY  - 2022
AB  - The polarization and diffusion effects of landscape patterns are important features of megalopolis development. Under the urbanized effects, green space is a key spatial unit in delivering vital ecosystem services for sustainable urban planning. However, currently, fast urban developing is swamping the green space. In this study, by tracing landscape pattern changes of a fast-developing megalopolis, the Chengdu-Chongqing Megalopolis in the southeast of China, and using land-use data from 1980 to 2020, we aimed to determine the polarization and diffusion effects of the megalopolis and their impacts on the green space within and between the cities. We found that: (1) during the past four decades, spatial expansion of the megalopolis mainly occupied grassland and farmland, trig-gering an increase in landscape fragmentation; (2) based on socio-economic indicators, the spatial-attraction network analysis showed a significant polarization effect; however, based on the natural landscape, this analysis demonstrated a more scattered pattern; (3) importantly, the megalopolis developed at quite a similar pace, which caused the green rural area between the central cities demon-strating an encroached trend by the urbanization. To promote sustainability of the fast-developing megalopolis, we suggest that the boundary of the green space should be broadened to form a green network in which natural green space and urban green space are interconnected, improving the connectivity of habitats within the megalopolis for urban biodiversity. Our study implied that main-taining the green buffer shall be considered in advance for sustainable megaregional planning and establishing resilience of the fast-developing megalopolis. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Are plant communities mainly determined by anthropogenic land cover along urban riparian corridors?
PY  - 2016
AB  - Often used as a mitigation tool to landscape fragmentation, urban riparian corridors also suffered from the effects of the urban expansion. This study explored the relationships between plant riparian communities and two major environmental variables (land cover, soil characteristics) and analyzed the floristic change along an urbanization gradient. Fifteen sites were surveyed on both riverbanks of two riparian corridors characterized by contrasting water regimes in Strasbourg, North Eastern France. Data of spontaneous species abundance was collected from 180 quadrats using (i) all plant species, (ii) herbaceous stratum and (iii) ligneous stratum (bush and tree). The diversity and compositional patterns of riparian plant species were analyzed within each corridor according to three levels of urbanization (urban, suburban, peri-urban). Relationships between riparian communities, land cover and soil chemical properties (pH, nitrogen and carbon content, moisture) were established by between-class co-inertia analyses. Land cover emerged as the main factor explaining changes in riparian communities along the rural–urban gradient while soil chemical properties discriminate water stress and fluvial dynamics of the two corridors. Similar compositional patterns were found within the most urbanized sites with the establishment of ubiquitous species. The herbaceous stratum is best linked to the level of urbanization, whereas the tree stratum is primarily correlated with corridor attributes (hydrological regime, soil properties). Although riparian species and communities are mainly determined by land cover, urban riparian corridors maintain native biodiversity up to the urban center.

TI  - River-valleys as an intra-city natural feature
PY  - 2007
AB  - Intra-city natural structures have always had a key role in creating sustainable urban greenspaces. Adapting to natural features and relating the intra-city greenspaces to such natural structures as river-valleys, hillsides, lakes and forests, guarantee the endurance, sustainability and longevity of the natural quality of city. This paper looks at intra-city natural structures which have undergone wholesale changes and been ruined, and considers the lives of these invaluable natural structures which have been endangered due to gross human interference and pressure, regardless of physical and biological features. River-valleys in Tehran have always had a significant role in offering valuable bio-environmental services to the city. From the time of Qadjar era, villages enjoying favorable climate were built outside the city, and the villa of the governors and affluent people were built near hillsides across river-valleys because of the abundance of running water, cool weather in the summer and natural plant life. Little by little green corridors of Shemiranat were built near river-valleys, which formed the axes of the development of the city at the time Pahlavi dynasty. From then, the development of the city towards hillsides, regardless of these natural structures, increased and the destruction of these urban natural spaces have posed serious problems nowadays. Familiarity with these natural structures, their preservation and organization, and making the optimum use of them seem to be a very critical issue. Taking an ecological approach in this paper, is an attempt to look at the intra-city river-valleys. To do so, the data collected from a natural river-valley is used as evidence to back up any claims made in this regard.

TI  - Vegetation of road verges on an urbanisation gradient in Potchefstroom, South Africa
PY  - 2000
AB  - A vegetation survey of road verges along an urban to rural gradient in the Potchefstroom Municipal Area was conducted. Important applications of these studies include understanding of the role of indigenous (native) and exotic species in the overall synanthropisation of vegetation. The present study forms part of a research programme on spontaneous vegetation in urban open spaces in the North-West Province of South Africa. A numerical classification technique (TWINSPAN) was used as a first approximation and the classification was refined using Braun-Blanquet procedures. The result is a phytosociological table from which 13 plant communities and seven sub-communities were recognised. Although some of these communities and subcommunities are similar to previously described vegetation types in natural and disturbed areas, most of them were not described before in South Africa. Two ordination scatter diagrams show the distribution of the plant communities along gradients which were related to the depth of the soil water table, habitat type, trampling, soil compaction and percentage of gravel in the soil surface. Similarities between roadside vegetation in this study and those overseas are discussed, as well as the possible role of road verges as dispersal corridors between natural and disturbed areas.

TI  - The importance of traffic corridors as urban habitats for plants in Finland
PY  - 2008
AB  - Traffic corridors have been recognized as floristically rich with endangered and rare species included. The aim of this study is to treat traffic corridors as habitats and estimate their importance for diversity of vascular plants on municipal level. The material is derived from the comprehensive studies of urban floras in the cities of Vantaa, Kerava and Järvenpä ä during the 1990s in southern Finland. The material consists of over 190,000 species records (704-771 species). The material was divided in two groups: the ones with occurrences in traffic corridors (TC) and the others with no occurrences (NTC). The percentage of the traffic corridor plants of the total flora is almost the same in all the three cities: two thirds in traffic corridors and one third not in traffic corridors. The explanation may be the general floristic similarity of the cities. The two groups differ ecologically from each other. The association of plants with traffic corridors varies according to the ecology of the species. About 100 plants have more than 50% of their occurrences in traffic corridors. In Järvenpää, a group of four Carex-species was intensively mapped. 46 occurrences out of 50 were found in traffic corridors. A case study showed the difficulties in management of endangered species on a roadside site. The usual extensive management techniques were not sustainable for the survival of the species. Instead, a much more intensive management was needed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - The influence of urban land use on seed dispersal and wetland invasibility
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urban habitats are generally considered highly invaded by exotic species due to the frequency and extent of disturbance caused by human activities and development. Our previous study had demonstrated that forested wetlands within residential areas are more extensively invaded than wetlands within industrial-commercial areas. In this study, we investigate whether the structure of the forest edge and seed dispersal can explain the differential in the invasion of wetlands surrounded by industrial and residential land use. Our results indicate that edges of industrially bordered wetlands are denser, with vegetation concentrated at the boundary of tree growth, whereas the edges of residentially bordered wetlands are more open and diffuse. This difference influences the number of seeds and species capable of dispersing into the wetland. Less dense edges resulted in a higher number of seeds entering residential wetlands; however, there were no differences in the numbers of exotic seeds or exotic species in the seed rain residential and industrial wetlands. Although seed dispersal could not directly explain differences in the current extent of invasion of these sites, seed dispersal did follow corridor pathways, including ditches and trails that breach the edges and extend through the wetlands. These disturbances act as corridors for seed dispersal into both types wetlands and may play a role in introducing new species to the interior of the wetland, an outcome supported by a higher number of exotic species in the seed banks of residential sites. Our results suggest that both the type of adjoining land use and the provision of access to people on trails in urban wetlands can affect the composition of these communities. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Habitat filtering and adult dispersal determine the taxonomic composition of stream insects in an urbanizing landscape
PY  - 2015
AB  - Suitability of the local habitat ('habitat filtering') and dispersal between stream reaches determines the composition of insect communities, and urban land use may affect both processes. While urban streams are often poor habitats for insects and dispersal between them is often hindered, conservation and restoration activities generally focus solely on the local (in-stream) environment. We determined whether in-stream habitat filtering (a 'local' process) or dispersal between reaches (a 'regional' process) controlled assemblage composition in a landscape subject to ongoing urban development ('urbanizing'). We compared models incorporating geographic distance between sites, environmental dissimilarity, and land-use/land-cover attributes of dispersal pathways in an attempt to explain the dissimilarity of stream insect assemblages. Distance and land-use/land-cover attributes were characterised along both overland (straight line) and corridor pathways. Both in-stream habitat filtering and dispersal affected assemblage composition, but habitat had a stronger influence. Overland distance was a better predictor of assemblage dissimilarity than corridor distance, implying stream insect dispersal occurs across catchment boundaries as well as along stream corridors. The best model incorporated land-use/land-cover attributes along dispersal pathways, which supported the idea that urban land-use in the terrestrial environment mediates dispersal. Conservation and restoration strategies for streams in urbanizing landscapes that focus on local habitat quality and ignore dispersal are missing a potentially important mechanism affecting insect assemblage composition. While the primary focus should be on maintaining or improving the local habitat, potential dispersal pathways should also be considered. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Connectivity of tiger (Panthera tigris) populations in the human-influenced forest mosaic of central India
PY  - 2013
AB  - Today, most wild tigers live in small, isolated Protected Areas within human dominated landscapes in the Indian subcontinent. Future survival of tigers depends on increasing local population size, as well as maintaining connectivity between populations. While significant conservation effort has been invested in increasing tiger population size, few initiatives have focused on landscape-level connectivity and on understanding the effect different landscape elements have on maintaining connectivity. We combined individual-based genetic and landscape ecology approaches to address this issue in six protected areas with varying tiger densities and separation in the Central Indian tiger landscape. We non-invasively sampled 55 tigers from different protected areas within this landscape. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian genetic assignment tests indicate long-range tiger dispersal (on the order of 650 km) between protected areas. Further geo-spatial analyses revealed that tiger connectivity was affected by landscape elements such as human settlements, road density and host-population tiger density, but not by distance between populations. Our results elucidate the importance of landscape and habitat viability outside and between protected areas and provide a quantitative approach to test functionality of tiger corridors. We suggest future management strategies aim to minimize urban expansion between protected areas to maximize tiger connectivity. Achieving this goal in the context of ongoing urbanization and need to sustain current economic growth exerts enormous pressure on the remaining tiger habitats and emerges as a big challenge to conserve wild tigers in the Indian subcontinent. © 2013 Joshi et al.

TI  - Spatial Effects of Landscape Patterns of Urban Patches with Different Vegetation Fractions on Urban Thermal Environment
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The landscape patterns of urban green spaces have been proven to be important factors that affect urban thermal environments. However, the spatial effect of the landscape patterns of urban patches with different vegetation densities on land surface temperature (LST) has not been investigated in detail. In this study, the built-up area of Xuzhou City was taken as the study region, and the four phases of Landsat 8 images and their corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020 were selected as the basic data. Normalized spectral mixture analysis and an improved mono-window algorithm were used to invert the vegetation component fraction (VF) and LST maps of the study area, respectively, and the surface patches were classified into five levels according to the VF values, from low to high. Four landscape-level and five class-level metrics were then selected to represent the landscape characteristics of each VF-level patch. The tested values of 60 and 780 m were regarded as the best grain size and spatial extent, respectively, in the calculation of all landscape metrics of ALL VF-level patches (VFLM) using the moving-window method. The results of bivariate Moran’s I for VFLM and LST showed the following: (1) for landscape-level metrics, only the Shannon diversity index and patch diversity have substantial negative spatial correlations with LST (with average |Moran’s I| &lt; 0.2), indicating that the types of VF levels and the number of patches exert weak negative effects on the thermal environment for a certain area; (2) for class-level metrics such as percentage of landscape, patch cohesion index, largest patch index, landscape shape index, and aggregation index, only the class-level metrics of sub-high VF (LV4) and extreme-high (LV5) VF levels patches have significant negative spatial correlations with LST (with high Moran’s I value, and high–high and low–high distributions in local indications of spatial association cluster maps), indicating that only the patches of high VF levels can effectively alleviate LST and that patch proportion, natural connectivity degree, predominance degree, shape complexity, and aggregation degree are important landscape factors for regulating the thermal environment. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression were applied to determine the impact weights of the class-level VFLMs of LV4 and LV5 patches on LST, which revealed the contributions of these landscape metrics to mitigating the urban heat island effect (UHI). These results signify the importance of and differences in the spatial patterns of various VF-level patches for UHI regulation; these patterns can provide new perspectives and references for urban green space planning and climate management.</jats:p>

TI  - Biodiversity in the coastal ecosystems of small islands and its conservation status
PY  - 2021
AB  - Around 77% of Indonesian islands is small islands and Indonesia known as mega biodiversity center, but coastal biodiversity of small islands was not well documented. The objective of this study is to assess coastal biodiversity in small islands and its conservation status. The study indicated that small islands provide complex biodiversity ranging from ecosystem to species. Diversity index of mangrove: 1.4-1.8, seagrass: 1.5-1.9, coral: 1.7-2.3. Ecosystem condition in urban small island was poor and in rural small island was healthy. The islands also provide fauna diversity i.e mollusc (110 species), crabs (52 species), and coral fish (261 species). Diversity of mollusc and crabs in rural island was higher than in urban island, ?2 (1) = 1.3, p< 0.001 and ?2 (1) = 4.3, p< 0.002, respectively. Diversity index of coral fish range from 2.14 to 4.27 (mean: 3.4). Most of the biodiversity located outside protected area and main threats were ecosystem degradation, pollution, overexploitation, and sedimentation. In conclusion, small islands are important coastal biodiversity spots, but it faces tremendous threats. The study recommends better management of coastal biodiversity i.e. establishing coastal protected areas in small islands, building marine corridor, and public awareness to ensure biodiversity conservation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Wildlife‐Habitat Restoration in an Urban Park in Southern California
PY  - 1994
AB  - Within an urban park in southern California, the relationship between the structure and floristics of vegetation and the distribution, abundance, and behavior of wildlife was studied in relatively undisturbed areas (San Luis Rey) and in contiguous areas (Guajome Park) in need of restoration. These data were used to develop recommendations for the enhancement of native animal species in the park. The abundance of amphibians and reptiles was highest in native upland scrub and willow (Salix)‐riparian vegetation types, and lowest in dry, disturbed sites. Western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) were the most abundant reptile throughout both study areas. Overall, bullfrogs (Rana catesbiana), an exotic species, were the dominant amphibians; the native Pacific treefrog (Hyla regilla) was rare throughout. At both study areas, the small mammal community was dominated by western harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis) and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and, to a lesser extent, by brush mice (P. boylii) and exotic house mice (Mus musculus). Negative correlations in abundance existed between house mice and harvest mice, and between house mice abundance and overall small mammal abundance. In riparian sites, cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and various height classes of willow were the dominant factors in the majority of bird abundance–habitat‘correlations and where foraging activities were concentrated. Recommendations for enhancing native animal species include reduction of marsh sedimentation, removal of feral species, and development of connections between the park and nearby natural areas. A corridor of native riparian vegetation (primarily cottonwood‐willow) should be developed to replace the existing agricultural fields, thereby linking Guajome with the San Luis Rey River.

TI  - New forces influencing savanna conservation: increasing land prices driven by gentrification and speculation at the landscape scale
PY  - 2021
AB  - Land transformation reduces biodiversity and regional sustainability, with land price being an indicator of the opportunity cost to a landowner of resisting land conversion. However, reliable spatially explicit databases of current land prices are generally lacking in developing countries. We used tools from data science to scrape 1,487 georeferenced land prices in southern Kenya from the internet. Prices were higher for land near cities and in areas of high agricultural productivity, but also around the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Predicted land prices ranged from US$662 to US$4,618,805 per acre. Land speculation associated with expanding urbanization increases the opportunity and acquisition costs of maintaining conservation buffer zones, corridors, and dispersal areas. However, high land values are also found adjacent to a world-famous tourist destination. Profit-driven turnover of ownership, subdivision, and transformation of land is occurring at a rapid pace in southern Kenya, to the detriment of savanna biodiversity and the sustainability of the pastoral social–ecological system.

TI  - Population Genomic Analysis of the Blue Crab Callinectes sapidus Using Genotyping-By-Sequencing
PY  - 2017
AB  - Previous genetic studies of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts have reported weak or temporally variable spatial structure, suggesting high gene flow among distant populations possibly facilitated by long-distance larval dispersal or other features of blue crab life history. The use of relatively few genetic markers, however, may have limited power to detect subtle but significant structure that could inform fisheries management. In this study, the potential for genome-scale datasets to uncover subtle patterns of population structure in the blue crab was examined using a high-throughput genotyping approach (genotyping-by-sequencing) that generated data for more than 9,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in crabs from three populations: Panama City Beach, FL, Agawam River, MA, and Porto Alegre, Brazil. Principle components analyses among the three populations revealed very distinct clustering of the Brazilian samples from U.S. populations, likely reflecting restricted gene flow across the equator. Detailed analysis of population structure between the two U.S. populations revealed low but significant genetic differentiation (FST = 0.0103), with FST values ranging from -0.05 to 0.48. Previous studies have failed to detect significant genetic structure on a similar geographic scale. FST outlier analysis identified 242 loci (2.45% of total) with statistically extreme values at the false discovery rate α = 0.05 level, only 16 of which showed significant sequence homology to annotated proteins via BLASTx alignment. Top BLASTx hits were to crustacean or arthropod sequences and 8 of the 16 had high sequence similarity to transposable elements or related machinery. Finally, results of population assignment tests for the two U.S. populations showed that the full marker dataset provided good power to assign individuals back to their population of origin (∼83% and 92% success for Panama City Beach and Agawam River, respectively), which dropped significantly when using only 500 randomly selected SNPs (∼61% and 72% success). Overall, this study demonstrates the great utility of high-throughput sequencing technologies for characterizing fine-scale patterns of genetic structure in blue crabs, and this approach should substantially improve the delineation of stock structure and further advance our understanding of blue crab population connectivity and ecology.

TI  - Assessing spatial population structure and heterogeneity in the dronefly
PY  - 2015
AB  - In order to secure pollination services and improve conservation strategies, a better understanding of factors influencing population structure of pollinator species is vital. Here, we aimed to empirically evaluate various individual- and population-based statistical methods for characterization of genetic structure of the widespread dronefly, Eristalis tenax. Thirty-five European populations, comprising 888 individuals, were genotyped at five polymorphic allozyme loci. Three Bayesian genotypic clustering approaches (STRUCTURE, BAPS and Geneland), pairwise FST estimates, analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA), principle component analysis (PCA) and Mantel tests were applied in a comparative way in attempt to reveal the patterns of gene flow that occurs at various spatial scales in E.tenax. STRUCTURE analysis and PCA results provided no evidence of conspecific differentiation. In contrast, BAPS and Geneland clustering solutions did acknowledge low but significant proportion of among-populations genetic variation revealed by AMOVA. Similarly, pairwise FST estimates partially argue against genetic homogeneity across Europe. The lack of correlation between genetic distance and both latitude and longitude variation suggests that the flies disperse in multiple directions. Therefore, our results indicate that continued long-range dispersal tend to homogenize populations over time, resulting in little population structure in E.tenax across the European landmass. On the other hand, significant differentiations between geographically proximate populations indicate that dispersal potential may not be realized and that gene flow patterns in E.tenax might be geographically complex. Using information from our genetic approaches will be useful for identifying patterns of migration and population connectivity across continent, which is an important issue for conservation efforts. Since E.tenax is an important pollinator, our results contribute to understanding the potential extent to which this taxon can facilitate gene flow among plant populations across natural and semi-natural habitats, agroecosystems and urban environments. Dronefly-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant-dronefly conservation will require large-scale action. © 2015 The Zoological Society of London.

TI  - Wetland Network Design for Mitigation of Saltwater Intrusion by Transferring Tidal Discharge
PY  - 2012
AB  - With the interactions of river discharge and tide, the balances between water and saline in estuaries are helpful for maintaining biodiversity and landscape diversity. However, the delicate balances have been broken in many estuaries especially in some areas where prosperous cities have been developed. Saltwater intrusion causes serious adverse effects on estuary ecosystems in Pearl River estuary (PRE), China. This paper tries to use a wetland network which is a methodology to divert saltwater to explain how to address the adverse effects of saltwater intrusion and aims to mitigate such intrusion. The existing wetland patches and corridors are connected and form a wetland network with structural and functional connectivity. The patches in the wetland network are assigned to attributes that represent storage capacity of wetlands, and the corridors are assigned to attributes that represent water flow of channels. The results demonstrated that the saltwater intrusion length follows a linear relationship with tidal discharge in the southern part of Guangzhou (SPG, a part of PRE). When the upstream discharge changed slightly, saltwater intrusion cannot be effectively mitigated merely by diverting water from river channels to wetland network during spring tides. This paper provides new insight for management of saltwater intrusion in estuaries. The method withdrawing saltwater from tidal rivers into wetland network is ineffective to mitigate saltwater intrusion. However, this method can be integrated into the alternative way which replenishes freshwater from upstream into tidal rivers via a wetland network to mitigate saltwater intrusion. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TI  - Wildlife restoration: Mainstreaming translocations to keep common species common
PY  - 2015
AB  - In most urban and agricultural landscapes, remnants of native vegetation are surrounded by an inhospitable matrix. Although vagile species come and go, many reptiles, amphibians and small mammals are effectively stranded and declining towards local extinction. In the same landscapes, other areas where these species are absent are improving in habitat quality, both through natural regeneration and active restoration efforts. So, for many species in many domesticated landscapes, there are too many individuals in some patches of decreasing quality and no individuals in patches of increasing quality. One solution to this situation is to move animals from those areas where there are plenty to suitable areas where there are none. These targeted translocations apply lessons learned from revegetation to dispersal-limited animals to in-fill distributional ranges, increase population size and improve both demographic and genetic connectivity, pushing nonequilibrial metapopulations away from extinction via an imposed mass effect. In contrast to conventional reintroduction schemes-expensive, reactive interventions involving highly-trained specialists and captive-raised endangered species-these inexpensive, proactive, community-driven initiatives aim to avert future declines by keeping common species common. Having introduced the wildlife restoration vision, we use two scenarios to illustrate the benefits of the approach-to species, ecosystem function, ecological understanding, restoration practise and public engagement. As well as adhering to best-practise reintroduction techniques to ensure animal welfare is not compromised and avoid detrimental effects to source populations or release sites, we emphasize community participation, data quality and long-term accessibility as paramount to maximize learning opportunities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The influence of street trees on pedestrian perceptions of safety: Results from environmental justice areas of Massachusetts, U.S
PY  - 2021
AB  - Previous research has shown that trees and other roadside vegetation can mitigate adverse environmental conditions on urban street corridors, and, in turn, positively contribute to pedestrian perceptions of safety and walkability. In this study, pedestrian surveys (n = 181) were collected from three Massachusetts post-industrial cities to understand if street trees moderate pedestrian perceptions of safety. Three street tree conditions – sparse street tree abundance, mature street trees, and new street tree plantings – were compared as study settings. Several methods were used to correlate perceived safety with street trees and sociodemographic variables, including repeated measures and between-group ANOVA, qualitative open-coding, exploratory factor analysis, and simple moderation analysis. This study did not find empirical evidence that street trees influence people's perceived safety, nor that street trees substantively contribute to feelings of safety while walking. These findings suggest that pedestrians do not have universal experiences of safety in walking environments, and different sociocultural backgrounds may contribute to diverging experiences of safety or fear when walking. Our research supports previous findings on the ways in which pedestrians value street trees; this can be extended to municipal or regional Complete Streets guidance and technical assistance programs. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Pavement and riparian forest shape the bird community along an urban river corridor
PY  - 2015
AB  - Knowledge of habitat use by animals within urban-riparian corridors during the breeding season is important for conservation, yet remains understudied. We examined the bird community along an urban-riparian corridor through metropolitan Boise, Idaho and predicted that occupancy of individual species and species richness would be greater in forested areas than in urbanized areas. We surveyed birds throughout the summers of 2009 and 2010 and quantified the m2 of each cover-type within 50-m, 100-m, and 200-m buffers surrounding each survey location using satellite imagery. Occupancy modeling revealed that eight of 14 species analyzed were positively associated with riparian forest, and no species avoided forest. Species richness was negatively associated with the amount of paved surface within 100 m of a survey site with richness declining by more than two species for every hectare of paved surface. Most associations with cover-types–especially riparian forest–were at ⩾100 m. Therefore, the riparian forest within 100 m of a given site along an urban-riparian corridor should be the most important for maintaining species richness.

TI  - Intelligent mobile messaging for smart cities based on reinforcement learning
PY  - 2018
AB  - Mobile messaging has become a trend in our daily lives, and is vital in supporting new services in smart cities. The current schema for messaging is to route all the messages between mobile users through a centralized server. This scheme, though reliable, creates very heavy load on the server. It is possible for users to communicate through peer-to-peer (P2P) connection, especially over urban networks characterized by heavy user traffic and dense network connectivity. P2P connections however do not provide the best user experience, as they are sometimes unreliable due to network coverage fluctuation. We propose an intelligent messaging framework based on reinforcement learning to strike a balance between reducing server load and improving user experience. The system learns and adapts in realtime to user mobility and messaging patterns. The adaptive system dynamically chooses between routing through the server and routing via P2P connection. As it does not rely on user location information, user privacy is thus preserved. Performance evaluation through simulation of user movement and messaging patterns demonstrates that the system is able to find the best messaging policy for users, achieves a well balance between heavy server load and unreliable communication, and provides a fine user messaging experience while reduces server load. We believe that this work is significant for future smart cities and urban networking where mobile messaging will be prominent among mobile users as well as mobile smart objects. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

TI  - Scale impacts of land cover and vegetation corridors on urban thermal behavior in Nanjing, China
PY  - 2008
AB  - In order to integrate urban microclimatic pattern, heat island intensity, land cover and cooling effect of vegetation corridors in a more comprehensive way, both fixed and mobile observations at two types of scale have been made simultaneously in different weather conditions during hot weather in Nanjing, China. Then the air temperature distribution of Nanjing and its impact factor were detected and quantified, and vegetation cooling models were developed in this paper. There was a significant day-to-day variation of urban heat island (UHI), and the average intensity of UHI during the measurement period was 2.0°C. The strong UHI usually occurred around midnight; however, a peak UHI was frequently observed 2-3 h after sunset. During daytime, several isolated hot areas were observed next to cooler ones, indicating a negative UHI. The air temperature distributions of the vegetation corridors at mesoscale in the evening were similar to those at micro-scale at noon. The influence of the Purple Mountain was very obvious with the maximum cooling effect up to 3.0°C/100 m at microscale and 0.4°C/km at mesoscale. This research indicated that the pattern of the UHI in Nanjing is a function of the climatic conditions, the local topography, the effect of the Purple Mountain and the Yangtze River and the urban characteristics such as land uses, vegetation, building density, traffic loads, construction materials and anthropogenic heat sources, which should be taken into account for urban planning and ecologically comfortable residence. The results have further relevance for environmental implications in a subtropical city on the Yangtze River. © Springer-Verlag 2007.

TI  - Floristic Inventory of the James River Park System, Richmond, Virginia
PY  - 2020
AB  - We completed a floristic inventory of the James River Park System (JRPS), a ca. 223-hectare (550-acre) multi-unit park along the James River in Richmond, Virginia. The JRPS includes land within the riparian zone along a 13-kilometer (8-mile) stretch of the river that bisects the city, providing two million annual visitors with recreational access to the rapids along the \"Falls of the James.\"Although the vegetation within the park system is an important attraction for park-goers, information on the flora of the JRPS and this section of the James River corridor is limited. This study updates partial records of the JRPS flora from ca. 50 years ago with collections that were made over the span of three growing seasons from 2016-2018. A total of 566 species and sub-specific taxa were documented from 336 genera and 115 families, including 63 new botanical records for the locality. Native species comprise 69.4% of the overall species richness, with dominant families including Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Cyperaceae. Non-native invasive species are prevalent throughout the park: 51 species are listed on the Virginia Invasive Plant Species List, 21 of which carry a \"high\"invasiveness rank. Four state-listed rare species were documented within the park, and seven other state-rare \"watchlist\"species were found. The information presented here is being used to help guide management efforts of the JRPS Invasive Plant Task Force, an organization dedicated to the removal of non-native invasive species, restoration of natural habitats, and preservation of natural communities within the park system. © Copyright 2020 Southern Appalachian Botanical Society.

TI  - Community health risk associated with weather-related air pollution events: Perspectives of urban resilience and mitigation
PY  - 2021
AB  - Weather-related air pollution can create community health risks in a high-density city with a compact environment. However, how to develop protocols for urban resilience and mitigation has seldom been discussed. Based on case studies related to dust storm and haze events in Hong Kong, this chapter examines the potential improvement of urban design and community planning for mitigation and emergency management. In particular, this chapter suggests that major road networks and areas of refuge in high-rise buildings could be part of the vertical and horizontal sections of urban ventilation corridors to improve airflow within a compact environment. Urban greenery for mitigation should consider the elements of patterns, diversity, and density. These include traditional settings of vertical greening and terrace/rooftop gardens as well as greenery within areas of refuge; vegetation types with greater ability to remove air pollution with less risk of tree failure during extreme weather; and urban planting along not only pedestrian areas but also areas with high mobility of individuals such as social spaces or outdoor environments with clustered population during peak hours. Additionally, multifunctional centers with integrated social and health services could be developed in order to reserve spaces as well as support local community timely, passively, and actively through delivering disaster-related information in different platforms and settings, such as social media and community workshops. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - An approach to the integrated management of exotic invasive weeds in riparian zones
PY  - 2016
AB  - The riparian zones have been for millennia a fundamental element for the settlement of the population due to the availability of water, the existence of meadows and fertile valleys as roads. Their ecological importance and livelihood, however, have not prevented their degradation. For centuries this degradation has been gradual and slow, exponentially increasing from the twentieth century by human transformation capabilities of the medium. In mountain areas, the less human presence, coupled with an abrupt relief, a more hostile climate and lower agricultural potential, have allowed a better conservation of rivers, in morphological and biological aspects. However, in middle and lower zones, the degradation has been intense and it is increasingly difficult to find a riparian zone with its original and unaltered riparian vegetation. The main causes of riparian zones degradation are the agriculture on the floodplain, large hydraulic pipes, diversions and dams, channels that have destroyed and altered their morphology, biological and hydrological function. The rapid urban expansion in the riparian zones, in recent years, have caused the channelling of rivers to prevent flooding of building areas. The degradation of riparian zones join to undesirable presence of the exotic species, which will replace the native vegetation in these zones eventually. The riverbanks act as the last refuge of natural vegetation, but it has been replaced by agricultural crops or forest plantations. This situation presents a unique duality: the widespread degradation of the riverbanks and, at the same time, their high ecological value as stronghold for natural vegetation for wildlife and their role as biological corridors. In Mediterranean riparian habitats, uncontrolled presence of invasive and exotic species can reduce native plant species richness, which would be devastating for our environments. Based on the historical management, there are very limited control options available. The presence of weeds or exotic species in riparian zones creates controversial because these species invade very sensitive habitats. In this context, we suggest a methodology to address the management and control of one of the most invasive riparian weeds in the world, the grass Arundo donax L. (Giant reed), from an integrated perspective, improving the ecological status of the riparian zones and producing the diminishing impact on the biodiversity. We combined mechanical, physical, chemical and biological techniques in a management programme of riparian zones, taking account the ecological factors of plant communities and social context. The findings of this research project should encourage further studies on the integrated management of invasive weeds in riparian zones, and environmental conditions that may influence field efficiency. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Easements and wildlife conservation in Kenya
PY  - 2006
AB  - INTRODUCTION Wildlife as a resource plays an important role in the economic development of Kenya. It is the main basis of the tourism industry, which contributes greatly to the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Kenya's wildlife is preserved in protected areas in which human settlement is prohibited and land use restricted to wildlife conservation. However, most of these protected areas have been found too small to maintain viable populations and diversity of wildlife in the long term. Over 70 percent of Kenya's wildlife resides outside protected areas. This land provides habitat for wildlife as well as connectivity between various protected areas. While the importance of land outside protected areas to the integrity and viability of protected areas is accepted, the continued availability of wildlife areas outside protected areas is threatened. These lands are rapidly being subdivided, fenced, and converted to other uses such as agriculture and urban development. Unregulated land use change destroys wildlife habitat and migratory routes and threatens the existence of wildlife. It is therefore important to find mechanisms to conserve critical wildlife areas found outside protected areas. This chapter examines the use of one land conservation mechanism - easements. It traces the history and use of easements in the English Common Law. It discusses the limitations that easements under Common Law present to the use of the easement for wildlife conservation by the requirements for dominant and servient tenement and the rule against easements in gross. © IUCN Academy of Environmental Law 2007 and © Cambridge University Press, 2009.

TI  - Improvement of aquatic vegetation in urban waterways using protected artificial shallows
PY  - 2012
AB  - Wave- and current-protected shallows have been constructed in the heavily modified, urban River Spree to create a littoral habitat with reduced hydrodynamical disturbances by navigation. Five years after construction and an initial planting of various macrophytes, abiotic conditions were measured and the establishment of aquatic and riparian vegetation was assessed. This study aimed to quantify the effective reduction of hydrodynamic disturbances and to assess the rehabilitation of aquatic plants and the improvement of the macrophytes-based ecological status by means of the reference index (RI).Wave stress has been successfully reduced and a diverse, abundant community of aquatic and riparian plants developed resembling the vegetation of natural oxbows. Most of the planted species were still present after five years, and in addition, several new species became established. The aquatic plants at the rehabilitated site indicated a \"good\" ecological status and even the \"high\" status if planted species were excluded from the RI. In contrast, the control site remained largely unvegetated indicating a \"bad\" status. Abiotic conditions other than wave action confirmed low hydrological connectivity and the ecosystem-engineering capabilities of vegetation. Low oxygen saturation and the accumulation of organic material limit the habitat suitability for other biota. Principally, wave-protected shallows are well suited to improve aquatic macrophytes in urban waterways. They will be rapidly naturally colonized, while planting of macrophytes, especially of species typical for advanced stages of succession should be omitted. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Implementation of IoT networks based on MQTT for wildlife monitoring system
PY  - 2019
AB  - With the widespread use of the Internet of Things (IoT), use cases in IoT have been considered for solving social problems in various fields such as agriculture, welfare, disaster prevention, and transportation infrastructure. Additionally, crop damage caused by animals is a common occurrence all over the world. An example of such damage is the damage to agricultural crops and threat to elderly people owing to animals in Hakusan city, Ishikawa prefecture, where the Hakusan campus of the authors' university is located. Presently, measures against damage caused by animals are being implemented by installing animal traps and cages; however, it is necessary to patrol the conditions of capture, thereby increasing human effort. To solve this problem, the authors considered a wildlife monitoring system to remotely manage a cage by using a sensor or camera with Internet connectivity. Assuming that a large number of IoT devices would be used in such a system, the authors visualize a high network load problem. Therefore, the authors aim to reduce the load on the IoT network. In this paper, the part of the wildlife-monitoring system that is concerned the evaluation and consideration of network using MQTT is described. © 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Species turnover and geographic distance in an urban river network
PY  - 2013
AB  - Aim: Understanding the relationships between species turnover, environmental features and the geographic distance between sites can provide important insights into the processes driving species diversity. This is particularly relevant where the effective distance between sites may be a function of the habitat or topographic features of the landscape and the means of dispersal of the organism. River networks, in particular in human-modified landscapes, are a striking example of such a situation. Here, we use data for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms across an urban river network to examine patterns of species turnover and to determine whether these patterns differ between different taxonomic groups. Location: Sheffield area, UK. Methods: Aquatic (macroinvertebrates, diatoms) and terrestrial (birds, plants, butterflies) organisms were surveyed at 41 sites across an urban river network. We assessed the relationship between turnover and three alternative geographic distance measures (Euclidean, network and flow distance), whilst also taking into account the environmental distance between sites, using Mantel and partial Mantel tests. Results: Turnover of all taxonomic groups apart from butterflies was significantly correlated with at least one measure of geographic distance. The aquatic taxonomic groups showed the strongest correlations with the geographic distance measures, and in particular with network distance. Terrestrial taxa were more closely associated with environmental than any of the geographic distance measures, although network distance remained significant for birds and some plant groups after removing the effect of environmental distance. Water-dispersed and neophyte plant groups were significantly related to network and flow distance. Main conclusions: The results suggest that aquatic communities are strongly influenced by spatial processes occurring within the river network. Terrestrial taxa have a more complex relationship with distance, with different components of these communities displaying different responses. Nevertheless, it is clear that connectivity along the river corridor is important for both aquatic and terrestrial communities. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Amphibian Diversity and Conservation in the Ejido Tierra y Libertad, Southwestern Chiapas, Mexico
PY  - 2022
AB  - Amphibians constitute one of the richest and most endangered groups in Mexico; however, their diversity and threat factors at the regional level remain little known in many parts of the country, including in protected areas. We analyzed amphibian diversity of the Ejido Tierra y Libertad, Municipality of Jiquipilas, Chiapas, Mexico, 40% of which occurs within the La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biósfera La Sepultura, or REBISE). We conducted fieldwork from January 2016 to April 2020, including 980 person-hours of systematic sampling across 11 transects spanning different habitat types. We documented 20 amphibian species, including the first record of the Yellowbelly Mushroomtongue Salamander (Bolitoglossa flaviventris) for the REBISE. Seven of these amphibian species are included in some risk category: three in the NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 of the Mexican federal government, two in the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and two categorized in both. The Common Leaf-litter Frog (Craugastor loki) was the most abundant species, and together with four other anuran species, constituted 82.1% of the total abundance observed. Intertransect faunal similarity was generally associated with proximity, forest corridor connectivity, and the presence of water. Conserved Semi-Deciduous Forest had the highest alpha diversity, but somewhat surprisingly, urban and some disturbed habitats had the highest species richness. Pasture was the least rich and diverse habitat, however, so we discuss the consequences of ongoing expansion of pastures on amphibian populations. We propose conservation measures intended to promote both amphibian diversity and human health. © 2022. Emmanuel Javier-Vázquez All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Examining the ecological quality of küçükçekmece district parks in Istanbul in terms of permeability and natural vegetation
PY  - 2010
AB  - Küçükçekmece, is one of the important districts to define the city of Istanbul at the international level with its historical, cultural, and natural values. In this study, the parks in Küçükçekmece District were examined in terms of ecological quality, principles, and standards. Ecological quality is a composite of the structural and functional features determining the habitat values of a landscape. An objective evaluation on the ecological quality of parks is important from the point of rehabilitation from an existing situation, and providing areas which will have high habitat value in the future. Recovery in the existing park area will generate a livable urban atmosphere. In line with this basic comprehension, the ecological quality of the parks in Istanbul's Küçükçekmece District was examined. There are four principles determining ecological quality of an area: vegetative production, water, permeability (soil), and natural vegetation cover (biological diversity). This research was done in two phases regarding the permeability and natural vegetation cover using ecological quality principles. In the first phase of the study, a vegetation list was provided by the Park and Garden Department of the Küçükçekmece Municipality. The park names and size were acquired from the \"Küçükçekmece District green corridor Transformation Project\". The space where the soil surface is covered by soil material, or is suppressed because of overuse and can not sustain plant growth is accepted as an impermeable soil surface. Whether there is a relation between park areas and permeable surface areas was examined using the Spearman correlation test. Whether permeability ratio of parks changes according to their location was analyzed using the Chi-Square test. In the second stage of the study, the existing vegetation cover was analyzed on-site. Existing vegetation cover analysis is made according to trees, shrubs, bushes, flowers, and trailings. Findings of, this study show that the average permeability ratio is 35.19% and the naturality ratio is 52% in the 63 parks under examination. This study shows that the permeable land surfaces of the parks remain incapable of sustaining vegetative growth and therefore the habitat values of the park areas, which can have an economic, social and ecologic contribution to the urban environment, will reduce. Result of this study will contribute to the sampling used for the ecological quality principles in other parks in other districts. The study reveals the importance of the ecological quality factors that need to be taken into consideration in the design and planning of parks.

TI  - Large diameter water main in a congested urban environment fort worth east side II 54\" water main
PY  - 2013
AB  - Large-diameter pipeline design in a fully-developed urban environment presents many challenges. The designer has to work around or relocate existing obstacles while keeping water, sewer, and traffic disruptions at a minimum. This paper will discuss: (1) the design of the City of Fort Worth East Side II 54-inch Water Main (E-2); (2) how existing development presented multiple design challenges; and (3)how the design compensated for these challenges. The E-2 pipeline is a key component of the City's water transmission system. The pipeline supplies water from the City's Rolling Hill's Water Treatment Plant to northern sections of the City and several wholesale customer Cities. The current pipeline was built in multiple stages from 1972 to 1985. The E-2 is primarily a 54-inch pipeline. There is, however, a 42-inch section in the middle of the alignment that limits the full use of the entire line. The City of Fort Worth hired Freese and Nichols, Inc. to design a 54-inch replacement for this section of the line. The original concept was to construct the replacement 54-inch pipeline parallel to the existing 42-inch. However, the 42-inch alignment is very congested and an alternate route had to be developed. The E-2 pipeline runs through the heart of Fort Worth's east side, primarily along the Beach Street Corridor. The area has been developed for many years (in some cases over 100 years), and existing water, sewer, franchise utilities, and gas well sites occupy much of the open space and City Right-Of-Way. While selecting the route and designing the 54-inch line, the project team had to consider all of these potential conflicts as well as two major urban highway crossings, a railroad crossing, and a crossing of the Trinity River. The design also had to allow for keeping the existing 42-inch water line, a 36-inch water line and numerous smaller water and sewer lines in service, while keeping all major streets open during construction. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Landscape factors affecting the distribution of the great tit in fragmented urban forests of Seoul, South Korea
PY  - 2016
AB  - Seoul City, as the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea, has high population density, and its remaining forests are extremely fragmented as a result of intensive development. The purpose of this study is to analyze the distribution of the great tit (Parus major) and develop a habitat model. Tits have been known as forest birds that inhabit urban forests in Seoul City. A Seoul biotope map and land cover map were combined, and the urban forest areas were delineated on these maps. As factors affecting the distribution of the great tit, landscape indices were calculated by separating them into intrapatch indices, namely logged patch area (PA), area-weighted mean patch shape index (PSI), tree rate (TR), and tree area (TA), and interpatch indices, namely patch degree (PD), patch betweenness (PB), patch proximity (PP), and difference probability of connectivity (DPC), to analyze the internal properties of the patches and their connectivity by tit occurrence data. The results of a t test analyzing the differences of habitat variables by great tit presence/absence and distribution showed differences in PA (p < 0.05), PSI (p < 0.001), TR (p < 0.01), TA (p < 0.001), PD (p < 0.05), PB (p < 0.01), PP (p < 0.05), and DPC (p < 0.1). In the results of logistic regression modeling, in most cases, more than one model had ΔAICc less than 2.0, suggesting that multiple models may be the best model. In the comprehensive models, the TR, PB, and DPC metrics were the best predictors. Among all variables in the intrahabitat model, PSI was the best predictor of species occurrence. Within the interhabitat model, DPC was the best predictor and had a positive relationship with species occurrence, which is the most important of all the factors. In other words, the great tit is more likely to be found in a large circular forest patch than a small and long-shaped forest patch, and connectivity in the threshold distance is the most important factor in predicting great tit occurrence. These results suggest that ecological potential, not only “location potential” but also “supply potential,” should be considered in fragmented urban forests.

TI  - Orchid bees of forest fragments in Southwestern Amazonia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Bees of the tribe Euglossini are known as orchid-bees. In general, areas with more vegetation cover have greater abundance and diversity of these bees. This study investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on assemblages of the euglossine bees in the region of Rio Branco municipality, State of Acre, and surrounding areas. Ten forest fragments with varying sizes were selected for the study and were classified as urban or rural. The bees were sampled between December 2005 and August 2006. A total of 3,675 bees in 36 species and 4 genera were collected. In general abundance and richness of bees did not differ statistically between urban and rural fragments. The index of edge in fragments was a predictor of richness and diversity of bees. The connectivity estimated was also an adequate predictor for richness. Fragments with greater similarity in relation to their landscape structure were also more similar in relation to faunal composition.

TI  - Can road-crossing structures improve population viability of an urban gliding mammal?
PY  - 2009
AB  - Tree-dwelling mammals are potentially highly vulnerable to discontinuities in habitat created by roads. We used population modeling to assess the viability of a metapopulation of Australia's largest gliding marsupial, the greater glider (Petauroides volans), occurring in forest remnants in the fastesturbanizing region of Australia, where habitat is dissected by major roads. Crossing structures for arboreal mammals (consisting of a land bridge with wooden poles for gliding and adjacent rope canopy bridges) have been installed over an arterial road that separates two of these remnants (one large, one small). It is currently unknown whether this species will use the crossing structures, but available tree height and spacing do not allow a glide crossing, and fences with metal flashing prevent access to the road by terrestrial and arboreal mammals. Our modeling reveals that even a relatively low rate of dispersal facilitated by these structures would substantially reduce the probability of extinction of the smaller subpopulation. This rate of dispersal is plausible given the small distance involved (about 55 m). The inclusion of wildfire as a catastrophe in our model suggests that these two remnants may encounter an undesirable level of extinction risk. This can be reduced to an acceptable level by including inter-patch movement via dispersal among other forest remnants. However, this requires connection to a very large remnant 8 km away, through a set of remnants that straddle two motorways. These motorways create discontinuities in forest cover that are beyond the gliding ability of this species. Crossing structures will be required to enable inter-patch movement. A priority for future research should be whether the greater glider will use road-crossing structures. Loss of habitat and habitat connections is continuing in this landscape and is likely to have dire consequences for wildlife if land managers are unable to retain appropriate habitat cover with corridors and install effective wildlife road-crossing structures where large roads intersect wildlife habitat. © 2009 by the author(s).

TI  - Conservation of aquatic invertebrates: concerns, challenges and conundrums
PY  - 2016
AB  - Invertebrates inhabiting marine and freshwater ecosystems make important contributions to global biodiversity and provide significant services that have cascading effects across ecosystems. However, this group is grossly under-represented in assessments of conservation status and often neglected in targeted aquatic conservation efforts.

In global assessments of 7857 freshwater invertebrates and 2864 marine invertebrates, 30–34% were considered Data Deficient highlighting the paucity of information for making such assessments. Of the invertebrate groups that could be assessed, those with poor dispersal abilities and high local endemism, such as many gastropods, crayfish and mussels, are the most threatened.

Springs and subterranean hydrological systems support the highest proportions of threatened freshwater species, while in marine environments coral reefs, lagoons and anchialine systems are particularly vulnerable.

Key agents of biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems are water pollution, overexploitation and harvesting, habitat degradation and destruction, alien invasive species, and climate change. Effects of dams and water management along with pollution from urban, agricultural and forestry sources are the main threats in freshwater ecosystems, whereas a broad range of factors have impacts on marine invertebrates, including biological resource use.

Significant impediments facing conservation of aquatic invertebrates are limited knowledge of their diversity, the need for broadscale actions to account for connectivity within and across ecosystems, lack of political will and investment, and the prospect that conditions may get worse before they improve, possibly not in time to save some already highly imperilled invertebrate species from extinction.

TI  - Network structure of 'space of flows' in Jilin Province based on telecommunication flows
PY  - 2014
AB  - Information communication is an important expression of interaction between two cities, and it is also a key element to build the city network. This study proposes to map the network structure of 'space of flows' based on the actual observed telecommunication flows, with Jilin Province as the case area. Specifically, the call durations via fixed- line telephone are employed to measure the information flows occurred between cities. The cities at the county level or above are treated as research units. To be reliable, a synthetic method composed of principal component analysis, C-Value and D-Value hierarchy analysis, dominant flow analysis, the minimum spanning tree method is utilized to map out the structure. The research reveals the following aspects. (1) The 'space of flows' in Jilin Province is a hierarchical network, which centers on Changchun. In this network, Changchun, Yanji, Tonghua and Gongzhuling are the 1st-level leading cities; Jilin, Baicheng, Baishan, Liaoyuan, Songyuan and Siping are 2nd-level leading cities, and the other cities in Jilin are subordinate cities. (2) Administrative division plays a fundamental role in the formation of the current pattern. (3) Changchun is a unique center, but on the contrary to our previous understanding, Jilin is not that 'centric', and the interaction between Changchun and Jilin is not that strong either. (4) Surprisingly, the two cities of Gongzhuling and Dunhua at the county level, play important roles in the network of 'space of flows'. Gongzhuling tends to be blended in the Changchun metropolitan area, and Dunhua becomes a key node in the eastern Jilin. The regional connectivity functions of the two cities need to be improved. (5) Siping and Lishu, have strong interaction with each other, and are supporting a further integration strategy of the two neighboring cities.

TI  - Modeling scale-dependent landscape pattern, dispersal, and connectivity from the perspective of the organism
PY  - 2007
AB  - Understanding the impacts of habitat fragmentation on dispersal is an important issue in landscape and conservation ecology. Here I examine the effects of fine- to broad-scale patterns in landscape structure on dispersal success of organisms with differing life-history traits. An individual-based model was used to simulate dispersal of amphibian-like species whose movements were driven by land cover and moisture conditions. To systematically control spatial pattern, a landscape model was created by merging simulated land cover maps with synthetic topographic surfaces. Landscapes varied in topographic roughness and spatial contagion in agriculture and urban land cover. Simulations included three different species types that varied in their maximum potential dispersal distances by 1-, 2-, or 4-fold. Two sets of simulations addressed effects of varying aspects of landscape structure on dispersal success. In the first set of simulations, which incorporated variable distances between breeding patches, dispersal success was lowest for all species types when anthropogenic cover was patchily distributed. In the second set, with interpatch distances held constant as landscape composition varied, dispersal success decreased as anthropogenic cover became spatially contagious. Both sets revealed strong main effects of species characteristics, interpatch distances and landscape composition on dispersal success; furthermore, scale-dependent patterns in land cover and moisture gradients had a stronger effect on longer- than shorter-ranging species types. Taken together, these simulations suggest that heuristic conservation strategies could potentially be developed based on important but limited life history information. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

TI  - More than nature: Linkages between well-being and greenspace influenced by a combination of elements of nature and non-nature in a New York City urban park
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract This study examines the association between the elements of an urban greenspace and users’ subjective well-being (SWB). In addition to the urgency of addressing climate change, co-benefits such as health and well-being are stimulating increasing investment in urban green infrastructure. Previous studies have established a link between SWB and urban greenspace and identified connectedness to nature (CTN) as one contributor to this effect. Few studies, however, have examined the interactions of park elements as they contribute to CTN and SWB. The current work evaluates the relative importance of various elements of an urban greenspace for individuals’ feelings of SWB and CTN. Possible determinants are investigated through mixed-methods analysis using data from a rating task and interviews conducted with park users in Washington Square Park, NYC. Findings indicate (1) trees are the most important element of nature contributing to a majority of participants’ SWB and CTN, and (2) that for the majority of participants, SWB derives from both elements of nature and non-nature. Results also suggest that a majority of park users are responding to their experience of the park as a whole; this experience is identified as para-urban—characterized by occurring in a space set apart from the rest of the city.

TI  - Economic valuation of a seed dispersal service in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden
PY  - 2006
AB  - Most economic valuation studies of species derive from stated preferences methods. These methods fail to take into account biodiversity values that the general public is not (made) informed about or has no experience with. Hence, production function (PF) and replacement cost (RC) approaches to valuation may be preferable in situations where species perform key life support functions in ecosystems, such as seed dispersal, pollination, or pest regulation. We conduct an RC analysis of the seed dispersal service performed by the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden. The park holds one of the largest populations of giant oaks in Europe, and the oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petrea) represents a keystone species in the hemiboreal forests. The primary objective was to estimate the number of seed-dispersed oak trees that resulted from jays and to determine the costs of replacing this service though human means. Results show that depending upon seeding or planting technique chosen, the RC per pair of jays in the park is SEK 35,000 (USD 4900) and SEK 160,000 (USD 22,500), respectively. Based on the park's aggregated oak forest-area, average RC for natural oak forest regeneration by jays is SEK 15,000 (USD 2100) to SEK 67,000 (USD 9400) per hectare, respectively. These estimates help motivating investments in management strategies that secure critical breeding and foraging habitats of jays, including coniferous forests and jay movement corridors. The analysis also illustrates the need for detailed ecological-economic knowledge in a PF or RC analysis. The continuous temporal and spatial oak dispersal service provided by jays holds several benefits compared to a man-made replacement of this service. PF and RC approaches are particularly motivated in cases of known functional ecological relationships, and critically important in estimating management measures where mobile link organisms and keystone species form key mutual relationships that generate high biodiversity benefits. In relation to obtained results, we discuss insights for conducting valuation studies on particular species. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Investigation on the population of wild Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) in Medog, Tibet
PY  - 2019
AB  - Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) used to be commonly distributed in Medog County, southeast Tibet, whereas no occurrence record has been reported across this area since 2002. In 2013-2018, we conducted field surveys in nine potential distribution areas of Bengal tigers in Medog using integrative approaches including camera-trapping, information network collection method and footprint identification method. The results suggested that there are only 1-3 non-resident individuals of Bengal tiger existing in Medog, occurring only during the dry season (October to March) in the south bank of the Yalu Zangbo River in the town of Beibeng, the south bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River in the Medog Town, and the south bank of the Jinzhu Zangbo in the Gedang Township. The prospects of the subsistence of wild Bengal tiger in Medog are not optimistic, subjected to various conditions and causes. Actions we proposed to conserve the wild tigers in this region include:(1)Conduct systematically designed basic monitoring on Bengal tigers and their prey; (2)Strengthen field patrolling and law enforcement against wildlife poaching; (3)Strengthen the protection of the intact forests; (4)Promote the livelihood and education of indigenous peoples to reduce their consumption of nature resources; (5)Develop landscape corridors for wild tigers to increase the habitat connectivity and facilitate their dispersal; (6)Strengthen cooperation on research and technical exchanges among different institutions and parties. © 2019, Science Press.

TI  - The role and potential of residential open space in a suburban green space network
PY  - 2021
AB  - As the climate changes, green spaces of all types will be increasingly important in maintaining livable and biodiverse communities. A type of green space common to suburban communities in the United States is residential open space. Residential open spaces tend to be small and heavily managed and are frequently undervalued and understudied as ecological amenities. This study uses GIS analysis and spatial statistics to explore the configuration of 1900 residential open spaces in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a suburban county in the northeastern United States. It examines local characteristics such as open space policy, subdivision features, and socioeconomic status to identify variables that are associated with open space parcel size and connectivity and could be leveraged to foster a more beneficial configuration of metropolitan green space. The analysis finds that open space is moderately fragmented, but is abundant in the county and clustered, which could support functional connectivity. Direct connections also considerably augment the size of open spaces and other types of protected greenspaces. Results highlight that municipal actions like setting open space standards, using open space to protect riparian areas, and taking ownership of open space parcels are associated with beneficial on-the-ground open space characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Sustainable living neighbourhoods: Measuring public space quality and walking environment in Lisbon
PY  - 2022
AB  - • Public space quality contributes to a good walking environment • Geographic modelling is an efficient method to produce Urban Quality Indicators • Urban quality attributes are used to evaluate the walking environment • Mapping walking environment quality supports sustainable planning Obesity and global warming are two major challenges that affect communities' health and quality of life. Providing good walking environments, with appropriate pedestrian infrastructure, green areas and access to commercial retail and transport hubs favour liveable, healthy, and sustainable cities. The Lisbon City Hall has implemented an intervention program in the public space as a strategy to improve environmental quality and mitigate the effects of climate change. The program “A square in each neighbourhood” intends not only to reinforce the economic base of Lisbon, namely tourism, restaurants, commerce, and creative activities but also to promote physical activity and improve the quality of living of all citizens. For studying the impact of the public space quality on the walking environment, Campolide, a typical Lisbon neighbourhood, Portugal, which includes one of the requalified squares, was selected. A two-step methodology based on spatial modelling is proposed. In the first step, the public space quality was evaluated based on a set of 13 urban quality attributes. Attributes, intended for the street level, were collected from open data platforms and complemented with a field survey. Then, through spatial analysis, these attributes were used to build the Pedestrian Environment Quality Indicator and the Priority Intervention Indicator. Using these indicators, walking-friendly streets were mapped and the most critical sites that require priority intervention were identified to prepare for the requalification planning process. The street with the highest quality in the study area according to the dimensions evaluated - connectivity, convenience, comfort, cleanliness, and conviviality - has a great offer of trees, bus stops, commercial establishments, commercial diversity, crossings, paper bins/eco points and esplanades. On the opposite side of the rank, the street with the lowest quality has no trees or green areas, transport stops, benches and tables, or commercial activity. The urban quality indicators constitute a helpful tool for city planners and policymakers when planning sustainable living neighbourhoods.

TI  - Bird Flight Resistance Analysis and Planning Strategies in Urban Regeneration Areas: A Case Study of a Certain Area in Shenzhen, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - At present, the sharp decline in urban biodiversity worldwide is severe. Conducting biological perspective analysis and proposing space construction solutions during urban regeneration can greatly alleviate the contradiction between urban construction and biodiversity conservation. In this study, birds were taken as biological representatives, and a certain area in Shenzhen with strong conservation needs was used as an example. Based on a thorough analysis of bird status, the minimum resistance model was applied to establish a resistance surface describing the real flight movement of the indicator species and to construct a bird conservation pattern from the flight process of birds. The results show that: (1) bird flight resistance is the lowest in the southern green space and northern woodland around the reservoir in the research region, and the resistance is higher in the central part, but the path of least resistance therein has the potential to become a corridor. (2) From the perspective of the community structure of green space vegetation, the sparse woodland and shrubland in the research region have low resistance and high richness, which are the most ideal green space forms for birds; from the perspective of architecture, bird flight resistance shows a negative correlation with building height and a positive correlation with building density. The final urban regeneration design plan is thus derived, and the validity of the method is verified based on the biodiversity index. This study reveals the possibility of applying bird flight resistance analysis based on the minimum resistance model to small and medium-scale urban regeneration areas, and also provides insight into the correlation between flight resistance and spatial design elements, which can assist decision-makers, planners and developers in spatial design and planning from a biological standpoint. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - You Can Bend Me but Can’t Break Me: Vegetation Regeneration After Hurricane María Passed Over an Urban Coastal Wetland in Northeastern Puerto Rico
PY  - 2021
AB  - Tropical urban coastal wetland regeneration is complex. Wetland plant biodiversity varies due to past and present land use, nutrient inputs, hydrological conditions, and terrestrial/marine connectivity. The intensity of atmospheric disturbances, such as hurricanes, will determine these systems' level of disturbance and regeneration capacity. On September 20, 2017, Category 4 hurricane Maria passed over Puerto Rico, leaving behind a path of destruction across the entire island, especially in coastal ecosystems, from the combined effects of winds, severe storm surges, and urban runoff. Our question was: to what extent do human-influenced coastal urban wetlands regenerate after such a massive event. This study determines the spatio-temporal regeneration dynamics of plant cover and composition during the first two years after hurricane Maria in a coastal urban wetland, Cienaga Las Cucharillas, located in San Juan Bay. We assessed the distribution of plant functional types using small unmanned aerial vehicles (s-UAV) and monitored climate and environmental data (salinity, phreatic water levels, and precipitation). Wetland vegetation cover had a high recovery rate – 16 months after the hurricane, vegetation cover occupied 87 % of the study area. We found a successional pattern of plant regeneration that seemed to be partly explained by the fast-slow continuum. Plants with high specific leaf area (SLA) colonized bare soil spaces first. Plant regeneration also varied according to changes in phreatic water conductivity and waterlogging. Isotopic analyses of plant species signaled high nutrient availability, increasing the system's regeneration speed. After two years, the wetland's plant cover and composition of functional plant types proved resilient to the initial hurricane effect and subsequent changes in conductivity and freshwater conditions. Further studies will expand how spatio-temporal conditions will affect long-term plant community dynamics.

TI  - Water dispersal of vegetative bulbils of the invasive exotic Dioscorea oppositifolia L. in southern Illinois
PY  - 2005
AB  - Riparian corridors promote dispersal of several species of exotic invasives worldwide. Dispersal plays a role in the colonization of exotic invasive species into new areas and this study was conducted to determine if the invasiveness of Dioscorea oppositifolia L. (Chinese yam) is facilitated by secondary dispersal of vegetative diaspores (bulbils) by water. Since seed production of this plant has not been observed in the United States, bulbils represent the only means of dispersal to new habitats. Dispersal was monitored by placing aquatic traps, tethered bulbils, and painted bulbil caches in a tributary of Drury Creek, Giant City State Park, Illinois. Results indicate that high-energy flow in the creek accelerated secondary dispersal of bulbils downstream and onto the floodplain. The longest recorded dispersal distance was 206.2 m downstream. Dispersal distance of tethered bulbils was not related to rainfall or flow velocity in the creek; however the total number of bulbils trapped was positively related to flow velocity. We conclude that secondary dispersal by water in streams can facilitate dispersal of vegetative bulbils of this exotic species.

TI  - Toward an ecophilosophical approach to community and regional planning: a bioregional framework
PY  - 1994
AB  - This article argues that to resolve the global ecological crisis requires an application of the ideas of environmental philosophy to planning theory and planning discourse. The author traces the origins and the development of the ecological wisdom concept. It is shown that the historical roots of wilderness-inspired planning framework can be traced back to the ideas of MacKaye, Geddes, and Mumford, and these ideas can form the basis of the bioregional planning framework that is needed today. This new framework would aim to preserve wilderness cores as centres of biodiversity, surrounded by buffer zones necessary to protect the core. Connectivity between protected areas, via nature corridors, would be essential to enable the movement of species between the cores. A final element of the framework would be the development of ecologically healthy cities. -N.Davey

TI  - EECASC: an energy efficient communication approach in smart cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - The power consumption and connectivity of mobile nodes to the network are two essential issues in smart cities. In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized approach for mobility management of mobile nodes in smart cities. We propose a customized communication protocol compliant with 6LoWPAN along with the scheme that consumes less power regarding previous solutions. The proposed approach organizes static nodes as a tree for efficient routing, automatic addressing, and handling movement of mobile nodes. The proposed approach has a hybrid data transmission capability by proactively choosing multi-hop or single-hop routing to reduce power consumption of mobile nodes. It is evaluated based on different factors. The results show the superiority of the approach compared with the previous works. The promising analytical results manifest the higher performance (about 10% compared to the best scheme) of the proposed approach specifically in reducing the power consumption of mobile nodes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

PY  - 2021
AB  - The riparian forest is one of the most diverse environments of the La Plata River plains. It is represented by patches of humid forests, which are a valuable source of ecosystem services and have recreational and educational potential. However, the riparian forest has undergone constant modification, worsened by private real-estate developments and a lack of government regulation. Among the reserves that protect the riparian forest, the Municipal Ecological Reserve of Avellaneda is the closest to the southern limit of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Although there are around 300 species of wild fauna and flora informally registered in the area, there are only a few studies published about its biodiversity. In this work, the diversity of thirteen native and exotic ferns in the core area (Eco Área) of the reserve is characterized, the origin of the species is also evaluated and comparisons are made with other nearby protected areas. The Eco Área of the Reserve plays an important role as part of the urban reserve corridor of the La Plata River plains and constitutes a refuge for both native and exotic ruderal species. The present work represents the basis for future studies about the population dynamics and the colonization strategies of the ferns. © 2021 Naturalis Biodiversity Center.

TI  - Simulating free-roaming cat population management options in open demographic environments
PY  - 2014
AB  - Large populations of free-roaming cats (FRCs) generate ongoing concerns for welfare of both individual animals and populations, for human public health, for viability of native wildlife populations, and for local ecological damage. Managing FRC populations is a complex task, without universal agreement on best practices. Previous analyses that use simulation modeling tools to evaluate alternative management methods have focused on relative efficacy of removal (or trap-return, TR), typically involving euthanasia, and sterilization (or trap-neuter-return, TNR) in demographically isolated populations. We used a stochastic demographic simulation approach to evaluate removal, permanent sterilization, and two postulated methods of temporary contraception for FRC population management. Our models include demographic connectivity to neighboring untreated cat populations through natural dispersal in a metapopulation context across urban and rural landscapes, and also feature abandonment of owned animals. Within population type, a given implementation rate of the TR strategy results in the most rapid rate of population decline and (when populations are isolated) the highest probability of population elimination, followed in order of decreasing efficacy by equivalent rates of implementation of TNR and temporary contraception. Even low levels of demographic connectivity significantly reduce the effectiveness of any management intervention, and continued abandonment is similarly problematic. This is the first demographic simulation analysis to consider the use of temporary contraception and account for the realities of FRC dispersal and owned cat abandonment. ©2014 Miller et al.

TI  - Small-Scale Habitat Conditions Are More Important Than Site Context for Influencing Pollinator Visitation
PY  - 2021
AB  - The ability of insects to persist in urban greenspace depends on their ability to usefully interact with available plant resources. Greenspace design influences plant-insect interactions by: 1) limiting the plant-species pool available for interaction through plant choice, 2) limiting the insects that are available for interaction through site-occupancy dynamics; and 3) mediating insect preferences based on the context of particular plant-insect interactions through structural barriers, microclimatic changes or competition. We designed an experiment to measure the effect of greenspace design attributes on site occupancy and insect preferences while keeping plant availability constant. Using a set of 5 functionally distinct flowering plant species (‘phytometres’), we used occupancy-detection modelling to test factors affecting probability of visitation for eight groups of pollinating insects (ants, beetles, butterflies, bumblebees, honeybees, small bees, hoverflies and other flies) across 102 urban squares in Munich, Germany. We found that the probability of detecting an interaction was low for most functional groups, and situational factors, such as weather or competition from co-occurring flowers, were the primary drivers of visitation. Increasing the proportion of unsealed surfaces and quantity or diversity of flowers on the site had a positive influence on the probability of interaction, and, to a lesser extent, on probability of occupancy. Landscape connectivity and site area were important for only a few groups. Together, our results suggest that small-scale habitat conditions are more important than site context for influencing pollinator visitation. Designers can encourage interaction through contiguous provision of floral resources and unsealed surfaces while limiting internal barriers.

TI  - Prospecting the potential of ecosystem restoration: A proposed framework and a case study
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Projects focusing on the restoration of degraded ecosystems have to be financially appealing, spatially multi-scaled, and ecologically efficient. Considering such premises, a model was elaborated to assess the locals in relation to the kind of management to be adopted (conservation or restoration) and, for locals indicated for restoration, the kind of restoration to be adopted (assisted or passive). Furthermore, we propose a set of ecologically-based alternatives at medium- and local-scale to assist the restoration of areas considered unsuitable for passive restoration. Such techniques are: install artificial connectors among forest fragments near each other, or, for areas where forest fragments are far each other, install nucleation techniques, revitalization of concrete-lined urban rivers, and the control of erosion and invasive plant species. We tested the potential of our model through a case study carried out in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The study area is predominantly occupied by pasture lands, but urbanization also is an important land cover category. There are 661 forest fragments, being 25 of them larger than 50 ha. From the area considered “non-habitat”, i.e., modified due to human usage, 35.5% of the total study area and 45.5% of the study area classified as non-habitat is suitable for passive restoration, and the rest of the area needs is suitable only for assisted restoration techniques. We verified that the facility and low cost of installation are advantageous features of such techniques and the results obtained by mean of application of the assisted techniques indicate that the alternatives tend to accelerate the process of establishing connectivity of the landscape in locals devoid of connections.

TI  - Challenges of urban growth in himalaya with reference to climate change and disaster risk mitigation: A case of nainital town in kumaon middle himalaya, India
PY  - 2019
AB  - Himalaya is the most rapidly urbanizing mountains of the world where the process of urban growth has been fast, but mostly unplanned and unregulated. During the recent decades, Himalaya has experienced rapid urbanization mainly in response to population growth, improved road connectivity, development of tourism and economic globalization. As a result, urbanization has emerged as one of the important drivers of land use and environmental changes depleting natural resources and biodiversity, and disrupting natural drainage and ecosystem services; and increasing vulnerability of anthropogenically modified slopes to a variety of natural risks, particularly under climate change. The paper analyzes the emerging threats of unplanned urban growth in the densely populated Middle Himalayan Ranges with a case illustration of Nainital Town located in Uttarakhand. It was observed that the rapid urbanization is increasing the susceptibility of intensively modified and densely populated fragile slopes to the active processes of mass movement and landslides. Moreover, the rapidly changing climatic conditions, particularly the climate change induced hydrological extremes are posing severe threats to the sustainability of fast-growing urban ecosystem by increasing the frequency, intensity and severity of geo-hydrological hazards in the town and its surrounding region. The city development plan and also the state disaster risk reduction framework and climate change adaptation plan did not make any provision for addressing the emerging risks of climate change in Nainital and other towns of Uttarakhand. A comprehensive climate change vulnerability assessment and mapping of the town should be carried taking into account all the critical parameters of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of urban ecosystem involving a range of institutions and stakeholders. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

TI  - Influences of watershed, riparian-corridor, and reach-scale characteristics on aquatic biota in agricultural watersheds
PY  - 2001
AB  - Multivariate analyses and correlations revealed strong relations between watershed and riparian-corridor land cover, and reach-scale habitat versus fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages in 38 warmwater streams in eastern Wisconsin. Watersheds were dominated by agricultural use, and ranged in size from 9 to 71 km2. Watershed land cover was summarized from satellite-derived data for the area outside a 30-m buffer. Riparian land cover was interpreted from digital orthophotos within 10-, 10- to 20-, and 20- to 30-m buffers. Reach-scale habitat, fish, and macroinvertebrates were collected in 1998 and biotic indices calculated. Correlations between land cover, habitat, and stream-quality indicators revealed significant relations at the watershed, riparian-corridor, and reach scales. At the watershed scale, fish diversity, intolerant fish and EPT species increased, and Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI) decreased as percent forest increased. At the riparian-corridor scale, EPT species decreased and HBI increased as riparian vegetation became more fragmented. For the reach, EPT species decreased with embeddedness. Multivariate analyses further indicated that riparian (percent agriculture, grassland, urban and forest, and fragmentation of vegetation), watershed (percent forest) and reach-scale characteristics (embeddedness) were the most important variables influencing fish (IBI, density, diversity, number, and percent tolerant and insectivorous species) and macroinvertebrate (HBI and EPT) communities.

TI  - Modelling the Influence of Aquatic Vegetation on the Hydrodynamics of an Alternative Bank Protection Measure in a Navigable Waterway
PY  - 2016
AB  - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an effective tool for assessing hydrodynamics in complex environments. This paper reports on a CFD study of navigation-induced flows in a shallow, wave-protected, littoral habitat of the urban Spree River. It was constructed as a rehabilitation structure for aquatic organisms and subject to abundant growth of aquatic and riparian vegetation. This study aims to quantify the hydrodynamics induced by vessel movements and its consequences for water exchange and lateral connectivity between the habitat and the main channel with three representative, natural densities of aquatic plants. The simulations revealed both high efficiency of the rehabilitation structure in reducing hydrodynamic forces in the littoral and a superimposed reduction of hydrodynamic forces, and increase of flushing time with increased plant cover. Higher vegetation density resulted in lower wave propagation and lower connectivity of the rehabilitation structure with the fairway. Thus, natural succession of aquatic vegetation in the shallow habitats leads to increasing isolation and finally to terrestrialization. Maintaining the functionality of the rehabilitation structure as habitat for other aquatic organisms requires either plant removal or preferably adaptive modification, e.g. by successively increasing the openings to the main channel and letting the plants take over the protective function of the technical facilities. The developed CFD model helps to find hydrodynamically optimized solutions and to support decision-making process for maintaining littoral refuges for plants and weak swimming organisms in navigable waterways.

TI  - A review of the impacts and opportunities for african urban dragonflies
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban settlements range from small villages in rural areas to large metropoles with densely packed infrastructures. Urbanization presents many challenges to the maintenance of freshwater quality and conservation of freshwater biota, especially in Africa. There are many opportunities as well, particularly by fostering contributions from citizen scientists. We review the relationships between dragonflies and urbanization in southern Africa. Shifts in dragonfly assemblages indicate environmental change, as different species are variously sensitive to abiotic and biotic water and bank conditions. They are also conservation umbrellas for many other co-occurring species. Major threats to southern African dragonflies include increasing infrastructure densification, frequent droughts, habitat loss, pollution, and invasive alien vegetation. Mitigation measures include implementation of conservation corridors, maintenance of healthy permanent ponds, pollution reduction, and removal of invasive alien trees. Citizen science is now an important approach for supplementing and supporting professional scientific research. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Differential response of migratory guilds of birds to park area and urbanization
PY  - 2022
AB  - Variation in species richness and density of native birds in urban parks and greenspaces (“parks”) is often substantial. Understanding why differences exist, and whether all migratory guilds are equally affected, is poorly known. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 48 undeveloped forested parks in Portland, Oregon, USA, to determine the contributions of park area, shape, connectivity, landscape composition surrounding parks, and differences in structure/composition of local habitat to variation in richness and density of residents, long-distance migrants, and short-distance/partial migrants. Migratory guilds responded differently to environmental factors. Richness and density of long-distance migrants increased with park area and abundance of small (< 10 cm DBH), mostly native, tree species. Resident richness also increased with the abundance of small trees. However, resident and short-distance/partial migrant richness was independent of park area, and resident density declined with increasing area. Park shape, connectivity, and landscape composition did not influence richness or density of any migratory guilds, possibly because of relatively high tree cover in Portland’s landscape. Separate analyses of forest-dependent species of all migratory guilds revealed that area was the primary contributor to variation in density of residents and long-distance migrants, structural habitat features contributed to variation in density of residents but not long-distance migrants, and that density of long-distance migrants declined with elongated park shape. Few forest-dependent species existed in parks below 10 ha, and their minimum area requirements for maintaining populations were estimated to be 30 to 40 ha. Without such parks most long-distance migrants would likely disappear from Portland’s landscape. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - The avian population of an urban bushland reserve at Wollongong, New South Wales: implications for management
PY  - 1993
AB  - This study focuses on the avian ecology and management of a 43.5 ha remnant hind-dune and estuary ecosystem in suburban Wollongong (population 200 000). In total, 62 land-bird species and 24 water-bird species were present between July 1984 and February 1987 (32 months). During area searches (n=12) in each calendar month, an average of 427 individuals of 31 species was recorded with an average species diversity of 70%. The avian population was characterised by a small number of species with high abundance and vice versa. Five species were migratory. Resident species ranged in abundance from the Eastern Whipbird Psophodes olivaceus (maximum population eight birds) to the New Holland Honeyeater Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (maximum population 200 birds). Numbers of the latter species increased markedly in autumn and winter when banksia and coral trees were rich with nectar. Most terrestrial species were habitat specialist, linked to the various microhabitats for food, nesting or protection. Recommendations to preserve the bird community are as follows: (1) the catchment should be managed to control siltation and contamination of the wetland, rather than dredging the estuary itself; (2) wetland diversity should be maintained by allowing water levels to vary naturally; (3) terrestrial microhabitats should be preserved by maintaining their structural and floristic diversity; (4) refuge areas should be established to minimise the impact of human-related disturbance; (5) a network of corridors should be provided to facilitate movement of birds into the reserve; (6) a buffer zone should be maintained around the reserve to shield the birdlife from suburban disturbance and domestic animals. © 1993.

TI  - Assessment of light adequacy for vertical farming in a tropical city
PY  - 2018
AB  - The pursuit of urban agriculture as part of a city's green infrastructure is often a challenge, particularly within compact cities, where there is a limited amount of space between buildings for urban farming and gardening. Instead, such high-rise urban developments present often under-utilized spaces on the vertical surfaces of buildings. A key unknown is the adequacy of light for plant growth. Many leafy vegetables that require high amounts of light form a significant proportion of the staple diet in many Asian countries. We report on the assessment of sunlight adequacy for growing leafy vegetables in a compact tropical city, based on the high-rise and high-density residential environment of Singapore. Leaf physiological traits of seven leafy vegetables were assessed and used to estimate plant light requirements. A survey of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) along exposed corridors showed that the daily light integral (DLI) value ranged from 2 to 35 mol m−2 d−1 under relatively ideal weather conditions during days with abundant solar insolation, and façades that experienced a minimum of half-day direct insolation matched the light requirements of vegetables within the moderate to very high-light categories. With regard to the building form, PAR increased gradually with height, but remains highly influenced by façade orientation and configuration. Owing to the annual north–south oscillation of the sun's path, reduced annual PAR variability and higher total annual PAR at façades, buildings with an east–west orientation will better support continuous vegetable cultivation, especially for basic building typologies without self-shading configurations. However, excessive PAR and temperatures during mid-day hours may hinder plant growth. By highlighting such patterns in levels of PAR, this study confirms the potential for high-rise and high-density conditions in the tropics to support farming using typically under-utilized vertical spaces of residential buildings. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Riparian degradation, stream position in watershed, and proximity to towns facilitate invasion by Hedychium coronarium
PY  - 2021
AB  - Hedychium coronarium is an invasive plant widespread in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, especially in riparian areas. However, its distribution along streams is not continuous and the factors that are related to its local occurrence are unknown. We investigated which natural and anthropogenic drivers, particularly concerning dispersal and disturbance, facilitate establishment of H. coronarium. We sampled 148 randomly chosen riparian sites (each containing two plots) in a subtropical basin in southern Brazil and recorded presence/absence of the plant and some environmental variables in situ; other variables were extracted via GIS software. We performed a GLMM with presence/absence as the response variable, sampling site as a random factor and five predictors: intensity of ecosystem degradation, dominant type of terrestrial vegetation, river substrate size class, Strahler stream order and downstream distance to the nearest urban centre. Our results point out that invader presence is favoured by local human disturbance (high riparian degradation and presence of non-native forest), and possibly dispersal, as there is a higher H. coronarium presence probability in proximity to urban centres. Furthermore, a higher presence probability in downstream sections (higher Strahler order) might be explained by hydrologic dispersal of rhizome fragments. Our study illustrates that in the case of riparian invasions it is important to consider terrestrial and aquatic drivers, both natural and anthropogenic. © Bellini and Becker.

TI  - Analyzing land cover change and urban growth trajectories of the mega-urban region of Dhaka using remotely sensed data and an ensemble classifier
PY  - 2018
AB  - Accurate information on, and human interpretation of, urban land cover using satellite-derived sensor imagery is critical given the intricate nature and niches of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors occurring at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Forest-a non-parametric ensemble classifier-has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km2 in 1972 to 378 km2 in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh. © 2017 by the authors.

TI  - River Network Changes Over Suzhou China: An Insight from Urban Expansion
PY  - 2021
AB  - To understand geographical presentation of rapid urbanization and dense river network in Suzhou China, the authors utilize remote sensing information of different spatiotemporal resolution (2002-2018) to map the built-up areas and river network within the city through standardized processes. A vertical analogous quantitative method is applied to analyze the spatiotemporal relationship between urban expansion and river network recession at regional and pixel scales. Such relationship is essential in order to predict likely responses of river network recession induced by accelerating urbanization around rivers in terms of characteristic parameters such as river network density, river chains, nodes, connection rate and fractal dimension, and shows the following results: (1) The urban constructions in Suzhou have changed from expanding in all directions around the regional downtown to expanding around the multiple downtown associated with a networked connection. (2) The river network density has decreased during the urban expansion, with a stable connection rate induced by similar connectivity index, and a slightly decreased fractal dimension indicated slightly decrease of river network complexity. In the meantime, outside of the downtown, the river network has not shown obvious changes in the farmland and vegetation area. (3) The river network is significantly affected by urban expansion. Before 2010, the river network density has decreased evenly distributed in all grid cells. But after 2010, the decreases of the river network are more concentrated in grid cells with a lower proportion of built-up increment, which meant the decreases mainly occurred in the border of the urban expansion. The method in this research can provide scientific basis for the spatial planning decision making of urban ecosystem and the remote sensing scale effect research. © 2021, Science Press.

TI  - Combating Urban Heat Island Effect—A Review of Reflective Pavements and Tree Shading Strategies
PY  - 2021
AB  - Pavements occupy about 40% of urban land cover, with 75–80% black top roads, playing a critical role in urban connectivity and mobility. Solar energy is absorbed and stored in pavements leading to an increase in surface temperatures. Decreasing green cover is further contributing to rise in regional temperatures. Due to this activity, the city experiences urban heat island (UHI). This study presents a critical review of the literature on mitigation measures to combat UHI using reflective pavements with an emphasis on durability properties and impacts of tree canopy. The strategies with a focus on application of chip seals, white toppings, and coatings were discussed. Role of surface reflectance, including those from asphalt and concrete pavements, albedo improvements, and technological trends, application of waste materials, and industrial by-products are presented. Also, urban tree shading systems’ contribution to pavement temperature and microclimate systems is presented. The review shows that the development of mitigation measures using tree shading systems can reduce the pavement temperature during daytime and increase human thermal comfort. The outcomes of this review provide a scope for future studies to develop sustainable and state-of-the-art engineering solutions in the field of reflective coatings and urban forest systems.

TI  - Budapest
PY  - 2015
AB  - Budapest is situated in the Carpathian Basin close to Central Europe. It occupies 525 km2 and has a population of 1.7 million. Although the city is built on one of the oldest hominid settlements in Europe, it was not given its present name until 1873 when it was formed by the merging of Buda, Obuda and Pest. The city is divided by the Danube river, which flows from north to south and contains two long islands—Szentendre to the north and Csepel to the south. The solid geology of Buda (on the right bank of the river) is predominantly limestone and dolomite, which form a series of hills and valleys, whereas Pest comprises the Danube floodplain, which overlies the Triassic deposits. The varied geology and geomorphology have given rise to a wide range of habitats, including mountains, lowlands, forests, arable land, wetland and the biggest river in Europe, Danube. The face of Budapest has changed rapidly throughout its history with periods of expansion being punctuated by conflict. There is very little information about the fauna before the eighteenth century, which is restricted to observations and anecdotes in the dailies or hunting magazines. There are two large reviews of the fauna of Budapest, one published in 1879, the other in 1942. The chapter lists the 107 vertebrate species that have been recorded in Budapest in recent times: 33 fish, 10 amphibians, 16 reptiles and 48 mammals. Most of the urban mammal species are common, small-to midsized generalists. The diversity and easy availability of food resources and shelter and the low number of predators and competitors compensate for the fragmented pattern of habitats and human disturbance. The future of urban mammals very much depends on the quality of ‘green’ spaces and the corridors between them. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.

TI  - The effects of urbanization on biodiversity and water quality in the Rio das Velhas Basin, Brazil
PY  - 2005
AB  - In Brazil, most urban sewage is discharged without treatment into rivers. This is the situation for the Rio das Velhas, which receives in its upper course the sewage of the state capital of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, with more than 2.4 million inhabitants. Our study focuses on the effects of basin urbanization on aquatic biodiversity and water quality in the Rio das Velhas. We use the assemblage structure and taxonomic composition of fishes and benthic macroinvertebrates as biological indicators of water quality. Effects of Belo Horizonte's discharge included changes in water quality and declines in fish and benthos richness and diversity. However, the absence of dams in the Rio das Velhas main course, associated with connectivity with the Rio São Francisco system and tributaries in excellent condition, increase its rehabilitation potential. © 2005 by the American Fisheries Society.

TI  - Emergency architecture. Modular construction of healthcare facilities as a response to pandemic outbreak
PY  - 2021
AB  - Emerging infectious diseases originating from wildlife species continue to demolish humankind leaving an imprint on human history. December 2019 has marked the emergence of a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-2019) originated in China in the city of Wuhan. Drastic emergence and spread of infectious disease have shown to appear in highly densified areas causing rapid spread of epidemic through population movement, transmission routes, major activity nodes, proximity, and connectivity of urban spaces. An extreme number of cases rising throughout the world caused space unavailability in healthcare facilities to serve patients infected with Covid-2019, therefore urging for innovative emergency management response from construction and architecture industry. Prefabricated modular construction has been widely utilized around the globe assembling rapid response facilities after catastrophic events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and forest fires. An increasing number of Covid-2019 cases demanded effective and compressed implementation of medical centres to provide expeditious and secure healthcare.

TI  - Air pollution mitigation through vegetation barriers and green space
PY  - 2020
AB  - Air pollution has been identified by the World Health Organization as one of the leading causes of illness and death in the world. In many cities, transportation facilities such as highways, rail-lines, airports, marine ports, and other freight movement corridors experience some of the highest air pollution levels. These transportation facilities are often located where people spend significant amounts of time living, working, and going to school. Methods to reduce the impact of air pollution near large transportation sources can lead to improved public health. Roadside vegetation has been shown to impact air quality downwind of these sources, with some studies identifying reductions in air pollution concentrations and others indicating increases in pollutant levels when vegetation is present. This chapter summarizes recommendations for roadside vegetation and green space characteristics that can lead to improved local air quality, which can be used by planners and developers to achieve air quality and health benefits. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Regional variation in habitat matrix determines movement metrics in Baudin's cockatoos in southwest Western Australia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Context: The Baudin's cockatoo is one of three black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia and is listed as Endangered by state and federal governments. Although there is a Recovery Plan in place for this species, conservation efforts are hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding the species movement ecology. Aims: To identify key foraging and roosting habitat for Baudin's cockatoos and to determine differences in flock movements, including the spatial extent of movement, in Urban, Peri-urban and Forest regions using telemetry data. Methods: Wild Baudin's cockatoos that had been injured and undergone rehabilitation were equipped with satellite PTT (platform transmitter terminal) and GPS tags and released back into wild flocks. The study birds, and the flocks into which they integrated, were tracked in the field to collect telemetry and observational data. Satellite data were used to define the types of movement behaviour (resident, ranging, migratory), and GPS data were analysed to determine key foraging and roosting habitat, and to calculate home range area estimates. Key results: There was a significant difference in flock movement between the Urban/Peri-urban regions and the Forest region in terms of daily distances moved and distances between roosts, with these parameters being far greater for the Forest region. Additionally, flock sizes were larger in the Forest region compared with the Urban and Peri-urban regions. In Urban and Peri-urban regions, key habitat comprised remnant vegetation in urban green space (nature reserves, parks and private property), and roadside and riparian vegetation, which served as movement corridors in the landscape. Conclusions: The research shows that it is important to maintain vegetation connectivity in the landscape. This enables Baudin's cockatoos to utilise key patches of remnant vegetation in their non-breeding wintering grounds in Urban and Peri-urban regions of the Perth Peel Coastal Plain. Further research on the movement ecology of Baudin's cockatoos should focus on habitat suitability modelling, which, in combination with the identified key habitat sites, will benefit the decision-making process in relation to conservation management of this endangered black cockatoo species. Implications: This research has benefited the conservation management of Baudin's cockatoos by providing information on key habitat through satellite tracking and outlining the importance of the connective features of remnant vegetation. We advocate for further telemetry studies combined with habitat suitability modelling to preserve the necessary habitat for the persistence of this species in the Western Australian landscape. © 2021 CSIRO.

TI  - Landscape genetics of the nonnative red fox of California
PY  - 2016
AB  - Invasive mammalian carnivores contribute disproportionately to declines in global biodiversity. In California, nonnative red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have significantly impacted endangered ground-nesting birds and native canids. These foxes derive primarily from captive-reared animals associated with the fur-farming industry. Over the past five decades, the cumulative area occupied by nonnative red fox increased to cover much of central and southern California. We used a landscape-genetic approach involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 13 microsatellites of 402 nonnative red foxes removed in predator control programs to investigate source populations, contemporary connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics. Both markers indicated high population structuring consistent with origins from multiple introductions and low subsequent gene flow. Landscape-genetic modeling indicated that population connectivity was especially low among coastal sampling sites surrounded by mountainous wildlands but somewhat higher through topographically flat, urban and agricultural landscapes. The genetic composition of populations tended to be stable for multiple generations, indicating a degree of demographic resilience to predator removal programs. However, in two sites where intensive predator control reduced fox abundance, we observed increases in immigration, suggesting potential for recolonization to counter eradication attempts. These findings, along with continued genetic monitoring, can help guide localized management of foxes by identifying points of introductions and routes of spread and evaluating the relative importance of reproduction and immigration in maintaining populations. More generally, the study illustrates the utility of a landscape-genetic approach for understanding invasion dynamics and metapopulation structure of one of the world's most destructive invasive mammals, the red fox. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Analysis of urban forest landscape pattern in Hefei
PY  - 2003
AB  - Based on the theory and methodology of landscape ecology, the landscape pattern of the study area (17.6 km2) in the downtown of Hefei was analyzed by using the techniques of RS, GPS and GIS. The object was to provide a comprehensive method to study urban forest structure and its function in environmental improvement. The results showed that there were 5 major landscape elements, i.e., building and hard pavement surface, water, road, urban forest, and general green land in the area. The landscape matrix was building and pavement surface, occupied 73.13 % of total land. Road was the typical corridor element in the city and occupied 6.89%. Green land occupied 11.44 %, in which, urban forest patch occupied 9.18 %. There were 408 urban forest patches, with an area of 161.16 hm2. The average area of the patch was 0.396 hm2, and the maximum area was 12 hm2, 48 % of urban forest patch was identified as small scale patches with &lt; 500 m2 of area, and only 8.6 % of them was larger than 1 hm2. The number of general green land patch was 255, with an area of 39.74 hm2, which accounted for 2.26 % of land area, and its average and maximum area was 0.1558 hm2 and 3.86 hm2, respectively. There were 147 water patches, with an area of 149.93 hm2, and occupied 8.54 % of land, and the average and maximum area of the patch was 1.02 hm2 and 16 hm2, respectively. In the study area, both of the Shannon-Weiner landscape diversity index and evenness were low, only 0.928 and 0.576, respectively. In addition, the dominance of urban forest patch and general green land was 0.39, showing that the two landscape elements had a certain influence on the environment of the study area. The concept of interior habitat for forest was introduced in this paper, which was employed to make a scale class system of urban forest patch. The threshold area with interior habitat for urban forest patch was 9800m2, and there was 31.69hm2 of interior habitat of urban forest in total, which occupied 19.7 % of the total area of urban forest patch. This situation was not favorable for providing more habitats to support species diversity. It's suggested that the concept of interior habitat could be employed to identify urban forest patch, and a scale system of small scale patch of urban forest-middle patch-large patch-extra large patch was build in the paper. Based on this system, the ratio of different scales of urban forest patch in the study area should be 2:2:2:3. The authors also suggested that larger pieces (1.5-3.0 hm2) of urban forest patch should be built, and more urban forests should be established in the northeastern part of the city in the future.

TI  - Conservation and use
PY  - 2015
AB  - The Yucatán Peninsula has a great biological, ecological and cultural diversity, marked historically by the Mayan civilization and biologically by its high endemism, and affinity with nearby regions. It is botanically well known with an estimated total richness of over 2300 vascular plant species, but there is uncertainty about the number of rare species (195 rare woody species are estimated to occur in its forests). Further research on the population dynamics, distribution and ecology of rare and endemic species of the peninsula is needed. Its biodiversity also provides various ecosystem services, such as provisioning, including about 680 species of medicinal plants, 145 edible species and 130 timber-species; and regulation of air and water quality (terrestrial ecosystems of the peninsula protect and help regulate one of the largest karstic aquifers worldwide), and climate. The Yucatán Peninsula has the second-largest forested area in Latin America after the Amazon basin, and harbors the largest natural reservoir of carbon in Mexico (3554 Pg). However, this biodiversity and the environmental services it provides are threatened by human activities linked to development policies focused on short-term economic benefits, leading to forest fires and land use change for agriculture, tourism, roads or urban development. Thus, by 2010, the primary vegetation occupied only 22 % of the region. Fortunately, protected areas cover 21.6 % of the total land area and, along with other initiatives (Mesoamerican Biological Corridor-Mexico), and sustainable productive activities (beekeeping, alternative tourism), have conserved large tracts of forests, along with the biodiversity and environmental services they provide. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

TI  - Managing entrenched weed problems in botany wetlands - An urban stormwater basin in Sydney
PY  - 1999
AB  - The Botany Wetlands comprise a series interconnected ponds and adjoining land, which stretch over a 4-km corridor in the highly urbanised eastern suburbs of Sydney. The ponds serve as a major stormwater basin, draining an area of approximately 20 km2 of surface catchment. The pressures of urban expansion, which include urban and industrial stormwater, drainage, run-off from golf courses and leachate from a nearby landfill, have had a significant adverse impact on the Wetlands. Over several decades, the native plant community in the Wetlands has degraded and given way to massive infestations of weeds. These include Ludwigia peruviana, an introduced weed, a host of other noxious weeds such as Alligator Weed, Water Hyacinth, Pampas Grass, Lantana and Blackberry, and other undesirable vegetation (Willow Trees, Coral Trees and Camphor Laurels). The dominance of alien species is mainly a result of nutrient enrichment and sedimentation, combined with changing land use, and altered hydrologic regimes. Efforts to restore the Wetland's ecological and environmental values and rehabilitate the stormwater basin commenced in 1996. This required the initial removal of entrenched weed infestations, and replacement of the weed dominated vegetation by native, aquatic and terrestrial vegetation. The strategy for removal of the massive weed infestations was repeated, timely applications of herbicides, followed by large-scale mechanical and manual weed removal and controlled burning of dead plants. The strategy for revegetation and restoration of the areas cleared was based on natural regeneration by the native macrophytes, supplemented by active replanting of a range of desired species in order to maximise species diversity. Species were selected for plantings based on their ability to rapidly colonise sites, resist weed invasion, withstand herbicide spray effects, and provide desirable habitat and aesthetic characteristics. Water level management was essential for successful weed control operations by improving access and encouraging subsequent revegetation. This paper provides an overview of the problems encountered in implementing the strategies, some solutions, and discusses the success of the operations.

TI  - Effects of within-Patch heterogeneity on connectivity in pond-Breeding amphibians studied by means of an individual-Based model
PY  - 2013
AB  - The metapopulation framework presumes the habitat of a local population to be continuous and homogenous, and patch area is often used as a proxy for population size. Many populations of pond-Breeding amphibians are assumed to follow metapopulation dynamics, and connectivity is mostly measured between breeding ponds. However, the habitat of pond-Breeding amphibians is not only defined by the pond but, typically, consists of a breeding pond surrounded by clusters of disjoint summer-habitat patches interspersed with an agricultural/semi-urban matrix. We hypothesise that the internal structure of a habitat patch may change connectivity in two ways: (i) by affecting animal movements and thereby emigration and immigration probabilities; and (ii) by affecting habitat quality and population size. To test our hypotheses, we apply a spatially explicit individual-Based model of Moor frog dispersal. We find that the realised connectivity depends on internal structure of both the target and the source patch as well as on how habitat quality is affected by patch structure. Although fragmentation is generally thought to have negative effects on connectivity, our results suggest that, depending on patch structure and habitat quality, positive effects on connectivity may occur. © Author(s) 2013.

TI  - Aeolian sand activity characteristics of wind erosion and desertification in the grassland area of central Mongolia: A case of Choir City
PY  - 2022
AB  - Desertification is known to be the“cancer of the earth”. Mongolia is a country with the most serious desertification in the world. The desertified land in Mongolia is still expanding, and the central region is an important new expansion area. The frequent dust storms have caused serious harm and are a great threat to infrastructure connectivity, energy and resource base construction, ecological security, and environmental health and have become a major hurdle limiting Mongolia's socio-economic development and ecological security. Choir City, the capital of Gobi Sumber Province, is located in the central part of Mongolia. It is an important section of the Mongolian Plateau of the China-Mongolia-Russia economic corridor. It belongs to the mixed zone of grassland, dry grassland, and desert grassland. It is sensitive to natural and human disturbance and has serious wind erosion desertification. In this study, the wind dynamic conditions for the occurrence of local wind erosion desertification were examined using observations from the self-built automatic meteorological observatory (May 2019-July 2020) and the meteorological station of Choir City (1990-2018) and the sand collector (August 2019-August 2020). The results showed that (1) there were strong wind dynamic conditions for the occurrence of wind erosion desertification in the region. The annual sand drift potential was 735.96 VU, the resultant sand drift potential was 428.76 VU, and the resultant drift direction was SSW (195.06°). The wind direction variability index was 0.58, which belonged to the high wind energy environment with a moderate rate of variation-blunted double-peak wind conditions. (2) The critical wind speed was affected by soil moisture and vegetation coverage, which varied with seasons: it was the highest in summer and the lowest in winter, and spring and autumn are in the middle. (3) Because of the strong wind dynamic conditions and degraded surface, the sediment transport flux of aeolian sand flow was very high (2.135 t·m−1·a−1) in Choir City. The maximum sediment transport rate model developed by Owen was suitable for the simulation of aeolian sand flow in this area. This study presented a detailed analysis of wind dynamic conditions in Choir City, located in the central desert steppe region of Mongolia. The characteristics of critical starting winds in Choir City were analyzed in each season by combining soil moisture and particle size, vegetation conditions, and other factors to identify the wind dynamic basis and related influencing factors in the central steppe region of Mongolia and provide basic data for local wind and sand disaster control. The research results could provide an important reference for desertification control, ecological restoration, and local engineering construction in the desert steppe area of central Mongolia. © 2022 Science Press (China)

TI  - A genetic discontinuity in moose (Alces alces) in Alaska corresponds with fenced transportation infrastructure
PY  - 2015
AB  - The strength and arrangement of movement barriers can impact the connectivity among habitat patches. Anthropogenic barriers (e.g. roads) are a source of habitat fragmentation that can disrupt these resource networks and can have an influence on the spatial genetic structure of populations. Using microsatellite data, we evaluated whether observed genetic structure of moose (Alces alces) populations were associated with human activities (e.g. roads) in the urban habitat of Anchorage and rural habitat on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. We found evidence of a recent genetic subdivision among moose in Anchorage that corresponds to a major highway and associated infrastructure. This subdivision is most likely due to restrictions in gene flow due to alterations to the highway (e.g. moose-resistant fencing with one-way gates) and a significant increase in traffic volume over the past 30 years; genetic subdivision was not detected on the Kenai Peninsula in an area not bisected by a major highway. This study illustrates that anthropogenic barriers can substructure wildlife populations within a few generations and highlights the value of genetic assessments to determine the effects on connectivity among habitat patches in conjunction with behavioral and ecological data. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Not-so-wild things: Coping with wild animals-and vice versa
PY  - 2001
AB  - Conflicts between humans and wildlife are increasing. But the basic scenario is common to all. Humans, because of population increases and sprawling patterns of development, invade wildlife habitat. The invaders expect Nature to be picturesque and want to live right next to it. But they also want gardens and landscaping, and they want Fido to be free to roam without becoming coyote bait. Wildlife live by different rules. In report after report on recent encounters between animals and humans, police and wildlife officials point out that the wildlife are only doing what's natural-trying to survive-and that naive humans often increase the potential for conflict by putting food out for wildlife. The experts also note that the overpopulation of certain species is a sign of serious imbalance in the ecosystems in which they are found, and that it is people's intrusion that is most often to blame. So what's to be done? The first step, according to the National Wildlife Federation, is to recognize the impacts of sprawl. Low- density, auto- dependent development eliminates, fragments, and degrades habitat. Nesting and foraging sites are destroyed, food supplies and water quality are compromised, roads and power lines fracture corridors needed for movement, and the diversity needed to maintain a viable ecosystem is lost. Some species slide from threatened to endangered, while others overbreed. The federation advocates smart growth as the alternative: infill as opposed to greenbelt invasion, and compact development concentrated in town centers. Planners have heard it all before from the new urbanists, but now the wildlife advocates are joining the chorus.

TI  - Landscape response functions for biodiversity - Assessing the impact of land-use changes at the county level
PY  - 2004
AB  - Assessing the impact of land-use change on biodiversity is an important task in the context of global-change scenarios. Here, conceptual considerations, descriptions of a model solution and results of a case study for the regional scale are presented. Land-use was seen as an integrative variable, which depends on natural, as well as on socioeconomic parameters. Economic processes have been externalized by using results of economy driven base-scenarios about land-use change at the county level. Tendencies from these scenarios were extracted, expanded to a set of sub-scenarios, and transformed into land-use maps by a land-use model. These land-use maps were evaluated with respect to biodiversity at the ecosystem level. The results of the evaluation of the single sub-scenarios were summarized to response functions, which describe the sensitivity of landscape attributes toward land-use changes. It is stated that biodiversity is not a generic indicator and can only be assessed after defining the context. Here, only ecosystems with low hemeroby ('semi-natural' ecosystems) were considered. The concept of hemeroby, which describes the degree of human disturbance on ecosystems, was used as a qualitative complement to the quantitative concept of biodiversity. Biodiversity was assessed by means of six indicators for three aspects of biodiversity: composition, structure and function. The model was applied in a case study dealing with the impact of extensification of grassland on biodiversity in the county Havelland, west of Berlin. In general, the compositional aspect of biodiversity demonstrated the clearest response. Structural diversity reacted only moderately, but a strong impact of land-use change on connectivity was indicated by an increasing proximity of semi-natural biotopes. The latter was proven by evaluating the connectivity of semi-natural grasslands from the perspective of the white stork (Ciconia ciconia). All response functions showed a high heterogeneity in spatial and functional aspect. At the landscape level, the heterogeneity was hidden behind a supposed moderate reaction of landscape. This underlines the demand for a spatially explicit realization of land-use scenarios and for the consideration of a wide range of scenarios by means of response functions. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - \"Liaisons dangereuses\": The invasive red-vented bulbul ( Pycnonotus cafer), a disperser of exotic plant species in New Caledonia
PY  - 2018
AB  - The biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia hosts high levels of endemism (74% of flora) that is threatened increasingly by climate change, habitat reduction, and inva-sive species. The fruit-eating red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) is currently invading the main island of the archipelago, and its recent dispersal out of urbanized habitats raises questions about its potential to disperse noxious plant seeds along urban corridors and beyond. Indeed, the red-vented bulbul is considered a vector of several introduced plant species in its alien range including Miconia calvescens, Lantana camara, and Schinus terebinthifolius. We conducted a quantitative assessment of the bulbul's fruits consumption by analyzing the gut contents of shot birds. We estimated gut passage times for four species of fruit found in gut contents (S. terebin-thifolius, Myrtastrum rufopunctatum, Passiflora suberosa, and Ficus prolixa) and tested the effects of bird digestion on seed germination rates for two species. Finally, we monitored the movements of individual VHF radio-tagged red-vented bulbuls. All of the consumed fruit species we identified here have red fleshy diaspore, including fruit of the shrub M. rufopunctatum that occurred frequently (9.6%) in bulbul gut samples. Median gut passage times were short (15-41 min), corresponding to short-distance seed transportation (77-92 m). The effect of gut passage was positive for the germination of the invasive S. terebinthifolius and negative for the endemic M. ru-fopunctatum, suggesting a potential bias in the contribution to the dispersal toward alien species. This study provides the first integrated assessment of mechanisms involved in the seed dispersal effectiveness of this high-concern invasive bird species that is expected to face similar plant communities in most of its alien range in tropical islands. More generally, our results enhance knowledge of synergies between non-native frugivores and plant species dispersal.

TI  - Stormwater basins of the New Jersey coastal plain: Subsidies or sinks for frogs and toads?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Stormwater basins are commonly employed structures designed to mitigate the negative effects of urban runoff. They are ubiquitous in the urbanized landscape; yet the effect of these basins on anurans has only recently been addressed. Stormwater basins have the potential to influence the breeding distribution of anurans by being sources for some species and sinks for others. Our study aims to determine which species benefit from the existence of stormwater basins, which species are negatively impacted, and what variables are the best predictors of these effects. We monitored thirty-six permanently-ponded basins in southern New Jersey for the presence of anuran larvae and calling males by aural surveys, dip-netting and trapping. We assessed fish presence by interviews, visual encounters, dip-netting, and traps. We divided near shore buffer areas into impervious surface and managed or unmanaged categories for both grass and woody vegetation. Two connectivity metrics, distance to canopied corridor and percent of undeveloped upland were analyzed with ArcGIS. Fish were detected in 92% of the basins. Resistance to fish predation distinguished successful species, those with larvae present, from unsuccessful species, those with calling activity but no larval presence. Connectivity to and availability of terrestrial habitat were significant predictors of the breeding species richness at the basins. Number of calling species increased as access to and amount of terrestrial habitat increased. Therefore, design, management, and placement of permanently-ponded basins can impact anuran communities. Additionally, as wet basins are sources for Rana catesbeiana, where bullfrogs are invasive, basins will likely increase propagule pressure. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Ownership property size, landscape structure, and spatial relationships in the Edwards Plateau of Texas (USA): landscape scale habitat management implications
PY  - 2016
AB  - The present research focused on using spatial analysis to determine relationships among land ownership property sizes and landscape structure, with a focus on conservation management implications. Indices and metrics of ownership property sizes and landscape structure were calculated for 20 km buffer areas around 31 North American Breeding Bird Survey transects, 12 located within the Edwards Plateau ecoregion and 18 in contiguous ecoregions. The number of bird species observed at each transect provided a measure of avian species richness associated with land cover classes for each respective transect (Gonzalez in Urban influence on diversity of avifauna in the Edwards Plateau of Texas: effect of property sizes on rural landscape structure, Texas A&M University, 2005). Spatial correlations were calculated between each pair of the landscape indices. Spatial analysis identified a “threshold of habitat fragmentation” for the 500 acre (ac) ownership property size. Significant spatial correlations among variables showed that property sizes lower than 500 ac produced habitat fragmentation represented by a decrease in mean patch size (MN) and proximity among habitat patches (Index PROX). Spatial analysis also made possible the prioritization of ecological sub-regions of the Edwards Plateau for conservation or restoration. The Live Oak-Mesquite Savannah showed the highest average ownership property size (7305 ac) and the highest values of patch richness. Based on the results, management in the Live Oak-Mesquite Savannah sub-region should focus on the conservation of land mosaic diversity to assure native avian species turnover (Whittaker 1972). In Balcones Canyon Lands, 64 % of land was covered by farms smaller than 500 ac and the overall average ownership property size was above the threshold of fragmentation (1440 ac), implying that management policies there should focus both on habitat conservation and on restoration. In contrast, 71 % of land in the Lampasas Cut Plains was covered by farms smaller than 500 ac, and average ownership property size was very close to the fragmentation threshold (625 ac). Consequently, the results indicate that management in the Lampasas Cut Plains sub-region should focus on habitat restoration (e.g., corridors that connect isolated habitat patches). In general, the threshold of ownership property size, 500 ac, is important for conservation planning because below that threshold of property size, habitat patch size begins to decrease and the distance between equivalent patches of habitat increases. Isolated patches act as islands within a sea of less suitable habitat which produce negative effects on biodiversity. Identifying the spatial characteristics indicative of habitat fragmentation, or the likelihood thereof, is an important issue for conservation planning in places with urban sprawl influence.

TI  - Engaging in social interaction: relationships between the accessibility of path structure and intensity of passive social interaction in urban parks
PY  - 2022
AB  - Purpose: Functioning as space connectors, path structures in urban parks may rarely present social interaction opportunities, although centralized activity spaces are available. This paper investigated the interrelationships between the visual and physical accessibility attributes of path structure and their impacts on passive social interaction intensity across urban parks in Kuala Lumpur. Design/methodology/approach: The concept of social interaction has been studied elsewhere in social cohesion, social affiliation and sense of communication. Still, it has not been studied in the context of urban park design. This study employed mixed methods using an adaptive and unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data collections to analyze urban parks with a bit of visual vegetation barrier. The experiential landscape method was applied to determine visual accessibility by interpreting experiential landscape maps. The space syntax method based on quantitative analysis is considered to measure physical accessibilities and vigorous activities along the designated paths by conducting integration analysis and gate observation. The data were crossed-analyzed using a Geographic Information System (GIS) classification technique, correlation analysis and Microsoft combo-charts to generate the relationship between patterns of activities and their accessibilities. Findings: The results suggested that designated paths with higher accessibility attributes, impressively more elevated than other tracks, could influence the intensity of passive social interactions. The findings supported the understanding that activity nodes and active areas adjoining designated routes could make accessibility attribute areas more critical. These findings verify that visually enriching the spaces along the path structure toward activities is a pivotal contributor to urban planners and designers to enhance the paths’ local integration (LI) and visual accessibility to predict more passive eye contact among park visitors. Research limitations/implications: The proposed interrelationship among variables in this study has limitations because of not considering other qualitative methods and techniques like cognitive maps and interview simultaneously. These techniques could discover why some paths generate more passive eye contact among park users (Mohammadi Tahroodi, 2018). Practical implications: Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 emphasizes Kuala Lumpur’s unique image as a tropical garden city via preserving and developing the iconic historical urban parks in the city center (CHKL, 2004, pp. 3–3). The latest Draft Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2040 has outlined the strategy to achieve a conducive, good-quality neighborhood that encourages social interaction. The findings could assist urban planners and designers better public parks by considering accessibility and permeability aspects of design. This research endorses the appropriateness of interrelationship between accessibility attributes of path structure and social interaction in urban design research, which local urban designers have not fully considered until now. Evaluating the visual convenience of designated paths and assessing LI of the axial lines constructing each designated route of urban parks during the primary stage could enable urban designers to estimate to what extent the paths are accessible and respond to passive social interaction. Then they could enrich with salient landmarks, views and activity nodes to make them attractive. The considerable number of designated paths connections, specifically while they shape the sides of activity nodes, could increase the connectivity and integration of spaces within the parks. These patterns of positioning the activity nodes make the designated routes more legible and provide ease of movement. As a result, it will give urban park users more information about the activities. Allowing people to use the paths will increase people’s presence and, subsequently, passive social interaction. One way is to locate accessible lands that provide social activities at direct visual access paths within urban parks for legibility. Social implications: The socially responsive urban design enhances the quality of life and provides life satisfaction, happiness and society’s overall health. Being in urban social parks in any passive and active situations has psychological benefits. It facilitates relief and rests from a stressful modern lifestyle that significantly impacts their mental health and well-being. The framework applied in this research integrates the social, spatial and physical aspects of parks design. With this regard, principles and indicators facilitate physically and socially attractive urban parks for Kuala Lumpur city center and applicable to similar contexts elsewhere. Originality/value: The concept of social interaction has been studied elsewhere in social cohesion, social affiliation and sense of communication. Still, it has not been studied in the context of urban park design. This study employed mixed methods using an adaptive and unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data collections to analyze urban parks with a bit of visual vegetation barrier. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - The skipper butterflies (lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) of the reserva ecológica leonelo oviedo, San José, Costa Rica
PY  - 2019
AB  - Hesperiidae is one of the most diverse families of butterflies in Costa Rica, with approximately 486 species. Even so, there are few butterfly lists where this group has been included. In this paper, we present information on seasonality, abundance and natural history features of this family for the Leonelo Oviedo Ecological Reserve (RELO), a 2 ha forest embedded in an urban matrix. Over the course of two years, a monthly sampling was carried out on a 270 m trail across the Reserve from 08:00 to 12:00, collecting all the individuals locted within 5 m on each side of the trail. To better represent the richness, individuals were also randomly collected for more than ten years, but the butterflies collected in this way were not included in the statistical analysis. Photographs were taken of all the species in order to provide an identification guide. For the cryptic species, drawings and dissections of the genitalia were made. For the community indexes we used Microsoft Excel and the Shannon index with base two logarithm. For the summary of the monthly data analysis were done according to dry and wet season. For a comparison of richness and abundance we did a g-test to evaluate if there are differences between seasons; however, with the use of the R package vegan a hierarchical cluster analysis was done using the Jaccard index with Wards minimum variance agglomerative method. With R package pvclust the uncertainty of the clusters based on a bootstrap with 10 000 iterations. 423 individuals of 49 species were included in the statistical analysis, from a total of 435 individuals of 58 species. A tendency to greater richness and abundance of skippers was found during the dry season. Through the cluster analysis, it was possible to determine that in relation to the diversity of skippers, both wet seasons are grouped significantly (P = 0.05). The dry seasons are also grouped significantly (P = 0.05). The reserve has connectivity with other green areas via a stream. During the wet season, plant growth increases connectivity, which could lead to the entry of new individuals of different species that are not permanent residents of RELO and establish small populations, increasing the richness and abundance of species. This added to the variation in the occurrence of some species of butterflies in response to seasonal variations and differences in the availability of resources in different seasons explains the grouping of species between seasons. © 2019 by Revista de Biologia Tropical.

TI  - Chicago Wilderness: A new force in urban conservation
PY  - 2002
AB  - In 1996, a coalition of diverse and determined organizations launched a new initiative in the Chicago region. Our vision? Chicago Wilderness: a thriving mosaic of natural areas, connected by greenways and wildlife corridors, embedded in the nation's third largest metropolis. In this vision, the region's human communities reclaim a cultural tradition of protecting anti restoring these globally significant natural communities that enrich our lives. Today, more than 100 organizations join forces to transform this vision into reality. A regional Biodiversity Recovery Plan - the result of three years of assessment and planning by scientists, land managers, educators, and policy strategists - sets priorities and determines the lines of action for the coalition. This regional agenda stems from our vision and recovery goals for each ecological community; it encourages targeted research initiatives that focus on characterizing our native biological diversity and on analyzing elements critical to its recovery. Ultimately, though, the long-term survival of our natural wealth rests on the support from the public. While the challenges to conservation educators and communicators are many, Chicago Wilderness allows us to work together in understanding our audiences, channeling our resources, and creating novel approaches to engage the widest public in our conservation efforts.

TI  - Multiscale determinants of Pacific chorus frog occurrence in a developed landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla) populations have persisted despite urban and rural development throughout the species’ range; yet it is possible that P. regilla, like other anurans with which it historically co-occurred, will become extirpated from cities and suburbs if urbanization intensifies as predicted. An improved understanding of the conditions that enable this species to persist in developed landscapes is needed to identify and conserve suitable habitats. We investigated species-habitat relationships for P. regilla in a mixed urban-rural landscape in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to identify potential criteria for habitat suitability. We conducted repeat auditory surveys of chorusing males at 52 potential breeding wetlands and modeled occupancy at 26 of these sites using local and landscape variables representing competing hypotheses and spatial scales of influence. The models that best explained P. regilla occupancy included a combination of terrestrial habitat and connectivity factors and the presence of non-native predators. We found that the proportion of impervious cover within 250 m of a wetland had the strongest negative impact on occupancy. Our findings suggest that availability of terrestrial habitat adjacent to breeding sites is the primary driver of species presence in the developed landscape. Conservation efforts should seek to limit impervious cover to less than 20% within a 250-m buffer around breeding wetlands. Further, restored and created wetlands in urban and rural areas may be more likely to support P. regilla if they are designed with a seasonal hydroperiod that excludes non-native aquatic predators and are placed in an area of high pond density.

TI  - Outside the forest stand: Analysis of urban forest buffer zones to implement nature-based solutions - A case study of Poznan (Poland)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban forests are important and highly valuable natural elements of urban green infrastructure (GI). The tightening of developed areas in the vicinity of urban forests results in negative changes in water relations, the disruption of the continuity of wildlife corridors, and the growing number of users, which has an impact on the degradation of urban forest ecosystems. This study, conducted in Poznart, Poland, provides an analysis of urban forest buffer zones regarding land use type, the high greenery ratio, and the planning decisions that could serve as a nature-based solution (NbS). The study shows a significant change in developed land area in the urban forest buffer zones with the width of 500 m and 100 m. That change occurred between 1997 and 2019 and should be a matter of concern. Coverage of the buffer zones with high greenery, which turned out to be very diverse, could be treated as a forest extension and an element mitigating the negative transition between the forest and the city. Different land use types were taken into consideration, especially in developed areas. The buffer zones of urban forests should be developed with spatial planning tools like data management and decision-making to mitigate the negative impact of the developed areas on the forests. The development of the concept of supporting green infrastructure in urban forest buffer zones, regardless of land use type was also part of the study. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - A GIS site-selection process for habitat creation: Estimating connectivity of habitat patches
PY  - 2004
AB  - The paper presents a method that addresses the problem of site-selection for habitat creation involving spatial processes on the landscape scale. It interprets landscape ecological principles, with focus on population dynamics, to specific information required to support a particular decision at each stage of the process. The approach focuses on deciduous woodland with the redstart Phoenicurous phoenicurous as an umbrella species for woodland birds and is illustrated within the fragmented landscape of the east midlands area of England. The method requires the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to estimate the connectivity of habitat patches. Each patch is assigned a \"cost\" value that represents the cost of dispersal over a friction surface. The sites are ranked accordingly and, in combination with the spatial context and size, are prioritised in terms of their potential for forming cores for habitat creation. Habitat patches with low cost values, a large area of surrounding habitat and small size were identified as potential sites for expansion in order to satisfy the minimum requirements of the species. The approach is generic, applicable to any species, and despite its limitations it can be a useful aid in conservation planning. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identifying multiscale habitat factors influencing koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) occurrence and management in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia
PY  - 2008
AB  - Modelling for the conservation of koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) populations has primarily focused on natural habitat variables (e.g. tree species, soil types and soil moisture). Until recently, limited consideration has been given to modelling the effects of the landscape context (e.g. habitat area, habitat configuration and roads). Yet, the combined influence of natural habitats and anthropogenic impacts at multiple spatial scales are likely to be important determinants of where koala populations occur and remain viable in human-modified landscapes. The study tested the importance of multiscale habitat variables on koala occurrence in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. The models focused at three spatial scales: site (< 1 ha), patch (1-100 ha), and landscape (100-1000 s ha). Logistic regression and hierarchical partitioning analyses were used to rank alternative models and key explanatory variables. The results showed that an increased likelihood of koala presence in fragmented landscapes in the urban-forest interface (as opposed to larger blocks of forest habitat) can best be explained by the positive effects of soil fertility and the presence of preferred koala tree species in these fragmented areas. If koalas are to be effectively conserved in Ballarat, it is critical to (i) protect remaining core areas of high-quality habitat, including regenerating areas; (ii) protect scattered habitat patches which provide connectivity; and (iii) develop and implement habitat restoration programmes to improve habitat connectivity and enhance opportunities for safe koala movement between habitat patches intersected by main roads. © 2008 Ecological Society of Australia.

TI  - Whence the next pandemic? The intersecting global geography of the animal-human interface, poor health systems and air transit centrality reveals conduits for high-impact spillover
PY  - 2020
AB  - The health and economic impacts of infectious disease pandemics are catastrophic as most recently manifested by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emerging infections that lead to substantive epidemics or pandemics are typically zoonoses that cross species boundaries at vulnerable points of animal-human interface. The sharing of space between wildlife and humans, and their domesticated animals, has dramatically increased in recent decades and is a key driver of pathogen spillover. Increasing animal-human interface has also occurred in concert with both increasing globalisation and failing health systems, resulting in a trifecta with dire implications for human and animal health. Nevertheless, to date we lack a geographical description of this trifecta that can be applied strategically to pandemic prevention. This investigation provides the first geographical quantification of the intersection of animal-human interfaces, poor human health system performance and global connectivity via the network of air travel. In so doing, this work provides a systematic, data-driven approach to classifying spillover hazard based on the distribution of animal-human interfaces while simultaneously identifying globally connected cities that are adjacent to these interfaces and which may facilitate global pathogen dissemination. We present this geography of high-impact spillover as a tool for developing targeted surveillance systems and improved health infrastructure in vulnerable areas that may present conduits for future pandemics. © 2020 The Authors

TI  - Integration of landscape fragmentation analysis into regional planning: A statewide multi-scale case study from California, USA
PY  - 2008
AB  - Landscape fragmentation due to urban development, transportation infrastructure, and agriculture poses a threat to environmental integrity. There is a need to quantify the level of landscape fragmentation in an ecologically meaningful way for inclusion in planning and decision-making. Effective mesh size (meff) is an ecologically relevant metric that quantifies landscape fragmentation based on the probability that two randomly chosen points in a region are located in the same non-fragmented patch. We investigated variation in meff measured by transportation districts, municipal counties, and six spatial levels of watersheds within the state of California. Four fragmentation geometries were developed by overlaying highways, roads, urbanized areas, agricultural areas, and natural fragmenting features. Two meff calculation methods were compared: one where planning unit boundaries fragment the landscape (CUT), the other allowing for cross-boundary connections (CBC). The CUT procedure always produced lower meff values than CBC, with greater differences occurring in smaller planning units, confirming the bias introduced using boundaries with landscape metrics. Calculated meff values varied from 0 to 20 885 km2 across 6994 units in California. Roads contributed the most to fragmentation, while agriculture contributed little, as California's agricultural areas are already heavily fragmented by roads. This paper provides a systematic, quantitative, and intuitive method for transportation, land use and environmental planners to analyze cumulative impacts of multiple fragmenting features across a range of spatial scales within a variety of planning units. This approach could be used for analyzing the impact of future land development scenarios, and integrated into regional planning processes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Influence of photovoltaic power station engineering on soil and vegetation: Taking the gobi desert area in the hexi corridor of gansu as an example
PY  - 2019
AB  - [ Background ] During the construction of photovoltaic electric field, the excavation, dumping and rolling of the original surface inevitably destroy the soil and vegetation of the construction area. Through the study on the disturbance of soil environment and vegetation caused by the construction of photovoltaic power station, this paper tried to provide technical support for the ecological protection during the construction of photovoltaic power plant in the Gobi Desert Area in the Hexi corridor of Gansu. [ Methods] The study took 6 typical photovoltaic power stations in Wuwei, Zhangye and Jiayuguan cities from east to west in the Gobi Desert Area in the Hexi corridor in Gansu as the research object. The disturbances of photovoltaic power station construction on soil environment and vegetation were studied by using the methods of field observation, inspection, and soil and water conservation monitoring data. [Results] 1 ) There was little difference in soil pH value, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, organic matter and available phosphorus in the disturbed area between photovoltaic panels and the undisturbed area outside the photovoltaic power station, and the disturbance to the influence of soil nutrient was not obvious. 2) During the construction of photovoltaic electric field, the original vegetation and the surface crust were destroyed greatly, and the surface crust was damaged, which aggravated soil erosion and dust, and even caused dust storms. The destruction of vegetation reduced the coverage of vegetation and caused the deterioration of ecological environment and the decrease of plant population diversity. 3) During the operation period, the photovoltaic panel collected rainwater and the abandoned water for cleaning the photovoltaic panel, which increased the soil moisture content of the disturbed land between the photovoltaic panels and was conducive to vegetation restoration. [ Conclusions ] It is suggested that photovoltaic power station construction should give priority to photovoltaic modules with high photoelectric conversion efficiency, and spiral steel pipe pile foundation should be selected as the support foundation under geological conditions to reduce the disturbance range and intensity to the surface. The consciousness of environmental protection must be established in achieving the civilization construction. © 2019, Editorial Board of Science of Soil and Water Conservation. All rights reserved.

TI  - Greenways for recreation and maintenance of landscape quality: five case studies in Portugal
PY  - 2006
AB  - The use of the concept of greenway can be identified in Portugal throughout the 20th century as a planning and design tool. Several examples, such as the 'Improvement Plans for Lisbon' by Ressano Garcia (1901), the continuum naturale concept [Cabral, F.C., 1980. O Continuum Naturale e a Conservação da Natureza. Conservação da Natureza. Serviço de Estudos do Ambiente, Lisbon; Andresen, T., 2001. Francisco Caldeira Cabral. Landscape Design Trust, Surrey, UK, 213 pp.], the Green Plan for Lisbon [Telles, G.R., et al., 1997. Plano Verde de Lisboa. Ed. Colibri, Lisboa, 197 pp.], deal with the subjects of implementing vegetation corridors, pedestrian networks and landscape quality. These examples establish Portuguese planning and design tradition within the international greenway movement first identified by Fabos [Fabos, J.Gy., 1991. From Park to Greenways into the 21st Century. In: Proceedings from Selected Educational Sessions, ASLA Annual Meeting, Kansas City, Missouri]. Though several projects have been developed at the planning level, there is a need to analyze the applicability of such a concept at the regional, municipal and local level. We must consider the characteristics of Portugal's cultural landscape, recognition by other professions dealing with planning and involvement by politicians. By analyzing five case studies, this paper shows the significance of the greenway as a planning and design strategy, which coincides, with the current objectives of political and planning authorities at the municipal level. It also proves that it is possible to reconcile political objectives and urban development while safeguarding landscape quality and providing new opportunities for public recreation and education. Greenway planning and design is now undoubtedly a subject of growing significance in Portugal. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Data Processing Pipeline for Cyber-Physical Risk Assessments of Municipal Supply Chains
PY  - 2021
AB  - Smart city technologies promise reduced congestion by optimizing transportation movements. Increased connectivity, however, may increase the attack surface of a municipality's critical functions. Increased supply chain attacks (up nearly 80 % in 2019) and municipal ransomware attacks (up 60 % in 2019) motivate the need for holistic approaches to risk assessment. Therefore, we present a methodology to quantify the degree to which supply-chain movements may be observed or disrupted via compromised smart-city devices. Our data-processing pipeline uses publicly available datasets to model intermodal commodity flows within and surrounding a municipality. Using a hierarchy tree to adaptively sample spatial networks within geographic regions of interest, we bridge the gap between grid-and network-based risk assessment frameworks. Results based on fieldwork for the Jack Voltaic exercises sponsored by the Army Cyber Institute demonstrate our approach on intermodal movements through Charleston, SC and San Diego, CA. © 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Seasonal shedding of coronavirus by strawcolored fruit bats at urban roosts in Africa
PY  - 2022
AB  - The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup \"weaning\" period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa. © 2022 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

TI  - Habitat rehabilitation for juvenile fish in urban waterways: A case study from Berlin, Germany
PY  - 2017
AB  - This study examines the improvement of juvenile fish recruitment by technical rehabilitation measures implemented in two urban waterways in Berlin, Germany: the River Spree and the Teltow Canal. Rehabilitation sites provide new littoral habitats protected from navigation-induced flow and wake wash and are intended to improve habitat quality for juvenile fish and to support urban fish diversity. Both sites and four control sites with common embankments have been sampled monthly by point electric fishing (875 dips in total) from May to September 2009. In total, 6,243 fish were caught representing 12 species. Two of the species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), dominated the fish community, comprising 81.5% and 16.1% of the total catch. Nine species were rare, with relative abundances <1%, which hampered more detailed species-specific analyses. Of the dips 33% contained no fish, causing zero-inflation of the dataset. A hurdle regression model confirmed positive effects of reduced hydraulic disturbances and resulting vegetation cover on juvenile fish occurrence. However, it also showed low oxygen concentrations limiting habitat quality, as observed at the older, densely vegetated rehabilitation site in the River Spree. The general improvement of the juvenile fish assemblage by the rehabilitation measure appeared rather low, as partially vegetated, rectangle trapeze and trapeze profile banks had even higher fish abundance. The study also revealed a need for adaptive maintenance to improve the long-term performance of this type of rehabilitation structure. With the recovery of aquatic vegetation, the technical bank protection should be adaptively removed to retain the connectivity with the main channel for a sufficient oxygen supply for the long-term functionality as a fish habitat. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

TI  - Habitat use by birds across a forest-suburb interface in Brisbane: implications for corridors
PY  - 1991
AB  - Birds were counted within a series of habitat \"treatments' across the interface between Toohey Forest (a 500 ha remnant of eucalypt forest/woodland within the city of Brisbane, Queensland) and surrounding suburbs. Most species were behavioural macrohabitat specialists, and suites of suburb, forest and edge species could be identified. There was little movement of either forest or suburb species across the interface. There was a strong edge effect, with a distinctive suite of large and aggressive species using the combination of resources that were available at the edge. Forest species were characteristically small, foliage-feeding insectivores, and there was no effect of distance from the forest on the density of these birds within suburban sites. There was no significant effect on forest species of varying the local vegetation characteristics within suburban sites, although there was some effect on suburb species. Day-to-day movements among small, isolated remnants are unlikely for most forest species; narrow connecting corridors are likely to be dominated by aggressive edge species; and this could inhibit movements within them by forest species. A loss of foliage-feeding avian insectivores could lead to further perturbations within corridor ecosystems; these should be avoided by conserving wide corridors with a well-developed understorey. -from Authors

TI  - Neighborhood effects on heat deaths: Social and environmental predictors of vulnerability in Maricopa county, Arizona
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: Most heat-related deaths occur in cities, and future trends in global climate change and urbanization may amplify this trend. Understanding how neighborhoods affect heat mortality fills an important gap between studies of individual susceptibility to heat and broadly comparative studies of temperature-mortality relationships in cities. Objectives: We estimated neighborhood effects of population characteristics and built and natural environments on deaths due to heat exposure in Maricopa County, Arizona (2000-2008). Methods: We used 2000 U.S. Census data and remotely sensed vegetation and land surface temperature to construct indicators of neighborhood vulnerability and a geographic information system to map vulnerability and residential addresses of persons who died from heat exposure in 2,081 census block groups. Binary logistic regression and spatial analysis were used to associate deaths with neighborhoods. results: Neighborhood scores on three factors-socioeconomic vulnerability, elderly/isolation, and unvegetated area-varied widely throughout the study area. Te preferred model (based on ft and parsimony) for predicting the odds of one or more deaths from heat exposure within a census block group included the first two factors and surface temperature in residential neighborhoods, holding population size constant. Spatial analysis identified clusters of neighborhoods with the highest heat vulnerability scores. A large proportion of deaths occurred among people, including homeless persons, who lived in the inner cores of the largest cities and along an industrial corridor. Conclusions: Place-based indicators of vulnerability complement analyses of person-level heat risk factors. Surface temperature might be used in Maricopa County to identify the most heat- vulnerable neighborhoods, but more attention to the socioecological complexities of climate adaptation is needed.

TI  - Identifying streetscape features using vhr imagery and deep learning applications
PY  - 2021
AB  - Deep Learning (DL) based identification and detection of elements in urban spaces through Earth Observation (EO) datasets have been widely researched and discussed. Such studies have developed state-of-the-art methods to map urban features like building footprint or roads in detail. This study delves deeper into combining multiple such studies to identify fine-grained urban features which define streetscapes. Specifically, the research focuses on employing object detection and semantic segmentation models and other computer vision methods to identify ten streetscape features such as movement corridors, roadways, sidewalks, bike paths, on-street parking, vehicles, trees, vegetation, road markings, and buildings. The training data for identifying and classifying all the elements except road markings are collected from open sources and finetuned to fit the study’s context. The training dataset is manually created and employed to delineate road markings. Apart from the model-specific evaluation on the test-set of the data, the study creates its own test dataset from the study area to analyze these models’ performance. The outputs from these models are further integrated to develop a geospatial dataset, which is additionally utilized to generate 3D views and street cross-sections for the city. The trained models and data sources are discussed in the research and are made available for urban researchers to exploit.

PY  - 2011
AB  - Based on SPOT5 remote sensing image in 2008, the landuse landscape map of Huicheng Destrict was made by manual and Object-oriented Classification interpretations with ENVI and ArcGIS software. Through the calculation of landscape metrics, the formation of landuse landscape pattern in Huicheng, which as a case of outer area of Pearl River Delta, was analyzed quantitatively. The results indicated that connectivity of the landuse landscape pattern was stronger; diversity and evenness indices both were higher.Due to the human impacts, however, the landscape shape was more complicated and the stability was not good enough; the fragmentation degree differed greatly in every landuse types. In order to improve stability and adaptability of the landscape and realize the sustainable use of land resources, some countermeasures were put forward as the following: constructing the landscape pattern of the sustainable agriculture, using the planning measures, adjusting the vegetation structure, taking advantage of the tourism resource, and so on. © 2011 IEEE.

TI  - How effective is river restoration in re-establishing groundwater-surface water interactions? - A case study
PY  - 2015
AB  - In this study, we investigated whether river restoration was successful in re-establishing groundwater-surface water interactions in a degraded urban stream. Restoration measures included morphological changes to the river bed, such as the installation of gravel islands and spur dykes, as well as the planting of site-specific riparian vegetation. Standard distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and novel active and passive DTS approaches were employed to study groundwater-surface water interactions in two reference streams and an experimental reach of an urban stream before and after its restoration. Radon-222 analyses were utilized to validate the losing stream conditions of the urban stream in the experimental reach. Our results indicated that river restoration at the study site was indeed successful in increasing groundwater-surface water interactions. Increased surface water downwelling occurred locally at the tip of a gravel island created during river restoration. Hence, the installation of in-stream structures increased the vertical connectivity and thus groundwater-surface water interactions. With the methods presented in this publication, it would be possible to routinely investigate the success of river restorations in re-establishing vertical connectivity, thereby gaining insight into the effectiveness of specific restoration measures. This, in turn, would enable the optimization of future river restoration projects, rendering them more cost-effective and successful. © Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Airborne pollen and fungi indoors: Evidence from primary schools in Lithuania
PY  - 2023
AB  - The number of children suffering from respiratory allergies and asthma has been increasing worldwide and, hence, it is crucial to understand the burden of inhalant biological particles present in school facilities, where children spend one third of their life. From the perspective of indoor air quality, while there are numerous studies on outdoor bioaerosol exposure, there are still uncertainties regarding the diversity and deposition of airborne pollen and fungi indoors. When it comes to schools, there is limited research as to the potential bioaerosol exposure. Here we studied the indoor environment of public schools aiming to reveal whether primary schools of different sizes and at localities of different levels of urbanization may exhibit a variability in the biodiversity and abundance of particles of biological origin, which could pose a risk to child health. To achieve this, 11 schools were selected, located in a variety of environments, from downtown, to city centre-periphery, and to the suburbs. Fungal and pollen samples were collected from various surfaces in school classrooms and corridors, using passive air sampling and swab sampling. We demonstrated that fungi and pollen are detected in school premises during and after the vegetation season. The highest diversity of bioaerosols was found on the top of cabinets and windowsills, with Penicillium, Cladosporium and Acremonium being the most abundant indoors. The levels of fungi were higher in schools with more students. The diversity and amount of pollen in the spring were significantly higher than in samples collected in autumn. Our findings complemented existing evidence that bioaerosol measurements in schools (including kindergartens or informal education facilities) are vital. Hence, we here suggest that, in addition to monitoring air quality and bacterial levels indoors, fungi and pollen measurements have to be integrated in the existing regular biomonitoring campaigns so as to prevent exposure, increase awareness and manage efficiently allergic symptomatology. © 2022

TI  - The effects of artificial lighting on adult aquatic and terrestrial insects
PY  - 2014
AB  - There is a growing concern that artificial light might affect local insect populations and disrupt their dispersal across the landscape. In this study, we investigated experimentally the effect of artificial light on flying insects in the field, with an emphasis on aquatic insects. We asked whether lights prevented the ability of insects to disperse across the landscape, a process that is crucial in colonising restored habitats. We set up six, c. 3.5 m high downward facing high-pressure sodium streetlights along a permanently connected oxbow in the Spree River of eastern Germany. We collected insects using 12 flight intercept traps, each with trays at three different heights (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 m), placed at distances 0, 3, 40 and 75 m from the lights and 5, 8 and 80 m from water. The number of emerging aquatic insects in the study area was measured with six emergence traps. We emptied the traps 22 times between June and September 2010; the lights were on for 11 of these nights and off for the other 11. In total, we caught almost 27 times as many insects at traps 0 m from the lights when the lights were on than when they were off. Most insects caught when the lights were on were aquatic, with Diptera being the most common order. Furthermore, the proportion of aquatic insects caught at traps 0, 3 and 40 m from the lights when they were on was significantly higher than when they were off. On lit nights, more aquatic insects were captured per hour and m2 (area in which flying insects were intercepted) at traps 0 m from the lights than emerged from per square metre per hour from the Spree River. Our results suggest that adult aquatic insects can be negatively affected by artificial light and that city planners should take this into account when designing lighting systems along rivers. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

TI  - Day-to-Day Population Movement and the Management of Dengue Epidemics
PY  - 2016
AB  - Dengue is a growing public health problem in tropical and subtropical cities. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People’s day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector–host ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector–host ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector–host ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector–host ratio and people’s day-to-day movement patterns.

TI  - Avian population dynamics and human induced change in an urban environment
PY  - 2010
AB  - The predominantly urban boroughs of Warrington and Halton straddle the river Mersey in northwest England. Since the 1970s there has been a major change in land-use associated with both innovative town design and the decline of manufacturing and chemical industries in the boroughs. Also, co-ordinated programmes have directly addressed air and water pollution. The breeding birds of the two boroughs were surveyed in 1978-84 and 2004-06 as part of the bird atlases of Cheshire and Wirral, based on tetrads (2 × 2 km squares). We divided the breeding species into eight guilds based on broad ecological characteristics of habitat or food, omitting the generalists and colonial species, and compared the change between our two atlases in the number of occupied tetrads in Halton and Warrington and in the rest of the county. Four of our eight guilds have fared significantly better within our study area: waterbirds (24 species), those feeding on invertebrates (16 species), woodland specialists (21 species) and the two species that decorate their nests with lichens. The remaining four guilds showed no difference between Halton and Warrington and the rest of Cheshire and Wirral: raptors (5 species) have increased throughout, while breeding waders (7 species), farmland seedeaters (7 species) and aerial insectivores (5 species) have declined throughout. We interpret these results in relation to improved quality of water and air and changing patterns of land-use in the urban greenspace, especially an increase in woodland cover and connectivity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Land type information extraction and landscape pattern dynamic analysis of Laoshan scenic area
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Laoshan scenic area is an ecological barrier and biodiversity conservation area in Nanjing City. The dominant ecosystem in Laoshan is forest, its ecological position is extremely important. This study aims to analyze the dynamic changes of the landscape pattern in the scenic area for the past 17 years. Local land use information based on Landsat images from 2001, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2017 was extracted, using the technical method of object-oriented fuzzy classification, C5.0 decision tree classification, pixel-based maximum likelihood, artificial neural network and support vector machine. In addition, Fragstats 4.2 software was used to extract multiple landscape pattern indexes, for the comparison of dynamic landscape pattern from 2001 to 2017. Results show that the object-oriented fuzzy classification method had the highest overall accuracy (91.79%) and Kappa coefficient was 0.83. With the continuous construction and reform, the degree of landscape fragmentation in Laoshan scenic area has deepened. From 2001 to 2017, the number of patches (NP) showed an increasing trend, and reached 653 in 2017, with the patch density of 5.928 1 blocks·km-2. In 2017, contagion index (CONTAG) increased compared with that of 2001, reaching 59.41%, and the connectivity of dominant patch types has improved. The Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) value fluctuated in a narrow range, reaching a maximum of 0.725 5 in 2009. With the development of construction to a mature state, the overall development process slowly enters into an orderly state, and scenic area in Laoshan has gradually developed towards harmony and stability. © 2020, China Environmental Science Press.

TI  - Patterns of an invasion by Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) in a riparian corridor and its effects on ant diversity
PY  - 1998
AB  - This study documents the distribution of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), a well known invader of urban and agricultural ecosystems, in a riparian corridor near San Luis Obispo, California. Sampling of the ant community was done using pitfall traps placed along transects that crossed three vegetation types found at the study site: (1) riparian woodland dominated by coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and willow (Salix spp.) (2) Hard chaparral dominated by Scrub oak (Q. dumosa) and silk-tassel bush (Garrya sp.) (3) Coastal scrub dominated by black sage (Salvia mellifera), California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), and Yucca (Yucca whipplei). Linepithema humile has become well established throughout the lower reaches of the study site except in the chaparral vegetation. Ten species of native ants were found in the study area, but there was little to no correlation or cooccurrence between L. humile and native ant species. Total species diversity in areas where L. humile occurred was significantly less than in areas where L. humile was absent. These results suggest that invasion by L. humile is restricted by habitat type, and has significant negative impacts on native ant diversity.

TI  - Designs for the radnić rental building in split by engineer ante radica
PY  - 2009
AB  - In 1918-1928, during Mayor Ivo Tartaglia's term of office, Split recovered from a state of general poverty and a lack of urban infrastructure and became a progressive city. An economic crisis resulting from the First World War was overcome by big investments into city infrastructure and by support given to private entrepreneurship. After the signing of the Rapall Agreement on 20 November 1920, the town of Zadar was separated from Dalmatia thus giving Split the new role of a regional centre within the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. A great number of refugees that moved to Split from Dalmatian parts under Italian occupation led to the increased demands for houses whose construction had in the previous years been hindered by the war. The essential measures for enticing housing projects according to the 1912 Building Conditions included tax reductions for amounts forming 20% of the income that construction companies generated from new buildings in the first six years of their business. The new \"role of the Dalmatian centre\" as well as \"enticed housing projects\" indicated the need for a planned urban development of Split. Everything constructed during the Austro-Hungarian government was to be re-examined, which also included the Split Regulation plan made by Petar Senjanović in 1914. An international urban design competition was held in June 1923. The jury proclaimed Werner Schurmann from The Hague the winner (although his submission won the second prize which it shared with another entry; the first prize was not awarded). After the competition, in September 1924, Schurmann started developing a new Split Regulation plan which started to be implemented in 1925. The basic characteristic of Schurmann's plan was the separation of the city's historic core from the newly planned city centres in east and north with a green semicircular avenue starting at the far end of Bačvice Bay and ending at the foot of Marjan hill. The plan envisaged a big square in the geometric centre of the peninsula, on the axis that connected the existing City Port and the planned North Port, as well as a new urban landmark on Turska kula mound. The space around the new city square and along the perimeter of the streets and a tree-lined road facing it was planned to contain either multistorey public or residential rentals. However, the plan could have been implemented only with prior parcelling of the construction site that would enable the construction of regular city blocks and streets. That again brought private entrepreneurs to the public attention. Somewhat earlier, in 1921, a long single-storey house was built in the city's quarter Dobri, along the Street of Ss Cyril and Methodius which was envisaged by Schurmann's plan to form the connection between the historic core of Split and the newly built city square. The house was characterized with distinct historicist elements containing details rendered in the style of Vienna Secession. Art historians were for years proclaiming the house the architectural heritage which had been built for commercial purposes. However, recently found unexecuted ground-floor plans and drawings of the west façade reveal the name of the architect and civil engineers who built it demonstrating that the house did not have a commercial purpose. The built single-storey house was planned as a four-storey residential rental building designed by engineer Ante Radica. Its construction was to be entrusted to master mason Josip Leta. The found plans indicate a new perception of urbanity that entrepreneur Mate Radnić, Radica and Lete had, as well as their ambitions in the domain of city planning. Although congruent with Senjanović's plan from 1914, the multi-storey building had been planned for construction five years before Schurmann's plan became valid, on a parcel surrounded with peasants' stone houses and family villas, in the part of the city considered suburban. It was exactly an untimely building request, as well as the decision by the local government to build several residential rentals in the quarter of Manuš (the 1921 competition was won by architect Danilo Žagar) that caused the alteration in the construction of the Radnić house. Even though the plans were evidently signed by engineer Radica and mason Lete, the features of the urban and architectural designs for the Radnić house indicate a strong presence of engineer Petar Senjanović. Engineer Radica had in 1918 completed tine north wing of the Cooperative Alliance building in Bihaćka Street following the design by engineer Senjanović which explains a number of Senjanović-like details in the plans and on the façade of the Radnić house. According to the drawings the plan of the Radnić house was to be rectangular but insignificantly leaning to the form of a trapezoid with a blind wall of the south façade. The ground floor was to have two commercial spaces symmetrically placed around the axis of the main entrance and the porter's apartment facing the inner courtyard. The first and second floors were to have two three-room apartments on either side of a central stairwell containing one flight of circular stairs that gave access to both apartments. The apartments were planned to contain two rows of rooms on either side of the centrally positioned corridor: two interconnected bigger rooms and a dinning room facing the main west fa-fade; kitchen, pantry, a smaller room, maid's room, toilette and bathroom facing the inner courtyard. The analysis of the façade articulation indicates engineer Radica's skilful use of mixed styles in the process of construction. The treatment of bay windows and arched parapets, loggias, as well as recesses in the wall of the mansard roof above the columnar loggia covered with a three-sided hipped roof gives the façade a sculptural effect suggestive of the Vienna Secession. The same style is also suggested by the central windows cut into the wall surface of the west façade, underlined by stone window sills rectangular in section, as well as by the vertical segmentation of bay windows and loggias along with the repetitive pattern of triple lancet windows. Historicist styles are evident in the use of traditional building methods which employs stone for the construction of the ground floor, in two neo-Renais-sance cornices rectangular in section that divide the façade in three sections (the base, the body of the building and the cornice), as well as in the mansard loggia with Doric columns. Even though it has never been built, it is necessary to include these designs for the Randić rental residential building into the catalogue of Split buildings between the two wars. The discovery of the Randić house plans adds another important work to the oeuvre of engineer Radica making it, thus, more complete.

TI  - Twenty years of land cover change in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon: implications for biodiversity conservation
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Amazonian ecosystems of Madre de Dios (MDD) region, considered Peru’s “capital of biodiversity” due to its impressive species richness, are threatened by the rapid expansion of infrastructure. The paving of the Interoceanic Highway in 2010 has brought rapid population growth and environmental degradation, threatening large-scale conservation efforts such as the Vilcabamba-Amboro Conservation Corridor (VACC). To quantify the impacts of development processes and to identify critical areas where further conservation efforts should be focused, we analyzed 20 years of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics, drivers, and fragmentation patterns in MDD. We mapped LULC in 1993, 2003, and 2013 using Landsat imagery and modeled the proximate drivers of change related to deforestation, forest regrowth, gold mining, agriculture, and urban expansion in two time periods (1993–2003 and 2003–2013). We characterized habitat fragmentation patterns in four regional target areas. Our results show accelerated deforestation triggered by the road network spreading, mining and agriculture expansion, and population growth. LULC changes produced two contrasting spatial landscape patterns: numerous small forest fragments in the north due to agricultural expansion along the Interoceanic Highway and large continuous forest losses caused by gold mining expansion in the south. Current unplanned development in this region is threatening its outstanding biodiversity. We suggest that further conservation efforts should focus on strengthening the legal framework of the VACC, implementing a sustainable management plan for MDD, promoting agroforestry strategies along the Interoceanic Highway, and preserving smaller corridors for animal movement.

TI  - Mammalian nest predators respond to greenway width, landscape context and habitat structure
PY  - 2005
AB  - Birds of conservation concern breed in suburban greenways, yet abundant populations of mammals that depredate bird nests might reduce nest success. We evaluated how three factors influenced the abundance of mammalian nest predators in thirty-four 300-m long forested greenway segments in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA: (1) the width of the forested corridor containing the greenway, (2) the land-use adjacent to the forested corridor, and (3) the habitat structure within the greenway. Forest corridor width and adjacent land-use were measured using aerial photographs. Attributes of adjacent land use included categorical measures of development intensity (low-density residential, high-density residential, office/institutional), and the proportions of forest canopy, grass, buildings, and pavement. Several measures of habitat structure within the greenway were collected in the field, including trail width and surface type, and percentage of mature forest. We measured the relative abundance of mammalian nest predators with scent-station transects, operated for five nights during the 2002 breeding bird season. Total abundance of mammalian nest predators increased significantly as forest corridor width decreased. We found no relationship between categorical measures of land-use and total abundance of mammalian nest predators. Specific attributes of the landscape adjacent to the greenway, however, did have an effect. Greenways adjacent to landscapes with fewer buildings had a higher abundance of mammalian nest predators. The abundance of individual species varied with the amount of canopy, lawn, and pavement in the adjacent landscape. Some measures of habitat structure of greenways also were correlated with the abundance of mammalian nest predators. Greenway segments with wider trails had a higher abundance of mammalian nest predators, as did segments with a higher percentage of mature forest. No habitat structure variables were significant for all species. To reduce the overall risk of avian nest predation by mammals, forested greenways should be designed with wider forest corridors and narrower, unpaved trails. Some greenway characteristics that favor high-nest predator populations also favor birds of conservation concern. Similarly, some characteristics correlated with lower predator occurrence are also correlated with lower abundance of birds of conservation concern. Thus, management of greenways and the surrounding landscape must balance reduction of predator communities with the promotion of desired bird communities and other conservation goals. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Climate matching and anthropogenic factors contribute to the colonization and extinction of local populations during avian invasions
PY  - 2022
AB  - Aim: Concern about the impacts of biological invasions has generated a great deal of interest in understanding factors that determine invasion success. Most of our current knowledge comes from static approaches that use spatial patterns as a proxy of temporal processes. These approaches assume that species are present in areas where environmental conditions are the most favourable. However, this assumption is problematic when applied to dynamic processes such as species expansions when equilibrium has not been reached. Location: Iberian Peninsula. Taxon: Birds. Methods: In our work, we analyse the roles played by human activities, climatic matching and spatial connectivity on the two main underlying processes shaping the spread of invasive species (i.e. colonization and extinction) using a dynamic modelling approach. We use a large data set that has recorded the occurrence of two invasive bird species—the ring-necked (Psittacula krameri) and the monk (Myiopsitta monachus) parakeets—in the Iberian Peninsula from 1991 to 2016. Results: Human activities and climate matching play a role on species range dynamics. Human influence and urbanization were the most relevant factors explaining colonization. Additionally, an effect of climate matching was found. Persistence (the inverse of extinction) was mainly affected by human influence for the monk parakeet and by the extent of urban environments for the ring-necked parakeet. Main conclusions: Human activities play a major role not only on colonization of new locations, but also on persistence during range expansion. Additionally, natural processes—notably climate matching—also affect new colonizations. These findings add to our understanding of the mechanisms that might allow alien species to expand their geographic range at new locations and might help to improve our capacity to assess invasion risks and impacts accurately. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Infrastructure and Nature: Reciprocal Effects and Patterns for Our Future
PY  - 2013
AB  - My objective in this chapter is to explore these reciprocal effects, highlighting the resulting spatial patterns, and pinpointing key principles to use for a better future on the land. Roadways, railways, pipelines, powerlines and other corridors underpin today's society. Fortunately, a rather robust literature has rapidly emerged in a mere 25 years to elucidate this huge topic (Figure 3.1).1 \"Landscape ecology\" analyzes spatial patterns, functional flows and movements, and change over time for large land areas, such as seen from an airplane window or in a broad satellite image. \"Road ecology\" studies and catalyzes solutions for the interactions among vehicles, roads, plants, animals, earth, water, and air across the land. \"Urban region ecology\" analyzes the interactions among plants/animals and the physical environment for the city within its interdependent surrounding ring-around-the-city. Throughout this analysis key principles emerge for planning and policy. © 2012 Taylor and Francis.

TI  - Spatial pattern analysis for monitoring protected areas
PY  - 2009
AB  - The management of diverse biota within protected areas is affected by both land cover change within a protected area and habitat loss and fragmentation in the surrounding landscape. Satellite images provide a synoptic view of land cover patterns, but the use of such imagery requires careful consideration of sensor type, resolution, extent, and the metrics used to quantify ecologically significant change. We examined these factors for landscape monitoring applications in four small National Parks near Washington, DC: Antietam National Battlefield, Catoctin Mountain Park, Prince William Forest Park and Rock Creek Park. Using 4 m Ikonos, 10 m SPOT, 15 m pan-sharpened Landsat ETM+ and 30 m Landsat ETM+ imagery, the parks and surrounding areas were mapped to National Land Cover system classes. For each park, we examined four methods for defining map extent, including park administrative boundaries, two variable buffer widths, and watershed boundaries, and then analyzed patterns of forest habitat for the maps using a graph theoretic approach (critical dispersal threshold distance) and common landscape metrics (number of patches, percent forest, forest edge density, and forest area-weighted mean patch size). As expected, landscape metrics for maps derived at differing resolutions varied significantly, but map extent often yielded even larger differences. We found that for most applications, coarser scale data (e.g., 30 m Landsat) are adequate for characterizing landscape pattern, although ultimately data from multiple sensors may be appropriate or necessary based on different objectives of landscape monitoring (e.g., mapping single trees vs. forest stands) and the scale at which a resource of interest interacts with the larger landscape (e.g., birds vs. herptiles). Our results provide a strong caution regarding the practical issues associated with combining data sources from multiple satellite sensors for monitoring applications. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - How multi-lane, one-way street design shapes neighbourhood life: collisions, crime and community
PY  - 2017
AB  - ABSTRACTGlobal recognition of the need for more liveable and “complete” streets has allowed for increased funding to bicycle and pedestrian projects. That said, many streets in urban neighbourhoods remain unsafe. This study hypothesises that some of these issues related to safety issues are tied to multi-lane, one-way streets, which exist primarily in urban business districts and historic neighbourhoods, often occupied by poor and minority residents. There has been little research in this area to test how one-way street configurations relate to collisions, crime and community. To examine this, we use three principal strategies: (1) a cross-sectional citywide evaluation using descriptive and inferential statistics on all collisions occurring within a five-year period in a mid-sized city; (2) a focused assessment of traffic collision data, crime data, counts of trees, housing valuation data, foreclosure and vacant and abandoned structures on a 13-block street segment with both one- and two-way streets and (...

TI  - Effects of different restoration measures on the wintering waterfowl diversity in southern Dianchi Wetland
PY  - 2021
AB  - Restoring the ecological functions of damaged wetlands is an important part of the construction of the National Wetland Park, and restoration measures will have an important impact on the restoration effect. Dianchi Lake is an important wintering area for migratory birds in China. Due to long-term reclamation and urban expansion, the lakeside area has been severely damaged. In recent years, construction of wetland parks has brought opportunities for the restoration of Dianchi Lakeside, but the effects of various restoration measures still need to be clarified. In the winter of 2017, Kunming Southern Dianchi Lake National Wetland Park and adjacent wetlands were used as the study area, and four control sample areas were set up: constructed wetlands, enhanced wetlands, natural restored wetlands, and natural lake wetlands. Based on winter waterfowl diversity, the effect of wetland restoration was evaluated from the perspective of landscape ecology. The results showed that the natural lake wetlands had the highest species richness, followed by natural restored wetlands, enhanced wetlands, and constructed wetlands. Based on the Simpson diversity index, the waterfowl diversity of naturally restored wetlands was the highest (0.60±0.03), followed by natural lake wetlands (0.46±0.04) and enhanced wetlands (0.34±0.04), while the waterfowl diversity of constructed wetlands was the lowest (0 . 1 7 ± 0 . 0 3), which showed that the effect of natural restoration was better than enhancement and reconstruction. From the perspective of landscape pattern analysis, waterfowl diversity was negative correlated with road area (r = - 0 . 7 3 5, P < 0 . 0 1), landscape shape index (r — - 0 . 4 6 1, P < 0 . 0 1) and landscape splitting index (r — - 0 . 6 6 1, P < 0 . 0 1) . It also indicated that the degree of human disturbance, the shape of the landscape and the degree of fragmentation all had important impacts on waterfowl diversity. It is recommended that in the planning and construction of the National Wetland P a r k, the division of non-wetland landscapes, especially roads, on the overall wetland landscape should be reduced, and the connectivity and integrity of wetland patches should be improved to meet the spatial needs of waterfowl. Lake-type wetland parks should strengthen the creation of marsh in the lakeside area to meet the needs of waders, thereby increasing local bird diversity. © 2021 Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of bio-dlesel on the transport sector of Kolkata
PY  - 2009
AB  - The ground traffic system of Kolkata mega city which is extremely congested leading to excess emission is a concern to the city environmentalists. Unless the emission is controlled by a right technology, accumulation of green house gases in the atmosphere leading to rise in temperature of the earth's surface would invite climate change followed by respiratory and water-borne diseases. Moreover, it would have a disastrous effect on human beings, plants and animals affecting the bio-diversity of the region. As a primary safeguard against excess emission the replacement of fossil fuels by any other alternative fuel of low emission level cannot be ignored. Bio-diesel which is a blending ofJatropha oil to the fossil fuel in the right proportion can be considered as one of the alternative fuels of high oxygen content and so low emission level. Jatropha plantation in the waste land is doubly advantageous because of its conversion of the arid land into fertile character and extraction of oil. As secondary safeguard against surface traffic emission it is necessary to advocate for the underground and the elevated corridors for road and rail. Mass transportation vehicles of luxury model can also be introduced on the ground at premium for high income group and car owners.

TI  - Contemporary genetic structure reflects historical drainage isolation in an Australian snapping turtle, Elseya albagula
PY  - 2013
AB  - Effective spatial classification of freshwater biodiversity remains a worldwide conservation challenge. The isolating nature of catchment boundaries over evolutionary timescales makes them potentially important in defining natural units for biodiversity management. We sought to clarify biogeographical relationships amongst drainages within Australia's biodiverse mid-eastern coastal region (Fitzroy, Burnett, and Mary Catchments) where freshwater communities face considerable urban pressure, using a locally endemic riverine specialist, the white-throated snapping turtle, Elseya albagula. Mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite data sets were employed to investigate past and present influences on population connectivity and to identify units for management. Populations within catchments were largely well connected genetically. However, the Fitzroy Catchment contained a distinct genetic lineage, deeply divergent from a second lineage present across the Burnett and Mary Catchments. The two lineages can be considered evolutionarily significant units that reflect historical isolation of the Fitzroy and recent coalescence of the Burnett-Mary Catchments during lowered Pleistocene sea levels. Congruence with geological evidence and patterns reported for fish and macroinvertebrates supports a shared biogeographical history of a diverse regional biota. This work highlights the need for better spatial classification of freshwater biodiversity at local as well as regional scales, including recognition of potentially cryptic diversity amongst individual river drainages. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

TI  - Optimal design of a sewer line using Linear Programming
PY  - 2013
AB  - Wastewater collection systems greatly contribute to the cost of the overall municipal sewerage system; a cost-effective design of the collection system will provide significant savings towards the cost of wastewater services. It is impossible to evaluate the full impact that each pipe size and slope would have on the overall cost of the collection system with intuitive designs. However, these solutions generally satisfy the design objectives within the given constraints. A survey of the literature indicates that various optimisation techniques are being applied for least-cost solutions. In general these approaches provide continuous pipe sizes, which are converted to closest commercial sizes for adoption, which would heavily dilute the optimal outcome. Search methods are also adopted to obtain cost-effective design solutions using directly commercial pipe sizes, which are computationally expensive. In the design of a sewerage system, a sewer line is a basic unit occurring repeatedly in the design-process and finally the combinations of these basic units formulate the complete sewer system. However, the branch sewer lines, main sewers, trunk sewers, pumping stations, treatment plant and outfall sewers are in general the main components of an urban wastewater collection, treatment and disposal systems. A method has been developed to optimise this basic unit using Linear Programming technique without transforming nonlinear objective function or constraint equations into linear functions and incorporating commercially available pipe sizes directly in the problem formulation. The current research area of optimal sewer system design is focusing equally on economic considerations and hydraulic feasibility and moving away from conventional design guidelines based on only self cleaning velocity concepts for node to node sewer link hydraulic design. This paper is a step forward in developing optimal design approaches of sewer systems. © 2012.

TI  - The landscape approach: Designing new reserves for protection of biological and cultural diversity in Latin America
PY  - 2008
AB  - One of the greatest challenges for Latin America and the Caribbean, the most biologically and culturally diverse region in the world, is to halt the loss of species caused by habitat destruction and land degradation. Up to now, setting aside protected natural areas is considered the most effective alternative to conserve biodiversity. Protected areas, however, are under increasing assault by agricultural, silvicultural, and industrial development that surround and isolate them, reducing their habitat quality at the landscape scale. Among the different types of protected areas that have been proposed, biosphere reserves stand out for their attempt to compatibilize social development and conservation. Their management is the most amenable to integration of natural and human disturbance, inclusion of traditional management techniques, and participation by social and economic sectors in the administration. Biosphere reserves have proliferated all over the world, and today there are 531 of them located in 105 countries, where they protect vast ecological and cultural diversity. Even though the design of biosphere reserves is based on the landscape concept, it has yet to take into account ecosystem scales, possible long-term effects of disturbances, and better integrate and give higher consideration to the knowledge and experience of numerous ethnic groups that live within them. However, doing so requires a transformation of the function of the core, buffer, and transition areas. The current design of biosphere reserves is centripetal because the main function of the buffer zone is to protect biodiversity in the core. We propose a centrifugal model, where biodiversity of the core spreads freely toward the area of greater human influence with the buffer zone functioning as a connector. This connectivity can promote land-use practices that are in alignment with both ecosystems functioning and biodiversity conservation in natural, semi-natural, urban and industrial landscapes.

TI  - Analysis and conceptual geospatial modelling of the intermediary role of wetlands in drylands in post-fire material flux dynamics, Silvermine River catchment, Cape Town
PY  - 2022
AB  - Although it is generally accepted that wetlands in drylands are subject to higher fire frequencies than wetlands in humid regions, little is known about how wetlands in varied hydrogeomorphic settings mediate runoff and material fluxes in the post-fire catchment landscape. This paper evaluates the intermediary role of wetlands in water and sediment dispersal through a wet season that followed the March 2015 wildfire in the Silvermine River catchment, Cape Town. Field and laboratory analyses of the development and dynamics of soil water repellency were conducted across terrestrial hillslope, river riparian zone and hillslope seepage wetland sites. The latter two sites had significantly lower soil water repellency than the terrestrial site immediately preceding the first large rainfall event, and soil moisture emerged as a significant predictor of soil water repellency, consistent with previous research. Remote sensing analysis of post-fire vegetation recovery revealed that the first emergence of new vegetation occurred within wetlands and other moisture-rich areas across the catchment, likely associated with intact rhizome networks of the predominant sprouting vegetation in these areas. This post-fire green flush could have served to enhance post-fire infiltration due to macropore flow along rhizome networks, and to reduce early wet season runoff and erosion due to the rapid establishment of rainfall-intercepting leaf and stem structures. Longitudinal investigations of post-fire river channel and bed sediment characteristics detected a transition in bed composition from gravel to sand through hillslope-channel coupling and channel bank erosion, and effective conveyance of sand through the catchment to a constructed wetland at the catchment outlet. Suspended sediment sampling upstream, within and downstream of this wetland suggested a relative sediment trap efficiency of ~ 87 to 99%, supporting previous observations of post construction aggradation at the head of the wetland, with serious implications for long term wetland maintenance and management. Insights from field and remote sensing studies were used to develop a conceptual geospatial model of the role of wetlands in varied hydrogeomorphic settings in post-fire catchment sediment (dis)connectivity. Hillslope seepage wetlands located across the burned region of the catchment were shown to play an important role in hillslope surface sediment trapping and erosion control, contrary to common assumptions, and sediment connectivity modelling is recommended as a tool for further research aimed at understanding the intermediary role of wetlands in drylands in material fluxes in post-fire landscapes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Free space optics - A new horizon of wireless communications for plant wide information network connectivity
PY  - 2006
AB  - Minutes after the Twin Towers at World Trade Center in New York City were crashed to ground zero by the unthinkable terrorist's attacks on September 11, 2001; telecommunications backbone at lower Manhattan had crippled and causing a complete loss of fixed line phone systems for offices, shops, homes, schools and hospitals etc. The cell phone systems were also paralyzed other than text messages and the limited portable communication equipment mobilized to restore the chaos of New Year City under an emergency operation. At the sight of eight buildings of Manhattan courthouse system of New York State, the attacks had severely damaged the court's communication equipment. In an attempt to urgently resume communication services between Manhattan buildings and facilities located throughout the state, telecoms experts turned to an emerging communication technology: Free-Space Optics or FSO which is a line-of-sight (LOS) high speed broad band technology uses Infrared LEDs or Laser diodes to enable an optical wireless communication of data, voice and video up to 10Gbps through the air without the need of laying cables and RF spectrum licenses. This technology was originally developed for US military three decades ago as one of the most secured communication but commercial viability in recent years has helped FSO to position as alternative for network connectivity by service providers. Typically, FSO link comprises two transceiver heads to be mounted on building rooftops or indoor behind glass windows between two buildings preferably less than 2 km apart. It interfaces with network bridges, switches, hubs and routers via media converters and supporting redundant or back up communication through fail over devices. To date, there has been no trace of FSO deployment in the industrial environment especially the process plants, so can FSO lives up to the expectation of industrial users in the harsh environment? The author hopes to render a new technological perspective to automation world by exploring FSO as an alternative or back up to the existing fibers for plant wide Ethernet connectivity. The paper will usher in an insight into FSO technology, examining its pros and cons and the proposed industrial applications. Copyright 2006 by ISA.

TI  - Effects, Monitoring and Management of Forest Roads Using Remote Sensing and GIS in Angolan Miombo Woodlands
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Angola’s forests are abundant and highly productive with enormous potential to support local needs and exportation. The forests are well distributed across the country, but the existing road network is generally poor and, in some cases, inappropriate. Based on our previous work examining deforestation patterns and the modeling of primary tree attributes of vegetation types, we proposed forest management zones (MZ) for future planning in Huambo province in Angola. Herein, that same framework is applied for the detection of the existing road network in Huambo and the proposal of alternative routes inside the MZ. We used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information systems (GIS) to optimize connectivity among the existing forest plantations and their distance to the closest major cities within the province. We developed road suitability maps based on AHP and GIS to ensure safer driving conditions and contribute to the forest planner’s access to the current plantations. According to the suitability map created, 59.51% of the total area is suitable for road development and is counted in classes 4 and 5 in automatic classification. Parameters such as geology, slope, distance from roads to the railway, soil types, elevation, flow accumulation, and aspect were used. We provide a completed assessment of the state of existing roads and evaluate the safety of the observed road sections based on the AHP method. The calculated weights of the factors were all consistent with the model used (consistency ratio was 0.09 &lt; 0.1). Finally, we proposed the best alternative routes to the existing cities, MZ in miombo woodlands, and forest plantations inside the province. Our findings indicated that flow accumulation, soil type, and geology were the most significant factors impacting road construction. Overall, our framework is an important starting point for further research activities towards developing a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for planning road networks in Angola.</jats:p>

TI  - Urban Stream Assessment Procedure: A Framework for Assessing Stream Health in the Urban Environment
PY  - 2020
AB  - Various multi-scale hierarchical river health approaches and assessments have been developed and implemented with a variety of scientiﬁc and management purposes. Although many existing biological and geomorphological assessments offer insights into stream function, none were developed for or exclusively capture the functions of streams in the urban environment. Quantitative aspects of existing screening tools are limited in urban streams due to the unique combination of hydrogeomorphic and anthropogenic factors in the urban environment. Analyzing the physical, biological, and social drivers within the concept of the urban stream syndrome coupled with recent advances in stream assessments connects the health of urban streams with past, present, and future impacts. The urban stream assessment procedure (USAP) provides an innovative framework and conceptual model to comprehensively assess stream functions in the urban environment and quantify their health at multiple scales. The specific aim is to identify the highest function and lowest maintenance \"version\"of an urban stream that is achievable given the context - varying hydrologic regimes, geomorphic conditions, ecological diversity, social contexts, and community goals. It is designed to classify urban stream reaches and corridors according to their hydrological, geomorphological, vegetation characteristics and to support identiﬁcation of reaches that might be candidates for rehabilitation. Employing a multi-scale framework yields greater success in assessing stream function, diagnosing watershed-wide drivers, and implementing strategies to enhance streams in the urban environment. Furthermore, the USAP framework can assist water resources managers in assessing and managing health specific to urban streams through applicable spatial and relevant parameters and metrics. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Landscape-mediated edge effect in temperate deciduous forest: implications for oak regeneration
PY  - 2019
AB  - Context: Although the edge effect is known to be an important factor influencing the recruitment of trees in temperate forests, little is known of its synergistic relationships with landscape and fragment attributes. Objectives: We investigated how the edge effect on regeneration of oaks (Quercus spp.) varies with respect to fragment geometry, connectivity and landscape composition. Methods: We recorded oak sapling density along edge-interior gradients in 29 forest fragments at the periphery of Mexico City and examined the data with Generalized Additive Models. Results: A nonlinear and landscape-mediated edge effect was supported by data, including the interactions of the edge distance with patch connectivity, shape and size. Saplings were more abundant at a distance of ca. 50 m from the edge of small, large and connected patches, but large patches also exhibited reduced recruitment towards the interior of the patch. Conversely, sapling density in simple-shaped or connected patches was lower at the edge, exhibiting linear and concave-down increase trends towards the interior of patches, respectively. Conclusions: Boundary conditions could be interacting with interior forest conditions, making regeneration more frequent at 50 m from the edge. Shady and cooler sites in large patches may be inhibiting oak regeneration. The activity of acorn-dispersing animals and oak predators may increase in unconnected patches, thus increasing the likelihood of edge effects. These results provide insights into the restoration of temperate forest patches in heterogeneous fragmented landscapes. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Land use surrounding wetlands influences urban populations of a freshwater turtle
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization is one of the most influential land use changes globally and continues to affect wetland ecosystems and their biota. Freshwater turtles, which rely on both terrestrial and aquatic habitats to complete their life cycles, are one of the most endangered vertebrate groups, with approximately 60% of species threatened. Although habitat alteration caused by urbanization is recognized as one of the main threats to freshwater turtles, there is a paucity of studies quantifying the effects of terrestrial habitat change on turtle populations.

The aim of this study was to determine how terrestrial land use change, associated with urbanization, influences the viability of freshwater turtle populations. Thirty‐three wetlands were sampled for the southwestern snake‐necked turtle (Chelodina colliei Gray, 1856) (Chelidae) between October 2016 and February 2017 within a region of continuing urban intensification. Land use and habitat types were classified at the aquatic–terrestrial interface and within a 300‐m band around each wetland. Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify the land use variables that best explained the relative abundance of C. colliei.

Turtle abundance and population structure varied widely among wetlands. The percentage of residential land use, and the presence and accessibility of fringing native vegetation, was positively associated with the relative abundance of C. colliei. The association with residential land use may be an artefact of historical land use, whereas the association with native vegetation is probably because adjacent vegetation provides connectivity with suitable nesting sites, and thus facilitates increased recruitment.

This study shows how the modification of terrestrial habitat around wetlands may directly influence the population viability of freshwater turtles. Protection and restoration of native vegetation fringing urban wetlands is crucial to support the viability of remnant freshwater turtle populations

TI  - Forest fragmentation and connectivity in Virginia between 2001 and 2011
PY  - 2018
AB  - With an annual population growth rate currently estimated at about 5 %, Virginia presents an ideal case study for anthropogenic environmental disturbances. Urbanization as a result of increasing human activities has led to fragmentation of many crucial habitats, especially forests. Analysis of the extent to which forest fragmentation and connectivity have occurred in Virginia and corresponding changes associated with these processes, is relevant for conserving forest habitats and the biodiversity that they support. This study applies FRAGSTATS, a software system developed to assess forest fragmentation and connectivity, in combination with ArcGIS, to identify changes in forest patch metrics for Virginia over a ten-year interval (2001, 2006 and 2011) using National Land Cover Datasets (NLCD) maps as data source. Results show that, over ten years, forest patches have significantly declined in size, while the number of forest patches and total length of edge areas have increased over time. Results of this study show that road density in Virginia has no significant effect on forest fragmentation between 2001 and 2011. Analysis using ArcGIS revealed that sizes of core forest areas in Virginia are declining, and that these reductions match local topographic slope. This is because the steepness of the slope of an area dictates the degree of human activities in that area. These results suggest that urban sprawl associated with areas with gentler slopes, may have significant, long-term consequences for natural forest ecosystems and ultimately, biodiversity conservation. © 2018 Sciendo.

TI  - Coastal transformation and marine habitat loss
PY  - 2015
AB  - Coastal areas are undergoing continuous transformation to sustain the increasing residential, commercial, and tourist activities. However, the proliferation of artificial infrastructures (i.e. marinas and breakwaters) may contribute to destroy and fragment marine natural habitats, to alter the connectivity among populations and, as a consequence, the natural seascape. In particular, the upper sub tidal rocky fringe, where the coastal transformations are more conspicuous, represents the natural habitat of dominant engineering algae, such as Cystoseira and Sargassum; some of them, because of their sensitivity to environmental variability, are considered biological elements of water quality. The recent attempt to measure historical changes in macro algal diversity in the Gulf of Naples has highlighted a dramatic decrease of Cystoseira species in the upper sub littoral zones and at the same time the lack of information on their up to date extension. To verify the influence of coastal development on the decline of Cystoseira species in the Gulf, the percentage of natural/artificial coastal length has been estimated with Google Earth orto-photos. The results testified a correspondence: the higher was the Cystoseira spp. loss, the greater was the development of artificial urban infrastructures. To follow the temporal dynamics of these shallow systems, a complete remonitoring of the fucoid distribution along the Neapolitan coast has been planned. Up to now, the occurrence of these species has been mapped and digitalized in a qGIS database (scale 1:2,500) for the shallowest fringe of the island of Ischia. An ongoing homogenization of diversity at a medium scale has been recorded: Cystoseira compressa (the less sensitive species) is the widespread species; fragmented stands of Cystoseira amentacea (the most sensitive) still exist. Their distribution is limited to natural habitats slope more gently while the highest diversity has been reached in rocky pools. Occasional settlements were recorded on artificial structures when natural marine habitat was preserved in the surrounding area and the distance among the algal patches could not be a limiting factor in the spreading of the species. These preliminary data seem to suggest that a stronger collaboration between engineers and ecologists could favour a better coastal management in order to mitigate the impacts of artificial infrastructures on natural marine ecosystems and avoid the loss of biodiversity.

TI  - Reduced bird occurrence in pine forest fragments associated with road proximity in a Mediterranean agricultural area
PY  - 2001
AB  - This study investigated the effect of road and highway proximity on the occurrence of bird species in isolated secondary pine forest fragments in an agricultural matrix. We assessed the effects of road proximity separately for three different groups of bird species in order to detect ecological responses related to species biology. Bird occurrence was mainly related to fragment size but also to vegetation structure and fragment connectivity. When corrected for patch characteristics, we found that fragments up to 2 km away from a main highway contained less forest species, both generalists and specialists than fragments more distantly located. This pattern was independent of the side of the highway analysed. Considering each bird species separately, we found consistent lower occurrence probabilities near the highway in 50% of forest species. This difference was not found for ubiquitous species that were to some extent positively influenced by proximity of other major roads. Our results suggest that highway proximity, but not that of other major roads, decrease occupancy probability of forest birds in isolated forest fragments, thus reducing probability of metapopulation persistence. Although low habitat quality as a result of noise disturbance is likely to account for some of the results, the long distance effect detected strongly suggests that other factors rather than direct traffic disturbance alone are involved in lower bird occurrences near the highway. Decreased connectivity among forest fragments associated to avoidance of areas near the highway is an alternative explanation to the results obtained. We suggest that these findings should be included in strategic environmental impact assessment studies conducted to determine the ecological impact of large transport infrastructures across highly fragmented landscapes. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Increased body size along urbanization gradients at both community and intraspecific level in macro-moths
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urbanization involves a cocktail of human-induced rapid environmental changes and is forecasted to gain further importance. Urban-heat-island effects result in increased metabolic costs expected to drive shifts towards smaller body sizes. However, urban environments are also characterized by strong habitat fragmentation, often selecting for dispersal phenotypes. Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-moths-an insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal links-at both the community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean body size because of stronger filtering against small species along urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local and landscape scales (50-3,200 m radius), depending on the species. Hence, measures-such as creating and improving urban green infrastructure-to mitigate the effects of urbanization on body size will have to be implemented at multiple spatial scales in order to be most effective.

TI  - IMPACT of COAL MINING, THERMAL PLANTS, ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES on WILDLIFE CORRIDORS for NATIONAL PARKS and WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES in the STATE of MADHYA PRADESH, INDIA
PY  - 2022
AB  - To the rampant rise in urban settlements and human population, the national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and national tiger reserves of middle and southern India have been intruded upon by human settlements regularly. These are adjoined by paths called as ?wildlife corridors' especially the tiger and elephant corridors which are used as a means for migration. Bandipur and Pench-Satpuda national parks have one such essential pocket of wildlife corridors the Bandipur corridor interconnects the population of 8000 plus elephants between Mysuru and Wayanad in southern India whereas the Pench-Satpuda corridor sustains 120 plus tigers between Pench-Satpuda Tiger Reserve in middle India. To assess this it's imperative to assess the pattern of wildlife movements, changes in the animal habitats in terms of habitat cluster zones, land-use changes, the onset of human settlements and anthropogenic activities are to be monitored. For this, land use land cover (LULC) changes for these corridors were analyzed across two decades using geospatial and remote sensing technique. The study finds a organized deprivation of dense forests and open forests respectively, thus indicating large-scale destruction. The study also found the net area changes of dense forests and open forests which were diverted for agriculture activities indicating extensive encroachment of forest land for human settlement. The classification was monitored for water bodies that have reduced, indicating shrinkage during the duration under research. The existence of substantial coal deposits in the wildlife corridor and operational coal mining in the proximity of the wildlife corridor is a matter of grave concern which has been highlighted in the research. We examine to identify long-Term sustenance and protection of such corridors for preserving the natural habitat. Thus, with such suitability in wildlife monitoring, we can mark an increasing need for adaptable, tenable, and secure wildlife management as illustrated under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 15 mentioned under United Nations). © Author(s) 2022.

TI  - Research article feather corticosterone does not correlate with environmental stressors or body condition in an endangered waterbird
PY  - 2020
AB  - Physiological metrics are becoming popular tools for assessing individual condition and population health to inform wildlife management and conservation decisions. Corticosterone assays can provide information on howanimals cope with individual and habitat-level stressors, and the recent development of feather assays is an exciting innovation that could yield important insights for conservation of wild birds.Due to the widespread enthusiasm for feather corticosterone as a potential bioindicator, studies are needed to assess the ability of this technique to detect meaningful differences in physiological stress across a variety of stressor types and intensities. We examined feather corticosterone from 144 individuals among the 13 known breeding populations of Hawaiian gallinule (Gallinula galeata sandvicensis), an endangered waterbird, on the island of O'ahu. These ecologically independent subpopulations are known to have low genetic connectivity and movement rates and differ largely across a number of important conditions, including level of predator management, human disturbance, proximity to urban development and conspecific population density. This system is well suited for assessing the performance of feather corticosterone as a bioindicator of different known habitat-level threats common to this and many other conservation-reliant species.We found no statistically significant relationship between feather corticosterone and level of predator control, level of humandisturbance, gallinule population density, percent urban cover or body condition across all sites despite the substantial difference in stressor magnitude in our dataset. We did find that gallinules in habitats with larger population densities were in worse body condition. These findings suggest that feather corticosterone is not a consistent indicator of anthropogenic impacts on populations. Furthermore, they suggest that feather corticosterone may be a poor bioindicator of known habitatlevel threats for Hawaiian gallinules and that it should be used with caution in other avian taxa of conservation concern. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

TI  - Watershed management and 'Ecotonal NeTworks'. A holistic approach to coastal management
PY  - 2013
AB  - For the first time in the history of our species, the opportunity of halting the expansion of our global population discloses future scenarios of stably coexisting urbanised and non-urbanised ecosystems. The need for the establishment of such scenarios is particularly urgent in tropical regions, whose higher biodiversity is being rapidly eroded by recent and explosive urbanisation and land conversion. It is here proposed that the sustainable management of networks of urbanised and non-urbanised systems, the latter ones being interconnected by transitional systems, or ecotones, is the key to manage increasingly fragmented and isolated natural systems. In a cybernetic perspective, a decrease in internal connectivity both modifies fluxes with the external environment and impairs negative feedbacks, thus decreasing ecosystems' resilience. In particular, conservation efforts focused on traditionally conceived ecosystems have shown to be inappropriate to efficiently manage and protect tropical coastal systems. All these 'systems', although being anthropomorphically perceived as separate, evolved as deeply interconnected networks. The increasing loss of biocomplexity and resilience faced by such networks, is the inevitable consequence of the loss of internal connectivity determined by the loss of ecotones, due to fragmentation, degradation, and anthropogenic impact acting on the periphery of isolated natural areas. In order to sustainably manage natural isolated systems surrounded by urban, agricultural or degraded systems, appropriate management of ecological inputs and outputs, and maintenance of internal connectivity should be urgently implemented. Ecosystem-based management offers a rational perspective: (i) maximising the diversity of the managed systems within the original landscape, and (ii) creating and managing a dynamic network of ecotonal connections maintaining fluxes of energy and matter between them (Ecotonal NeTworks, or ENTs). Being inherently more resilient, such managed networks of natural subsystems would provide more sustainable and richer economic and ecological services, allowing for a rational integration of the highly interconnected urban subsystems.

TI  - Corridor Analysis of a Raw Water Transmission Pipeline
PY  - 2017
AB  - The City of Enid (City) is located in Northwest Oklahoma and services a population of over 50,000 residents. The City of Enid water supply infrastructure relies completely on an existing groundwater supply. Like many municipalities, aging public works infrastructure and increasing customer demands require continuous infrastructure maintenance, improvement, and expansion. The City of Enid proactively initiated a surface water supply program to supplement the existing ground water supply in order to meet increasing demands and diversity its water portfolio. In 2015, the City of Enid authorized Garver, LLC and Freese and Nichols, Inc. to perform a raw water transmission study and hydraulic analysis to deliver raw water from Kaw Lake to Enid's proposed water treatment plant, approximately sixty-eight (68) miles away. This paper will focus on the major analysis methods and lessons learned during the corridor study of the raw water transmission pipeline. The study includes data gathering from several public and private agencies. Preliminary corridor alternatives were produced on the basis of minimizing known potential environmental and archeological impacts, potential impact to landowners, constructability concerns, topographic characteristics that negatively impact hydraulic profile, and maximizing permanent easement access. The preliminary corridors were broken up by length into geographical classifications that represent specific construction challenges. A corridor evaluation matrix was developed utilizing geographical, environmental, maintenance, and installation characteristics to classify sections of the corridor as a means of comparing the alternatives. Hydraulic models of the recommended corridor were developed based on Kaw Lake water level data, contour data obtained, and previously developed flow requirements. These models were used to determine pumping alternatives, and potential pipeline sizing. A pipeline optimization analysis was performed to compare the capital cost of various pipeline sizes to the annual pumping (power) costs over a twenty-five (25) year span. Cost estimating was included in the study based on corridor characteristics linked with data obtained on recent market trends. © 2017 ASCE.

TI  - Genetic connectivity of the grey partridge in central northern France in a highly man dominated landscape
PY  - 2014
AB  - The loss and fragmentation of the landscape are the main causes of the decline and the extinction of many wildlife species. In this study we test the impact of landscape features on the genetic connectivity of a sedentary bird. Populations of our case study, the grey partridge (Perdix perdix armoricana), occur in central northern France. This is considered as the last bastion of high grey partridge densities in Europe and thus represents a relevant zone for the conservation of P. p. armoricana. Despite a highly man dominated landscape, results from the analysis of 12 microsatellite genotypes suggest the beginning of a genetic structure. This emerging genetic structure can result from the last historical event having occurred in the study area: a massive urbanization since the nineteenth century following the increase of the human density and town surface. Another hypothesis suggests that the weak genetic structure can result from a massive restocking with captive-bred individuals at a more or less recent point in time. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Conifer plantations consistently act as barriers to movement in a deciduous forest songbird: A translocation experiment
PY  - 2012
AB  - Many authors have concluded that habitat loss has a greater influence on biodiversity than habitat fragmentation . per se. Yet, several animal species have been shown to be reluctant to move across inhospitable landscape matrices, a phenomenon that would be expected to exacerbate fragmentation effects. In this study, we tested the ability of a forest songbird (Ovenbird, . Seiurus aurocapilla) to move across two contrasting landscapes whose matrix (intensively managed forest) would be expected to be relatively permeable compared to agricultural or urban matrices. We hypothesized that males would be less likely to return to their territory in a landscape dominated by forest generally unsuitable for breeding (spruce plantations) than in another dominated by potential breeding habitat (deciduous forest). The probability of resighting translocated males (. n=. 48) on their territory was significantly lower in the plantation landscape and this relationship was consistent over two successive years. Neither translocation time nor body mass, time of capture, or structural size were significant predictors of probability of resighting. Although this species is sufficiently vagile to return quickly to its territory (e.g. one male returning in less than 2. h), these results indicate that even a forested matrix may impose a resistance to the movements of a forest bird species when its structure or composition differs from that of breeding habitat. Matrix resistance to movements potentially restricts the ability of individuals to detect and colonize suitable habitat fragments. Less vagile species would be even more affected and, therefore, we submit that a more inclusive perspective on effects of landscape change is warranted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Natural plant establishment along an urban stream, Onondaga Creek, New York
PY  - 2014
AB  - Urbanization results in a suite of harmful effects to streams, including removal or degradation of riparian vegetation. Many stream-restoration programs address this by adding plants, with limited quantitative knowledge about vegetation dynamics already occurring within the stream corridor. This project examined natural plant establishment along an urbanized stream channel in Syracuse, NY. It had three objectives: first, to relate plant establishment along an urban stream gradient to substrate condition; second, to quantify seeds dormant in the soil at those same sites; and third, to indicate what passive revegetation responses might occur to various treatments along a rural-to-urban gradient. Three sites were selected along such a gradient on Onondaga Creek, near Syracuse, NY. Vegetation plots were established at each site to assess plant germination and establishment under substrate conditions designed to mimic restoration interventions. We also conducted a seedbank study using soil cores collected from these sites. Plant communities were dominated by grasses and forbs. Numbers of alien species increased from 34% at more rural sites to 51% at more urban sites. Seedlings of native riparian trees nonetheless germinated at all three sites along the gradient. Recruitment of native riparian trees (especially Populus deltoides [Eastern Cottonwood], Fraxinus pennsylvanica [Green Ash], and Acer negundo [Boxelder]) exceeded non-native and invasive ones. The riparian seedbank showed disproportionate dominance by herbaceous plants (95.5% of individuals) at all locations surveyed, and invasive species were common (about 25% of all germinants). This study shows some potential for natural regeneration of native trees, but also found a significant source of invasive plants in the soil seedbank that could reduce restoration success. Notably, the study recorded the presence of 16 bryophyte taxa, and the common ones were those typically associated with disturbances. © AlphaMed Press 2014.

TI  - Designing wetlands as an essential infrastructural element for urban development in the era of climate change
PY  - 2019
AB  - The increasing development of urban infrastructure has led to the significant loss of natural wetlands and their ecosystem services. Many novel urban development projects currently attempt to incorporate environmental sustainability, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and community engagement into the intricate challenges we all face in an era of climate change. This paper aims to communicate several key findings on design elements that can be adopted or incorporated in the design of created wetlands as infrastructural elements. Three major design elements-microtopography, hydrologic connectivity, and planting diversity-are presented, and their relations to restoring ecosystem services of urban wetlands, in particular water and habitat quality, are discussed. These design elements can be easily adopted or incorporated in the planning, designing, and construction stages of urban development. The success of urban infrastructure projects may require both better communication among stakeholders and a great deal of community engagement. The Rain Project, a floating wetland project on an urban college campus, demonstrates the role of interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement as a model for sustainable stormwater management, a critical part of today's urban development. Further efforts should bemade to advance the science of designing urbanwetlands and its communication to transform cultural attitudes toward sustainable urban development. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Picking up the pieces: A biosphere reserve framework for a fragmented landscape - The coastal lowlands of the Western Cape, South Africa
PY  - 1999
AB  - The coastal lowlands of the Western Cape (CLWC) form part of the fynbos biome, an area renowned for its high levels of plant diversity and endemism. The vegetation of the CLWC has been severely reduced and fragmented, and is currently impacted on by agricultural, pastoral, coastal resort and urban development, as well as alien plant spread. Furthermore, most of the vegetation communities are under-represented within existing protected areas. In response to this urgent need for increased conservation efforts, an initiative to establish a UNESCO-MAB biosphere reserve in the area has been launched. The aim of this project was to use biological criteria to identify areas that could potentially contain the core areas and buffer zones of a biosphere reserve. A reserve selection algorithm was chosen which provides a flexible tool for selecting representative areas for protection. The algorithm is a step-wise heuristic, which has rules for including mandatory polygons, forcing adjacency, including desirable (e.g. Red Data Book plant species) and excluding undesirable features (e.g. bisection by major roads). Farm boundaries (cadastral units) were used as selection units, resulting in a total of 1 717 parcels. The selection process was conducted three times with target areas set at 10%, 25% and 50% of the original extent of each vegetation type within the study area. Areas of 62 834ha, 121 199 ha and 242 397 ha, respectively, or 36%, 49% and 76% of the available land in the study area being selected. It is recommended that the area identified as the 50% target area be considered the future site of core areas and buffer zones for the proposed biosphere reserve. The algorithm successfully maintained a high degree of connectivity between selected areas. This is important considering the high levels of plant beta diversity associated with edaphic gradients. Rather than presenting a definitive reserve system, this study provides a tool allowing biological criteria to be included explicitly within the negotiation process. As the biosphere reserve is assembled, priorities can be re-assessed.

TI  - Evaluation of an ecosystem service for avoiding phosphorus nonpoint source pollution of aquatic environment and its economic value: A case study from Ertan Reservoir in Yalong River
PY  - 2010
AB  - Based on the integrated Geographic Information System (GIS) software package, ArcGIS9. 2, a model was established to simulate an ecosystem service of avoiding the receiving waters of watershed from nonpoint source pollution and its economic value. The model included fabricating the watershed of the study reservoir. The pollutant loading coefficient and vegetation filtering coefficient of different land use/cover types were used to simulate the spatial patterns of the annual quantity of the pollutant that were prevented from entering the water environment by the vegetation in each cell followed the flow path in watershed. The economic value of the ecosystem service in this model was determined by the expected water quality standard and marginal cost of purifying pollutant. This study chose phosphorus as a pollutant surrogate and took the Ertan reservoir as an example. The results showed that the region beside the riverway in the south of watershed was the high hydraulic connectivity area. The farmland in Yanyuan county, the Xichang city and Mianning county as well as certain regions in Chengduo county in northernmost watershed, Ganzi county in central watershed were phosphorus critical source areas(CSA). In 2000, the total of phosphorus that were prevented from entering the reservoir by vegetation in watershed was 978. 90 t•a-1. It occupied 81. 88% of the total CSA index. The contribution ratio of the forest to this ecosystem service value was higher than those of the other contributors on a per unit area basis. The total value of this service that avoided the receiving waters from phosphorus pollution was 1370. 18 × 104Yuan in 2000.

TI  - Multi-level, multi-scale resource selection functions and resistance surfaces for conservation planning: Pumas as a case study
PY  - 2017
AB  - The importance of examining multiple hierarchical levels when modeling resource use for wildlife has been acknowledged for decades. Multi-level resource selection functions have recently been promoted as a method to synthesize resource use across nested organizational levels into a single predictive surface. Analyzing multiple scales of selection within each hierarchical level further strengthens multi-level resource selection functions. We extend this multi-level, multi-scale framework to modeling resistance for wildlife by combining multi-scale resistance surfaces from two data types, genetic and movement. Resistance estimation has typically been conducted with one of these data types, or compared between the two. However, we contend it is not an either/or issue and that resistance may be bettermodeled using a combination of resistance surfaces that represent processes at different hierarchical levels. Resistance surfaces estimated from genetic data characterize temporally broad-scale dispersal and successful breeding over generations, whereas resistance surfaces estimated from movement data represent fine-scale travel and contextualized movement decisions. We used telemetry and genetic data from a long-term study on pumas (Puma concolor) in a highly developed landscape in southern California to develop a multilevel, multi-scale resource selection function and a multi-level, multi-scale resistance surface. We used these multi-level, multi-scale surfaces to identify resource use patches and resistant kernel corridors. Across levels, we found puma avoided urban, agricultural areas, and roads and preferred riparian areas and more rugged terrain. For other landscape features, selection differed among levels, as did the scales of selection for each feature. With these results, we developed a conservation plan for one of the most isolated puma populations in the U.S. Our approach captured a wide spectrum of ecological relationships for a population, resulted in effective conservation planning, and can be readily applied to other wildlife species. © 2017 Zeller et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

TI  - The importance of habitat design and aquatic connectivity in amphibian use of urban stormwater retention ponds
PY  - 2012
AB  - Stormwater retention ponds in urbanizing catchments are constructed to collect and treat runoff from impervious surfaces. Amphibians often inhabit retention ponds, which may partly offset the loss of natural wetlands resulting from urbanization. We investigated the use of retention ponds by frogs in a rapidly-urbanizing region of south-eastern Australia to (1) determine the habitat attributes associated with individual species, and (2) recommend specific wetland design criteria to enhance populations of frog species in the region and in other urbanizing areas throughout their distribution. We detected nine species of frogs during calling surveys at 30 retention pond sites in Greater Melbourne, 2008-2010. There were contrasting differences in habitat associations among five species for which we produced regression models of abundance or occurrence. The mean abundance of Crinia signifera increased with site area, whereas Limnodynastes dumerilii was associated with smaller sites. The occurrence of L. dumerilii was positively associated with waterbody shore depth, whereas L. peronii and L. tasmaniensis were associated with shallow shores. Two species were positively associated with time since construction or since dredging of a site, whereas the occurrence of L. dumerilii decreased with site age. Aquatic vegetation at a site was important for the occurrence of L. peronii and Litoria ewingii. There was evidence for a positive effect of aquatic connectivity on the occurrence of Limnodynastes peronii, which emphasizes the importance of riparian corridors in urban settings. These results highlight the contrasting differences in habitat associations among species in the region. We recommend that retention ponds in our region and elsewhere be constructed or enhanced to include specific habitat attributes that were found to be associated with different amphibian species. We recommend long-term monitoring at sites to determine whether retention ponds augment existing frog populations or contribute to declines. © 2011 Crown Copyright as represented by the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne.

TI  - The complexity of space utilization and environmental pollution control in the main corridor of Makassar City, South Sulawesi, Indonesia
PY  - 2020
AB  - Population mobility, increasing demand for transportation, and the complexity of land use have an impact on environmental quality degradation and air quality pollution. This study aims to analyze (1) the effect of population mobility, increased traffic volume, and land use change on air quality pollution, (2) direct and indirect effects of urban activities, transportation systems, and movement patterns on environmental quality degradation and air pollution index, and (3) air pollution strategy and sustainable urban environmental management. The research method used is a sequential explanation design. Data were obtained through observation, surveys, in-depth interviews, and documentation. The results of the study illustrate that the business center and Daya terminal with a value of 0.18 µgram/m3 is polluted, the power plant and Sermani industrial area with a value of 0.16 µgram/m3 is polluted, the Makassar industrial area with a value of 0.23 is heavily polluted, and the Hasanuddin International Airport area with a value of 0.04 µgram/m3 is not polluted. Population mobility, traffic volume, and land use changes have a significant effect on environmental quality degradation, with a determination coefficient of 94.1%. The direct effect of decreasing environmental quality on the air pollution index is 66.09%. This study recommends transportation management on the main road corridor of Makassar City, which is environmentally friendly with regard to sustainable environmental management. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Multihop wireless access networks for flood mitigation crowd-sourcing systems
PY  - 2017
AB  - Natural disasters can be mitigated or even anticipated if we have appropriate means, in terms of communications and data sharing models, to collect relevant data in advance or during disaster occurrences, which can be used for supporting disaster prevention and recovery processes. This work proposes a framework that encourages people to collect and share data about disaster, especially flood in Ho Chi Minh City, via on-site established multihop wireless access networks configured by the sharing of internet connectivity in users’ mobile devices. For connectivity sharing, on-the-fly establishment of multihop wireless access network (OEMAN) scheme is thoroughly analyzed and improved to resolve its inherent issue on traffic load imbalance due to its tree-based structure. More specifically, we propose a linear program for overload-aware routing optimization considering wireless interference. Evaluations implemented in Matlab show that the overload-aware routing improves load balancing among available virtual access points in OEMAN. By avoiding nodes with heavy load in the network, our solution improves network throughput compared to overload-unaware routing protocols.

TI  - Social and cultural role of greenery in development of cittaslow towns
PY  - 2019
AB  - The beginnings of the Cittaslow movement date back to 1998. Italian towns became a model for other European towns, and subsequently for others, around the world. This is how an international movement came into being, founded on the idea of improvement of the quality of life of residents, savouring \"slow\", healthy lifestyle, drawing on the tradition and history and respecting the natural and cultural environment of small towns. Green areas play a huge role in creating the image of Cittaslow towns. They constitute the so-called \"green urban corridors\" or \"green spots\" and have cultural, educational and social significance, including recreation and spa functions. They are not only a complement to architecture, but can play a superior role in the structure of cities. The aim of the work is to analyze the state of parks, squares and green areas management in the Cittaslow towns in region of Warmia and Mazury (Poland). There are 20 environmentally, spatially, economically and demographically diverse towns in the region of Warmia and Mazury that acceded to the association. The international network includes towns with a population under 50 thousand. An analysis of the source materials involved gathering and interpretation of information obtained from monographic and cartographic documentation, both current and archival, from websites of Cittaslow towns and mentions in the media. Apart from a monographic study, the authors carried out a landscape and spatial analysis, pre-project studies and made original designs for selected urban parks and greens in Cittaslow towns. All the Cittaslow towns in the Province of Warmia and Mazury under analysis have high potential in terms of using greenery areas with the social and cultural function. Parks and squares are perfect places for integration of communities and for conducting educational and cultural activities. However, diversity regarding land development and programme offer is observed (utility programme). In some towns, greenery areas cover only space with planned (not always in accordance with the art of gardening) plant compositions. However, parks and squares should be planned not only with their visual aspect in mind, but emphasis should be placed on their utility side (active use). Therefore, the article points to the directions of development of new places, as well the possibility of adding socio-cultural functions to existing greenery areas. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Urban stream assessment procedure: An integrative framework for assessing stream condition in the urban environment
PY  - 2020
AB  - Numerous multi-scale hierarchical river health approaches and assessments have been developed and implemented with a variety of scientific and management purposes. Although many existing biological and geomorphological assessments offer insights into stream function, none were developed for or exclusively capture the functions of streams in the urban environment. Quantitative aspects of existing screening tools are limited in urban streams due to the unique combination of hydrogeomorphic and anthropogenic factors in the urban environment. Analyzing the physical, biological, and social drivers within the concept of the urban stream syndrome coupled with recent advances in stream assessments connects the health of urban streams with past, present, and future impacts. The urban stream assessment procedure (USAP) provides an innovative framework and conceptual model to comprehensively assess stream functions in the urban environment and quantify stream health at multiple scales. The specific aim is to identify and investigate the highest function and lowest maintenance “version” of an urban stream that is achievable given the context – varying hydrologic regimes, geomorphic conditions, ecologic diversity, social contexts, and community values. It is designed to classify urban stream reaches and corridors according to their hydrological, geomorphological, vegetation characteristics and to support identification of reaches that might be candidates for rehabilitation. Employing a multi-scale framework yields greater success in assessing stream function, diagnosing watershedwide drivers, and implementing strategies to enhance streams in the urban environment. Furthermore, the USAP framework can assist water resources managers in assessing and managing health specific to urban streams through applicable spatial and relevant parameters and metrics. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, London

TI  - Managers' perceptions of threats to the protected areas of Kenya: Prioritization for effective management
PY  - 2007
AB  - In Kenya knowledge of the relative severity of threats to protected areas and the vulnerability of these areas to any threats is lacking. Such information is required, however, for assessment of the effectiveness of management of the country's protected areas, and to help identify critical management and policy weaknesses and priorities for improving management and allocating resources. We therefore studied the relative severity of threats to Kenya's 50 protected areas and their relative vulnerability to such threats based on the perceptions of protected area managers. Ten threats were identified by these managers, of which the most severe were illegal bushmeat hunting, poaching of large mammals, human-wildlife conflicts, human encroachment, and loss of migration corridors and dispersal areas. Thirty-two (64%) protected areas were vulnerable to over half of the threats, 54% vulnerable to over six of the threats and 32% vulnerable to over seven of the threats. Protected areas in marine, forested/montane and inland wetland ecosystems were regarded as highly vulnerable to the perceived threats. Protected areas adjacent to urban/industrial and agricultural areas were vulnerable to most of the threats. Our findings demonstrate that protected areas in Kenya are increasingly threatened, that major threats needs to be mitigated, and that prioritization of protected areas for strategic actions is required for effective management. © 2007 FFI.

TI  - Assumptions to the in-depth natural research carried out between the floodbank's of the Vistula Valley in the Warsaw area
PY  - 2000
AB  - The between floodbanks area of the Vistula (Pilica-Narew section) is an unique natural system as a consequences of limited degree to which the river can be transformed by hydrotechnical work, distinguished by very rare natural habitats (with characteristic fluvial processes) and biotopes with many specific species of plants and animals, so the optimal form of protection for this section should be regarded as essential. Detailed studies were carried out to indicate the optimal ways to manage the valley from natural and anthropogenic point of view. The investigations in this section concern flora and vegetation, fish, bird, mammal and inverterbrate faunas as well as soil processes. The result of work allow to formulate recommendations for protect nature: To conserye biological diversity, to preserve the specific landscape, to protect species of plants and animals. The Vistula Valley is an exceptional natural object on the scales of both Poland and Europe. This importance reflects the relatively limited degree to which the river has been transformed by hydrotechnical work and the consequent persistence here of the otherwise now very rare habitats that a large relatively unregulated lowland river may create. These constitute biotopes for many species of animal that could not survive in the region without these areas, so the obtainment of the optimal form of protection for the valley of the Middle Vistula should be regarded as essential. In the section under discussion (between the confluence points with the Pilica and Narew), the Vistula has variously been transformed and modified in terms of both its regulated corridor and the entire area between its floodbanks, which serves in the throughout of high floodwaters. The width of the area also varies greatly, as does the degree of transformation of plant cover within it. Particularly marked modification is of course to be noted in the case of the natural system within Warsaw, where the width of the area subject to flooding may be limited to only 400 m. This compares with the c. 1 km width of average sections up and downstream of the city. Comprehensive natural studies were carried out to indicate the optimal ways in which to manage the Valley from both the natural and hydrotechnical points of view. The work took in: - A detailed reconnaissance of the vegetation and flora; -A reconnaissance of the fish, bird, mammal and invertebrate faunas; -A reconnaissance of soil processes. The results of work allowed for the formulation of conclusions and recommendations resulting from the need to protect nature. This is first and foremost understood in terms of the needs: -To conserve biological diversity; -to preserve the specific landscape; -to protect species and areas as detailed in law.

TI  - Weighted linear combinationof a GIS environment in the definition of priority areas for connectivity among forest fragments
PY  - 2012
AB  - Forest fragmentation of anthropogenic origin is one of the results promoted by the disorderly process of the land use and land cover, especially in intensively cultivated landscapes. In this context, this study aimed to define priority areas to facilitate connectivity among forest fragments, seeking forest recovery actions in the Pardo River Basin, SP, using the multicriteria approach (Weighted Linear Combination). The Participator Technique was used to define the criteria and the weights of the factors. The factors considered important to the objective of this study were the following: proximity between the fragments with greater nuclear areas, proximity to forest cover, proximity of the river system, distance to urban centers, slope, erodibility of soil. Whereas the variables that influence the selection of priority areas for forest restoration in the Pardo River Basin, SP contribute with different weights in the final decision process, a hierarchy according to the importance of each factor to the fitness area was established. The major factor was proximity among fragments of the largest nuclear area (0.3713), followed by proximity to forest cover (0.1911), proximity to the river system (0.1516), distance to urban centers (.1168), slope (0.0840) and erodibility (0.0854). The result was a map of priority areas, with five classes of priority. The priority areas occurred in order to promote the first union of forest patches with greater nuclear area, and from this union, the successive expansion of these regions of very high priority tending to very low. The methodology was adequate to the mapping of priority areas for restoration in watersheds. Fragments with bigger nuclear areas, connected with small fragments where they are predominant in the landscape, promoting the formation of larger fragments from the formation of forest corridors and recompositon of vegetation.

TI  - The big easy was anything but for the panthers
PY  - 2010
AB  - The Big Easy, as a site for the National Committee to Combat Fascism (NCCF), presented the aspiring Black Panthers with a unique set of circumstances. New Orleans differed from other major southern cities both in its storied intraracial history and in its civil rights movement activity. To start with, New Orleans had a significant African American population from its earliest years, and prior to the Civil War this population included sizable numbers of free black men and women who, with their descendants, called themselves Creoles. Creoles (lighthued free black Catholics of mixed-race French ancestry) tended to fare better than other blacks in most areas of public and private life. Some non-Creole blacks resented the advantages that were afforded light-skinned blacks, making it somewhat difficult to forge the kind of close-knit African American community that may have existed in other southern cities. Activists attempting to organize the black community around issues of race may have found their work challenging. Moreover the long tradition of welleducated Creoles, coupled with the city's Roman Catholic and Latin heritage that encouraged tolerance and cooperation, made the civil rights struggle in the city different in some ways from that in other major southern locales. The New Orleans civil rights movement was not intense and forceful, as was the case in other southern cities. The movement mirrored the easy-going, relaxed nature of the masses. In an interview with historian Adam Fairclough, Harvey Britton, Louisiana's National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) field secretary, noted, \"We had worked at our own pace, and things were going to generally get better, but it was not on a national time schedule, it was on Louisiana's time schedule.\"1 Well, there was a generation of younger New Orleanians, both black and white, who believed that progress was moving at a much slower rate than warranted. In their minds, the timetable for black progress needed to be moved up. Consequently, a group of young aspiring Black Panthers (mostly in their late teens and early twenties) set up an NCCF office with the expressed purpose of accelerating the struggle for black equality. Before long they would catch the attention of the city leaders and find themselves in the crosshairs of the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD). Concerned with what the NCCF might be planning, the NOPD was prepared to thwart any armed insurrection or mass violence in the city, which had gone through the turbulent 1960s without a hint of a rebellion, something in which the city leaders took pride. Donald Guyton, now known as Malik Rahim, was one of those on whom the police set their sights. When Rahim (who was in charge of security for the upstart NCCF office in 1970) crawled on his belly through the Piety Street house that had been teargassed and riddled with bullets in the fall of 1970, it was impossible for him to foresee the mild evening thirty-three years later when he would again come face to face with the powers responsible for that onslaught. The NCCF charter, established in December 1969, was not even a year old when the group became embroiled in a highly publicized standoff with members of the NOPD in mid-September 1970. Rahim remembers, \"The shooting had stopped, and Charles Scott had instructed me to go from room to room and assess the carnage.\"2 Rahim, a Vietnam veteran, was no stranger to death and mayhem, but he dreaded what he might find as he made his way through the house. To his and everyone else's amazement, there were no casualties. The shootout on Piety Street between the aspiring Panthers and the NOPD lasted approximately thirty minutes. But the tensions leading up to the shootout had been building for months. During the previous summer, Rahim and his wife, Barbara, went to their friend Puchimo's house every day for Panther meetings. Those were the early days of the Black Panther Party (BPP) in New Orleans, and Puchimo's house was one of several gathering places. The oldest of the prospective Panthers, Rahim was only twenty-two. Even though he was well traveled, his encounter with the Panthers in his hometown awakened him to new ideas and new possibilities. Thirty-three years later he would reflect, \"It was the first time I ever talked to a brother who had no fear.\"3 The person to whom Rahim referred was nineteen-year-old Steve Green, the reported founder of the local office of the NCCF and a native Louisianan who had come to New Orleans in May 1969 by way of California. Initially, when Rahim and Barbara tried to join the NCCF, Green urged them not to. They had two children, and Panthers had to be ready on a daily basis to put their lives on the line for their principles. \"Too dangerous, \" Green told them. Rahim and Barbara, however, would not take no for an answer, and by the fall of 1970 they were members of the NCCF. According to the July 25, 1970, issue of the Black Panther, the NCCF acted as \"organizing bureaus of the Black Panther Party ONLY.\" The NCCF was sanctioned as a Black Panther chapter only after it proved its worthiness via various community initiatives.4 This approval, interestingly, came after the much-ballyhooed confrontation with members of the NOPD. Headquartered on Piety Street, the prospective Panthers were just outside of the largest, poorest housing development in New Orleans. The $23 million project opened to tenants on May 21, 1956, with 388 four-bedroom apartments and 968 three-bedroom apartments. The project, located within the Ninth Ward in a cypress swamp and dumping ground, was named, among all things, Desire. The New Orleans Times-Picayune would later call it a \"disaster from its inception . . . a mind-numbing series of careless decisions that amounted to a blueprint for disaster.\" \"It wasn't designed for people to live in; it was designed, rather, as warehousing for the city's poorest residents, \" according to Ed Arceneaux, a former Desire manager and housing management specialist with the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Larry Jones, the executive director of the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) in 1989, blamed racism. Said Jones in the Times-Picayune: The aim was quantity not quality, and so housing officials built an unwieldy giant. \"This was for poor black people. I just think that the commitment was not there. . . . They just felt like poor people don't deserve a whole lot.\"5 In the early 1960s, when some previously all-white projects opened their doors to blacks, some residents, who were initially confined to Desire, began moving out in search of better housing. However, by the mid-1960s Desire became increasingly overcrowded as the city was hit hard by Hurricane Betsy in 1965, putting parts of the city, including Desire, under six feet of water. Eightyone lives were claimed. Levees along the Mississippi River Gulf Coast Outlet along Florida Avenue in the Lower Ninth Ward, as well as on both sides of the Industrial Canal, were breached. Sections of the Lower Ninth Ward were destroyed, and many buildings and businesses were not rebuilt due to a lack of city loans and grants. Moreover, thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenue were lost, making grim conditions worse. Hurricane Betsy tested the city's levee system and forced massive black displacement and relocation, resulting in tremendous human suffering and death. These adverse conditions forced some black families to, as a last resort, move into Desire, where they remained. By 1970, 10, 594 residents, 8, 312 (75 percent) of them under the age of twenty-one, were crowded into an area twelve blocks long and three blocks wide.6 On a typical summer day, women sat on their porches fanning the tepid air and exchanging news and banter while children jumped rope and played ball in the dirt. Broken glass, old shoes, cigarette butts, and drug paraphernalia littered trampled weeds between apartments. Holes in walls and broken pipes accommodated a sizable population of rodents. Yet the city's administration did not publicly acknowledge the squalor of Desire until the NCCF, demanding attention and advocating revolutionary action, established a headquarters on Piety Street half a block from the project. At the same time, the NCCF was setting up services to provide some relief and to point out that simple and humane remedies could be provided, if not by the city, then by young black revolutionaries who believed that blacks were being treated more like chattel than citizens. In August 1970 the city finally took notice. Mayor Maurice \"Moon\" Landrieu sent Robert H. (Bob) Tucker, his idealistic young black special assistant, to Desire to investigate. Tucker spent seventy-two hours \"living\" in the home of Henry Faggen. Describing Desire as \"one of the most explosive areas of the city, \" Tucker wrote: \"Life in any multi-family structure for the low income family is a very difficult proposition, to say the least. The Desire housing project is a classic study of the worst.\"7 He reported that children waded in clogged sewers for lack of recreation facilities; families were afraid to leave their homes at night for fear of being robbed, mugged, or raped; piles of garbage went uncollected for days, even weeks. Desire was isolated, Tucker found, culturally and geographically from the rest of the city. Located in the Ninth Ward, downriver from the city, it was bordered by railroad tracks, the Mississippi River, the Industrial Canal, and a corridor of industrial plants.8 But it had nonetheless spawned community leaders, entrepreneurs, and social activists. © 2010 by The University Press of Mississippi.

TI  - The dispersals of crops: A study on the remains of carbonized plants in the neolithic age at longgangsi site in hanzhong, Shaanxi Province
PY  - 2020
AB  - The southward dispersal of millet and the northward dispersal of rice are of hot spots to the academic research in the Yangtze River basin. Southern Shaanxi is such a south-north transitional zone located in the upper reaches of the Han river. There was a good opportunity to take excavation and make floatation of Longgangsi Neolithic site in Hanzhong City located at southern Shaanxi Province, however the archaeological culture of this site belongs to the cultural system of the Neolithic age in the north. A total of 222 soil samples were collected from the site, including 2462 agricultural remains and 1419 non-agricultural remains. The results showed that the crop remains mainly include foxtail millet, broomcorn millet and rice. AMS 14C dating was conducted on the charred rice grains recovered from T1309G7④ and T1308H171③ according to their relative ages shown by the type of potteries. The time range (2σ) is about 4973~4826 cal.a B.P., which is basically consistent with the relative stratigraphy of the sites defined by archaeological typological sequences for the Yangshao and Longshan culture. According to the analysis of carbonized plant remains it is suggested that the agricultural economy of 5000~4000 cal.a B.P.(Yangshao-Longshan)in Longgangsi site was millet-based agriculture with rice utilization to some extent. In addition, the remains of soybean(Glycine max), Perilla frutescens and Chenopodium album and other plants were also found at the site of Longgangsi, indicating that the ancestors also used or collected such plants. In conclusion, it is the first study on archaeobotany in the south of Qinling Mountains and is of great significance to the study of crop dispersals and cultural exchange in the transitional zone between the north and the south. Han River basin was one of the corridors where rice from south and millets from north were spread in the ancient. © 2020, Science in China Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - First inventory and faunistic particularities of the chironomid population from a 6th order section of the sandy River Loire (France)
PY  - 2000
AB  - The chironomid populations of a 40 km section of the middle Loire (Tours region) were studied for the first time. Six collections (distributed over the years 1994 to 1996) of pupal exuviae and benthic pupae were made from April to November, in the main river bed, at 4 sites of this potamal zone. A total of 12,073 specimens were sorted and 117 species or taxa identified. Thirty one are new for continental France, in particular Polypedilum acifer Townes and Saetheria reissi Jackson, two dominant species. Among these, three genera are new: Hayesomyia, Robackia and Saetheria. A new pupal exuvia which has only been noted in the Loire has been recorded: Chironomus Pe23 (Langton 1995). A comparison of the middle Loire chironomid fauna with that of the potamal zones of five large European rivers - Rhone and Garonne (France) - Meuse (Belgium) - Po (Italy) - Rhine (Germany) - confirms the diversity and faunistic originality of the middle Loire using several descriptors such as diversity indexes, rarefaction curves, equitability index, distribution of species abundance, number of 'endemic' species and distribution of dominant species. Causes of the high specific richness observed, as well as rare species abundance or scarcity, are discussed taking into account functional characteristics of the River Loire's potamic parts such as the connectivity pattern. The relationship between high biodiversity and large, sandy rivers is also discussed using similar results obtained on two other large sandy rivers: the Po and the Elbe (Germany) rivers.

TI  - Physical habitat assessment in urban rivers under future flow scenarios
PY  - 2003
AB  - River corridors in urban environments provide areas of biodiversity which are important for both aesthetic and economic reasons. A physical habitat model, which was used to assess urban rivers in Birmingham, UK, was applied to pairs of selected reaches to represent differing levels of habitat diversity on three rivers. The results for different life-stages of dace, roach and chub suggest that the worst physical habitat occurs in highly modified channels and at the highest flows. Four scenarios, which were designed to represent alterations in flow regime caused by changes in management practices, were calculated using the hydrological model. Changes in physical habitat created by changes to the flow regime were assessed using a consistent, replicable method. It was shown that an increase in runoff would have detrimental effects in all cases, and that less engineered sites would benefit more from flow reductions. The lack of a suitable habitat for fry is shown to be a limiting factor for fish at all sites. © 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - ORIGIN OF THE AVIFAUNA OF URBAN AND SUBURBAN SINGAPORE
PY  - 1968
AB  - A list of the commoner garden and town birds of the tropical city of Singapore is given. None of them are birds of the rain forest which formerly covered the island. The majority are coastal species the natural habitats of which were mangrove and the thin fringe of savanna along parts of the east coast of the Malayan Peninsula. The reasons for this are discussed. The number of garden species is comparatively small and many niches appear to be vacant. These are expected to be filled mainly by open country species moving down the peninsula from Burma and Thailand along the corridors being opened up by deforestation. This process has already begun, though few species have yet reached as far south as Singapore. The garden avifauna is unstable and numerous changes in status have occurred in the last few decades; many more are predicted. Copyright © 1968, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

TI  - The parana-paraguay fluvial corridor (Argentina)
PY  - 2018
AB  - The Parana-Paraguay Corridor forms the main fluvial axis of De la Plata River basin, spanning free of hydroelectric dams, between 20 S and 35 S, crossing Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay. There are big differences in precipitation and hydrological seasons which drive the pulsing regimes of its large wetlands with extended wet and dry phases. From the Pantanal wetlands in the north and ending with the Rio de la Plata Estuary in the south, the corridor connects large tropical and subtropical wetlands with temperate deltaic and coastal areas, making it a remarkable thermal, geochemical and biogeographic highway. Species richness figures for the whole area are not available although some of its major wetlands (Middle Parana, Lower Parana Delta) have been extensively studied. A thorough assessment of the conservation status for the whole Fluvial Corridor has not been made yet. Its wetland mosaics contribute to buffer the effects of extraordinary floods and function as water reservoirs during dry seasons or spells. The Fluvial Corridor provides land settings, freshwater for domestic and industrial uses, pollution cleanup services, recreation opportunities, and local and international commerce transportation to more than 40 million urban dwellers which inhabit its shores. Major threats for the whole system are related to climate variability, river flow regulation from hydroelectrical projects and waterway development expansion, excessive runoff from agricultural and industrial mainland activities with few or no water treatments. Current economic development is heavily focused on transforming wetlands into terrestrial ecosystems for recreational urban development, year round cattle ranching and agriculture. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018.

TI  - Coupled simulation of human-driven and natural land cover change in the Front Range Corridor, CO
PY  - 2014
AB  - The Colorado Front Range Corridor is a mixture of urban, agricultural, grassland, and diverse forest types, making it an ideal natural laboratory to investigate feedbacks and interactions of coupled human and natural systems. We explored future scenarios of human-driven land use change and natural vegetation dynamics using the CHANGE model, which integrates a demand-allocation land use change module, a succession module for natural vegetation dynamics, and a spatially explicit fire initiation and spread module. We used the model to project landscape change over an approximately 48000 km2 study area from 2005 through 2050 under A2 and B1 emission scenarios. The area of young forest and deciduous forest increased due to increased burned area. The degree of forest species and structure change depended on the fire regime, with more dramatic change simulated under the A2 emission scenario. Expansion of developed areas resulted in loss of natural vegetation, and most of the newly developed area was in the Great Plains. However, expansion of the wildland urban interface (WUI) mainly occurred in the forests of the Southern Rocky Mountains and was concentrated along roads. The results suggested that: (1) increase of young forest may lead to higher drought and fire susceptibility, further amplifying fire risks; (2) fire and fuel management in the WUI is already challenging and those challenges will be greater with continued expansion of the WUI and changes in fire regimes; (3) changing land cover and natural vegetation composition and structure in our study area may have significant effects on a variety of ecosystem services.

TI  - Very small relict populations suggest high extinction debt of gingers in primary forest fragments of a tropical city
PY  - 2017
AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Tropical plant communities in fragmented forests are likely to experience an extinction debt, i.e., the habitat cannot support as many species as are present due to reduced habitat size and connectivity. There are few estimates of the number of species that represent extinction debt, and the number of extinctions over time has rarely been recorded. We recorded population sizes to assess threats and extinctions in gingers (sensu Zingiberales) in fragmented rainforest in Singapore, ca. 200 yr after fragmentation began. METHODS: We surveyed extant diversity and population sizes of gingers and used the results to estimate species survival. We critically assessed historic specimens to estimate initial extinctions and extinctions realized in present habitats. KEY RESULTS: We recorded 23 species, including five species previously presumed nationally extinct and four species omitted from the national checklist. The revised extinction rate is much lower than previously reported (12 vs. 37%). Most gingers have very small populations or miniscule ranges, implying that extinction debt has not been paid off. CONCLUSIONS: Ginger diversity remains high, but the number of species at immediate risk of extinction outnumber recorded extinctions. Although tropical forest fragments remain arks of plant diversity for a long time, extinction debt may be prevalent in all plant groups in Singapore. Slow relaxation of extinction debt should be explicitly identified as a conservation challenge and opportunity. For conserving plant diversity in tropical fragments, relaxation must be reversed through restoration of degraded landscapes and, where feasible, targeted ex situ conservation and planting. © 2017 Botanical Society of America.

TI  - A quantitative method for zoning of protected areas and its spatial ecological implications
PY  - 2007
AB  - Zoning is a key prescriptive tool for administration and management of protected areas. However, the lack of zoning is common for most protected areas in developing countries and, as a consequence, many protected areas are not effective in achieving the goals for which they were created. In this work, we introduce a quantitative method to expeditiously zone protected areas and we evaluate its ecological implications on hypothetical zoning cases. A real-world application is reported for the Talampaya National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Argentina. Our method is a modification of the zoning forest model developed by Bos [Bos, J., 1993. Zoning in forest management: a quadratic assignment problem solved by simulated annealing. Journal of Environmental Management 37, 127-145.]. Main innovations involve a quadratic function of distance between land units, non-reciprocal weights for adjacent land uses (mathematically represented by a non-symmetric matrix), and the possibility of imposing a connectivity constraint. Due to its intrinsic spatial dimension, the zoning problem belongs to the NP-hard class, i.e. a solution can only be obtained in non-polynomial time [Nemhausser, G., Wolsey, L., 1988. Integer and Combinatorial Optimization. John Wiley, New York.]. For that purpose, we applied a simulated annealing heuristic implemented as a FORTRAN language routine. Our innovations were effective in achieving zoning designs more compatible with biological diversity protection. The quadratic distance term facilitated the delineation of core zones for elements of significance; the connectivity constraint minimized fragmentation; non-reciprocal land use weightings contributed to better representing management decisions, and influenced mainly the edge and shape of zones. This quantitative method can assist the zoning process within protected areas by offering many zonation scheme alternatives with minimum cost, time and effort. This ability provides a new tool to improve zoning within protected areas in developing countries. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Clay Soil in Suburban Environments: Movement and Stabilization through Vegetation
PY  - 2015
AB  - Buildings, utility services, and transportation links in towns and cities built on expansive clay soils often suffer distortion and/or structural damage. This damage is caused by shrinkage and/or expansion of expansive soils through water extraction or absorption. Movement of clay may be estimated using testing protocols, with results depending on the method employed and sample preparation. Communities throughout the world continue to spend billions of dollars annually on rectification works due to the \"unpredictable\" movement of these soils.The aim of this chapter is to provide a summary of current literature and suggest a pathway to ensure constructed design meets its expected design life. Specific focus is on scenarios with combinations of expansive clays, tree species and root architecture (type and distribution of roots), chemical soil stabilization additives, and infrastructure materials.Deeply rooted trees growing in expansive clay suburban residential environments are known to exacerbate shrinkage movement through soil desiccation as the tree roots extract soil water. However, vegetation can provide a stabilizing effect, particularly, for example, for the usually wet subgrades underlying rail tracks and for sloped embankments built on moist to wet clay soils. The destabilization and/or stabilization of clay soils due to tree roots extracting and/or redistributing moisture in soil profiles in both suburban residential and rail track environments is yet to be reliably quantified through modeling, as conceded in the design standards in Australia for construction of residential footings.The distribution and interaction of the roots with the soil of various tree species in an expansive clay profile, particularly specific environments such as streets and rail corridors, is not predictable with current knowledge. The environment will impact on the tree root architecture. Numerical modeling of the influence of vegetation on soil requires an understanding of where the roots will be. Without this knowledge, prediction of either expansive clay ground movements or ground improvement due to trees growing next to buildings, roads, rail tracks, and sloped embankments will be misguided.The design of buildings and infrastructure on expansive clays may be undertaken with an understanding of trees and their root architecture and the soil suctions that are likely to be developed within and around the root zone. In conjunction with knowledge of the structural capacity of the materials of construction and, in some cases, the possibility of mitigating expansive soil movement with chemical additives, considerable savings may ensue through minimizing rectification during the operational life of the structure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - How storm water quality reduces flooding
PY  - 2019
AB  - Over the last century, urban sprawl has created environmental issues with storm water throughout communities of the United States. Loss of green space along with the increase of populations has generated life contaminates to enter the water and drainage systems. Invasive species are overtaking streams, marshlands, and open spaces. The Federal Government has issued non-funded mandates to the EPA, requiring communities to start addressing their storm water systems. These mandates require municipalities to create programs to treat their streams, waterways and lakes along with public education and outreach. Once a farming community of over 17 square miles, the City of Westlake is now almost fully developed and relatively flat with flooding problems that cause property damage. This paper outlines how this city combined both problems and found a solution that help resolve both issue, while creating an eco-friendly park. This project was a riparian corridor restoration project that protects and enhances a major drainage channel (Dover Ditch). This is done by converting an ill-maintained basins, urbanized drainage channel and dumping ground into a 20 acre nature preserve for the community. This project is along a major arterial that connects two interstates, which creates excellent exposure. Previously, this urbanized drainage channel has been found to have poor water quality by the County Board of Health and the Ohio EPA, which was a concern due to a swimming beach being located at the outfall of the watershed. Part of the land for this project is owned by Metro Health, a local non-profit public health care system. The land from Metro Health, for this project, was acquired by the means of a conservation easement as opposed to purchasing, which was a savings of $1.8 million. That money instead could be used for the project in lieu of a land purchase. This created a great partnership between these two entities. The overall project goals were as follows: • Improve water quality, uptake nutrients and breakdown contaminants in the restored wetlands. • Restore creek side vegetation and prevent erosion. • Eliminate invasive species. • Provide aesthetic preservation benefits. • Provide additional nature preserve for the community. • Increase public awareness. • Remove a blight in the community. • Protect existing wetlands so that they remain locally and are not land banked elsewhere. • Reduce localized flooding by lowering the hydraulic grade line. Currently, this urbanized drainage channel has no ecological benefit due to the degradation that has occurred over time from development, which has removed the following: • Natural flow pattern • Creek side vegetation • Wetland flood plains • Water quality • Animal and Fish Habitats.

TI  - Optimization of Spatial Pattern of Urban Imperviousness based on the Integration of SCS-CN Hydrological Model and the Ant Colony Algorithm
PY  - 2017
AB  - In recent years, the frequent occurrence of waterlogging in China has been one of the serious urban diseases. Spatial pattern of urban impervious surface density is an important factor affecting the waterlogging. This paper aims to provide a new method to optimize the spatial pattern of impervious surface in order to reduce urban waterlogging by the integration of SCS-CN model and the Ant colony algorithm. Firstly, the density of urban impervious surface was estimated by remote sensing images through the method of linear spectral mixing modeling. Secondly, the CN value was corrected by using the Williams formula. Then, the modified SCS-CN model was used to calculate the surface runoff. Thirdly, according to the goal of minimizing runoff coefficient, the spatial pattern of impervious surface of 18 runoff plots was optimized by Ant colony algorithm. Fourthly, landscape pattern indices were used to analyze the spatial pattern of impervious surface. The results show that: in rainfall reappearing periods of 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years and 100 years, the optimized impervious surface pattern could reduce the runoff coefficient by 21.19%, 19.58%, 19.38%, 18.93%, 18.41% and 17.25%, respectively. Based on the experimental results above, this research puts forward three suggestions for the optimization of urban renewal. ① Increase the area of grassland, garden, trees and other vegetation types to reduce the high impervious surface area which can be further divided into patches of lower levels of impervious surface. ② Gather low and medium-to-low types of impervious surface to increase the connectivity and the medium-to-high levels of impervious surface. ③ Increase the quantity and density of patches in each runoff plot and reduce the degree of spread and aggregation. © 2017, Science Press.

TI  - Anthropogenic disturbance and habitat loss for the red-listed Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus): Using ecological niche modeling and nighttime light satellite imagery
PY  - 2015
AB  - Habitat loss is a critical factor driving extinction of biodiversity worldwide, with models of future land use anticipating increases in rates of destruction of native habitats worldwide. The Asian black bear (. Ursus thibetanus) is a red-listed species with a broad geographic range that has been fragmented dramatically by land use change. Remaining populations of U. thibetanus occupy diverse habitats, ranging from highlands to coastal regions. We integrated ecological niche models (ENMs) with nighttime satellite imagery to identify areas suitable for U. thibetanus after anthropogenic alteration. We found that at least 10% of the potential distributional area for the species is not suitable owing to urban or suburban encroachment. U. thibetanus seems to persist in highland areas, characterized by low temperature and high precipitation, whereas humans concentrate in lowlands and less-extreme climatic conditions. ENMs based solely on climate frequently overestimate suitable areas available for species; nighttime light imagery offers a robust alternative to refining estimates of species' ranges, designing protected areas and corridors, prioritizing threatened species, and determining areas of human-wildlife conflict across broad areas. Our approach is transferable to other taxa and contexts, and should be considered in conservation planning and policy implementation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Reptile bycatch in a pest-exclusion fence established for wildlife reintroductions
PY  - 2014
AB  - Conservation fences have been used as a tool to stop threatening processes from acting against endangered wildlife, yet little is known of the impacts of fences on non-target native species. In this study, we intensively monitored a pest-exclusion fence for 16 months to assess impacts on a reptile community in south-eastern Australia. We registered 1052 reptile records of six species along the fence. Encounters and mortality were greatest for eastern long-necked turtles (. Chelodina longicollis), whereas impacts on lizards (. Tiliqua rugosa, Tiliqua scincoides, Pogona barbata, Egernia cunninghami) and snakes (. Pseudonaja textilis) were more moderate. We recorded several Chelodina longicollis recaptures at the fence and many of these were later found dead at the fence, indicating persistent attempts to navigate past the fence. We conservatively estimate that the fence resulted in the death of 3.3% and disrupted movements of 20.9% of the turtle population within the enclosure. Movement disruption and high mortality were also observed for turtles attempting to enter the nature reserve, effectively isolating the reserve population from others in the wider landscape. Of 98 turtle mortalities, the most common cause of death was overheating, followed by predation, vehicular collision, and entanglement. Turtle interactions were clustered in areas with more wetlands and less urban development, and temporally correlated with high rainfall and solar radiation, and low temperature. Thus, managers could focus at times and locations to mitigate impacts on turtles. We believe the impact of fences on non-target species is a widespread and unrecognized threat, and suggest that future and on-going conservation fencing projects consider risks to non-target native species, and where possible, apply mitigation strategies that maintain natural movement corridors and minimize mortality risk. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Ecological security pattern construction in typical ecological shelter zone: A case study of chengde
PY  - 2021
AB  - Optimizing the spatial patterns of urban expansion and ecological space is an urgent need in top-level design of land development. As a method for reconciling conflict between eco system conservation and urban exploitation, ecological security pattern (ESP) construction is important to improving the efficiency of land consolidation in ecological shelter zone, which is characterized by ecosystem diversity and ecosystem services. Chengde in Hebei Province is an ecological barrier area in the north of Beijing and Tianjin. According to the results of ecosystem services evaluation, we identified the most important zones of forest, shrubland, and grassland, and designated the ecological sources in combination with existing protection areas in Chengde. ESP was constructed based on minimal cumulative resistance (MCR) model. The area of identi- lied ecological sources was 13200 km', accounting for 34.22% of total area. The ecological corri dors were 2160 km, including cluster corridors and landscape corridors, which were distributed in pattern of one horizontal direction (Willing Mountain-Dushan Mountain) and three vertical di rections ( Liaohe headwaters-Maojing Dam, Baicao Depression-Yudao Pass, Baicao Depression - Luanhe headwaters). The corridors effectively linked up the ecological sources. In total, 22 eco logical nodes were identified, which could he classified into two types as core nodes and stepping stone nodes. The areas of high and low-level eco-security buffer zones were 12550 and 11352 2 • l • ∗ km . Compared with the status and planning of land-use, most natural vegetation was effectively conserved, and the ESP was generally consistent with the pattern of Chengde's environment pro-tection and urban development strategies. The results indicated that the improved method reduced the uncertainty of ESP resulted from heterogeneous vegetation distribution and difference in net primary productivity among different vegetation types, and had well applicability in ecological shelter zone. Our results provide scientific guidance and technical support for territorial develop ment and environment protection in ecological shelter zone. © 2021 editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

TI  - Riverine Landscape Patches Influence Trophic Dynamics of Riparian Ants
PY  - 2016
AB  - Food webs in riparian corridors are increasingly viewed as embedded in complex riverine landscapes characterized by an amalgam of aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats. However, the influence of riverine landscape pattern on trophic dynamics of riparian consumers remains largely unknown. We used naturally abundant stable isotope ratios (δ15N) to compare trophic structure of ants (Formica subsericea) among riparian patch types (crop, grass/herbaceous, gravel bar, lawn, mudflat, shrub, swamp, and woody vegetation) at 12 riverine landscapes distributed along an urban-rural landscape gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. We expected that the diet of F. subsericea, a common generalist consumer, would reflect local prey availability and thus differences in trophic dynamics among patch types. Mean ant δ15N was higher in crop patches than in any other patch type, and was lowest in grass/herbaceous, lawn, shrub, and woody vegetation patches, suggesting that patch type was associated with trophic position of F. subsericea. We also found that the range of δ15N, and thus trophic breadth, was significantly different by patch type, with woody vegetation exhibiting the greatest spread. Variability in canopy, tree and shrub cover, and the degree of urban development was positively correlated with δ15N range (R2 = 0.78), pointing to the role of habitat structure in mediating trophic breadth of riparian ants. These findings provide evidence that riverine landscape pattern can strongly influence trophic dynamics of riparian arthropods. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Ecophysiology of riparian cottonwood and willow before, during, and after two years of soil water removal
PY  - 2010
AB  - Riparian cottonwood/willow forest assemblages are highly valued in the southwestern United States for their wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and watershed protection. Yet these forests are under considerable threat from climate change impacts on water resources and land-use activities to support human enterprise. Stream diversions, groundwater pumping, and extended drought have resulted in the decline of cottonwood/willow forests along many riparian corridors in the Southwest and, in many cases, the replacement of these forests with less desirable invasive shrubs and trees. Nevertheless, ecophysiological responses of cottonwood and willow, along with associated ecohydrological feedbacks of soil water depletion, are not well understood. Ecophysiological processes of mature Fremont cottonwood and coyote willow stands were examined over four consecutive growing seasons (2004-2007) near Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The tree stands occurred near the inlet of a reservoir that was drained in the spring of 2005 and remained empty until mid-summer of 2006, effectively removing the primary water source for most of two growing seasons. Stem sap flux density (Js) in cottonwood was highly correlated with volumetric soil moisture (9) in the upper 60 cm and decreased sevenfold as soil moisture dropped from 12% to 7% after the reservoir was drained. Conversely, J s in willow was marginally correlated with 9 and decreased by only 25% during the same period. Opposite patterns emerged during the following growing season: willow had a lower whole-plant conductance (kt) in June and higher leaf carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) than cottonwood in August, whereas kt and δ13C were otherwise similar between species. Water relations in both species recovered quickly from soil water depletion, with the exception that sapwood area to stem area (As:Ast) was significantly lower in both species after the 2007 growing season compared to 2004. Results suggest that cottonwood has a greater sensitivity to interannual reductions in water availability, while willow is more sensitive to longer periods of soil water depletion. These data shed light on the linkage between soil water deficits and ecophysiological processes of threatened riparian forests given potential land-use and long-term drought impacts on freshwater resources. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Habitat associations and survey effort for shrubland birds in an urban pine barrens preserve
PY  - 2011
AB  - Inland pine barrens offer the rarest type of shrubland habitat in the northeastern United States and may contribute disproportionately to the regional diversity and conservation of shrubland birds. Testing local habitat specialization and estimating survey effort is needed to inform management of pine barrens for this rapidly declining avian group. We evaluated shrubland bird habitat associations in a heavily urbanized pine barrens of the northeastern United States, and used occupancy-detection sampling and analysis to estimate the number of sample points and surveys for point-based monitoring of shrubland birds in pine barrens. Although forest area was significantly greater than shrubland area, 8 of 11 reliably modeled species showed evidence of association for shrubland, and are thus potentially useful as indicators of pine barrens shrubland quality and management to avert succession. From the analysis of survey effort, we suggest two design options for point-based monitoring of shrubland birds in pine barrens: (1) include enough points to cover at least ∼3% of the study area and survey each point ≥5 times preferably during 05:00-08:00. hr, or (2) reduce the point sample, to no less than about 2% of study area, and increase the survey replication to ≥10 surveys. Three surveys, as suggested by shrubland bird experts for anthropogenic early-successional habitats (e.g., utility corridors) and by others as a general rule, may require too many sample points to feasibly monitor shrubland birds in pine barrens. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Feral honey bees in pine forest landscapes of east Texas
PY  - 2005
AB  - In 1990 the Africanized honey bee, a descendent of Apis mellifera scutellata, was identified in south Texas [Hunter, L.A., Jackman, J.A., Sugden, E.A., 1992. Detection records of Africanized honey bees in Texas during 1990, 1991 and 1992. Southwestern Entomol. 18, 79-89]. The potential impact of this immigrant on feral and managed colonies was the subject of considerable speculation. The goal of this study was to investigate the diversity of feral honey bee races in pine forest landscapes of east Texas, subsequent to immigration of A. m. scutellata. The specific objectives were (i) to assess the immigration of A. m. scutellata into east Texas pine forest landscapes and (ii) to evaluate the suitability of the pine forest landscape to feral honey bees. This mesoscale landscape study was conducted on the Sam Houston National Forest in east Texas. Swarm traps and aerial pitfall traps were used to monitor feral honey bees. Spatial databases were used to evaluate suitability of the pine forest landscape for honey bees. Scoring mitochondrial DNA type (mitotypes), we found representatives of A. mellifera scutellata, eastern European, western European, and A. mellifera lamarckii races in pine forest landscapes of east Texas. The conclusions that follow from this aspect of the investigation are (i) honey bees are a ubiquitous component of the pine forest landscape in east Texas, (ii) mitotype diversity persists subsequent to the immigration of A. m. scutellata, and (iii) A. m. scutellata is an added element of the mitotype diversity in the landscape. To evaluate quantitatively the suitability of the pine forest to feral honey bees, we used a spatial database for the study area and FRAGSTATS. The landscape structure in 1256 ha units surrounding six swarms of honey bees captured in the swarm traps was examined. The metrics used to characterize the kind, number, size, shape, and configuration of elements forming the landscape, defined a heterogeneous environment for honey bees that included sufficient food and habitat resources needed for survival, growth, and reproduction. The conclusions that follow from this aspect of the investigation are (1) although classified as a pine forest, management practices and other human activities have altered the landscape and thereby created food and habitat resources suitable for honey bees, (2) the forestry practices associated specifically with road corridor maintenance, stream side corridor protection, RCW management, and Wilderness Area management introduce structural heterogeneity to the forest landscape which enriches the diversity and abundance of early successional flowering plants and provides cavity sites needed by honey bees, (3) ranching, farming, and urbanization within the study area also create these conditions, and (4) based on inferences from melissopalynology, honey bees provide pollination services for a broad representation of native and introduced flowering plant species of the pineywoods ecoregion. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A flora of the Rock Hill Blackjacks Heritage Preserve, York county, South Carolina
PY  - 2002
AB  - The Rock Hill Blackjacks Heritage Preserve was recently established, partly within the city limits of Rock Hill, South Carolina. It showed evidence of moderate to severe human disturbance including the effects of agriculture, forestry, construction of utility rights-of-way, and abandoned roads. Despite its small size and obvious disturbance, the preserve supported over 400 species of vascular plants. The reasons for this unusual level of diversity are not entirely clear. Geology was one factor. The preserve is underlaid by the Rock Hill gabbro/metagabbro pluton. Thin soils and seasonally wet areas provided a mixture of wetland and dryland species. It contained six distinct plant communities: 1) Bottomland Forest, 2) Gabbro Glade, 3) Montmorillonite Forest/Woodland, 4), Old Field Grassland/Shrubland, 5) Old Field Woodland, and 6) a distinct Grassland/Shrubland in the utility rights-of-way. The greatest diversity, including many tall-grass prairie species, was in the utility corridors that crisscross the preserve.

TI  - Natural remnants and corridors in Greater Cape Town: their role in threatened plant conservation
PY  - 1991
AB  - Cape Town is situated in the Cape Floral Kingdom, one of the world's richest in plant diversity and endemism. The remaining lowland vegetation around Cape Town comprises mainly acid Sand Plain Fynbos and alkaline dune Strandveld. Remnants and corridors within the former have the greatest concentration of Red Data plant species in Southern Africa. Fynbos is more sensitive than Strandvelt to human-related impacts. The status of selected Red Data species' habitats in the two systems is discussed with reference to housing, alien vegetation, \"park-scaping', fire, stock-grazing, public ignorance and inappropriate planning decisions. -from Authors

TI  - Using ecological studies to understand the conservation needs of the squirrel glider in brisbane's urban forest-remnants
PY  - 2006
AB  - This paper provides an overview of our current ecological research on squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) living in forest-remnants within an urban matrix in south-east Queensland. We have conducted population censuses and behavioural observations primarily in one 60-ha remnant. The number of tagged gliders (minimum number known alive) in this remnant varied from 75 in 2002 when flowering trees were abundant, to 33 the following year when flowering was poor. Poor flowering led to a delay in breeding and a decline in the probability of glider survival. Feeding observations on gliders in the year of abundant flowering revealed that almost 50% of the diet was comprised of nectar and pollen derived from 10 tree species. A more detailed focus on flowering and its influence on population dynamics at several sites would be of considerable value in understanding the population ecology of this species. We assessed the viability of the subpopulations of P. norfolcensis distributed across the various remnants to allow identification of management actions that may improve viability. Viability analyses under various scenarios suggest that our focal metapopulation will have a high likelihood of extinction within the next 100 years. Predictions of population viability are sensitive to changes in life history parameter estimates. Thus, current field-work has been directed by the need for more precise empirical values. The remnants containing our metapopulation need to be functionally linked to larger nearby remnants to enable glider dispersal among sites. We need a better understanding of glider dispersal behaviour and how permeable the urban matrix might be for P. norfolcensis. Arterial roads and freeways sever connections between many remnants, requiring novel approaches to corridor provision. Future research should examine how habitat quality of the remnants changes over time due to tree dieback and wind-throw. We are investigating the potential role of nest boxes to facilitate glider dispersal and to supplement the availability of den trees. The findings of our studies should contribute to a greater understanding of the general conservation requirements of P. norfolcensis.

TI  - Anthropogenic factors affecting wildlife species status outcomes: why the fixation on pesticides?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Most Americans are at least three generations removed from the farm, thereby at least three generations removed from the reality of where their food comes from. Not surprisingly, there are many misconceptions about modern food production, including the potential collateral environmental damage attributed to agriculture, particularly the application of pesticides. However, the implication of conventional agriculture in the broader narrative of wildlife species status outcomes (SSOs) lacks context and relativity. Since the dawn of civilization, humans have had a profound impact on their environment. Originating as hunter-gatherer societies, our ancient ancestors initially exploited anything that could be consumed or brought to bear. With the advent of the \"first proto-farmers,\" humans began manipulating their environments to maximize available resources. Urban centers propagated and flourished proximal to agricultural origins, where modern societies have been built primarily on an abundance of food. As societies \"developed,\" and continue to develop, an inevitable economic transition occurs from agriculture to industry/service predominance, culminating in a corresponding shift in land use. Developed countries have typically experienced maximal expansion of the agricultural frontier, where farmland is now steadily eroding by a proverbial flood of urban development. In contrast, in developing countries, this shift in economic development has not yet fully manifested and the agricultural footprint continues to expand at the expense of native habitats. Thus, the relative influence of \"agriculture\" on SSOs, in terms of land use, is primarily dependent on economic developmental status, which can be, at least in part, ameliorated via technology by increasing yield from existing land. Moreover, in addition to the land use challenge, there are multiple other factors affecting wildlife SSOs, including a figurative plague of invasive species, a literal plague of disease, a barrage of buildings, bumpers, grilles, and windshields to collide with, light pollution to confuse cues with, poachers to contend with, and even more complicated factors such as climate change. Being an easy target does not mean pesticides are the right target, and this fixation can potentially detract from public awareness regarding the primary drivers affecting SSOs as well as the opportunity to proactively address them. So, relatively speaking, how do these other factors compare to \"pesticides\" in terms of driving SSOs? Moreover, why is the popular media so fixated on the pesticide narrative? Based on the available evidence, this manuscript attempts to address these questions from a holistic and relative perspective within the context of land use change, economic development, population growth, and associated implications of global connectivity and commerce.

TI  - A framework for understanding change
PY  - 2009
AB  - The world is undergoing unprecedented changes in many of the factors that determine both its fundamental properties and their influence on society. Throughout human history, people have interacted with and shaped ecosystems for social and economic development (Turner et al. 1990, Redman 1999, Jackson 2001, Diamond 2005). During the last 50 years, however, human activities have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than at any comparable period of human history (Steffen et al. 2004, Foley et al. 2005, MEA 2005d; Plate 1). Earth's climate, for example, is now warmer than at any time in the last 500 (and probably the last 1,300) years (IPCC 2007a), in part because of atmospheric accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) released by the burning of fossil fuels (Fig. 1.1). Agricultural development largely accounts for the accumulation of other trace gases that contribute to climate warming (see Chapter 12). As human population increases, in part due to improved disease prevention, the increased demand for food and natural resources has led to an expansion of agriculture, forestry, and other human activities, causing large-scale land-cover change and loss of habitats and biological diversity. About half the world's population now lives in cities and depends on connections with rural areas worldwide for food, water, and waste processing (see Chapter 13; Plate 2). In addition, increased human mobility is spreading plants, animals, diseases, industrial products, and cultural perspectives more rapidly than ever before. This increase in global mobility, coupled with increased connectivity through global markets and new forms of communication, links the world's economies and cultures, so decisions in one place often have international consequences. © 2009 Springer-Verlag New York.

TI  - Designing a local-scale microsimulation of lesser grain borer population dynamics and movements
PY  - 2011
AB  - Many systems, including those studied in the agricultural sciences and biogeography, are inherently complex and require the use of many different spatial analysis and modeling techniques to understand underlying spatial patterns and processes. In this context, the methods encompassed by the term “geocomputation” represent a rapidly evolving, and increasingly effective, suite of tools to both analyze and visualize problems that cannot be addressed adequately with the use of standard aspatial or spatial statistics. Geocomputation methods include agent-based models, genetic algorithms, cellular automata, and neural networks. Agent-based models, in particular, are increasingly being used to examine a variety of questions involving spatiotemporal dynamics (e.g., changes in landuse/landcover, urban population growth) and the temporal paths of mobile entities (e.g., vehicular trafŽc analysis, pedestrian ¬ows, disease dispersal, animal movements). Presented here is the rationale behind, and instructions for, constructing a simple agentbased model that can be used to form or revise theory regarding the early season infestation of grain storage bins by a small (3-5 mm) beetle called the lesser grain borer (LGB) (Rhyzopertha dominica). LGB is a devastating, long-lived pest of stored cereal grains worldwide and the most damaging pest of stored wheat in the United States. Extending our understanding of LGB populations to include an explicit spatial component via agentbased simulation provides an opportunity to better evaluate the connectivity of grain storage bins on neighboring farms and more fully appreciate the role of landuse, landcover, and landscape conŽguration in shaping insect source-sink dynamics. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Restricted human activities shift the foraging strategies of feral pigeons (Columba livia) and three other commensal bird species
PY  - 2021
AB  - Invasive species are a growing concern with increasing global connectivity. Feral pigeons (Columba livia) are widespread and invasive, thus their effective control is of keen international interest. The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the impact of a nation-wide Circuit Breaker (restricted human activities) in Singapore on first, the abundance of the feral pigeons and three urban commensals—the Javan myna (Acridotheres javanicus), common myna (A. tristis), and house crow (Corvus splendens) in different food source types; and second, the activity budgets of feral pigeons. A significant and progressive decline in feral pigeon abundance was observed in open food centres and feeding hotspots after the Circuit Breaker was implemented. While the house crow and common myna were less affected, the Javan myna abundance increased moderately at refuse collection centres during the Circuit Breaker and decreased significantly in green spaces after the Circuit Breaker. Changes in food abundance could also predict changes in feral pigeon abundance and its effect was greatest in feeding hotspots. A greater proportion of feral pigeons was observed foraging and moving with a smaller proportion seen resting with probable consequences on their reproductive capacity. Our study also cautions against drawing inferences on biological responses due to similar social restrictions without careful consideration of other ecological factors, like average flock size and time of the day, which also affected the proportion of pigeons foraging on natural versus anthropogenic food. In summary, our results advocate a food limitation approach to control the feral pigeon populations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The evolution of Greenways in China
PY  - 2006
AB  - This paper focuses on the evolution of Greenway planning and implementation in China, and provides a historical context to the Greenway concept. It was found that:(1)Although the concept of Greenway was an adaptation from the Western World, the Chinese have a history of more than 2000 years of Greenway planning and implementation. Chinese Greenways have been called various names and were planned for various reasons.(2)The long history of Greenway planning and implementation in China was mainly a \"top-down\" approach, which, while very effective under a centralized administrative system, often lacked a scientific basis and significant public participation.(3)The functions of the Greenways were mainly protection and productive, with little concern for human uses such recreational uses of cycling and hiking. Greenways in China are discussed chronologically and in three categories:(1)Riparian Greenways run along rivers, streams and water channels. The history of these Greenways dates more than 2000 years, since a time when trees were grown along canals and city moats. They have in modern times evolved into a network of drainage channels.(2)Greenways along transportation corridors. These Greenways run parallel to state and provincial highways, railroads, country roads and urban streets and evolved from tree plantings along highways. Used exclusively by emperors, the green corridor networks have been systematically planned and constructed at a national scale and directly organized by the central government.(3)Greenways along farmland for wind protection. These plantings evolved from individual segments of windbreak rows to a network of protective windbreaks and the large, regional scale \"Green Great Wall\" project running along the northern edge of China. As Greenways have evolved in China, they reflect changes in ideology, utilization and scale; from protection of production or beautification to ecological and multiple uses, and from small-scale fragments to a systematic regional and national network. The occurrence of disasters, the involvement of state leaders and the influence of science played an important role in the evolution of Greenways in China. The paper also argues that:•the traditional top-down approach in Greenway planning and implement should be integrated with scientifically based methods;•recreational uses should be considered and integrated into existing and planned Greenways;•the recently invoked \"city beautiful\", or cosmetic approach to Greenway planning and implementation should be stopped; and•Greenways should be planned as an critical strategic element of ecological infrastructure at both the regional and urban scale during current rapid and extensive urbanization occurring in China. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - West Nile virus in California
PY  - 2004
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) was first isolated in California during July 2003 from a pool of Culex tarsalis collected near El Centro, Imperial County. WNV transmission then increased and spread in Imperial and Coachella Valleys, where it was tracked by isolation from pools of Cx. tarsalis, seroconversions in sentinel chickens, and seroprevalence in free-ranging birds. WNV then dispersed to the city of Riverside, Riverside County, and to the Whittier Dam area of Los Angeles County, where it was detected in dead birds and pools of Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus. By October, WNV was detected in dead birds collected from riparian corridors in Los Angeles, west to Long Beach, and through inland valleys south from Riverside to San Diego County. WNV was reported concurrently from Arizona in mid-August, and from Baja, Mexico, in mid-November. Possible mechanisms for virus introduction, amplification, and dispersal are discussed.

TI  - Ecological restoration of coastal sage scrub and its potential role in habitat conservation plans
PY  - 2000
AB  - Extensive acreage loss of coastal sage scrub (CSS), isolation of surviving stands, and the federal listing of several animal species with obligate relationships to this plant community, particularly the threatened California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica), have led to attempts to create CSS to mitigate habitat lost to urban development and other causes. Many of these creations lie within habitat conservation plan (HCP) sites, and they could play a more prominent role by being repositories for plants taken from a single site having site-specific genetics. Among others, one technique that increases initial resemblance to natural stands uses digitized, to-scale photography, which has been ground-truthed to verify vascular plant associations, which appear as mosaics on a landscape. A combination of placing patches of salvaged, mature canopy plants within larger matrices of imprinted or container plant plots appears to significantly enhance immediate use by CSS obligate bird species, accelerate 'spread' or expansion of CSS, and can also introduce many epiphytic taxa that otherwise would be slow or unable to occupy developing CSS creations. Reptile, amphibian, butterfly, and rodent diversity in a salvaged canopy restoration case study at the University of California, Irvine, showed CSS species foraging and inhabiting transplanted canopy patches. Using restoration techniques to expand existing CSS stands has more promise than creating isolated patches, and the creation of canopies resembling CSS mid-fire cycle stands is now common. Gnatcatchers and other birds use restorations for foraging and occasional nesting, and in some cases created stands along 'biological corridors' appear to be useful to bird movement. Patches of transplanted sage scrub shrubs along habitat edges appear to break up linear edge effects. There are no data on which long-term survival, succession, or postfire behavior can be predicted for CSS restoration sites and postfire community changes are not part of either mitigation or restoration planning at present. Long-term planning including burning is needed so that a fire-adapted habitat will develop. Restoration is important in retaining genetic resources, for ameliorating edge effects, as habitat extenders in buffer zones around HCP sites, and by providing areas into which natural stands can expand. Extensive acreage loss of coastal sage scrub (CSS), isolation of surviving stands, and the federal listing of several animal species with obligate relationships to this plant community, have led to attempts to create CSS to mitigate habitat lost to urban development and other causes. Many of these creations lie within habitat conservation plan (HCP) sites, and they could play a more prominent role by repositories for plants taken from a single site having site-specific genetics. Using restoration techniques to expand existing CSS stands has more promise than creating isolated patches, and the creation of canopies resembling CSS mid-fire cycle stands is now common.

TI  - The great capricorn beetle Cerambyx cerdo L. in south-western Poland-the current state and perspectives of conservation in one of the recent distribution centres in Central Europe
PY  - 2017
AB  - Presence-only models can aid conservation and management of threatened, elusive species. A MaxEnt model has been developed for the great capricorn beetle (Cerambyx cerdo L., 1758) in south-western Poland and the variables identified best explaining the species' occurrence on a large scale. Once successfully validated, the model was used to (a) illustrate the expected location of the species' habitats in the region and in existing Natura 2000 sites (SACs) in S-W Poland and (b) assess the efficacy of the regional network of national protected areas (NPAs) versus Natura 2000 (SACs). Overall, information was gathered on 1025 localities of C. cerdo L., 1758 in Lower Silesia. All the records came from the pedunculate oak Quercus robur L., 1753. The occurrence of the great capricorn beetle in the study region is limited mainly to its eastern part, with a marked concentration in the valleys of the rivers Odra, Barycz and Bystrzyca. The kernel density estimation analysis also showed the high concentration of occupied trees in the north-western part of the region, clearly isolated from the above-mentioned main populations. Although a considerable part of the localities in the study region (74.2%) occurred within protected areas (PAs), their contribution to the species' conservation varied between the PAs groups. Natura 2000 SACs are the most important PAs, covering more than 30% of the predicted area of suitable habitats in the region and more than 45% of optimal habitats. In total, 384 localities of C. cerdo L., 1758 were found within the cities, most of them (n = 356) in the city of Wroclaw. Forty three percent (43%) of the urban localities of the species (n = 165) in the study region are protected within the regional network of protected areas (OPAs), while those unprotected are mainly concentrated in the city of Wroclaw (n = 207). Wroclaw also includes 17.1% of the area of suitable habitats and 29% optimal habitats of the species in the region outside the protected area network. To preserve C. cerdo L., 1758, forest corridors should be created or restored to bridge the otherwise impermeable gaps revealed by the authors' model and grant protection to the still largely unprotected area of the Lower Silesian territory. The species conservation programme in the region requires the cooperation of various authorities, not only those dealing with nature conservation, but also local governments, state forest management and flood protection authorities.

TI  - Globalization and the evolving port landscape of Progreso
PY  - 2008
AB  - In the contemporary era of globalization, as in earlier defining periods of capitalism, flows of money and goods are igniting dramatic changes in the local geographies of the regions and cities involved. Although the \"command functions\" of the new global economy are largely centered in the \"world cities\" of the more economically advanced core, localities throughout the global periphery and semi- periphery, including such places as the Mexican state of Yucatán and its port city of Progreso, participate in progressively stronger ways in the system, albeit from a position of relative dependence (Sassen 1994; Friedmann 1995, 21). As such, these secondary localities are increasingly reaching outward to forge economic links beyond their national boundaries, resulting in more complex connections between them and distant points of the world economic network (Amin 1995, 1-34; Knox and Agnew 1998, 259-91; Simon 1995, 133). Decreased regulation of trade and reduced restrictions on foreign direct investment are two facets of liberalization that have strongly shaped the contemporary global economy during the past three decades, thus prompting statesmen, scholars, and the media to recognize an emergent global economy, replacing the traditional international economy (Amin and Malmberg 1995; Martin 1994). In this scenario, transportation linkages, including maritime ports, foster changing inter- urban and urban- hinterland relationships. As Keeling (1995, 125-26) notes, a given set of transportation linkages of a given city can make that city more poorly connected to its own country, and increasingly linked to foreign localities. The port of Progreso, thirty- two kilometers due north of Mérida, was opened in 1870 as an alternative to the somewhat remote port settlement of Sisal, fifty kilometers northwest of Mérida. Sisal's shore was too shallow to accommodate the larger ships transporting henequen fiber abroad, and the port was difficult to access from Mérida during the rainy season (Yucatán 1988, 304; Meyer- Arendt 2001). Progreso was in pre- Columbian times a Maya fishing village and a site of salt production, part of the province of Cehpech ( Meyer- Arendt 1991). Today the city occupies a depositional barrier just offshore from the limestone shield that composes the Yucatán Peninsula, and it is separated from the mainland by a shallow, mangrove- lined lagoon ( Meyer- Arendt 2001). Given the shallow shoreline of the entire northern Yucatecan coast, Progreso has always faced logistical shipping difficulties. However, its proximity to Mérida and the periodic dynamism of the northern Yucatecan economy have made it the peninsula's primary site of maritime trade. As noted throughout this volume, the cultural and social effects of globalization in Yucatán are considerable, as the region's character is shaped largely by influences emanating from distant locations. This chapter focuses on the changing nature of imports and exports handled by the port of Progreso in recent decades, the corresponding evolution of the physical infrastructure, and the transformation of activities in the port's hinterland, as reflected in the region's human landscape. Quite simply, it argues that the port's morphology, or physical- spatial form, serves as a gauge of the changing nature of northern Yucatán's involvement in the global economy. While Progreso is arguably a dependent locality whose fortunes are linked to the fate of activities in its hinterland, it clearly is also a catalyst for Yucatán's stronger ties to the global economy. Progreso's hinterland has witnessed the recent appearance of export- oriented assembly plants, particularly in Mérida and along the emerging Progreso- Mérida manufacturing corridor, and a gradual transformation of its agricultural landscape from henequen, historically the state's primary export product, to one emphasizing a more diverse product base that includes meat production for domestic markets and specialty agricultural and seafood products for export. I trace the expansion of the port in four distinct phases since the 1870s, each corresponding to changes in northern Yucatán's external relations. Such an analysis is intended not only to shed light on the effects of globalization on northern Yucatán but also to offer suggestions for updating traditional geographic approaches to the study of developing countries' ports and their hinterlands, given the rapid transformations to localities that globalization brings about. The Yucatecan case study of port evolution and port- hinterland geography is an appropriate one for illustrating the dynamic and distinct nature of geographic change in a single locality of the global periphery, as well as how such transformations are linked to the different localities' dependent development. It also is appropriate for examining Mexico's changing geography of ports and shipping, characterized by increased volumes of imports and exports in the era of global trade deregulation, the enlargement of trading blocs, and the expansion of telecommunications into the realms of production and consumption in the country since the late twentieth century (Posadas Hernández and Martínez Luna 1999, 169-70). Moreover, this case study is one indication that there is no universal pattern of geographic change in the relationship of port and hinterland. Much can be learned from individual case studies of port cities of the global periphery. Following a brief overview of contemporary literature relevant to porthinterland geography in the global periphery, this chapter outlines the phases of Progreso's port development and the external linkages of the state that underlie each phase. First, as the Golden Age of henequen created a wellentrenched and affluent local elite in Yucatán in the late 1800s, the port was created. Second, during World War II there was a temporary recovery in henequen exports owing to disruptions in much of the world's fiber supplies; Mexican authorities therefore carried out an expansion of the port to accommodate larger ships with the hopes of attracting more of them. Third, when Mérida's industrialization expanded in the aftermath of the global oil shock of the 1970s, local businessmen and politicians optimistic about Yucatán's future maneuvered for another port expansion to handle ever- larger shipments. Fourth, in the era of maturing globalization, the Yucatecan strategy of luring foreign direct investment in manufacturing, diversifying agriculture away from traditional henequen, and attracting tourism resulted in the most recent port expansion to accommodate containerization, huge increases in grain shipments, and cruise ships to the state of Yucatán. © 2008 by University of Alabama Press.

TI  - Distribution of bird diversity in a vulnerable neotropical landscape
PY  - 2004
AB  - Recent withdrawal of the U.S. military from the Republic of Panama has exposed 64,000 ha of lowland forest in the former Canal Zone to possible development. The forests form a 16-km-wide strip reaching 65 km from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean and function as the water supply for the canal and as home to one of the world's richest terrestrial biotas. We present an overview of the distribution of bird diversity in the forests of the canal area based on 10 years of inventories. A total of 498 terrestrial species has been recorded, of which 177 occur only in lowland forests. More species reside in Caribbean- than in Pacific-slope forests and in the largest forest tracts. The Panamanian government, recognizing the importance of the forests for protection of biodiversity and for proper functioning of the canal, has created two national parks and a national monument in the canal area. One large park, Soberania National Park, currently contains 92% of the region's forest-dwelling species. Two large tracts on the Caribbean coast, the Achiote Road forest and the Fort Sherwan forest, are not designated as national parks but are recognized as important forest areas. Those two forests harbor species found nowhere else in the canal corridor. Extensive fragmentation, disconnection of forested corridors between foothills and lowlands, and anthropogenic degradation of forests near towns have altered regional bird-community dynamics. Some dynamics occur on large spatial scales, such as the poorly understood movements of elevational and transisthmian migrants. Long-term maintenance of bird species diversity in the canal area will require preservation of the large forest tracts and reestablishment of a forested connection from the canal corridor lowlands to the Chagres lowlands and foothills in the east. Such conservation activities will be challenging to execute given the region's growing human population and desires for a stronger national economy. We recommend protection of remaining forests and active enforcement of protection laws to reduce hunting and further intrusions.

TI  - Alterations in use of space, air quality, temperature and humidity by the presence of vertical greenery system in a building corridor
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban greenery is valued not only for its aesthetic value but also for environmental services and the overall health benefits that follows. A large portion of the world population now resides in built environments, and there is growing need to provide a conducive and healthy environment for the dwellers. Vertical greenery systems (VGS) provide greenery opportunities in cities even when there is limited land space especially as recent technology enables people to grow plants outdoors as well as indoors. Indoor vertical greenery (iVGS) was installed to monitor any alteration in the temperature, humidity, particulate matter and use of space. The present study used an actual environment, included paralled corridors in the same building. The movement in both corridors were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) correlated and post green wall establishment data showed the relationship changed significantly (r2 = 0.8748, P &lt; 0.0001, RMSE = 23.4521) with relatively more people using the corridor after the iVGS installed. Significant difference was seen in the humidity levels but not in the temperature after the installation. Particulate matter levels dropped 48.5%, 82.6%, 5.5% (PM2.5, PM10,&gt;PM10 respectively) in the corridor with iVGS by the end of the data collection. These findings suggest larger green coverage would have a greater positive impact on the environmental conditions of an indoor environment. © 2018

TI  - Neighbourhood traffic management
PY  - 2006
AB  - Neighbourhood traffic management issues have received considerable attention in the last decade, dealing with concerns over vehicle speeds, volumes, level of truck activity, pedestrian and cyclist accommodation and safety, and street aesthetics. Generally, the focus has been on local residential streets; however, collector streets have also been examined in some cases. This paper will review a number of neighbourhood review projects, including: • A local street in Winnipeg, MB along the Red River that was the subject of a corridor enhancement focussing on upgrades to the pedestrian and cyclist environment along the street and improved access to the Red River. The study looked at traffic circles, bulb outs, and raised crosswalks. After initial public support the project was stopped due to a change of heart among some residents who were directly impacted by the measures. • A collector street in Fargo, ND that was reviewed following intense neighbourhood lobbying to the Mayor and City Commission following the street being extended under I-29 to connect to a street adjacent to a regional shopping centre. Area residents were concerned about increased volumes and speeds, and difficulty in exiting from local streets onto the collector. The study looked at traffic management measures that did not involve vertical deflection. Initially supported by City Commission, a strong grass roots movement by area residents significantly modified the recommended plan. • A neighbourhood review in Saskatoon, SK was requested due to the proposed closure of a portion of a collector street by the City to expand the City's water plant. The street served as an important link to the downtown area and neighbourhood residents were concerned that traffic would divert to the local streets. The study examined both \"carrot and stick\" approaches to encourage commuters to stay on the major road system.

TI  - Urban impacts on tropical island streams: Some key aspects influencing ecosystem response
PY  - 2012
AB  - Improving our understanding of the impacts of urbanization on tropical island streams is critical as urbanization becomes a dominant feature in tropical areas. Although the \"urban stream syndrome\" has been successful in summarizing urban impacts on streams, the response of some island streams is different to that expected. Here we review available information on urban impacts to tropical island streams and describe unique responses to urbanization. We identified three key aspects that play particularly important or unique roles in determining tropical-island stream integrity: biotic response to water pollution, movement barriers along the stream network, and altered geomorphology that results in habitat loss. As expected, water pollution negatively impacts stream ecosystems in tropical islands and in some regions impacts can be severe, as untreated wastewaters are directly discharged into streams. While aquatic insects show the expected responses to pollution, other native fauna (e. g., shrimps and fishes) appear to be less impacted by moderate levels of pollution. Movement barriers along the stream network are especially important as much of the tropical island fauna have diadromous (either amphidromous or catadromous) life histories. Most native freshwater mollusks, shrimps, and fishes inhabiting tropical islands are diadromous and depend on unimpeded connections between freshwater and marine environments to complete their life cycles. The presence of these species in urban streams is best explained by longitudinal connectivity rather than by the degree of urban impact. Finally, in streams that remain connected to marine environments, the presence of native shrimps and fishes is strongly related to the physical habitat. Fish assemblages in channelized and severely altered stream reaches are almost completely devoid of native fauna and tend to be dominated by non-native species. In contrast, relatively diverse shrimp and fish assemblages can be found in reaches that retain their physical habitat complexity, even when they are impacted by urbanization. Our understanding of urban impacts on tropical island streams remains limited. However, the identification of key aspects can help us better understand urban impacts on streams in tropical islands, and best focus our management and research efforts to protect these unique ecosystems. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Article eye-level street greenery and walking behaviors of older adults
PY  - 2020
AB  - Evidence suggests that built environment characteristics affect older adults’ travel activity behaviors, e.g., walking and cycling, which have well-established health benefits. However, the relationship between urban greenery and walking behaviors remains unclear, partly due to methodological limitation. Previous studies often measured urban greenery from a bird’s eye perspective, which may mismatch with the pedestrian’s perception from the street. In this study, we measured greenery view index from eye-level streetscape photos retrieved from Baidu Street View, an online mapping service provider. Walking behaviors of 180 older adults in six neighborhoods were collected from questionnaires. We also measured land use diversity, pedestrian-oriented design (street connectivity), and population density—the three Ds of the built environment. Results show that street greenery view index contributes to walking time of older adults, suggesting street greenery should be taken into design consideration to promote walking behaviors of older adults.

AB  - We investigated patterns of moth occurrence among habitats in two different landscapes surrounding roosts of the endangered Ozark big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) from May to August 2005, and compared these data with published results on the diet of this subspecies. Landscapes were situated in the Ozark Mountains, USA, and consisted of a fragmented, agricultural landscape and a contiguous national forest. We captured 8720 moths constituting ≥314 species and 22 families. Pastures demonstrated a lower abundance and richness of moths than other habitats in the fragmented landscape (p < 0.05). Neither abundance nor richness of moths varied by habitat in the forested landscape, but we did observe variation among roost locations (p < 0.05). Abundant families of moths (n ≥ 100 specimens captured) did vary in abundance among habitats in both landscapes (p < 0.05), with poletimber stands, riparian forest and upland forest selected, and pasture, forest edge, sawtimber and sapling stands avoided by at least one family of moths. Density and richness of woody plant species were correlated with the occurrence of moths at sampling sites. We recommend maintaining habitat heterogeneity around roosts of the Ozark big-eared bat to encourage an abundance and richness of moth prey, and suggest that forested riparian corridors are important habitat elements for Ozark big-eared bats foraging in fragmented landscapes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Urbanization and the loss of prime farmland: a case study in the Calgary–Edmonton corridor of Alberta
PY  - 2015
AB  - Rapid urban expansion is a major contributor to environmental change in many parts of the world. This study investigated land cover changes that occurred between 1988 and 2010 in the Calgary–Edmonton corridor in Alberta, a region that has undergone considerable recent urban expansion. We used satellite imagery to develop land cover maps for four different snapshots in time between 1988 and 2010 and used these maps to investigate two principal questions related to urban expansion: (1) How did urban expansion affect other land cover types? and (2) How did urban expansion affect the availability of high-quality agricultural land in the region? Our results show that 60 % of new urban and peri-urban growth between 1988 and 2010 occurred on agricultural land. Nevertheless, total agricultural land increased in the region because of the greater clearing of natural vegetation for agriculture away from the urban core. Urban expansion predominantly occurred on soils that were highly suitable for farming, while new agricultural expansion occurred on soils of poorer quality. As a result, the average soil quality of land used for agriculture has declined in the Calgary–Edmonton corridor, confirming other studies of the food security implications of urbanization.

TI  - Influence of Urban Agglomeration Expansion on Fragmentation of Green Space: A Case Study of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Loss of green space habitats and landscape fragmentation are important reasons for the decline in environmental quality, degradation of ecosystem functions, and decline in biodiversity. Quantifying the spatio-temporal characteristics of landscape fragmentation of green space and its relationship with urban expansion mode is an important basis for improving urban development mode and enhancing urban ecological functions. For this paper, we took the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration as the research object, a typical rapidly urbanizing area. Through multi-scale landscape pattern analysis and statistical analysis, the spatial–temporal evolution characteristics of green space fragmentation in the BTH urban agglomeration from 2000 to 2020 and the influence of urban expansion were analyzed, and the land-use situation in 2030 was predicted by the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. The main conclusions are as follows: The BTH urban agglomeration has developed rapidly in the last 20 years, showing the characteristics of diffusion and corridor development. The intensity and pattern of urban expansion have significantly affected the pattern of green space, leading to the intensification of domestic green space fragmentation. Among them, urban expansion exerts most severe effects on the fragmentation of farmland, followed by grassland and water. The influence of urban expansion on the scale and fragmentation of forestland is limited. The forecast results in 2030 show that built-up areas may continue to occupy green space. The rate of occupation of farmland will slow down while that of grassland will intensify.</jats:p>

TI  - Analysing Process and Probability of Built-Up Expansion Using Machine Learning and Fuzzy Logic in English Bazar, West Bengal
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The study sought to investigate the process of built-up expansion and the probability of built-up expansion in the English Bazar Block of West Bengal, India, using multitemporal Landsat satellite images and an integrated machine learning algorithm and fuzzy logic model. The land use and land cover (LULC) classification were prepared using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for 2001, 2011, and 2021. The landscape fragmentation technique using the landscape fragmentation tool (extension for ArcGIS software) and frequency approach were proposed to model the process of built-up expansion. To create the built-up expansion probability model, the dominance, diversity, and connectivity index of the built-up areas for each year were created and then integrated with fuzzy logic. The results showed that, during 2001–2021, the built-up areas increased by 21.67%, while vegetation and water bodies decreased by 9.28 and 4.63%, respectively. The accuracy of the LULC maps for 2001, 2011, and 2021 was 90.05, 93.67, and 96.24%, respectively. According to the built-up expansion model, 9.62% of the new built-up areas was created in recent decades. The built-up expansion probability model predicted that 21.46% of regions would be converted into built-up areas. This study will assist decision-makers in proposing management strategies for systematic urban growth that do not damage the environment.</jats:p>

TI  - Introduction and establishment of raccoon rabies on islands: Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA as a case study
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract:  The introduction of rabies virus (RABV) to barrier islands, which are often popular tourist destinations with resource-rich habitats and connectivity and proximity to the mainland, is especially concerning because it can easily become endemic due to factors like dense rabies-vector populations (e.g., raccoons [Procyon lotor]), high inter- and intraspecies contact rates, and anthropogenic activities such as supplemental feeding of feral cats (Felis catus). In January 2013, a neurologic raccoon found on the Jekyll Island (JI), Georgia, US causeway tested positive for rabies. Mortality investigations of 29 raccoons have been conducted between December 2012–May 2017. The two most common diagnoses were RABV (n=11) and canine distemper virus (CDV; n=8). Parvoviral enteritis was diagnosed in four raccoons but no coinfections were diagnosed. There was no apparent seasonality for rabies cases, but all CDV cases occurred in spring-fall. Most (64%) rabies submissions came from residential or recreational ...

TI  - Source-sink dynamics of Florida Key deer on Big Pine Key, Florida
PY  - 2004
AB  - The endangered Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) is endemic to the Florida Keys, Florida, USA, with Big Pine Key (BPK) supporting most (approx 60%) of the population. Habitat loss and fragmentation have altered the amount of available habitat, creating areas of varying suitability; north BPK (NBPK) is believed to contain more optimal habitat than south BPK (SBPK), which is more developed and fragmented. We evaluated the source-sink dynamics of Key deer using a sex- and stage-structured, stochastic matrix model. Model results indi-cated that the NBPK population of Key deer was increasing (λ = 1.02), whereas the SBPK population was decreasing (λ = 0.87). Without dispersal from the north, the SBPK population has a 97% probability of falling below 25 individuals (quasi-extinction threshold) in the next 20 years. The higher risk to Key deer in SBPK can be explained by relative habitat-quality differences between the 2 areas. House density, amount of roads, number offences, and amount of development were all greater in SBPK. Collectively, study results indicate that SBPK can be described as an ecological sink with a nonviable population supplemented by deer dispersal from NBPK (source). Care should be taken to preserve the source population and its habitat. Thus, we propose limiting future development in NBPK (high-quality source habitat). The US 1 highway corridor project has the potential to decrease Key deer mortality due to vehicle collisions, and we recommend that future management goals continue to address mortality factors on SBPK (low-quality sink habitat).

TI  - Effects of Human Disturbance on Riparian Wetland Landscape Pattern in a Coastal Region
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The wetland ecosystem along a river in a coastal region has great significance in purifying water bodies, regulating climate, and providing habitat for animals and plants. Studying the effects of human disturbances on the landscape patterns of wetlands is of great significance to the protection and management of an ecosystem. This study used Guannan County and Guanyun County, two counties in China that are located on both banks of the Xinyi River as the study area. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the landscape pattern evolution of wetlands and their relationship with human interference from 2009 to 2020 were analyzed by the landscape dynamic rate, landscape conversion matrix, landscape indices, human disturbance index, and the quadratic regression equation. The results showed that: (1) Except for the increase in the area of beach and paddy fields, the area of other landscape types decreased; (2) the changes in wetlands were heterogeneous and showed different trends in different regions; (3) the boundary shape’s complexity and the landscape pattern’s fragmentation showed a decreasing–increasing trend and the connectivity and the diversity of the landscape decreased; and (4) the human disturbance index increased from 2009 to 2014 and then decreased from 2014 to 2020, declining outward from the places where towns and construction land aggregated. Moreover, there was an inverted U-type relationship with the landscape pattern indices. The findings provide direct, specific, and explicit information and theoretical guidance for the protection of wetlands along the river in the coastal region as well as for the restoration of wetland ecosystem function and the improvement of wetland biodiversity in relevant regions.</jats:p>

TI  - Habitat associations of gopher tortoise burrows on industrial timberlands
PY  - 2004
AB  - The western population of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1987 due to extensive population declines. Declines have been linked to site conversion of native pine (Pinus spp.) forests for urban development, agriculture, and commercial forest management. We conducted surveys to detect tortoise burrows on corporate timberlands in southern Mississippi and southwestern Alabama during summer 1994. We surveyed 2,759 0.5-ha strip transects on soil types of 9 different suitability categories for gopher tortoises. We found 460 active and 264 abandoned burrows on the 1,380 ha surveyed. Edaphic and vegetative conditions, such as sandy soils and total and midstory canopy coverage, influenced gopher tortoise occurrence. Logistic regression analyses revealed that active burrow occurrence was related positively to deep, sandy soils and related negatively to total canopy closure and fine loam soils with limited sand content. Abandoned burrow occurrence was related positively to increasing midstory canopy closure and selected soil types. Sandy soils and open overstory canopy that created favorable burrowing, nesting, and foraging conditions were important influences in active burrow occurrence. Vegetation management techniques, such as prescribed fire, midstory control, and intermediate forest stand thinning, are recommended on gopher tortoise conservation areas and connective corridor habitats on commercial timberlands. We theorize that restoration of longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests on sandy ridges can produce desirable core habitats and dispersal corridors for gopher tortoises in landscapes dominated by intensively managed pine plantations.

TI  - Comparison of function of created wetlands of two age classes in central Pennsylvania
PY  - 2009
AB  - Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) functional assessment models were used to assess whether function in created wetlands of two ages (1 year old and >12 years old) was equivalent to that of natural (reference) mainstem floodplain wetlands. Reference wetlands scored higher than both created age classes for providing energy dissipation and short-term surface water storage. Reference wetlands scored higher in maintaining native plant community and structure than 1-year-old sites, and 12-year-old wetlands scored higher than reference sites for providing vertebrate habitat structure. Analysis of individual model variables showed that reference wetlands had greater vegetative biomass and higher soil organic matter content than both created wetland age classes. Created wetlands were farther from natural wetlands and had smaller mean forest patch sizes within a 1-km-radius circle around the site than did the reference sites, indicating less hydrologic connectivity. Created wetlands also had less microtopographic variation than reference wetlands. The 1-year-old created sites were placed in landscape settings with greater land use diversity and road density than reference sites. The 12-year-old sites had a higher gradient and a higher percentage of their surrounding area in urban land use. These results show that the created wetlands were significantly structurally different (if not functionally so) from reference wetlands even after 12 years. The most profound differences were in hydrology and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. More attention needs to be focused on placing created wetlands in appropriate settings to encourage proper hydrodynamics, eliminate habitat fragmentation, and minimize the effects of stressors to the site. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

PY  - 2008
AB  - The common asparagus beetle, Crioceris asparagi (Linnaeus) and the twelve-spotted asparagus beetle, Crioceris duodecimpunctata (Linnaeus) are introduced Palearctic leaf beetles that feed exclusively on asparagus. The introduction history of these species in North America is reviewed and their dispersal to and distribution in the Maritime Provinces of Canada are described. Both species were first reported in Canada in 1899 in asparagus production areas in Queenston, Ontario, and other parts of the Niagara Peninsula where they caused serious crop damage. However, we discovered that both species were already found around Québec City 22 years earlier. Populations now established in the Maritime Provinces of Canada probably originated from southwestern Ontario where most commercial asparagus production in Canada began and now occurs. Crioceris asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata spread steadily throughout eastern Canada by adult flight dispersal abetted by wind, by the dissemination of seeds by birds, and by commercial movement of root crowns and spears of asparagus. Asparagus escaped from cultivation, growing along transportation corridors (such as railway tracks, power utility right-of-ways and roads) and in vacant lands, which facilitated the spread and establishment of C. asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata throughout North America. Now, both these adventive pest species occur wherever asparagus is grown. Both C. asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata are confirmed to occur in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, but not Newfoundland and Labrador. However, C. duodecimpunctata is newly recorded from Prince Edward Island. These introduced beetles are not regulated by Canada or by the U.S.A., and they are readily controlled at economically acceptable damage thresholds.

TI  - Motor vehicles as vectors of plant species from road verges in a suburban environment
PY  - 2006
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the potential contribution of car-borne flora to species dispersal in a suburban area in Flanders (Belgium). Therefore, motor vehicle-borne flora was evaluated monthly for a random sample of 20 cars between October 1988 and September 1989. At the end of the experiment 33 car-borne plant species, with a total of 690 seedlings were identified from mud, attached to these vehicles. There was considerable temporal variation in the mud mass attached to the vehicles and therefore also the size and composition of the vehicle-borne flora varied during the year. Because mud retention on cars is a crucial factor in seed dispersal, the number of emerging seedlings is negatively correlated with precipitation in the week preceding the sampling. The flora dispersed by vehicles consists mostly of species with small, light seeds and a persistent seed bank. Usually, they are pioneer species of nitrogen-rich habitats. The nature of the vehicle dispersed flora was compared with the local flora of road verges and differed significantly from this in, e.g., seed length, seed weight, ecological groups, Ellenberg indicator values for nitrogen supply, potential dispersal strategies and rarity. A larger resemblance with the flora of the zone immediately adjacent to the carriageway was found. We only found a low similarity to other motor vehicle-borne floras. © 2005 Gesellschaft für Ökologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Corridors linking populations have been identified as a potential tool to avoid negative effects of isolation, increasing population viability. Here, we performed a Brazil-wide evaluation of potential large scale corridors connecting protected jaguar populations. Six variables (human population size, dam reservoir size, number of dams, roads, railways and cities) expected to negatively impact jaguar movement were analyzed across 180 potential corridors connecting 298 protected jaguar areas. We established overall disturbance scores for the corridors using a principal components analysis and compared them among the Brazilian biomes. We further investigated which variables separated biomes using a canonical variates analysis. The Atlantic Forest and the semi-arid Caatinga have the most impacted potential corridors, whereas the Amazon and Pantanal still have the best potential corridors. Corridor quality in the Cerrado grasslands was intermediate. All variables but human population size and corridor length contributed significantly to differences in corridor variables among biomes. Our conclusions suggest that we need to plan the implementation of large scale corridors in the Amazon, Pantanal and particularly the Cerrado soon, while potential corridors might still be economically viable. In the much more impacted Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, the need for conservation actions is strongest, but logistical difficulties and costs may turn implementation of corridors unfeasible. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Conservation of forest cover in Mesoamerican biosphere reserves is associated with the increase of local non-farm occupation
PY  - 2022
AB  - • Protected areas do not reduce the fragmentation rate. • Protected areas do not promote forest regrowth. • High concentration of rural settlements promote forest loss. • Reserves in contexts with greater non-farm occupation endure lower forest loss. • Local non-farm economic activities may help to conserve forest cover in protected areas. Protected areas can prevent forest loss, but their effects on forest fragmentation and forest regrowth are poorly understood. Furthermore, the importance of protected areas in shaping these forest spatial changes may depend on different socioeconomic drivers (e.g. population size, distance to cities, proportion of local people working in non-farm occupation), but the empirical evidence on such dependence is very scarce. Here, we used contra factual technics to assess whether biosphere reserves (n = 19) in the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot can reduce forest loss and fragmentation and promote forest regrowth during the period 2000–2020. We used satellite imagery and governmental data to assess the socioeconomic factors driving these changes. Particularly, using multimodel inference analysis, we tested whether higher non-farm occupation, combined with low demographic pressures, reduces forest loss and fragmentation and promotes forest regrowth. We found that reserves reduce forest loss and preserve less-fragmented configurations, however, they neither reduce fragmentation rate nor promote forest regrowth. Forest loss rate inside the reserves decreased as non-farm occupation enhanced and the density of rural settlements decreased. Therefore, promoting higher opportunities in non-farm economic activities and planning rural settlements distribution around reserves could help to increase the effectiveness of reserves for forest conservation.

TI  - Air quality assessment in a highly industrialized area of Mexico: Concentrations and sources of volatile organic compounds
PY  - 2011
AB  - Parallel to the economical benefits brought by the oil industry in Mexico, there have been some negative environmental effects due to emission of pollutants to the atmosphere. Salamanca, a city located inside one of the most important industrial corridors of the country, has been frequently affected by elevated concentrations of sulfur dioxide and particle matter. However, little is known about volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which in this study are analyzed along with criteria pollutants and meteorological parameters during February-March 2003 at urban, suburban and rural sites. Although sulfur dioxide average levels were ∼0.017 ppm, a high concentration event (∼0.600 ppm), attributable to emissions from the oil refinery and the thermoelectric power plant, was observed at the urban site at night time. The VOCs concentration varied from 170 ± 50 ppbC (rural) to 699 ± 212 (urban) and were constituted by 40% alkanes, 13% aromatics, 11% olefins and 11% of halogenated. The most abundant species were propane (167 ± 40 ppbC), n-butane (91 ± 23 ppbC), toluene (51 ± 10 ppbC) and i-pentane (44 ± 7 ppbC), that are related to combustion processes. Freon-114, methyl bromide and 1,2-dichloroethane which are likely emitted by application of pesticides, soil fumigation and fabrication of chemicals, showed high concentrations (48 ± 10, 50 ± 10 and 32 ± 6 ppbC respectively) in the rural sites, highlighting the importance of control measurements implementation for these species, as they represent a potential hazard for public health. Moreover, these halocarbons showed similar ratios regardless the monitoring site, suggesting same source. Modeling results indicated that meteorological conditions generally transport air masses to the northeast rural areas where the highest concentrations of ozone were calculated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Forecasting the Effects of Land-Use Change on Forest Rodents in Indiana
PY  - 2009
AB  - Forest cover in the upper Wabash River basin in Indiana was fragmented due to agricultural conversion beginning more than 175 years ago. Currently, urban expansion is an important driver of land-use change in the basin. A land transformation model was applied to the basin to forecast land use from 2000 to 2020. We assessed the effect of this projected land-use change scenario on five forest rodent species at three scales: using occupancy models at the patch level, proportional occupancy models at the landscape level, and ecologically scaled landscape indices to assess the change in connectivity at the watershed level. At the patch and landscape scales, occupancy models had low predictability but suggest that gray squirrels are most susceptible to land-use change. At the watershed scale, declines in connectivity did not correspond with the decline of forest. This study highlights the importance of map resolution and consideration of matrix elements in constructing forecast models. Unforeseen drivers of land use, such as changing economic incentives, may also have important ramifications. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Tiger presence in a hitherto unsurveyed jungle of India-the Sathyamangalam forests
PY  - 2012
AB  - Tiger, being a solitary and territorial animal, often tends to move out of protected areas into the surrounding forests. This is especially true in the case of sub-adult animals leading to escalating conflicts and deaths in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Unless adequately protected against various human activities, such corridors and surrounding forests will soon disappear, trapping the animals within protected areas with resultant local extinctions. In this paper we ascertain tiger presence, occupancy and numbers in one such partially protected area, the Sathyamangalam forest, located close to better known tiger reserves in India, through non-invasive faecal DNA analysis. Here we highlight the potential of Sathyamangalam as a tiger habitat. Tiger positive faecal samples were considered as evidence to establish occupancy in two different parts of Sathyamangalam, reserve forest and wildlife sanctuary. We collected 103 faecal samples out of which 69 were tiger positive. Species occupancy (psi), was 0. 672 (±0. 197) with a detection probability of 0. 2 (±0. 06) in the wildlife sanctuary area; while psi was 0. 72 (±0. 2) with detection probability of 0. 212 (±0. 6) in the reserve forest. Further, number of males and females, as determined in our study, was close to the ideal sex ratio in a healthy forest with good prey abundance. This study also highlights the presence of more females in the reserve forest (n = 10) than the wildlife sanctuary (n = 3) possibly indicating lesser disturbance and more prey availability. We recommend that the reserve forest to the north of Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary be declared as a tiger reserve. The wildlife sanctuary could serve as a buffer zone between this reserve and Sathyamangalam town which lies to the south of the forest. Proper protection of Sathyamangalam will go a long way in saving the entire landscape and tigers of the Western Ghats of India. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Creation of a Downtown \"Main Street\" by reducing arterial travel lanes
PY  - 2007
AB  - During the update of the city's downtown master plan, Settlers Landing Road, a major east - west arterial street, was identified as being a barrier that separated the downtown from the waterfront. This street is a 35-mile per hour, 4-lane divided facility carrying 21,000 vpd with heavy pedestrian activity with six signalized intersections. This arterial street provides easy access to the interstate from the southwestern quadrant of the city as well as a cut-through route to by-pass frequent backups on the interstate system. In addition, lack of on-street parking was seen as obstacle to serving and attracting retail businesses in the downtown. The traffic engineering analysis conducted as part of the master plan concluded that Settlers Landing Road at its current width of four through lanes and traffic volumes had excess capacity. This excess capacity presented an opportunity to \"reclaim\" the road and narrow each direction of travel by one lane. It further recommended the installation of on-street parallel parking and bulb outs and street trees at street intersections that would further tame the street for pedestrians and cars alike. City staff had previously studied the reduction from 4 to 2-lanes and had concluded that it would most likely worsen traffic movements along the corridor The reduced lane configuration with on-street parking was tested and the field evaluation concluded that despite overwhelming negative feedback, it was technically feasible to permanently implement the 2-lane roadway concept with on-street parking however some peak hour congestion could be expected. Permanent installation is currently underway.

TI  - Northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge Hydrothermal Habitats: A Systematic Review of Knowledge Status for Environmental Management
PY  - 2021
AB  - Highly specialised biota occurring at hydrothermally active vents on the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (nMAR: from south of Iceland to the Equator) have been the subject of numerous research projects over the 36-year period since these habitats were first discovered in the region. When hydrothermal activity ceases, biota endemic to hydrothermally active habitats are lost, and a new biota colonise these sites. Little is known about the biota colonising hydrothermally inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR, although these sites may be the target of deep-sea mining within the next decade. In this review, we seek to clarify the current knowledge of biological communities colonising hydrothermally active habitats and inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR. To achieve this, we (1) used a systematic review process to update the species list of benthic invertebrates associated with hydrothermally active habitats, (2) conducted a regional biogeographic analysis of hydrothermally active vent fields on the nMAR, (3) undertook a comprehensive literature review to provide a descriptive account of biological communities, and (4) identified key knowledge gaps in the current understanding of nMAR hydrothermally active and inactive ecosystems. Our updated species list increases the number of benthic invertebrates recorded from hydrothermally active habitats on the nMAR to 158 taxa. Our regional biogeographic analysis separates nMAR hydrothermal vent fields into distinct clusters based on depth/latitude and chimney composition. Vent fields close to the Azores (Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike, Rainbow) formed a separate cluster from those at greater depths south of the Azores (Broken Spur, TAG, Snake Pit, Logatchev, and Ashadze-1). Moytirra, located north of the Azores, clustered separately, as did Lost City with its unique carbonate chimneys. We present detailed information on the biological communities at hydrothermally active and inactive habitats in this region, and discuss the information available on the diversity, ecosystem function, trophic relationships, connectivity, temporal variability, and resilience and recovery of these communities. Many knowledge gaps still exist, with detailed information needed on all aspects of the biological communities at hydrothermally active habitats and inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR to understand and predict impacts from natural and human-induced disturbances in the region. © Copyright © 2021 Boschen-Rose and Colaço.

TI  - Habitat use of juvenile fish in the lower Danube and the Danube Delta: Implications for ecotone connectivity
PY  - 2006
AB  - In the lower Danube and the Danube Delta the juvenile fish assemblage has been surveyed in August 2001. In the main channel of the Danube downstream of the town Galati (Romania) and in the Sfintu Gheorghe branch in the Danube Delta altogether 22 sites were sampled by beach seining and electrofishing respectively, covering nine mesohabitats. Altogether 109 beach seine samples and 318 electrofishing points were taken during daylight, to analyze the distribution and abundance of fish species and ecological guilds compared to regulated rivers, to derive conservation targets for the fish community of Central European rivers. A total of 22 412 fish was caught representing 42 species, five of them non-native. Bleak and monkey goby were most abundant and frequent, contributing together 61% to the total catch. The highest fish densities were observed in connected side waters, but substantial amounts of phytophils in the main channel and regular distributions of rheophils and lithophils between main channel and side waters indicated a high ecotone connectivity. Large woody debris was identified as most important habitat structure for riverine cyprinids, whilst its replacement by riprap favors gobiids. Accordingly, habitat alterations and embankments are prerequisites for gobiid fish to invade Central European rivers. River rehabilitation and mitigation measures should provide large woody debris as most important natural in-channel structure and improve the lateral connectivity of main channels to ecotone complexity beneficial for fish. © 2006 Springer.

PY  - 2009
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse) was first detected in New Jersey in 1995 during mosquito surveillance operations in Monmouth County. We tracked statewide changes in populations of the Asian tiger mosquito and its association with West Nile virus from 2003 to 2007. Ae. albopictus population abundance has increased in New Jersey since 2003, primarily along the urban corridor between New York City and Philadelphia, and they are now expanding their range further into suburban and rural areas of the state. Ae. albopictus has invaded all counties of New Jersey except for two northwest rural counties (Sussex and Warren). West Nile virus was detected in Ae. albopictus throughout several foci in New Jersey during the study, underscoring the public health significance of this mosquito. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.

TI  - Wetland and aquatic habitats
PY  - 1992
AB  - Riparian wetland areas often represent critical corridors for animal and plant dispersion in wildland watersheds and downstream river systems. It is essential that integrated management of riparian wetland areas be developed to reverse the loss of biological diversity. Agricultural and urban uses, and related water developments, have led to a marked decline of stream-side wetland habitats. Six major ways are discussed in which conventional agriculture alters wetlands and aquatic habitats: wetland drainage, water diversions, stream channelization, bank stabilization, grazing, and the release of agricultural pollutants. This article discusses these practices and suggests ways biological diversity can be protected, or even enhanced. In addition, aquaculture is discussed as a new force which affects the diversity of aquatic organisms. Aquaculture methods range in intensity of management from low to high. The higher the intensity the potentially more disruptive practices can be to surrounding aquatic systems. Management for biological diversity as well as for food production should be encouraged. © 1992.

TI  - Vegetation structure and fuel dynamics in fire-prone, Mediterranean-type Banksia woodlands
PY  - 2022
AB  - Increasing extreme wildfire occurrence globally is boosting demand to understand the fuel dynamics and fire risk of fire-prone areas. This is particularly pressing in fire-prone, Mediterranean climate-type vegetation, such as the Banksia woodlands surrounding metropolitan Perth, southwestern Australia. Despite an extensive wildland-urban interface and frequent fire occurrence, fuel accumulation and the spatial variation in fuel risk is not well quantified across the broad extent of this ecosystem. Using a space for time sampling approach to generate a chronosequence of time since fire, we selected sites that spanned across two distinct sandy soil types (Spearwood and Bassendean sands) and a rainfall gradient (550 to 750 mm north–south). We examined 82 sites in Banksia woodlands, southwestern Australia. Of the 82 sites, 44 burnt during the measurement period (2016 to 2021), which provided the opportunity for fuel measurements following fire (resulting in total N = 126). We wanted to answer two key questions: 1) How do measures of fuel load (mass) and arrangement (structure and continuity) vary across space and time, particularly with respect to time since the last fire? 2) How do biophysical drivers, such as soil type and rainfall, influence fuel accumulation and arrangement, and do these covariates improve litter fuel modelling beyond traditional asymptotic models? We found that fine surface fuel loads (litter and small twigs) differed between sand types, accumulating faster and reaching a higher peak on Spearwood sands (7–9 Mg ha−1) compared to Bassendean sands (6–7 Mg ha−1). Shrub layer fuel loads also accumulated faster on Spearwood sands than on Bassendean sands. While shrub layer fuels on Spearwood sands peaked at 14 years and declined thereafter, those on Bassendean sand did not decline over time but have lower overall connectivity. Total fine fuels (fine surface plus fine shrub layer fuels) had no significant decline over the same time period, on either sand type. Total fine fuel loads reached a peak of 9–10 Mg ha−1 between 13- and 20-years following fire, depending on the underlying sand type. Our quantitative fuel accumulation models confirmed the strength of time since fire as a predictor of hazard, but nonetheless included up to 40% unexplained variance. Importantly, while components fluctuated over time, the combined total of fine fuels did not decline with the long absence of fire, suggesting fire risk does not necessarily decrease in long unburned vegetation. © 2021

TI  - An integrative conservation planning framework for aquatic landscapes fragmented by road-stream crossings
PY  - 2020
AB  - Road-stream crossings represent a significant source of habitat fragmentation for global aquatic ecosystems, yet integrative conservation planning frameworks are lacking for most regions. We describe a connectivity conservation planning framework that draws on recent advances in the fields of surveying, modelling, and optimizing removal of crossings that block aquatic organism passage. We demonstrate this framework with a case study involving 1200 crossings surveyed in Florida, USA in which barrier severity was quantified on a continuous scale from 0 (complete barrier) to 1 (no barrier). Using field surveys, we built a boosted regression tree (BRT) model that linked barrier severity to 44 landscape variables representing natural (e.g., stream size) and anthropogenic (e.g., land use) stream conditions. We used a recently developed optimization routine to conduct two scenarios, including (1) surveyed crossings only and (2) surveyed crossings plus crossings modelled at 5545 unsurveyed locations. The BRT model explained 54% of variation in barrier severity scores and showed that the most severe barriers occurred on small, high-elevation streams draining urban and agricultural catchments. Estimates of connectivity gains following remediation were 5.3-times lower when unsurveyed locations were included in the optimization, suggesting inclusion of unsurveyed sites is critical for conservation planning. Results from this framework can be used over short (e.g., planning immediate barrier mitigation) and long (e.g., planning future field surveys) time horizons to benefit aquatic connectivity conservation. The survey protocol and modelling methods used here, combined with global datasets on stream conditions, can be applied to benefit connectivity planning in other regions. © 2020 The Authors

TI  - A visual assessment of roadside poplar plantings in Turkey
PY  - 2018
AB  - Roadside plantings along urban and rural road corridors are designed to create visual effects as well as to provide functional benefits such as shading, screening or routing. Considering their potential for daily public use, roads and road corridors, as significant visual impact centers, can attract people’s attention and affect their points of view. Poplar species, which grow rapidly and easily along road corridors and can adapt to different ecological conditions swiftly, are used widely in both urban and rural landscapes in Turkey. The main objective of this study was to determine the visual structures dependent on the road-plant relationships of the poplar compositions that play an important role in shaping the roadside landscapes. For this purpose, compositions of poplar trees in selected urban and rural road corridors throughout Turkey were photographed and visual analysis techniques (VATs) were applied to determine visual preferences. Participants (n= 35) were shown 30 photographs, selected from the nearly 1000 taken, of road corridor poplar plantings and their evaluations were recorded in a questionnaire. In this survey, the people were requested to evaluate their appreciation levels towards the plantings as well as to express their other visual preferences and to assess visual quality. In addition, the association of all these evaluations with the demographic characteristics of the participants were determined. A correlation analysis was then performed to identify the relationships among all the visual assessments and a cluster analysis was conducted according to the visual status of the photographs in order to determine their groups. In the results of the study, the poplar trees, either individually or in the form of compositions, were reported to have a significant visual diversity. Moreover, the cluster analysis found the resulting three groups to be associated with leaf density, seasonal conditions and the trees as individuals or in groups. The seasonal variation factor in particular was shown to be visually effective in the poplar compositions. It was determined that visual perception of the poplar plantations differed in accordance with the demographic differences. This work established that poplar plantations as single trees or in groups and their proximity to the road altered visual preferences, and consequently, some suggestions were made concerning the use of poplars in roadside landscape planning.

TI  - OXIDANT STUDIES IN CANADA
PY  - 1984
AB  - Of all the pollutants that are routinely monitored in Canada, ozone is of greatest concern in view of the widespread and regular occurrence of concentrations that are potentially harmful to human health and to vegetation. The most severely affected areas in Canada are the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD)-Lower Fraser Valley, the Windsor-Quebec City corridor and in the New Brunswick-Nova Scotia region. The meteorological features associated with persistent and areal episodes in each region were characterized and back trajectories from selected sites were calculated for some episode days. The meteorological characteristics typical of episode days include clear skies, warm temperatures, a stagnant high pressure system and an associated land/sea breeze circulation. Ozone episodes result entirely for locally generated precursors. Oxidant control strategies are indicated for Canada. The development of these strategies requires not only air quality and meteorological data bases but also sensitive receptor inventories and emission inventories which are compatible with area-specific photochemical models.

TI  - Habitat use and basking behavior of a freshwater turtle community along an urban gradient
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urbanization of riparian corridors may alter or eliminate suitable freshwater turtle basking habitat due to fragmentation of shoreline vegetation, reduction of basking sites, or frequent human disturbance. We used 3 indices of shoreline urbanization at 2 spatial scales to assess the relationship between shoreline urbanization and basking turtle behavior. Indices included local-scale Shoreline Modification and Disturbance Frequency and broad-scale Building Density. The community of basking turtles included the Texas river cooter, Pseudemys texana (Baur); red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta elegans (Wied); Mississippi map turtle, Graptemys pseudogeographica kohnii (Baur); midland smooth softshell, Apalone mutica mutica (LeSueur); pallid spiny softshell, Apalone spinifera pallida (Webb); and a turtle from the family Kinosternidae that could not be identified to species during basking surveys. At the local scale, abundances of basking turtles were greatest in areas of high Shoreline Modification, characterized by a substantial reduction in woody shoreline vegetation. Disturbance Frequency of human intrusion limited turtle basking in areas with daily disturbance. At the broad scale, most turtles basked adjacent to shorelines with nearby buildings. All species of the turtle community basked in urban environments, but their tolerance of urbanization varied. © Chelonian Research Foundation.

TI  - An Operational Landscape Unit approach for identifying key landscape connections in wetland restoration
PY  - 2008
AB  - 1. Nature conservation and restoration traditionally focus on protecting individual sites. In parts of the world where the natural landscape has been severely altered for agricultural or urban use, individual patches are too small and isolated to ensure effective nature protection. Spatial processes, such as metapopulation dynamics, are disrupted and natural linkages in the landscape, such as water flows, are severed by modifications in the landscape and hydrology. 2. We propose the identification of Operational Landscape Units (OLUs), which are defined as combinations of landscape patches with their hydrogeological and biotic connections, as a tool to facilitate wetland restoration in catchments with a high degree of fragmentation and strongly altered hydrology. The combined consideration of biotic (i.e. dispersal, transports of organisms) and hydrological connections (flooding events, groundwater flowpaths) is a new approach. 3. We developed criteria for the delineation of OLUs in regional wetland restoration initiatives. The key elements for delineation are definition of the restoration objectives, identification of spatial landscape mechanisms and information on historic and present land uses and hydrologic management. 4. As a case study, we delineated an OLU by applying these criteria in a restoration initiative for a large agricultural area that used to be a floodplain until the early 1950s in N.E. Twente, The Netherlands. The OLU encompassed not only the floodplain area to be restored but also a relatively remote nature reserve upstream as well as the stream connecting both areas. By restoring the historic water regime, flooding events would become a regular feature in the two areas and organisms including seeds would flow from the nature reserve to the restored floodplain. 5. Synthesis and applications. Discussions of the proposed Operational Landscape Units with stakeholders (water authorities, nature conservation agencies, farmers) resulted in shared insights which will lead to modifications of the original management plan for the area. We believe the OLU approach will make natural resource managers aware of the importance of spatial processes and connectivity in landscapes and, if properly applied, will lead to more natural and more successful restoration projects. © 2008 The Authors.

TI  - Use of a wildlife corridor by desert mule deer
PY  - 2001
AB  - We examined the efficacy of a mitigation project in Avra Valley, Arizona, established to provide wildlife access across the barrier created by a canal, the Central Arizona Project (CAP). We monitored movements of 17 radio-collared desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) to determine if deer were using the corridor for access across the canal and the 26-km wide valley. We also determined frequency of corridor use by desert mule deer relative to surrounding lands. Four deer crossed the canal but stayed within 500 m of the crossing site. One deer traversed the valley via the corridor. Two of these deer used crossing areas not in the designated corridor. Overall, 22.4% of deer locations were in the corridor. The corridor currently serves as a link with other undeveloped lands to provide movement for animals seeking to cross Avra Valley, but some lands outside the corridor are scheduled for development for agriculture. With increasing pressures from an urban population, the corridor may prove to be of greater value in the future.

TI  - Agricultural landscapes and the Loire River influence the genetic structure of the marbled newt in Western France
PY  - 2018
AB  - Amphibians are particularly sensitive to landscape fragmentation. Potential barriers between breeding sites can negatively influence the dispersal of individuals and increase genetic structure between populations. In this study, we genotyped 10 microsatellites for 334 marbled newts (Triturus marmoratus) at 11 different locations in Western France. Samples were collected in different regions with contrasting agricultural landscapes (low and high proportion of arable land in the north and south, respectively). We found a strong genetic structure between the northern and southern sampling sites. Isolation by distance was recorded after 62 km, but within the northern region, little or no genetic structure was detected over large distances (up to 114 km). Genetic structure at shorter distance (43 km) was found between sites situated in landscapes with larger amounts of arable lands. A significant positive relationship was found between the pairwise genetic distance (Fst) between sites and the amount of arable land together with the distance between sites. Our results suggest that the Loire River might act as a corridor for the marbled newt, while arable land might act as a barrier. Finally, although a large city is located between sampling sites, no effect was detected on population structure. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Landscape features and forest maturity promote the occurrence of macroinvertebrates specialized for seepage springs in urban forests in Washington, DC
PY  - 2022
AB  - The hypotelminorheic is a groundwater-fed shallow subterranean habitat, occurring a few metres below the surface and emerging at a seepage spring. Little is known about the habitat requirements for the amphipods and isopods that live there, and forest quality and other surface parameters have been largely unexplored. Urban parks, encompassing protected lands from ballfields to forests, are not necessarily secure sites, because of non-compatible uses and changing park boundaries. Almost all records for this fauna in the study area are in parks. Using data from sampling in parklands of south-east Washington, DC, exploratory analyses were conducted at two spatial scales – the seeps and pervious land patches surrounded by impervious surfaces (which range from 0.59 to 231 ha). Habitat quality, fragmentation and geological variables were calculated, and exploratory logistic regression models were fitted to predict occupancy. Hypotelminorheic macroinvertebrates were found at 66 of 207 seeps and 15 of 27 patches. Five species were collected, three of which were uncommon. Only patches containing three or more seeps and >7.6 ha were inhabited. Occurrence of one or more species in seeps was associated with distance inside the forest, taller tree canopy, elevation and geological formation. There is a threshold amount of habitat below which a population can no longer exist. Few patches of forest remain that are sufficiently large for habitation, and conservation actions should prioritize forested patches with three or more seeps. In addition, the development of forested corridors to enhance connectivity among populations, education of the public about the value of the hypotelminorheic, and development of field methods to detect habitats is recommended. Urban parklands can be important reservoirs for species of conservation concern.

TI  - Diet of the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in the Arid Chaco of Córdoba, Argentina
PY  - 2018
AB  - In the North-west of Córdoba (Argentina) lives a small population of guanaco (Lama guanicoe Müller, 1776), of which only occasional records are available in the natural region of the Western Chaco District. We analyzed the diet composition of guanacos in the dry and wet seasons in the center of Arid Chaco Biogeographical Corridor of Córdoba, taking into account two natural environments of the region: Open Forest Plain and Perisaline Shrub. During the years 2009 and 2010, plant samples were taken in the town of Piedrita Blanca and surrounding areas, vegetation reference patterns were recorded and epidermal cells, presence and characteristics of stomata, hairs and salt glands of each species were described. Feces were collected from active dung piles and relative frequencies of plant species were determined by fecal micro-histological analysis. The diet diversity was analyzed from the graph of diversity and relative abundance, complemented by Simpson’s inverse index (Cinv). In the analyzed feces, 57 native plant species (that belong to 35 genera and 19 families) were observed. The diet diversity did not differ significantly between seasons or between environments. The main species consumed were grasses, followed by Geoffroea decorticans (Gillies ex Hook. &amp; Arn.) Burkart, Atriplex cordobensis Gand. &amp; Stuck., and several species of the genus Prosopis. Woody plants, grasses and halophytes were the most abundant, in descending order. In both environments, herbaceous plants other than grasses were more consumed in wet season and cacti in the dry season. © SAREM, 2018.

TI  - Assessment of Landscape Change of Lesser Himalayan Road Corridor of Uttarakhand, India
PY  - 2020
AB  - The spatio-temporal monitoring and understanding of the pattern of land-use and land-cover (LULC) change in the Himalayas are essential for sustainable development, especially from environmental planning and management perspective. The increasing anthropogenic activities and climate change in the Siwalik and Lesser Himalayas have substantially experienced rapid change in the natural landscape; however, detailed investigation and documentation of such observed changes are limited. This study aims to assess the LULC changes along the Kalsi-Chakrata road corridor located in the Lesser Himalayan region of Uttarakhand state of India using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) for the periods 2000-2010 and 2010-2019. The LULC maps were generated from multi-temporal satellite images of the Landsat -7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) series for 2000 and 2010, and the Linear Imaging Self-Scanning System IV (LISS IV) images from Resourcesat-1 for 2019. The extent of spatial landscape changes occurred in different LULC classes was performed through the cross-tabulation change matrix in the GIS module up to the individual village level. The results indicate that the forest cover of the area was intensively converted to open areas, sparse vegetation, and different land-use categories. These included agricultural land, built-up areas, and decreased from 47.27 % in 2000 to 36.66 % in 2019. During the same period, the open areas and agricultural areas were increased by 15.86 % and 4.49 %, respectively. Moreover, the built-up areas (both urban and rural settlements) were progressively increased from 0.33% in 2000 to 0.56 % in 2019. The conversion of forests and sparsely vegetative areas to agricultural land and rural settlements is closely associated with the increasing anthropogenic activities due to population growth, tourism, movement of heavy vehicles for mining and other economic activities. The changes in land-cover to land use classes are more prominent in Samalta Dadauli, Nithala, Bhugtari, and Udapalta villages located between Kalsi and Sahiya town. The reported maximum transition of forest areas into the open area, agricultural land, and sparse vegetation indicates the possible scarcity of water, which could link with the incidence of climatic or seasonal variation in the Lesser Himalayan terrain to the hydro-geomorphic and anthropogenic processes. The trend in LULC change at the village level gave the insight to help to prioritize future mitigation planning and sustainable development that are exceedingly convenient for the planners, policymakers, and local authorities for comprehensive forest management, biodiversity strategies, and necessary conservation. © 2020 Ujjwal Sur et al., published by Sciendo.

TI  - Movement and habitat selection by Argia vivida (Hagen) (Odonata, Coenagrionidae) in fuel-modified forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - Fuel management for wildfire protection is becoming increasingly common in the wildland-urban interface and may have conservation implications for species with restricted distributions and limited dispersal abilities. To evaluate the impact of forest fuel management on the damselfly Argia vivida at the northern margin of its range, we examined terrestrial movements and habitat associations using Capture-Mark-Recapture and point count techniques. We found that habitats away from the springs were particularly important for A. vivida females. Most damselflies travelled at least 50 m between capture and recapture and patches of cleared forest up to this size did not pose a barrier to movement. Although A. vivida typically roosts in trees at night, cleared fuel treatment areas were preferred over unmodified or thinned forest as daytime basking and foraging sites. Preferred sites were also characterized by heterogeneous canopy closure, i.e., a clearing adjacent to unmodified forest with a closed canopy. We speculate that this behaviour derives from the species' thermoregulation requirements; the use of sunspots for thermal basking during the day and the use of forest cover at night to slow the radiant loss of heat. Our findings demonstrate the scale of movements that define available habitat and the importance of both daytime and night time habitat requirements in considering terrestrial foraging and movement corridors. Consequently, conservation efforts for this species in fuel management areas should focus on maintaining unmodified stands of dense trees in association with cleared patches of appropriate dimension, rather than a uniformly thinned forest. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Planning approaches to mitigate adverse human impacts on land/water ecotones
PY  - 2001
AB  - Land-inland water ecotones are environments of exceptional diversity, but are also highly vulnerable to impacts from human settlement. Settlement on floodplains and exacerbation of peak runoff from land-use changes have resulted in flood damage to human structures, leading in reaction to widespread efforts to control flooding through such measures as land drainage and construction of levees and artificial flood control channels. These measures increase flood hazard downstream and result in loss of valuable riparian and aquatic habitats. Similarly, human settlements along river banks may be threatened by natural channel migration, leading to ill-conceived bank stabilization projects, which eliminate riparian habitat. Environmental planning strategies to minimize these impacts include reducing stormwater runoff through use of permeable pavement, infiltration galleries, and detention basins; ordinances protecting urban streams and riparian corridors (from development, filling, etc.); prohibitions or restrictions on development on floodplains; retention of vegetative buffer strips along stream channels; maintenance of continuity of riparian corridors for wildlife and human use; use of alternatives to traditional flood control strategies; and release of flushing flows to mimic effects of natural floods below reservoirs.

Despite the urban expansion in the state of Rio de Janeiro, large areas of continuous vegetation with high connectivity degree can still be found. Recently, new Rubiaceae species have been described in the Rio de Janeiro flora, which present small populations and very particular distribution. The current paper analyzed the similarity in the floristic composition of the Rubiaceae in eight Atlantic Forest remnants of Rio de Janeiro state protected by Conservation Units. We also surveyed and set guidelines for conservation of microendemic species. The similarity analysis were based on previously published studies in Area de Protecao Ambiental de Grumari, Area de Protecao Ambiental Palmares, Parque Estadual da Serra da Tiririca, Parque Nacional do Itatiaia, Parque Nacional de Jurubatiba, Reserva Biologica de Poco das Antas, Reserva Biologica do Tingua and Reserva Ecologica de Macae de Cima - using the PAST software (\"Paleontological Statistics\") with Sorensen coefficient. The floristic similarity analysis revealed two groups with distinct physiographic characteristics and different vegetation types. Group A consisted in two Restinga areas, Area de Protecao Ambiental de Grumari and Parque Nacional de Jurubatiba, which showed strong bootstrap support (98 %). Group B included forest remnants with distinct phytophisiognomies or altitudes, but with moderate bootstrap support. Low similarity levels among the eight areas were found due to the habitats’ heterogeneity. The current study pointed out 19 microendemic species from the Atlantic Forest, they present a single-site distribution or a distribution restricted to Mountain and Metropolitan regions of Rio de Janeiro state. Concerning the conservation status of microendemic species, discrepancies between the Catalogue of Flora of Rio de Janeiro and the Red Book of Brazilian Flora (two of the main reference catalogs of Brazilian flora) have been identified. We have also highlighted the need for recollecting microendemic species from the Atlantic Forest, and for properly assessing the degree of threat faced by these taxons early.

TI  - Evaluation of revegetation progress and erosion-prone areas along oli and gas pipelines in Azerbaijan
PY  - 2012
AB  - The construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil and South Caucasus gas (SCP) pipelines was completed in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The Azerbaijan section of the BTC oil and SCP gas pipelines is 442 km long and lies in a 44 m wide corridor named as the Right-of- Way (RoW). BTC and SCP pipelines are aligned parallel to each other within the Ro W. The construction pro-cess significantly disturbed vegetation and soil cover along the RoW of the pipelines. The revegetation and erosion control mea-sures were conducted after the completion of construction to restore disturbed footprints of construction. The general goals of the present studies, dedicated to the environmental monitoring and erosion control measures were to evalu-ate the status of the revegetation in 2007 since the completion of the construction ac-tivities and to determine erosion-prone ar-eas along the Ro W Quantitative assessment of vegetation cover (VC) was based on the regression and RMSE analysis using IKONOS NDVI 2007 and in-situ estimation of VC percentage for the normalization of NDVI to VC. The predic-tion of erosion-prone areas was based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The prediction reliability of USLE was evaluated using in-situ collected erosion occurrences. ©2012 URBAN-VERLAG Hamburg/Wien GmbH.

TI  - Interactions between groundwater and surface water at river banks and the confluence of rivers
PY  - 2004
AB  - Riparian vegetation depends on hydrological resources and has to adapt to changes in water levels and soil moisture conditions. The origin and mixing of water in the streamside corridor were studied in detail. The development of riparian woodland often reflects the evolution of hydrological events. River water levels and topography are certainly the main causes of the exchange between groundwater and river water through the riverbank. Stable isotopes, such as 18O, are useful tools that allow water movement to be traced. Two main water sources are typically present: (i) river water, depleted of heavy isotopes, originating upstream, and (ii) groundwater, which comes mainly from the local rainfall. On the Garonne River bank field site downstream of Toulouse, the mixing of these two waters is variable, and depends mainly on the river level and the geographical position. The output of the groundwater into the river water is not diffuse on a large scale, but localised at few places. At the confluence of two rivers, the water-mixing area is more complex because of the presence of a third source of water. In this situation, groundwater supports the hydrologic pressure of both rivers until they merge, this pressure could influence its outflow. Two cases will be presented. The first is the confluence of the Garonne and the Ariège Rivers in the south-west of France, both rivers coming from the slopes of the Pyrénées mountains. Localised groundwater outputs have been detected about 200 m before the confluence. The second case presented is the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna Rivers in the north of India, downstream of the city of Allahabad. These rivers are the two main tributaries of the Ganges, and both originate in the Himalayas. A strong stream of groundwater output was measured at the point of confluence. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessment of the functionality of wildlife corridors used by red deer in the Geneva basin
PY  - 2017
AB  - The red deer population located west of the Jura Mountains is expanding its range. For the past fifteen years this expansion has also affected the lowlands of the Geneva basin. When entering the Plateau area, the red deer face a landscape highly fragmented by urbanisation. In addition their natural habitats are broken up and are often reduced to small patches. In this context it is hard to imagine how a red deer population manages to find all the resources required for survival, and how the animals manage to connect the scattered habitats in their area. A study was initiated in 2009 in order to assess this population's use of the space available. Sixteen individuals were fitted with GPS collars in order to monitor their movements. The results show that these individuals manage to connect a set of habitats, forests and agricultural areas, thanks to the presence of transit corridors, the whole system forming a network superposed on the urban network. It was however observed that the functionality of these corridors is often threatened and that their size has been reduced in the last decade. However, even though the landscape matrix is dominated by agricultural environments and is strongly fragmented, the animals are, at present, able to find enough resources by moving between habitat patches using the network which remains. The area thus used to satisfy their essential needs is surprisingly small. © 2017 Schweizerischer Forstverein. All rights reserved.

TI  - The fish community as an indicator of biotic integrity of the streams in the Sinos River basin, Brazil
PY  - 2010
AB  - The basin of the Sinos River, located in the northeastern part of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, has been highly impacted by industrial and urban activities. Water quality is low because of domestic and industrial sewage discharges. Most of the tributaries have suffered drastic structural interventions like canalisations and the removal of riparian vegetation. The aims of this study were to: 1) assess the diversity of fish at 34 sampling sites in twenty-four tributaries of the Sinos River basin; 2) quantify impact level by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and an adapted Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI); and 3) check the interference of environmental impacts, formerly quantified in a Stream Corridor Assessment Survey (SCAS), on the fish assembly and 4) compare the relationship between the IBI with stream order. Fish sampling was performed by electric fishing in the period from April 2004 to August 2006. A total of 4,869 individuals were sampled, representing 61 species, 14 families and six orders. Significant relationships of the Shannon-Wiener index and IBI with SCAS scores and stream orders were found. Of all impacts that make up the SCAS score, only channel modifications were significantly correlated with IBI. These results indicate that the adaptation of the IBI was effective and performed better than the Shannon-Wiener diversity index when related directly to specific impact categories. The application of the IBI with the SCAS and the other variables was efficient in the tributaries of the Sinos River basin because it showed the biotic degradation in accordance with changes in physical habitat.

TI  - Ecological Impacts of Altered Stream Hydrogeomorphic Characteristics Extend Beyond the Channel Boundary: Evidence From Urban Streams of Columbus, OH, United States
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanization in stream catchments can have strong effects on stream channel hydrogeomorphic features including channel dimensions, channel-floodplain connectivity, and flood regime. However, the consequences of hydrogeomorphic alterations on aquatic-terrestrial subsidy dynamics are largely unexplored. We examined the associations among hydrogeomorphic characteristics, emergent aquatic insect assemblages, and the density and trophic dynamics of riparian spiders of the family Tetragnathidae at 23 small urban stream reaches in the Columbus, OH (United States) Metropolitan Area. Naturally abundant stable isotopes of 13C and 15N were used to quantify the relative contribution of aquatically derived energy (i.e., nutritional pathways deriving from algae) to tetragnathid spiders and their trophic position. Bankfull discharge was negatively related to both emergence rate and family richness. On average, tetragnathid spiders relied on aquatically derived energy for 36% of their nutrition, with the greatest reliance found for spiders next to channels with wider flood-prone widths and proportionally fewer emergent insects of the family Chironomidae. Mean emergent aquatic insect reliance on aquatically derived energy was 32% and explained 44% of the variation in tetragnathid aquatically derived energy. A positive relationship between δ13C of tetragnathid spiders and emergent insects provides additional evidence of tetragnathid reliance on emergent insects. Mean tetragnathid trophic position was 2.85 and was positively associated with channel sinuosity and negatively associated with aquatic insect emergence rate. Sinuosity was also positively related to aquatically derived energy of emergent aquatic insects; as well as emergent insect family richness; % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT); and aquatic insect emergence rate; implicating instream habitat-mediated shifts in emergent aquatic insect communities as an indirect mechanistic link between hydrogeomorphic processes and spiders. Our findings underscore that the impacts of stream hydrogeomorphic alterations can cascade into terrestrial food webs. These results suggest that monitoring and restoration of fluvial geomorphic form and function (e.g., sinuosity, slope, and hydrology) confer benefits to both aquatic and terrestrial riparian ecosystems in urban catchments.

TI  - Active Transport Network Design Based on Transit-Oriented Development and Complete Street Approach: Finding the Potential in Qazvin
PY  - 2022
AB  - Today, automobile dependency constantly causes traffic congestion, delays, reduced access, increased fuel and energy consumption, and environmental emissions. Automobile dependency has caused many direct and indirect transportation problems that may influence our life. Urban planners and transportation engineers seek to improve transport networks considering social issues. One of the most successful solutions for advocating sustainable transport is transit-oriented development (TOD). Another solution that planners encourage to use is designing the roadways based on a complete street approach, which is a system that provides safe, convenient, and comfortable travel and increases accessibility for users of all ages regardless of their transport modes. The present study employed the saturated roads that have heavy traffic most of the time and public transport e-ticket data to investigate the potential complete streets in Qazvin. An online questionnaire was developed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method based on the TOD and the complete street framework to investigate the essential criteria for redesigning the network based on the active transport approach. Thus, after analyzing the six criteria (density, diversity, distance, accessibility, demand management, and design) and eight sub-criteria (pedestrian flow, pedestrian density, connectivity, safety, bike route, bus route, road width, and urban tree canopy index), the proposed active transport network emerged and results show that five high priority streets were identified to be considered as a solution. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Traditional agricultural landscape in Goričko Landscape Park (Slovenia): Distribution and variety of riparian stream corridors and patches
PY  - 2008
AB  - Goričko Landscape Park is a well-preserved example of typical Central-European agricultural landscape. We used modified PHYSIS typology to describe and classify different habitat types (HT), especially the riparian stream corridors and patches (RSCP)-habitats of riparian woody stands occurring outside the closed woodland. The RSCP of Goričko were categorized into 107 HT, which cover 1.35% of the 45,000 ha in Goričko. The ash-alder vegetation is the most widespread riparian HT. For the detailed analysis, we compared two similar areas that differ only in land-use intensity. RSCP showed slightly higher fractal dimension and significantly higher elongation index in more intensified area B. The analysis of RSCP types on these areas showed a shift, accompanying increased agricultural impact, from pure stands to mixed, from trees to scrub, from ash-alder and white willow stands to mixed riverine willow stands. The course of the intensification produced two results: arable HT were united into large, homogeneous polygons, while less usable land was abandoned. We can conclude that some of the landscape characteristics we used can be applied to detect the level of preserved traditional cultural landscape. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of metal contamination in soil and vegetation along the Arbutus Greenway in Vancouver, British Columbia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aims: The Arbutus Greenway is a former railway corridor and current greenspace spanning 9 km in Metro Vancouver, BC. The objective of this study was to quantify variability in metal concentrations along the greenway and assess barrier effectiveness on reducing atmospheric deposition of metals from nearby roads. Methods: At 5 sites along the greenway, soils and vegetation were sampled; metal concentrations were determined by ICP-OES. Results: We found high variability in naturally occurring soil metal concentrations. We were able to associate the values with site history as a railway transportation corridor. In addition, we found higher concentrations of total soil metals in areas without a barrier separating the greenway from the heavily trafficked roads, indicating that atmospheric deposition of metals from roadways is occurring. The use of barriers seemed to be effective in reducing atmospheric deposition of metals in our study. Conclusions: These findings support our conclusion that a thorough and comprehensive assessment of potential greenspaces prior to the planning phase, and continued monitoring during use, will be important to maintain public health. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Analysis on the damage causes of sabo dam with one open cross section at upstream of Fuxing bridge in Lacus Creek
PY  - 2020
AB  - Lacus Creek is one of the important tributaries of the Laonong River upstream of the Gaoping River, which is an important river in southern Taiwan. After Typhoon Morakot in 2009, severe sediment disasters occurred, which affected the security of local revitalization, and the government has since invested in numerous projects to reduce the impact of sediment and flood disasters. In 2017, the Kaohsiung City government built a sabo type dam upstream of Fuxing Bridge in Lacus Creek; however, it was severely damaged by a heavy rain less than a year later. To investigate the cause of the damage, site investigations, concrete sampling tests, hydrology analysis, and reviews of the planning and design methods, construction process, etc. have been conducted, in order to understand the cause of the problem, avoid repeating mistakes, and clarify the responsibility of the administrative agency. The investigation and research found that many recent cases of torrent management have considered the transverse structures as isolated wildlife corridors, reduce the height of the transverse structures, create gentle slopes of the downstream surfaces, add fish passages, cut (openings) export slits, etc.; however, after setting up these environmentally friendly facilities, their effect and impact have not been explored in depth. This research survey found that, although the frequency of heavy rain events is not high in recent years, the current iterative impact of continuous rainfall may exceed the original design requirements. If the overflow mode with a single export opening is added, the scouring energy will be concentrated, and this additive effect is likely to cause the foundation of the sabo dam to lose bare space, and finally, the dam will be damaged. Therefore, it is recommended that when designing these torrent transverse structures, try to avoid using the method of a single narrow opening: it is better to increase the number of export openings (like a slit dam), expand the size of a single export opening, or adopt a fully enclosed dam design. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The relative importance of landscape and community features in the invasion of an exotic shrub in a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2006
AB  - Although invasive plants are recognized as a major ecological problem, little is known of the relative importance of plant community characteristics versus landscape context in determining invasibility of communities. We determined the relative importance of community and landscape features of 30 woodlots in influencing the invasion of Lonicera maackii. We sampled woodlots using the point-quarter method and calculated canopy openness and basal areas and densities of shrub, sapling and tree species, as well as woody species richness. We used aerial photos and ArcView GIS to calculate landscape parameters from the same woodlots using a buffer distance of 1500 m. We used logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the community and landscape factors that best explain L. maackii presence and density. We also tested whether woodlot invasion by L. maackii begins at woodlot edges. Presence of L. maackii was significantly explained only by distance from the nearest town (logistic regression, p=0.017); woodlots nearer town were more likely to be invaded. Among invaded woodlots, density of L. maackii was positively related to the amount of edge in the landscape (partial R2=0.592) and negatively related to total tree basal area (partial R2=0.134), number of native woody species (partial R2=0.054), and sapling shade tolerance index (partial R2=0.054). Lonicera maackii in woodlot interiors were not younger than those on the perimeters, leading us to reject the edge-first colonization model of invasion. Our findings reveal that landscape structure is of primary importance and community features of secondary importance in the invasion of L. maackii. This shrub is invading from multiple foci (towns) rather than an advancing front. Connectivity in the landscape (i.e. the number of corridors) did not promote invasion. However, edge habitat was important for invasion, probably due to increased propagule pressure. The community features associated with L. maackii invasion may be indicators of past disturbance.

TI  - Using remote sensing imagery to determine the impact of land cover changes on potential runoff for the mid-cibolo creek watershed, texas
PY  - 2010
AB  - Land cover changes within watersheds have the potential to produce dramatic changes in surface hydrology, namely runoff, in the event of storms. The Mid- Cibolo Creek watershed in south-central Texas has experienced extensive land- cover change in the past two decades due to mass residential development and land clearing in the wake of urban growth along the I-35 corridor. This study determined land-cover changes within the basin using supervised classification to classify land cover from LANDSAT images for the years 1986 and 1999. Changes in runoff volume were then calculated using the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) runoff equation for a series of rainfall scenarios. The results showed that an overall increase in impervious cover and decrease in natural vegetative cover has occurred leading to larger runoff volumes for all storm scenarios. The findings are important for watershed scale urban expansion and land clearing practices as current methods suggest that flood risk is increased. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Vegetative and thermal aspects of roost-site selection in urban yellow-billed magpies
PY  - 2006
AB  - We examined vegetative, and thermal aspects of roost-site selection in urban Yellow-billed Magpies (Pica nuttalli) in Sacramento, California, from winter 2003 to spring 2004. Vegetation used for roosting included cultivated species such as glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum), English ivy (Hedera helix), and white mulberry (Morus alba), and native species such as interior live oak (Quercus wislizeni), valley oak (Q. lobata), and California laurel (Umbellularia californica). Percent canopy cover was consistently high (mean = 94% ± 1.9 SD). Mean roost height was 9.7 m ± 3.5 SD and the mean height at which magpies roosted was 6.6 m ± 2.0 SD. Communal roosts were generally located within or near riparian corridors. Magpies roosted in relatively warm microhabitats, but they did not appear to obtain a thermal advantage by roosting communally. The timing of roost occupancy was restricted primarily to times when the roost was thermally advantageous.

TI  - Spatial and temporal characterization of nutrient net uptake in a vegetated urban stream: Stream bank features leading to net uptake hotspots
PY  - 2017
AB  - Urban stream features can be used to promote nutrient retention, however their interactions with different hydrological regimes impact nutrient cycling, decrease their retention capacity and inhibit stream ecosystem functioning. This study analysed the temporal and spatial dynamics of the uptake of three nutrients (nitrate, ammonium and phosphorus) in an urban drainage stream during high flows. In particular, we studied variations in net uptake along the right margin, (with native vegetation and a roots mat) comparatively to the left margin (a non-rooted grassy bank). Applying the spiralling approach within each sub-reach on either side, we determined nutrient sub-reach (sr) retention metrics: uptake rate coefficients ( Knetsr), mass transfer rates vfnetsr and areal uptake rates ( Unetsr). Our results showed nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4) net uptakes on the right side were higher and more frequent along sub-reaches where the root mat was more abundant ( Unetsr (µg m-2s-1) = 22.80 ± 1.13 for NO3 and 10.50 ± 0.81 for NH4), whereas on the left side both nutrients showed patchy and inconsistent net uptake patterns despite the homogeneous grass distribution. Net uptake for filtered reactive phosphorus (FRP) was not observed on either side at any flow rate. The impact of hydrological factors such as discharge, travel time, water depth and concentration, on uptake metrics was studied. Despite increases in travel time as the flow decreased, there was a reduction in net uptake rates, vfnetsr and Unetsr, on either side. This was attributed to a reduction in water level with declining flows, which decreased hydrologic connectivity with the stream banks, combined with a decrease in water velocity and a reduction in nutrient concentrations. We concluded the rooted bank acted as effective retention area by systematically promoting net uptake resulting in a two-fold increased DIN retention relatively to the non-rooted side where net uptake was spatially localised and highly dynamic. Overall, this work emphasized the importance of strategically sampling close to biologically active surfaces to more accurately determine areas where gross uptake surpasses release process.

TI  - Configuration and Location of Small Urban Gardens Affect Colonization by Monarch Butterflies
PY  - 2019
AB  - Ecological theory predicts that specialist insect herbivores are more likely to locate and colonize host plants growing in relatively sparse or pure stands compared to host plants growing amongst diverse non-host vegetation. We tested the hypothesis that increasing the apparency and accessibility of milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants in small polyculture gardens would boost their colonization by the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), an iconic native species of conservation concern. We established replicated gardens containing the identical mix of milkweeds, flowering nectar sources, and non-host ornamental grasses but arranged in three different spatial configurations that were monitored for monarch colonization over two successive growing seasons. Monarch eggs and larvae were 2–3 times more abundant in gardens having milkweeds evenly spaced in a 1-m corridor around the perimeter, surrounding the nectar plants and grasses, than in gardens in which milkweeds were surrounded by or intermixed with the other plants. Predator populations were similar in all garden designs. In a corollary open-field experiment, female monarchs laid significantly more eggs on milkweed plants that were fully accessible than on milkweeds surrounded by non-host grasses of equal height. In addition, we monitored monarch usage of 22 citizen-planted gardens containing milkweed and nectar plants in relation to their botanical composition, layout, and surrounding hardscape. Multivariate analysis explained 71% of the variation, with significantly more eggs and larvae found in gardens having milkweeds spatially isolated as opposed to closely intermixed with non-host plants, and in gardens having 100 m north/south access unimpeded by structures. Numerous programs encourage citizens to establish gardens with milkweed and nectar plants to help offset habitat loss across the monarch's breeding range. Our findings suggest guidelines for garden design that can help make the urban sector's contributions to monarch habitat restoration more rewarding for participants, and of greater potential value to monarch recovery.

TI  - Sad song in the Delta: The potential for historical archaeology in the I-69 corridor
PY  - 2008
AB  - The Mississippi Delta has historically been, and continues to be, one of the most tormented regions in the South. John Emmerich, former editor and publisher of the Greenwood Commonwealth, noted in 1991 in a Time magazine article that the Delta has \"the highest rate of everything bad, like teen pregnancy, and the lowest rate of everything good, like income\" (Sidey 1991). In the 1960s, from Memphis to Vicksburg, this area was one of the deadliest battlegrounds in the Civil Rights movement, and one of the poorest and blackest parts of this country. Blacks who had not left Delta cotton plantations to migrate to Northern cities suffered horrible poverty and, in some cases, near-starvation. When Robert F. Kennedy visited the Delta in 1967, he expressed (cited in Sidey 1991) his shock at the living conditions there, saying, \"My God, I didn't know this kind of thing existed. How can a country like this allow it?\". Copyright © 2008 The University of Alabama Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Geospatial assessment of human-wildlife-environment interactions for spatial decision support
PY  - 2021
AB  - Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) is a global concern that requires geospatial data collection, analysis and geovisualization for decision support and mitigation. Bull African elephants, (<iLoxodonata africana</i), are often responsible for breaking fences, raiding crops and causing economic hardship in local communities in Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Methods for monitoring and understanding elephant movements are needed to mitigate conflict, find ways for coexistence and secure the future of Africa's elephant populations. Researchers from academia and conservation organizations are partnering with decision makers and scientists of the Zimbabwe Department of National Park and Wild Life Management (PWMA) to track the movement of 15 bull elephants in the general area of Victoria Falls to analyse spatio-temporal patterns of elephant behaviour related to climatic factors, habitat conditions and changing land uses. Spatial decision support for local famers, resource managers and planners will assist in avoiding agricultural expansion and urban development that coincides with elephant corridors and access to water resources. © Author(s) 2021.

TI  - Vegetation of the presettlement forests of northern New England and New York
PY  - 2000
AB  - The lotting surveys from northern New England and New York provide a unique opportunity to derive quantitative documentary evidence on past forests. Due to the distinctive \"proprietory town\" land tenure system, northern New England has an extensive and virtually untapped archive of land division surveys done prior to settlement (1763-1820). I searched archives throughout Vermont, New Hampshire, and northern New York and located records from 179 towns documenting 48,260 individual trees across the region. Surveyors used 131 separate vernacular names representing at least 49 recognizable species. This collection of town-wide witness tree relative frequencies is a consistent and unbiased empirical estimate of the composition of the natural vegetation before confounding land use. Five ubiquitous taxa (beech, spruces, maples, hemlock, birches) comprised 79% of the witness trees. Beech (32%) consistently dominated the region with greater than 60% of the trees in some towns. Spruce (14%) was the second most abundant species and found throughout the region. Maples (12%) were consistently distributed with peak abundance in Vermont. Hemlock (12%) had a patchy distribution with pockets of abundance, including the eastern Adirondacks. Birches (9%) were a species group with higher abundance in the mountains or to the north. White pine was consistently uncommon with very low (<1%) abundance on the uplands. A dramatic \"oak-beech\" tension zone or ecotone separated the oak-pine vegetation in the major southern valleys from the spruce-maple-beech composition northward. The central tendency was toward spruce-hardwoods with distinctive variants in the north, the Taconics, and the Champlain Valley. Major fires and blowdowns were equally rare and affected only 0.5% of the region. Fire was frequent only in the Hudson-Champlain corridor and windthrow was a low-level background disturbance. The most dramatic changes documented over the past 200 years have been the decline of beech and the profound effects of human land use.

TI  - Lost floodplain wetland environments and efforts to restore connectivity, habitat, and water quality settings on the Great Barrier Reef
PY  - 2019
AB  - Managers are moving toward implementing large-scale coastal ecosystem restoration projects, however, many fail to achieve desired outcomes. Among the key reasons for this is the lack of integration with a whole-of-catchment approach, the scale of the project (temporal, spatial), the requirement for on-going costs for maintenance, the lack of clear objectives, a focus on threats rather than services/values, funding cycles, engagement or change in stakeholders, and prioritization of project sites. Here we critically assess the outcomes of activities in three coastal wetland complexes positioned along the catchments of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon, Australia, that have been subjected to restoration investment over a number of decades. Each floodplain has been modified by intensive agricultural production, heavy industry and mining infrastructure, urban/peri urban expansion, aquaculture development and infrastructure expansion. Most development has occurred in low-lying coastal floodplains, resulting in major hydrological modifications to the landscape. This has left the floodplain wetlands in a degraded and hydrologically modified state, with poor water quality (hypoxic, eutrophication, sedimentation, and persistent turbidity), loss of habitat, and disconnected because of flow hydraulic barriers, excessive aquatic plant growth, or establishment of invasive species. Successful GBR wetland ecosystem restoration and management first requires an understanding of what constitutes \"success\" and must be underpinned by an understanding of complex cause and effect pathways, with a focus on management of services and values. This approach should recognize that these wetlands are still assets in a modified landscape. Suitable, long term, scientific knowledge is necessary to provide government and private companies with the confidence and comfort that their investment delivers dividend (environmental) returns. © 2019 Waltham, Burrows, Wegscheidl, Buelow, Ronan, Connolly, Groves, Marie-Audas, Creighton and Sheaves.

TI  - Landscape and population drivers of ungulate-vehicle collisions in Portugal
PY  - 2023
AB  - Ungulate-vehicle collisions (UVC) have been steadily increasing throughout Europe, posing a risk to human safety, representing an extra factor of animals death. Here, we used information of a 2-year roadkill (2019–2020) monitoring of wild ungulates (wild boar, red deer and roe deer) to assess the drivers that influence the likelihood of UVC in Portugal. Our results support the contention that the variables promoting the collisions varied markedly between species, including the importance of land use and cover (wild boar and red deer), water availability and movement corridors (wild boar), ungulate population density (wild boar) and road topology (wild boar, red deer and roe deer) in the likelihood of UVC. The significant and positive interaction between urbanized and forest areas shows that regions sharing characteristics of both urban and natural environments represent a high-risk for the occurrence of collisions. The application of mitigation actions in these regions are welcome and should focus on reducing its attractiveness and/or the abundance of ungulate populations. Awareness campaigns and species-specific signalling may also contribute to a general decrease of casualties. We advocate that continued efforts of data collection are pivotal to assess the local relevance of fine-scale predictors amenable to manage. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Effect of temperature on the occurrence and distribution of colorado potato beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in China
PY  - 2014
AB  - Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is the most destructive pest of potato in many countries of the world. It first invaded China from Kazakhstan in 1990s and now is a major pest of potato in many areas of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature on the spread of Colorado potato beetle in China after its invasion. Cold temperature in winter (December) and high temperature in summer (July) were analyzed in accordance with the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang. The boundary between the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang nearly coincided with the -8°C isotherm of monthly mean minimum temperature in winter. The stress of the low temperature in winter for Colorado potato beetle basically disappeared in the southeastern Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province of China, suggesting that the Hexi Corridor is the best channel to prevent any long-distance invasions of Colorado potato beetle into the Central Plains region. However, in Turpan City in northeastern Xinjiang, the extremely hot weather in the summer prevents the local colonization of Colorado potato beetle. Furthermore, according to our monitoring, high temperature in summer also limited Colorado potato beetle to diffuse eastward through Turpan. Results of this study suggest that it is essential to strengthen inspection and quarantine measures to prevent any artificial transmissions of Colorado potato beetle spreading eastward and thus to ensure the sustainable production of potato and other Solanaceae crops in northwest regions of China. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.

TI  - Alien and endemic flora at reference and non-reference sites in Mediterranean-type streams in Portugal
PY  - 2007
AB  - 1. A comparison was made between a variety of alien and endemic plant species from 272 aquatic and riparian habitats in Portuguese Mediterranean-type streams in reference condition - i.e. nearnatural river corridors - and non-reference condition. The objective was to detect differences in relative proportion and cover between these species groups. The differences in endemic and alien flora from siliceous and calcareous river types were also analysed. Environmental and human disturbance factors were related with the richness and cover of both species groups. 2. A total of 568 species were found, of which 44 were alien and 28 were endemic. Alien species were present at 91% of the surveyed locations, and were consistently more widespread at non-reference sites than at reference ones for both river types, with calcareous sites having a higher invasibility. Endemic species occurred at 45% of the sampling sites and displayed a significantly lower richness and cover than their alien counterparts. 3. Alien richness and cover were positively related to direct human disturbance within the river systems, and with floodplain uses such as urban occupation, intensive agriculture, and nutrient inputs. Endemic species also respond to anthropogenic variables, rather than to climatic and geographical ones, with richness and cover increasing as human impacts on fluvial systems and related floodplains decrease. 4. Comprehensive control of alien invasive species and the protection of endemic plant populations will require attempts at monitoring ecological river integrity, and the achievement of 'good ecological status' - one of the goals of the European Union's Water Framework Directive. Portuguese riparian areas must be managed in such a way as to protect the relatively few preserved riparian habitats by lowering the direct and indirect pressures in fluvial corridors and thus preventing future alien plant invasions.

TI  - Maryland's Green Infrastructure Assessment: Development of a comprehensive approach to land conservation
PY  - 2006
AB  - Like many parts of the US, Maryland is urbanizing rapidly. The scattered pattern of low-density development consumes an excessive amount of land, fragments the landscape, displaces many native species, and disrupts ecosystem functions. Maryland's Green Infrastructure Assessment is a tool developed in the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to help identify and rank those areas of greatest statewide ecological importance, as well as those at greatest risk of loss to development. It identifies large contiguous blocks of natural land (hubs), interconnected by natural corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs and corridors were ranked within their physiographic region for a variety of ecological and development risk parameters, as well as combinations of these. Prioritization was also done on a finer scale (0.127 ha) for ecological importance and vulnerability to development, allowing a more detailed analysis for site prioritization within the network. The hub and corridor framework identified through the Green Infrastructure Assessment is being used to guide Maryland's ongoing land conservation efforts. At a multi-state scale, the green infrastructure method has been used as the framework for setting landscape ecological priorities within the Chesapeake Bay program. At a regional scale, the method has been used to rank or focus areas for state land conservation programs. Within a local government planning context, the method is now being translated into locally relevant criteria to support county-scale green infrastructure initiatives. Finally, the cell-based ranking method has been incorporated into parcel prioritization that has been used to aid state, local and private land trust conservation decision-making. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Late-Pleistocene to precolumbian behind-the-arc mafic volcanism in the eastern Mexican Volcanic Belt; implications for future hazards
PY  - 2002
AB  - An area of widespread alkaline-to-subalkaline volcanism lies at the northern end of the Cofre de Perote-Citlaltépetl (Pico de Orizaba) volcanic chain in the eastern Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB). Two principal areas were active. About a dozen latest-Pleistocene to precolumbian vents form the 11-km-wide, E-W-trending Cofre de Perote vent cluster (CPVC) at 2300-2800 m elevation on the flank of the largely Pleistocene Cofre de Perote shield volcano and produced an extensive lava field that covers &gt; 100 km2. More widely dispersed vents form the Naolinco volcanic field (NVF) in the Sierra de Chiconquiaco north of the city of Jalapa (Xalapa). Three generations of flows are delineated by cone and lava-flow morphology, degree of vegetation and cultivation, and radiocarbon dating. The flows lie in the behind-the-arc portion of the northeastern part of the MVB and show major- and trace-element chemical patterns transitional between intraplate and subduction zone environments. Flows of the oldest group originated from La Joya cinder cone (radiocarbon ages ~ 42 000 yr BP) at the eastern end of the CPVC. This cone fed an olivine-basaltic flow field of ~ 20 km2 that extends about 14 km southeast to underlie the heavily populated northern outskirts of Jalapa, the capital city of the state of Veracruz. The Central Cone Group (CCG), of intermediate age, consists of four morphologically youthful cinder cones and associated vents that were the source of a lava field &gt; 27 km2 of late-Pleistocene or Holocene age. The youngest group includes the westernmost flow, from Cerro Colorado, and a lava flow ~ 2980 BP from the Rincón de Chapultepec scoria cone of the NVF. The latest eruption, from the compound El Volcancillo scoria cone, occurred about 870 radiocarbon years ago and produced two chemically and rheologically diverse lava flows that are among the youngest precolumbian flows in México and resemble paired aa-pahoehoe flows from Mauna Loa volcano. The El Volcancillo eruption initially produced the high effusion rate, short-duration Toxtlacuaya alkaline aa lava flow from the southeastern crater. This 12-km-long hawaiite (average 50.5% SiO2) flow was followed by extrusion of the calc-alkaline Río Naolinco lava flow from the northwestern crater. This large-volume (~ 1.3 km3) tube-fed basaltic pahoehoe flow (average SiO2 49%) traveled 50 km. Inferred effusion rates suggest emplacement over a decade-long period. Flows of all three age groups are transected by Highway 140 and the railway that form major transportation arteries between Jalapa and Puebla. This area has not previously been considered to be at volcanic risk, but volcanism here has continued into precolumbian time. Future eruptions of similar magnitude and location to those documented here could pose significant hazards to transportation corridors and to densely populated areas in and to the north of Jalapa. Slight variations in vent locations could produce future flows down one or more of more than a half dozen drainages with widely varying population densities. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Part IV summary: Reconciliation of conservation with socio-economic development
PY  - 2012
AB  - This last book chapter describes the theoretical framework related to the valuation of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation, analyzes the Galápagos development history by looking at its geographical connectivity with the world and proposes an alternative production model for Galápagos, which defines its development capacity in terms of the archipelago’s potential for providing ecosystem services to its population of local residents and tourists. In his chapter, Robert Costanza clarifies concepts in ecological economics and shows that the assessment of the trade-offs among ecosystem services and between ecosystem services and other contributors to human well-being requires profound research with regard to the interconnections between humans and the rest of nature. He presents conceptual and empirical tools for making these connections and discusses the difficulties in valuing biodiversity and ecosystem services with reference to the Galápagos Islands. He insists that to achieve sustainability we must incorporate natural capital and the ecosystem’s goods and services into our economic and social accounting and our systems of social choice. In estimating these values, we must consider how much of our ecological life support systems we can afford to lose. Costanza defines sustainability as the amount of consumption that can be sustained indefinitely without degrading “natural capital”, here defined as “a stock that yields a flow of valuable goods or services into the future”; for example, a stock or population of trees or fish that can provide a flow or annual yield which is sustainable year after year. The sustainable flow is “natural income”; the stock that yields the sustainable flow is “natural capital”. Natural capital may also provide services like recycling waste materials or water catchment and erosion control, which are also counted as natural income. Since the flow of services from ecosystems requires that they function as whole systems, the structure and diversity of the ecosystem is a critical component of natural capital. Costanza emphasizes that the Galápagos Islands represent a huge asset for humanity just like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, both being producers of ecosystem services and having iconic natural features, and are large stores of unique biodiversity and a source of scientific knowledge about biodiversity and its role in the co-evolution of humans and the rest of nature. He sees the largest values for the Galápagos in the realm of “cultural” ecosystem services (i.e. conservation value) and only moderate importance for several other more “production”-oriented ecosystem services (but see the essay of Wolff and Gardener, who see great scope for a development towards a self-sustained Galápagos using its “production”-oriented ecosystem services in order to reduce the Galápagos dependency to the continent). In his chapter “Nature and the World: A Geohistory of Galápagos”, Christophe Grenier shows that the Galápagos archipelago is fully integrated into the World System geohistory and analyses the increasing connectivity of this once isolated oceanic archipelago with mainland America and beyond through a series of schematics. Globalization, that is the general geographical opening of every region on the planet that presents economic or strategic interests for transnational, international or national actors, is complete in Galápagos. He shows that the consequences of this growing geographical opening of Galápagos are enormous, whether direct or indirect. The archipelago is rapidly losing its singularity, not only from an ecological point of view but also culturally. The main actors concerned - the Ecuadorian state, regional institutions, island inhabitants, local and foreign tourism enterprises, etc. - consider Galápagos to be like any ordinary region, ruled by the same economic “laws”, seeking the same kind of “development” and with Galapagueños wanting the same lifestyle as urban populations from other parts of the world. For these reasons, many of the archipelago’s ecosystems are in danger. His geohistorical approach to the human history of Galápagos demonstrates that people are the main drivers of the archipelago’s recent natural history, by opening it to the outside world and a flood of introduced species. Putting geographic space at the core of conservation policy may help to find solutions to reduce the Galápagos geographical opening in a sustainable manner for the island population. This implies a change in the tourism model in order to shift from quantity to quality by reducing the number of visitors and organizing a real ecotourism; to stop fuel subsidies and promote alternative energy sources; banning further imports of motor vehicles and implementing public transport; controlling immigration; providing better local education and training; and improving the quality and availability of locally produced food instead of importing most of the food supply. In the final chapter Matthias Wolff and Mark Gardener continue with the analysis of the present development of Galápagos and reflect on the problem of estimating the population and visitor carrying capacity of the Galápagos archipelago. It is argued that through the strongly growing tourism industry (9-10% economic growth per year), the process of habitat degradation, biodiversity loss and contamination is accelerated. While technological solutions for reducing the local ecological footprint (such as shipping waste away and improving quarantine systems) may slow this degradation process down, they will not stop it. An alternative model is proposed, which defines the development capacity (i.e. the number of people the archipelago may sustain) in terms of the archipelago’s potential for providing ecosystem services to its population of local residents and tourists (food, waste recycling and renewable energy). This increases selfsustainability and reduces dependence on the continental and the global market. © 2012 selection and editorial material, Matthias Wolff and Mark Gardener; individual chapters, the contributors.

TI  - Leaving more than footprints: Anthropogenic nutrient subsidies to a protected area
PY  - 2022
AB  - Mobile animals that traverse ecosystem boundaries can fundamentally reshape environments by providing critical nutrient and energy inputs to the ecosystems they inhabit. In particular, aggregations of seabirds often transform coastal and island ecosystems through large amounts of nutrient-rich guano deposition. Anthropogenically driven losses of these subsidies can occur through changes in abundance of mobile species, including seabirds, and have been shown to drive whole-scale ecosystem state change on islands. However, even though many species that forage on anthropogenic food sources are highly mobile and may thus play important roles in moving nutrients from urban systems to otherwise conserved ecosystems, the impacts of anthropogenic supplements on spatial subsidies have been largely ignored. Here we examine the effects of large nesting colonies of Western Gulls (Larus occidentalis), a generalist carnivore known to forage on human refuse, on the Channel Islands of California. Specifically, we explore how their foraging on human subsidies may change nutrient deposition patterns at their relatively remote and protected breeding islands. We equipped gulls with GPS loggers to assess the frequency of urban foraging, and we partnered this tracking data with bird density data to estimate the rate of wild and urban-derived guano deposition on two different islands. Consistent with research on other gull species, we found high (up to 40%) but island-specific rates of urban foraging, resulting between 66 and 93 kg ha−1 of guano in these two sites during the breeding season, a level greater than half the amount of fertilizer applied annually in typical commercial agricultural settings and likely the primary source of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to this system. Specifically, we estimate that 27 kg ha−1 year−1 of nutrient-rich guano is shuttled to these otherwise isolated islands from anthropogenic sources. This research highlights the large shadow (i.e., footprint) that human activity can cast on even remote ecosystems by driving significant nutrient enrichment through impacts on animal behavior and connectivity. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Spatiotemporal railway use by grizzly bears in Canada's Rocky Mountains
PY  - 2019
AB  - Railway networks contribute to the direct mortality of wildlife through collisions with trains, which can threaten vulnerable wildlife populations even in protected areas, including grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Banff and Yoho National Parks, Canada. Mitigation to reduce bear-train collisions requires information about how grizzly bears use the railway spatially and temporally and how particular types of use might increase collision vulnerability. We used data from 27 grizzly bears fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars between 2000 and 2016 to relate railway use by bears via resource selection functions to variables that described land cover, human use, and topography. We used the same suite of explanatory variables to distinguish pairs of 4 types of steps, in which 3 successive GPS points (with 2-hr fix rates) included ≥1 within 30 m of the rail (hereafter on) and 2 others that defined locations where bears effectively entered the railway (first fix off rail, next 2 on), crossed it (only the middle fix on the rail), continued along the railway (all 3 fixes on), or exited the railway corridor (first 2 on, last off). We compared both sites of higher use and each of these 4 step types to the relative frequency of bear-train collisions, predicting a positive correlation for continue step types. Relative to available locations, bears were more likely to use the railway close to railroad sidings (sections of twinned track where trains sometimes stop), at intermediate distances from human-use features (e.g., town sites, highways, trails), in areas with lower values of the compound topographic index (a proxy for wetness; within 500 m), and within 90 m of rugged terrain. Seasonally, bears made greater use of the railway in spring and fall. Among 1,515 sequences of 3 steps, crossing locations comprised >50% and were most distinct from continue locations (about 20%), which occurred in areas with more rugged terrain (within 300 m), closer to railway sidings, in spring and fall, and with steps that were 60% shorter. Contrary to our prediction, past reports of bear-train collisions were negatively correlated with continue locations and unrelated to overall use or any other movement type. Our results suggest that railway use by bears increased where it provided increased forage or easier travel, particularly in spring and fall, but more work will be needed to determine the mechanistic basis of bear-train collisions. Meanwhile, mitigation efforts such as habitat alteration or warning systems might target locations where past strikes are concentrated for grizzly bears or other sensitive populations. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © 2019 The Wildlife Society

TI  - Onehunga foreshore restoration project
PY  - 2015
AB  - Major urban infrastructure historically were carried out with a strong focus on their primary function. This has resulted in motorways, rail and other infrastructure corridors sometimes separating communities from their coastal edge. There is now strong community desire for amenity, accessibility and bio-diversity enhancement to be considered as part of major urban infrastructure design and many large infrastructure projects now include these matters as parts of the design brief. The challenge is to include these elements in a cost effective and meaningful way. An even greater challenge is to retrofit amenity, accessibility and bio-diversity enhancements to existing infrastructure developments. This paper describes the process of foreshore restoration of the coastal suburb of Onehunga, situated on the shores of Manukau Harbour, Auckland, focussing on the foreshore design components. The foreshore was separated from the harbour in 1975 as part of Auckland's motorway development programme that was initiated in the 1950's. The proposed amenity enhancements were not carried out at the time due to budget constraints. Through ongoing community advocacy, Auckland Council and the New Zealand Transport Agency revisited the issue with a vision to; restore the coastline of Onehunga Bay and the recreational and amenity values which once existed there; reconnect the community to the foreshore; provide improved pedestrian and cycle connections; enhance visual amenity and natural character and provide facilities for public enjoyment of the coast. The preferred design concept was developed through a competition process via consortia comprised of both contractors and consultants to provide both creative and affordable solutions. The winning consortia including Fulton Hogan Ltd, Tonkin & Taylor, Isthmus Group and URS was commissioned to gain consent and complete the design and construction for 6.8 Ha new park land; three sand beaches, six gravel shell beaches, a pedestrian and cycle bridge, a boat ramp as well as a bio-diversity offset for marine birds to address the loss of intertidal area. Design innovation was achieved with a strong focus on understanding the natural character and coastal processes operating at the site to create 1.4 km of soft edge to replace 700 m of rock revetment and to create a landform that included varying topography to reflect to surrounding landscape.

TI  - Promoting Atmospheric-River and Snowmelt-Fueled Biogeomorphic Processes by Restoring River-Floodplain Connectivity in California’s Central Valley
PY  - 2015
AB  - Potential biogeomorphic benefits from intentional levee breaks and weir overflow on the managed floodplain-river system of California's Sacramento and San Joaquin River watershed (Central Valley) are discussed here. Prior to the nineteenth century, the system was characterized by natural levees alongside complex multichanneled rivers and tributaries, and geomorphic processes such as channel migration and avulsion, typical in lowland floodplain-river systems globally, dominated. Today, the floodplain-river system has been heavily modified with infrastructure such as levee embankments that disconnect floodplains from channels and diminish key processes of floodplain-river ecology. Unintentional levee breaks in river systems where floodplains have been developed for agriculture or urban uses still occur regularly (in a quarter of twentieth century years) and are sometimes catastrophic. Floodplain inundation, erosion, and sedimentation, the dominant geomorphic processes that occur during unintentional levee breaks, are flood risks in such embanked river systems. Climate and flood variability still dictate the frequency of unintentional levee breaks despite many decades of engineering. Of particular consequence are the so-called atmospheric-river (AR) storms. Since 1951, 81 % of breaks have occurred as a result of AR storms and flooding, while most of the rest occurred during snowmelt floods. Intentional levee breaks or planned weir overflows that are designed for floodplain restoration can facilitate a return towards more natural and dynamic biogeomorphic processes. In areas where room for flood-driven geomorphic processes is available on floodplains, local sediment scour and deposition near a levee break promote topographic diversity that enhances vegetation establishment and floodplain habitat. This chapter summarizes our current understanding of climate processes and flood variability that govern unintentional levee breaks or weir overflow. We also review examples of alternative flood management approaches in the Central Valley that promote processes necessary to restore or sustain lowland floodplain biogeomorphology. Future climate-driven changes in flood regime, such as enhanced flooding during winter months or more frequent atmospheric rivers, could be accommodated by additional intentional levee breaks or planned weir overflow for restoration. Implementation of these alternatives could be used to improve restoration policy and management of floods in embanked river floodplains. © Springer New York 2015.

TI  - Intelligent mobile messaging for urban networks: Adaptive intelligent mobile messaging based on reinforcement learning
PY  - 2016
AB  - Mobile messaging has become a trend in our daily lives. The current schema for messaging is to route all the messages between mobile users through a centralized server. This scheme, though reliable, creates very heavy load on the server. It is possible for users to communicate through peer-to-peer (P2P) connection, especially over urban networks characterized by heavy user traffic and dense network connectivity. P2P connections however do not provide the best user experience, as they are sometimes unreliable due to network coverage fluctuation. We propose an intelligent messaging framework based on reinforcement learning to strike a balance between reducing server load and improving user experience. The system learns and adapts in real-time to user mobility and messaging patterns. The adaptive system dynamically chooses between routing through the server and routing via P2P connection. As it does not rely on user location information, user privacy is thus preserved. Performance evaluation through simulation of user movement and messaging patterns demonstrates that the system is able to find the best messaging policy for users, achieving a well balance between heavy server load and unreliable communication, and provides a fine user messaging experience while reducing server load. We believe that this work is significant for future smart environments and urban networking where mobile messaging will be prominent among mobile users as well as mobile smart objects. © 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Microhabitats of planted sea wall strips used by pollinators and Orthoptera
PY  - 2020
AB  - As part of an Urban Buzz scheme, strips of teasel (Dipsacus fullonum) and greater knapweed (Centaurea scabiosa) have been established along a sea wall flood defense in the UK to provide a corridor of flower-rich habitat for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The cutting of tall grassland and planting of dicotyledons also created a suitable short sward environment (c. 30 cm height) for Orthoptera nymphs in the establishment year (2018). However, by 2019, the grassland in the pollinator strips was taller (c. 75 cm) and suboptimal for grasshoppers; in contrast to Roesel's bush-cricket (Roeseliana roeselii), which inhabited the taller vegetation in greater abundance. The progression to established grassland with flowering D. fullonum saw the pollinator strips attract significantly higher numbers of bees and butterflies than the floristically poor control strips. This small-scale study illustrates that pollinator strips can have multi-functional benefits for ecosystems beyond pollination, with Orthoptera of tall grassland (R. roeselii) likely to persist alongside planted wildflowers. © 2020 Pensoft Publishers.

TI  - Movement paths of koalas in the urban-rural fringes of Ballarat, Victoria: implications for management
PY  - 1991
AB  - The problem of road deaths has led to a study of the mobility of Phascolarctos cinereus and their use of a range of disturbed habitats varying from natural remnant eucalypt forest to planted residential areas and Pinus radiata planatations. These broad habitat types, together with large areas of agricultural land create a mosaic in a human-dominated landscape. Translocated koalas move extensively from their relocation site in contrast to non-translocated koalas whose activities tend to be localized. Translocated koalas continue to move for several months, but eventually the path taken loses directionality and activity becomes localized in their preferred habitat. The localised movements of non-translocated koalas result in intensive use of a limited area. Koalas were able to cross large tracts of open and alienated land. Success in crossing these spaces suggests that continuous tracts of habitat in the form of vegetation corridors are not essential for koala movement. -from Author

TI  - Northeast LRT rail-with-trail
PY  - 2005
AB  - Many abandoned rail lines have been converted to multi-use trails, however there are only a few trails in Canada adjacent to active rail systems. Extending from the east side of Downtown, Edmonton's Light Rail Transit (LRT) right-of-way includes a parallel, 3.0 kilometre long multi-use trail. The asphalt trail is 4.0 metres wide for use by pedestrians, cyclists and other active modes, connecting Downtown with Northlands Park, Edmonton's principal indoor hockey venue and exhibition centre. Planning is underway to extend the trail an additional 4.1 kilometres to link to the North Saskatchewan River Valley trail system. Edmonton's Transportation Master Plan (1999) highlighted the importance of providing a mix of travel options. A ten-year goal was to develop non-motorised facilities along rail and utility rights-of-way. City Council has since approved a 62 kilometre Multi-use Trail Corridor Network that will service all quadrants of the city. The trail corridors are equivalent to the arterial roadway system for vehicles, and form the backbone to the citywide trail system for year round use. The Rail-with-Trail along the LRT is the primary link to northeast Edmonton. During the planning and design process, foremost tasks included conducting an independent safety audit, value engineering session and extensive review to safely integrate the multi-use trail with the surrounding roadway network and LRT operations. Similar case studies were researched, VISSIM simulation models utilised to examine different crossing options, and innovative signal timings developed to coordinate the trail crossing signal with both the roadway network and any approaching LRT vehicles. Compatibility with LRT operations was a major consideration, ranging from trespassing concerns on the rails, delineating the adjacent rail and trail facilities, and discouraging unauthorised access to LRT stations. A broad project team was established including engineers, designers, signals experts, LRT drivers, maintenance and security personnel, each of whom contributed to design development. Construction of Edmonton's Northeast LRT Rail-with-Trail occurred between 2002 and 2005. An opening took place August 29, 2002, that also celebrated installation of a community mural created during a local art festival. Other elements to beautify the corridor include tree planting, landscaping nodes and unique trail lighting.

TI  - Local and landscape influence on richness of amphibian species breeding in seasonal ponds in the spanish south- atlantic littoral. Impact determination
PY  - 2015
AB  - The increase in urban land and the continuous increment of road network experienced by littoral zones contribute to the loss, degradation and isolation of both terrestrial and aquatic habitats in which amphibians spend the different stages of their life cycle. The aim of this study is to explain the relationship between the characteristics of 17 seasonal ponds located in the Atlantic littoral of Cádiz province (SW Spain), the land uses in their surroundings, the road network, and the diversity of amphibian species. Our results show that amphibian richness is higher in larger ponds with longer hydroperiods, surrounded by forest and scrubland, and away from the nearest road. Roads, and in particular secondary roads, have a great and negative impact on amphibian richness be- cause the shorter the distance between the pond and the road was, the fewer breeding species were found. From the data obtained in this study, we have classified the ponds according to their status of conservation. This classification demonstrates that 94% of the studied ponds require immediate measures to be taken in order to reduce the negative impact of habitat fragmentation caused by roads. Finally, in order to maintain healthy amphibian populations at the long term, forests and scrublands surrounding ponds must be protected, and connectivity among ponds, as well as with the terrestrial habitats in the vicinity, must be ensured. Preventing amphibians from road kills during their migration movements can be achieved by means of constructing underpasses and tunnels in hot spots. © Asociacion Herpetologica Espanola.

AB  - Urban and agricultural development has resulted in drastically modified riverine corridors that are often considered to be detrimental to the recovery of anadromous salmonid populations. Although mitigation features (e.g., large wood and shallow-water areas) are frequently incorporated in flood control infrastructure to offset the impacts of streambank stabilization, little is known regarding their effectiveness and the habitat characteristics associated with enhanced nearshore rearing conditions in large rivers. We evaluated two measures of habitat use by emigrating juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha relative to different shoreline types (rock revetment [riprap], mitigated, and natural) and analyzed associations between environmental characteristics and habitat occupancy using a large number of presence/absence samples in the lower Sacramento River, California. We found both measures of habitat use to be significantly higher at natural shorelines and those including mitigation features than at shorelines consisting predominantly of rock revetment. A predictive logistic regression model suggested that the density of woody material and inundated terrestrial vegetation, depth, and substrate type significantly affected habitat occupancy. Despite a moderate predictive capability (62% of correctly classified records in a leave-one-out simulation), the model was useful in identifying habitat characteristics associated with significantly increased habitat use in this large, low-gradient river, most notably the presence of instream cover (wood or vegetation), gently sloping streambanks, fine substrate, and variable nearshore current velocity. Conversely, habitat occupancy by juvenile Chinook Salmon diminished with large, rocky substrate and increased depth, characteristics favored by introduced predatory Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu. This study illustrates the value of incorporating mitigation features and identifies characteristics that enhance habitat use by emigrating juvenile Chinook Salmon. © 2018 American Fisheries Society

TI  - Mineral industries, growth corridors and agricultural development in Africa
PY  - 2013
AB  - An extractive industries boom in Africa is driving unprecedented expansion of infrastructure into sparsely populated regions. Much of the investment is in high-volume minerals such as iron and coal that will require heavy infrastructure and large settled workforces. New roads and railways are being built to support these industries. Mineral infrastructure is reinforcing the dynamic of designated \"growth corridors\", which are increasingly determining settlement patterns and rural land use in Africa. These corridors are penetrating into areas where agriculture has been constrained by lack of access to markets. They could unleash a major expansion of arable crops in the Guinea and Miombo savannahs, tropical tree crops in Congo Basin rainforests and irrigated agriculture on the floodplains of several African river systems. Rapidly growing African cities are largely dependent on imported food but growth corridors linking them to hinterland areas could favour shifts to African-sourced foods. Governance weaknesses may allow outside investors to make land grabs along growth corridors and further marginalise poor smallholders. New pressures on environmentally sensitive areas may emerge. Policy changes are needed to avoid negative impacts of this major new development trend and to exploit the potential for poverty alleviation and food-security benefits. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sewage mediated transfer of antibiotic resistance to River Yamuna in Delhi, India
PY  - 2020
AB  - Increase in antibiotic resistance (AR) in environment is a global health concern as the emergence of AR is limiting the treatment options. Inappropriate and indiscriminate uses of antibiotics are known causes for the spread of AR but lack of access to safe drinking water and poor sanitation aggravate the problem. The present study aims to estimate the abundance of coliforms, carbapenem and ESBL resistant bacteria and respective resistant genes in 20 sewer drains and 5 locations of the river Yamuna across New Delhi over two seasons. Significant positive correlations were observed between FC levels and carbapenem (R = 0.90,p = 0.002,n = 40) and ESBL resistant bacteria (R = 0.93,p = 0.005,n = 40) levels across all the samples, indicating possible association of resistant bacteria with faecal matter. However, higher abundances of coliforms, resistant bacteria and genes were observed in winter relative to summer season. Poor/lack of connectivity between drains and sewage treatment plants (STPs) and thus discharge of treated/untreated sewage at different locations of the river Yamuna is the major reason for increasing the pollution load of the river. Microbial culturing indicated presence of \"critical pathogen\" listed by WHO in urgent need of new antibiotics in the collected samples. Overall, release of untreated sewage into the river Yamuna carried by the sewer drains poses a high risk to the people residing in the city and highlights an urgent need to treat the entire sewage. Complete treatment of the entire sewage generated using treatment techniques such as advanced oxidation processes (80-90%) could reduce the introduction of these emerging pollutants in the environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Integrated management of waterbirds: Beyond the conventional
PY  - 2002
AB  - Integrated waterbird management over the past few decades has implicitly referred to methods for managing wetlands that usually attempt to enhance habitat for taxonomic groups such as shorebirds and wading birds, in addition to waterfowl, the traditional focus group. Here I describe five elements of integration in management: taxonomic, spatial, temporal, population and habitat, and multiple-use management objectives. Spatial integration simply expands the scale of management concern. Rather than emphasizing management on a very limited number of impoundments or wetlands in small refuges or wildlife management areas, the vision is beginning to shift to connectivity within larger landscapes on the order of many square kilometers as telemetry data on daily and seasonal movements for many species become available. Temporal integration refers to the potential for either simultaneous management for waterbirds and commercial \"crops\" (e.g., crayfish and rice) or for temporally-staggered management such as row crop production in spring-summer growing seasons and waterbird management on fallow fields in the non-growing (winter) season. Integrating population dynamics with habitats has become a major research focus over the past decade. Identifying which wetlands are \"sources\" or \"sinks\" for specific populations provides managers with critical information about effective management. Further, the applications of spatially explicit population models place heavy demands on researchers to identify use patterns for breeding and dispersing individuals by age, sex, and reproductive class. Population viability analysis models require much the same information. Finally, multiple-use management integration refers to trying to optimize the uses of wetlands, when only one (perhaps secondary) use may include waterbird management. Depending upon the ownership and primary land use of a particular parcel of land containing wetlands and/or water bodies, managing for waterbirds may be an \"easy sell\" (e.g., public natural resource lands) or a very contentious one, where wetlands are created for industrial, aquaculture or urban uses. In the latter case, careful planning and implementation require broad stakeholder participation and education.

TI  - Land-use effects on river habitat quality and sediment granulometry along a 4th-order tropical river
PY  - 2013
AB  - Land-use change is among the most important human impacts on habitat quality and species diversity. In this study, we investigated the effects of land use on river habitat quality and sediment granulometry in a larger tropical river, affected by urbanization and agricultural land use. We selected 15 representative sampling reaches in the Rio das Mortes basin, 12 of them along the main river from its headwater to its mouth, and 3 in major tributaries. A habitat survey was conducted in these reaches in the dry season 2010 and sediment samples were taken for granulometry analyses. Sub-basin land cover of reaches was dominated by natural vegetation (41.6 to 60.2% of total land cover), followed by agricultural land cover (38.4% to 56.9%) and urban land cover (1.4% to 5.6%). Sediments were dominated by poorly to moderately sorted silts to sands, little conducive to diverse biological communities. According to the river habitat survey, all investigated river reaches exhibited moderately to totally disturbed habitat integrity, due to diverse and often co-occurring human impacts, such as riparian deforestation, water abstraction, sand and gravel extraction, and margin erosion. Only one of the investigated sampling reaches exhibited the minimum riparian forest corridor width demanded by the Brazilian Forest Code. Our results indicated that river habitat and sediment quality mainly depended on conditions in the direct vicinity of river reaches. Accordingly, initial cost-effective restoration of aquatic habitats could be achieved by relatively simple channel restoration measures and the protection of the riparian corridor in the investigated tropical river.

TI  - A critically-endangered capuchin (Sapajus apella margaritae) living in mountain forest fragments on isla de margarita, Venezuela
PY  - 2013
AB  - There are currently only two islands in the Caribbean that harbour Neotropical primates, Isla de Margarita with an endemic capuchin Sapajus apella margaritae; and Trinidad with two endemic monkeys Cebus albifrons trinitatis and Alouatta seniculus insulanus and the recently introduced brown capuchin Sapajus apella. These Caribbean monkeys live in habitat islands surrounded by towns, agricultural areas and roads, and their main threats are habitat fragmentation and hunting. In this case study, conducted on a fragment scale on Isla de Margarita, we report on the Margarita capuchin distribution and encounter rates of monkey groups and signs, as well the location of introduced primates in the Margarita capuchin habitat. We conducted reconnaissance surveys and interviews with local people and hunters. Line-transect surveys by distance sampling were carried out in the forest fragments where capuchins were found. Margarita capuchins live in four forest fragments; two of them are protected areas. The abundance of introduced howler monkeys and wedge-capped capuchins in the mountains could not be quantified and it is assumed they are likely to be low, but generates concern about resource competition, disease transmission and hybridisation. Capuchins on Isla de Margarita seem to prefer the evergreen forest when this is available, but they also live in a forest fragment entirely covered by dry vegetation. Corridors have been proposed to increase the capacity of dispersal of primates among forest fragments as an important factor for their longterm survival on the Island. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

TI  - Landscape planning for a rural ecosystem: Case study of a resettlement area for residents from land submerged by the Three Gorges Reservoir, China
PY  - 2003
AB  - The goals of landscape planning are multiple for rural ecosystems of the resettlement area in the Hubei Province of China. They relate to the types, diversity and patterns of the ecosystems, and to the conservation of ecosystem functions and biodiversity. We were interested in the improvement of socio-economic conditions, and the promotion of the development of farmland ecosystems and natural forest ecosystems. The landscape planning took into account the conservation and the restoration of forestlands, and the reconstructions of farmlands, towns and villages. The areas of towns and villages were assigned by trade-off analysis balancing ecological, economic and social benefits. The spatial pattern of used lands was designed by a multi-criteria optimal spatial planning, resulting in the strengthening of some primary ecosystem functions. In the resettlement area forests will expand to a matrix, and cropland patches together with tree fences will form patch-corridor systems. Significant ecological, economic and social benefits can be derived from this landscape pattern.

TI  - Researchon the landscape pattern of tidal flat reclamation area in jiangsu coastal zone based on GF-1 satellite imagery
PY  - 2018
AB  - The tidal flat in the transitional belt between land and ocean is deeply disturbed by human reclamation activity. The reclamation and development of tidal flat is the specific land use pattern of coastal zone. Jiangsu province possesses abundant tideland resources and a large-scale tidal flat reclamation has taken place in Jiangsu during the past several decades. Analysis of the landscape pattern of reclamation is one of the important components to realize the sustainable development in the coastal zone. This paper takes Yancheng City of Jiangsu as a case to analysis the landscape pattern of reclamation area by using GF-1 satellite imagery. The panchromatic and multispectral data were resampled for geometric correction and fused to obtain the multispectral data of 2m resolution. Object-based classification method was taken to classify different landscape categories in study area. Wheat paddies, rape paddies, forest and grass, rive and lake, aquaculture ponds, facility aquaculture, facility planting, industrial land and traffic land were extracted separately from the GF-1 imagery through multi-resolution segmentation, training samples selection, classification features establishment. Landscape indices of area, shape and distribution characteristics were calculated by using Fragstats software for analyses. The results show that within the study area, high resolution GF-1 satellite imagery could identify landscape types in tidal flat reclamation area and offer reliable information for the landscape pattern analysis. The cultivated land (including wheat paddies, rape paddies) and aquaculture area (including facility aquaculture and aquaculture ponds) are the main landscape types in the study area and the shape of most of the landscape type is very regular, which reflected the characteristics of intensification. As the corridors of the study area, traffic land, river and lake played a better connecting function and the overall connectivity of the landscape is relatively high. The distribution of landscape types is uneven, but the overall concentration trend is obvious. © 2018 IEEE.

PY  - 2022
AB  - Most of sidewalks, especially in developing countries, are roled as public area with many social activities besides as the main function for serving pedestrian movement. Therefore, sidewalks may need some facilities to support user activities, namely benches, planting, including stalls for street vendors. The aims of this research is to evaluate pedestrian facilities in two different characteristic zone y.i. residential and business area in Yogyakarta city using Pedestrian Index (P-Index) method. The data are collected in KHA Dahlan-H Agus Salim-Kauman coridors, and Sudirman-Suroto coridors, that both coridors are considered residential and business area in downtown of Yogyakarta. Some variables are taken in to account, namely mobility, safety, facility, and accessibility. The results reveal that the pedestrian facilities are supportive towards pedestrians. The sidewalk in Sudirman-Suroto corridors are better in safety aspect, but must be improved. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Methodological proposal for the study of livestock trails from the landscape. Application to the cordel de gamBogaz (Seville)
PY  - 2021
AB  - The relationship between walking, the contemplation of the landscape and the network of roads and livestock trails is argued by resorting to the origin of these roads, that is, trails designed to facilitate the movement of animals at the slow pace of herds and shepherds. Although the function of transhumance is currently residual, the livestock trails are being recovered and used by the competent administrations, with the aim of improving the articulation of the territory through which they pass, favoring biodiversity and landscape diversification in urban environments and, to a large extent, responding to the new citizen demands related to leisure, sports and recreational activities typical of today’s society. This work makes a methodological proposal for these public itineraries from the intervention in the landscape, taking as a case study a livestock trail of the Metropolitan Green Corridor of Seville, the Cordel de Gambogaz, which runs between the capital of Seville and the town of Santiponce. © 2021, Ministerio de Fomento.

TI  - The configuration of forest cover in Ribeirão Preto: A diagnosis of Brazil's forest code implementation
PY  - 2020
AB  - The fragmentation of forests is a consequence of human activities that intensively change the natural landscapes. In Brazil, there is a long-standing legal framework for native vegetation protection, called Forest Code. The last update is from 2012. The revisions incorporated in this restructured code (Law No. 12,651/12) encompassed new rules, rights and obligations for adequate land use management of productive systems and for environmental conservation and protection. An example of a protective measure was the creation of a Legal Reserve inside the rural properties and Areas of Permanent Protection around the watercourses. This study explored the effects of implementing the new code on the spatial and temporal evolution of forest cover fragmentation since the legal changes were set up. In that context, the area, perimeter and shape (circularity index) of forest fragments, as well as the buffer strips along watercourses, were assessed from 2010 to 2016 within the municipality of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo state, Brazil. The assessment resorted to remote sensing techniques and visual inspection of orbital images. It was clear from the results that forest patches became more abundant but smaller, more dispersed and elongated, and that this route to fragmentation was hinged on a chaotic expansion of urban and agricultural areas. Important edge effects were anticipated from these results. The area numbers revealed that Ribeirão Preto was 7.95% covered with forest fragments in 2010, while this percentage rose to 8.03% in 2013 and reached 8.35% in 2016. Most of this increase occurred within a 30-meter wide buffer along the watercourses. This was a positive outcome. However, the numbers also revealed that forested areas smaller than 51 hectares increased from 71% in 2010 to 73% in 2016. The conclusions were that implementation of Law No. 12,651/12 is leading to an increase of forestland, but not yet promoting sustainability, namely through improved connectivity among fragments for reduction of edge effects and provision ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - The diet of powerful owls (Ninox strenua) and prey availability in a continuum of habitats from disturbed urban fringe to protected forest environments in south-eastern Australia
PY  - 2006
AB  - This study investigates the diet of six breeding pairs of powerful owls in the Yarra Valley Corridor in Victoria, Australia, and compares prey consumption with prey availability. The six sites represent a continuum of habitats, ranging from urban Melbourne, through the urban fringe interface to a more forested landscape. We found that powerful owls in the Yarra Valley Corridor are reliant almost exclusively on arboreal marsupial prey as their preferred diet, with 99% of their overall diet comprising four arboreal marsupial species. These four species (the common ringtail possum, common brushtail possum, sugar glider and greater glider) were also the most abundant species observed while spotlighting; however, their abundance varied along the continuum. There was a strong positive relationship with the presence of these species in the diet and their site-specific availability, indicating that the powerful owl is a generalist hunter, preying on the most available prey at a given site and in a given season. This study suggests that food resources are high in these disturbed urban fringe sites and it is unlikely that food availability in urban environments will limit the potential survival of urban powerful owls. © CSIRO 2006.

TI  - Seismic Performance and Recovery Modeling of Natural Gas Networks at the Community Level Using Building Demand
PY  - 2019
AB  - Earthquakes can substantially disrupt the operation of critical lifelines in a community, particularly water, gas, and other below-ground infrastructure. The damage that occurs to lifelines in a community from an earthquake can, in turn, have a substantial impact, resulting in social and economic disruption. Furthermore, the duration of the loss in functionality of lifelines is a key factor in the economic disruption that results from an earthquake. In this study, a virtual community known as Centerville was subjected to earthquakes of varying intensity, each having the same assigned point source location, using a well-known attenuation model in order to examine the restoration of communities in the aftermath of an earthquake. The virtual community model being studied has the essential physical components that describe a community, but the focus of this paper is the natural gas network, which is composed of a processing plant, compressor stations, city gate stations, district regulating stations, and buried pipelines. Based on the level of damage that occurred to the network components and their connectivity (topology) throughout the community, the functionality of supplier nodes is assessed using Monte Carlo simulation, and functionality curves are presented for the community's natural gas network. Notably, the effect of the industrial makeup of a community on its natural gas recovery following an earthquake, as well as the influence of replacing conventional steel pipes with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) ductile pipelines, is examined. As expected, the ability of the HDPE pipe to reduce the network recovery time is substantial and is quantifiable at the community level using the approach presented herein. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - At the urban level, different site characteristics (natural river and agricultural park; ex-industrial renewal; existing workmen's village and ancient 13th-century Borgo Minore; new railway connections; and new residential development) were coordinated within a unique, organic, energy-ecological holistic urban planning design. The urban comfort, microclimate, and site qualities are responsive to the urban design. Improving ventilation within the public open space has been carried out according to the direction of the prevailing wind during the various seasons (wind corridors); protection from winter wind (through rows of trees) and promotion of summer wind penetration have also been achieved, with a consequent reduction in building energy demand. At the building level, microclimates have been created that are responsive to urban texture and building typologies. Optimization of the architectural form and functions of exterior and interior open and closed building spaces has occurred through Fluent simulations (fluid dynamic software simulations). The building typology interventions utilize a cooling system for ventilation through a stack effect, integrated with the convective loop system and combined with the use of a chimney to achieve a cooling and ventilation system that is able to produce, in summertime, a good microclimate and adequate indoor conditions. The installation of obstruction/reflection elements outside the passive systems of the windows permits sun radiation to be screened during the hot period and reflects the direct solar radiation on the ceiling in winter time, thus using the ceiling as a thermal storage element and reflecting the remaining solar radiation in order to obtain uniform natural lighting system without glare. © Richard Hyde, 2008.

TI  - Assessment of the historical environmental changes from a survey of local residents in an urban-rural catchment
PY  - 2013
AB  - When attempting to address the environmental problems of a catchment, it is important to consider changes in a long-term environmental context. However, the long-term data on the state of the environment that are required for such an examination are rarely documented. Such data collection typically requires several years of investigation and observation. In addition, as there may be a significant time lag between the occurrence of a phenomenon and its cause, subsequent environmental investigations of changing animal and plant states scaling up to 5 years may be inadequate. We conducted a long-term analysis of the environmental changes in five sub-catchments of the Nagara River, Japan, assessing a period of 30 years, using a questionnaire survey approach involving local communities. Four sub-catchments of the Yoshida River were also analyzed for comparison. In addition, we attempted to clarify the relationship between various environmental factors and the space-time response of animals and plants. The survey included eight topics: assumed information, hydrological characteristics, habitat conditions for living things, forest state, land cover conditions, river awareness, free-entry information, and respondent information. Our method also has academic significance in that it validates the environmental agent extraction technique using a questionnaire survey. Our results identify management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss due to climate change. Forest management and human activities should be undertaken with care, and the environmental context going forward into the next century should be considered for integrated catchment management. Elsewhere, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, and/or efforts to provide corridors to ease species movements may be necessary at the global level. © 2013 The Authors.

TI  - The distribution and environmental state of vegetated islands within human-impacted European rivers
PY  - 2012
AB  - 1.Vegetated islands within river corridors are pivotal landscape features and are among the first to disappear as a consequence of flow regulation and channelisation. However, how vegetated islands vary along human-impacted rivers is poorly understood. 2.We carried out a detailed analysis of the contemporary distribution, diversity and environmental state of vegetated islands within 12 human-impacted European rivers, using 75 Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images (1999-2002), historical maps, DEM data and landscape metrics. We tested whether channel fragmentation, catchment land use and the environmental state of fringing floodplains determine the spatial patterns of the islands. We also analysed the historical change of islands within selected sections of the Upper Danube, Upper Rhine and Olt rivers. 3.We identified 2771 islands in the contemporary landscape, varying from 0.06 to 9828ha. Islands covered up to 21% of the active channel area and contributed up to 32% of the total riparian ecotone length. Island density ranged from 0.06 islands per river-km (River Sava) to 1.6 islands per river-km (River Tagliamento). River regulation has led to a marked loss of island density: 94% in the Upper Danube, 93% in the Upper Rhine, and 69% in the Olt. The environmental state of the islands was significantly less altered by human activity than of their fringing floodplains; 93.4% of the vegetated islands exhibited a near-natural state, while 86% of the fringing floodplains were expansively converted to agricultural and urban land uses. 4.Our results highlight the ubiquitous presence of vegetated islands, their sensitivity to river regulation and their pivotal role for the future restoration and management of river corridors. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Distribution of the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) in an urban environment using environmental DNA
PY  - 2022
AB  - The boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) is at risk of extinction in parts of its range in Canada. Our objectives were to quantify the influence of local and landscape characteristics on the occurrence of the species in wetlands in southern Québec. We hypothesized that site occupancy depends on local characteristics and landscape characteristics contributing to site connectivity. We developed an environmental DNA (eDNA) method to detect the species and compared the detection probability of this method to traditional call surveys. We collected water samples from a total of 180 sites (90 in 2017, 110 in 2018), whereas we surveyed a subset of 63 sites using both eDNA and call surveys in 2018. Site occupancy varied across years, but was higher in sites where the species had been previously detected during the last 12 years by other studies. Site occupancy did not vary with other local and landscape characteristics, in part due to an apparent decrease in the number of sites occupied by the species since the last 12 years. Detection probability via eDNA (0.81; 95% CI: [0.31; 0.98]) did not differ from that of call surveys (0.62; 95% CI: [0.25; 0.89]). To identify the optimal sampling period for the boreal chorus frog, future studies should estimate the detection probability of eDNA during the breeding season and the larval development period of the species. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Analysis of human and Philippine teak forest interaction in the lasang-baybay landscape along Verde Island Passage Marine Corridor, Batangas Province, Philippines
PY  - 2021
AB  - This study determined the local ecological knowledge (LEK) on the uses of plants in the Philippine teak forest (PTF) landscape and proposed a framework for conservation practitioners reconciling anthropogenic change drivers and ecological values of the PTF. Using techniques in participatory resource appraisal (PRA), facilitated focused group discussion (FGD), and key informant interviews (KIIs), the information on LEK on the plant uses were gathered among the villagers in the lasang (satoyama) and baybay (satoumi) in Batangas City and the municipality of Lobo, Batangas Province. Results show that the local community in the study site had a good perception of the multiple ecological functions of the Philippine teak (Tectona philippinensis) forest. The PTF is integral in the lives of the local community as a component wood source for the construction of their dwellings and shelters of domestic farm animals. Cultivated plants in the agroecosystems were observed as best alternatives to sustain the harvesting of some indigenous plants such as Vitex parviflora and T. philippinensis for the livelihood and material culture of the local population. Since the old times, molave (V. parviflora) trees have been used to build houses of the century-old dwellings in the localities, suggesting that the species had been dwindling its abundance in the wild. This could also explain the reason for the. © 2020 Institution for Marine and Island Cultures, Mokpo National University.

TI  - Field inspections according to prEN 16841-1:2015 in a naturally evolved neighborhood of industry and living areas. state-of-the-art-technology of a comprehensive data collection, interaction of different sources and effects on the perceiving citizens
PY  - 2016
AB  - An increasing complaint situation on odour nuisance in the cities Mainz and Wiesbaden in the Rhine corridor brought the ministries of the two German counties Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate to the decision that comprehensive field measurements are necessary to determine the real impact situation. The Olfasense GmbH (formerly Odournet GmbH) conducted this huge field inspection on behalf of the ministries. The measurement area of around 7.500.000 m2 was covered with a grid of 157 measurement points and 100 grid cells. Over half a year a panel of 21 assessors conducted field measurements and assigned the occurring odours to 15 defined odour characters. The article will describe the advantages of the used web technology in comparison to the former proceeding with paper registration of odours especially due to the quick access to the results during the whole investigation period. This has several benefits for the local authorities and plant operators. It will present the results of the measurements according to prEN16841-1 and the Guideline on Odour in Ambient Air (GIRL) as well for the complete odour situation as for single odour characters. In parts the results showed a clear exceedance of the German limit values (allowed frequency of odour perception) for living areas. We will provide a discussion on the influence of odours of different sources and different characters occurring in the same period of time (odour hour) and the attempt to relate this to the effects on the citizens. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

TI  - Discovery and implementation of Magellanic woodpecker (Campephilus magellanicus) as an emblematic species: A biocultural approach for conservation in Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve
PY  - 2007
AB  - At the southernmost part of South America there is Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve where the Magellanic sub-Antarctic evergreen unfragmented the Nothofagus forests still persist. This zone has been considered as one of the world's most pristine regions and this area is currently subject to increasing development pressures from new connectivity, urban expansion and tourism development. Using a biocultural approach we found that the Magellanic Woodpecker (Campephilus magellanicus) is the favorite bird for the community of Puerto Williams, the world's southernmost town and the biggest human centre in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Although, significant differences (P< 0,05) exists between the preferences of the sociocultural groups toward birds, all groups agreed in their preferences toward the Magellanic woodpecker. This species of bird was the preferred for the people who have been longer in Cape Horn; the members of the Yahgan Indigenous Community and long time residents. The analysis of these results as well as the discovery of ten attributes that this species of picid presents which in addition is the largest of South America, have taken us to consider it like a charismatic or emblematic species with a high potential for the conservation of the austral forests of Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. For this previous reasons the Magellanic woodpecker could be transformed into a symbol or a charismatic species for the conservation of the pristine austral forest. Between the year 2005 and 2007 we developed the Magellanic Woodpecker Implementation Program with the objective to increase both its intrinsic value and habitat valuation and the knowledge from the local community. The discovery of this species potential as well as their later implementation may contribute to the conservation of the fragile, singular and beautiful austral forests and its singular biological and cultural diversity.

PY  - 1996
AB  - Lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) winter in the Grand Calumet River - Indiana Harbor Canal (GCR-IHC) drainage into southern Lake Michigan, a polluted oasis in the highly urban and industrial corridor of northern Illinois and Indiana. The GCR-IHC is an important wintering area for lesser scaup in northwestern Indiana, especially after Lake Michigan freezes, because of the lack of other wildlife habitat in the area. We investigated the feeding and movement patterns of these wintering lesser scaup to better understand the ecological significance of this area to wintering waterfowl and to interpret contaminant levels in these lesser scaup. We implanted radio transmitters in 20 individuals in January 1994 and tracked them until early March 1994. Four lesser scaup disappeared and four died within the first 2 weeks after implantation; 12 lesser scaup remained in the GCR-IHC for the next 6-7 weeks, individual radio-marked scaup (n = 12) were located in the GCR-IHC on an average of 62.2% (extreme values = 25-87%) of the searches. No radio-marked lesser scaup were located outside the GCR-IHC. Lesser scaup were feeding during 23% of the radio fixes.

TI  - A multiple natural hazard analysis, SECMOL College region, near Leh, Ladakh, North India, with applications for community-based DRR
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose: This paper places a college at the centreof a multi-hazard assessment (earthquake, flood and landslide). The college is within a less studied, rural area of Ladakh, North India. Research focusses on a case study (Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) College), close to Leh, Ladakh, and extends to incorporate/apply thinking from/to the wider Ladakh region. The approach adopted, centring on the hazard assessment of a single entity/local area, allows a rapid uptake of hazard recommendations within a college environment planning to continue its existence for decades ahead. A sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) documents the active involvement of college staff and students in the principles of geohazard assessment and the development of student-centric hazard assessments of the college and their home village. SECMOL is a self-sufficient, alternative, college, organised along strong environmentally sustainable principles. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This work has adopted different strategies for different hazards. Fieldwork involved the collection of quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. shape and size of valleys/river channels/valley sides, estimation of vegetation density, measurement of sediment clasts, angle of slopes, assessment of sediment character, stratigraphy of floodplains and identification of vulnerable elements). These data were combined with satellite image analysis to: define river catchment character and flood vulnerability (e.g. using the methodology of Collier and Fox, 2003), examine catchment connectivity, and examine landslip scars and generic terrain analysis. Literature studies and seismic database interrogation allowed the calculation of potential catchment floodwater volumes, and the collation of epicentre, magnitude, depth and date of seismic events, together with recent thinking on the return period of large Himalayan earthquakes. These data were used to develop geological-seismic and river catchment maps, the identification of vulnerable elements, and disaster scenario analyses. Findings: This research concludes that SECMOL, and much of the Ladakh region, is exposed to significant seismic, flood and landslide hazard risk. High magnitude earthquakes have return periods of 100s to c. 1,000 years in the Himalayas and can produce intense levels of damage. It is prudent to maximise earthquake engineering wherever possible. The 2010 Leh floods demonstrated high levels of devastation: these floods could severely damage the SECMOL campus if storms were centred close by. This study reveals the connectivity of catchments at varying altitudes and the potential interactions of adjacent catchments. Evacuation plans need to be developed for the college. Northern ridges at SECMOL could bury parts of the campus if mobilised by earthquakes/rainfall. Slope angles can be lowered and large boulders moved to reduce risk. This work reinforces recommendations that relate to building quality and urban/rural planning, e.g. using spatial planning to keep people away from high-risk zones. Practical implications: The frequency of hazards is low, but potential impacts high to very high. Hazard mitigation actions include engineering options for hazardous slopes, buildings to be earthquake-proofed, and evacuation management for large floods. Originality/value: Methodologies undertaken in this research are well-tested. Linkages between disciplines are ambitious and somewhat original. The application of this work to a specific college centre site with the capacity to rapidly take up recommendations is novel. The identification of catchment inter-connectivity in this part of Ladakh is novel. This work complements a sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) for community aspects of this study, adding to the novelty value. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Man bites mosquito: Understanding the contribution of human movement to vector-borne disease dynamics
PY  - 2009
AB  - In metropolitan areas people travel frequently and extensively but often in highly structured commuting patterns. We investigate the role of this type of human movement in the epidemiology of vector-borne pathogens such as dengue. Analysis is based on a metapopulation model where mobile humans connect static mosquito subpopulations. We find that, due to frequency dependent biting, infection incidence in the human and mosquito populations is almost independent of the duration of contact. If the mosquito population is not uniformly distributed between patches the transmission potential of the pathogen at the metapopulation level, as summarized by the basic reproductive number, is determined by the size of the largest subpopulation and reduced by stronger connectivity. Global extinction of the pathogen is less likely when increased human movement enhances the rescue effect but, in contrast to classical theory, it is not minimized at an intermediate level of connectivity. We conclude that hubs and reservoirs of infection can be places people visit frequently but briefly and the relative importance of human and mosquito populations in maintaining the pathogen depends on the distribution of the mosquito population and the variability in human travel patterns. These results offer an insight in to the paradoxical observation of resurgent urban vector-borne disease despite increased investment in vector control and suggest that successful public health intervention may require a dual approach. Prospective studies can be used to identify areas with large mosquito populations that are also visited by a large fraction of the human population. Retrospective studies can be used to map recent movements of infected people, pinpointing the mosquito subpopulation from which they acquired the infection and others to which they may have transmitted it. © 2009 Adams, Kapan.

TI  - Regional strategic transportation plan regional municipality of Wood Buffalo
PY  - 2010
AB  - The key economic engines in Alberta's Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo are oil sands development, gas processing, forestry, and tourism activities. The Municipality's rapid growth in the past few decades has been mainly driven by large scale investments in oil sands projects; this growth has resulted in significant pressure on the Municipality's transportation network. Additionally, some rural communities surrounding Fort McMurray do not have access to an all-weather road network. Oil sands activity around the Municipality is increasing the need for more direct connections between these regions to ease the movement of goods, equipment, and people. The Municipality is currently experiencing a variety of development pressures. The Municipality's 2008 population was approximately 103,000 people and is expected to nearly double to 204,000 people by 2028. This population forecast is based on construction and operation employment activities associated with future oil sands and other resource-based industry projects. Ongoing improvement and expansion of the Regional Municipality's transportation network is vital to sustaining this anticipated growth. The Regional Strategic Transportation Plan addressed long-term transportation system requirements within the municipality. This study addressed required improvements to the existing regional transportation network and made recommendations for new connections that will allow the municipality to achieve its full potential as a major economic contributor in Canada. This study investigated the improvement of other transportation modes throughout the municipality, including transit, air, and water travel to resolve forecast congestion concerns. In addition to upgrading the region's main highway through Fort McMurray, the study recommends a bypass highway to carry additional traffic around the Fort McMurray Urban Service Area. With rapid growth in oil sands development, the number of vehicle trips between the Urban Service Area and plant sites has increased dramatically; additional oil sands projects coupled with increased production rates at existing sites will require innovative solutions. The study recommends a mass public transportation system to reduce traffic congestion, road expansion, and green house gas emissions. To enhance northern rural communities' development and to increase social ties, the study recommends an allweather road be constructed north, east, and west of Fort McMurray to service connectivity to surrounding areas.

TI  - Rapid Late Quaternary denudation of the Karacasu Graben in response to subsidence in the Büyük Menderes Corridor: Insights from morphotectonics and archaeogeology
PY  - 2020
AB  - The timing and geomorphological consequences of high-angle normal faulting in the Büyük Menderes Graben (W Anatolia) is an essential yet poorly studied issue that has been evaluated mostly regarding detachment faulting in the Central Menderes Core Complex. However, this subject has direct concerns related to ongoing debates regarding the level of seismic risk and the response of surface process to active tectonics in the most rapidly extending region in the world. To approach this problem, an integrated scheme was followed that involves the study of late Quaternary stratigraphy, terraces, and ancient and modern civic structures in the Karacasu Graben located on the southern uplifted block of the Büyük Menderes Graben. Our stratigraphic observations coupled with the existing micro-mammalian fossils demonstrate the widespread occurrence of terrestrial coarse red clastics (Karacasu Formation) before the appearance of the narrow-faulted corridor. The onset of high-angle normal faulting started with gradual denudation through the axial Dandalas Creek and its confluences southward while alluvial sedimentation remained active in the more southern areas of the Karacasu Graben. Ages from surface dating techniques (mainly OSL and cosmogenic radionuclides) show that previous knickpoints determined by the incision/accumulation threshold reached the vicinity of the antique Greek city of Aphrodisias, 30 km from the Büyük Menderes Valley with a headward erosion rate of 75mky−1 by the end of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).Incision rates derived from terraces and Roman aqueducts in the middle and upper reaches of the basin increased from 1 mmy−1 (background average geological rate for the last 65 ka) to 3 mmy−1in the last 2.3 ka, presumably due to increased population pressure in and around the vicinity of the city of Aphrodisias at the centre of the graben. Modern civic structures such as aqueducts and bridges constructed after the 1970's demonstrate the second wave of incision increased to as much as 10 mmy−1, likely due to increasing human pressure and the mechanisation of farming. On the other hand, inverse extrapolation of the knickpoint progression rate yields a surprisingly younger age of 400 ka for the birth of the new narrow tectonic corridor. This morphotectonic transformation exposed large depositional areas such as Karacasu and Bozdoğan grabens to erosion and should have resulted in a significant increase in the sediment supply to Büyük Menderes River. However, seismic investigations in the Aegean Sea have yet to identify the sedimentary record of this tectonic transformation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ecological vision drives post superfund cleanup river restoration
PY  - 2007
AB  - The West Branch of the DuPage River is a second order stream in Northeastern Illinois. At the Warrenville Grove Dam, it drains 90.4 sq. mi., which includes 18.4 sq. mi. drained by its largest first order Tributary Kress Creek. Waterborne deposition of inert - but radioactive - mine tailings containing low-level Thorium, (232Th) throughout a 7.5-mile reach of the river complex, set the stage for a massive cleanup under the CERCLA-Superfund program. In the immediate aftermath of the cleanup was a stream system pocked with excavations and construction operations that severely damaged both banks and the stream bed. More than half of the affected land and 60% of the shoreline is owned by the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, who have been actively managing their land for restoration to ecologically balanced conditions, and while the cleanup is a short term setback, the restoration of the land after the cleanup was viewed as an opportunity to further overall restoration goals. The immediate functions of the steam system - to move water and sediment - had to be reestablished as quickly as possible and in a manner that promoted dynamic stability. At the same time, opportunities to mitigate for the loss of aquatic habitat and wetlands had to be found and implemented. These sometimes conflicting imperatives have been balanced to provide a post-cleanup restoration that is expected to further enhance the biodiversity and functions of the aquatic, wetland, and upland communities. The entire affected stream reach was characterized both quantitatively and qualitatively for the presence of aquatic structure, function, and habitat, utilizing the IEPA stream assessment methodology (IEPA, 1994) to establish a baseline against which the long-term and short-term restoration effects can be compared. Quantitative measurements of water quality were also taken and monitored during the cleanup. Prior to excavation related to the cleanup, fish and mussels were collected, surveyed, and relocated to other stream reaches not affected by the cleanup, which produced a baseline census of the pre-cleanup aquatic community. Post-excavation restoration design emphasized the establishment of in-stream structure and a diversity of flow conditions and regimes to provide the broadest cross-section of habitats possible. Existing pool-riffle complexes were identified and restored as a part of the post clean-up activities, while a variety of in-stream structure was added, including bendway weirs, vortex weirs, and selective addition of boulders. Short-term habitat losses, such as in-stream woody debris and undercut banks were mitigated to jumpstart the return of the biotic community. Commitments for maintenance and monitoring under CERCLA afford the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the restoration over a longer term, and the continued post restoration management activities of the Forest Preserve District cast a vision for the recovery of a degraded urban stream corridor. © 2007 ASCE.

TI  - Fish passes - an ecological measure for the river and habitat continuity preservation in the Cris river basin
PY  - 2011
AB  - River Restoration represents an important domain for water authorities in Europe, especially due to the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/CE which aims at improving the status of rivers ecosystems in a broad, integrated, ecological perspective and to the new Flood Directive. Development of infra-structure projects associated with power supply, abstractions, waste disposal and both rural and urban land-use can all have impacts on the river systems and they threat the bio-diversity and sustainability of flora and fauna including the fish populations. Barriers to fish migration have profound consequences for hydrology and habitats, revering fisheries and upstream and downstream migration of fish. Flood protection is one of the key driving forces causing river and habitat continuity interruption in the Romania country. In Romania there are a small number of fish's passes in four river basins. Most structures, including large barrages, flood-control dams, sluices, flood gates etc., have been built for floods control, water conservation during dry periods, for hydropower, irrigation, for safety or for water supply. This paper focuses on ecological solutions for the fish migration, representing a limited effort related to the achievement of a good ecological status for the heavy modified bodies. Connectivity is crucial in the context of restoration. From a list of 788 reservoirs, only 77 dams/weirs were analyzed, being characterized by surface area above 50 ha and height of the dams until 15 m. The study case has been identified taking into account several criteria such as: the historical fish zone, the present monitoring fish data and the ecological prioritization criteria recommended by the International Commission for the Danube River Protection. The paper presents the ecological solution for the Abramut Crestur reservoir, created in 1976 year, after the sluicing of the Fancica river (total length: 25 km, surface: 100 km2) from the Cris River basin. The reservoir is situated in an agriculture area, characterized by low flows and two species of migratory fishes: Barbus barbus and Chondrostoma nasus. Before the embankment the floodplain provided an important habitat and food source (marshland and wet zone covered with reed) for migratory birds and fishes. The proposed ecological solution is to restore natural hydrological functions of the Fancica River by creating a lateral \"natural bypass channel\" for the fish, on the left side of the reservoir, all along the reservoir. Taking into account the neighborhoods of the dams it is enough space for the construction of the fish passes in \"cascade\", being equipped with artificial or natural obstacles such as weirs, stone-blocks and alluvial material mimicking a natural watercourse. The slope of such fish facility will be very slow, and long enough for providing resting areas for the fish. This way the proposed fish way could be an important means of redressing the detrimental effects of obstructions. © SGEM2011 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.

TI  - Towards the next generation of smart grids: Semantic and holonic multi-agent management of distributed energy resources
PY  - 2017
AB  - The energy landscape is experiencing accelerating change; centralized energy systems are being decarbonized, and transitioning towards distributed energy systems, facilitated by advances in power system management and information and communication technologies. This paper elaborates on these generations of energy systems by critically reviewing relevant authoritative literature. This includes a discussion of modern concepts such as ‘smart grid’, ‘microgrid’, ‘virtual power plant’ and ‘multi-energy system’, and the relationships between them, as well as the trends towards distributed intelligence and interoperability. Each of these emerging urban energy concepts holds merit when applied within a centralized grid paradigm, but very little research applies these approaches within the emerging energy landscape typified by a high penetration of distributed energy resources, prosumers (consumers and producers), interoperability, and big data. Given the ongoing boom in these fields, this will lead to new challenges and opportunities as the status-quo of energy systems changes dramatically. We argue that a new generation of holonic energy systems is required to orchestrate the interplay between these dense, diverse and distributed energy components. The paper therefore contributes a description of holonic energy systems and the implicit research required towards sustainability and resilience in the imminent energy landscape. This promotes the systemic features of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, and balances global and local system objectives, through adaptive control topologies and demand responsive energy management. Future research avenues are identified to support this transition regarding interoperability, secure distributed control and a system of systems approach.

TI  - Critical lands project, Flathead Lake Montana, USA
PY  - 2004
AB  - Flathead Lake located in Northwest Montana is the largest natural fresh water lake in western United States. Its ecosystem extending into British Columbia, Canada is characterized by spectacular mountain scenery including the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, other wild areas, abundant wildlife, sparkling lakes and rushing rivers. Traditional resource uses such as logging, mining, ranching and farming continue, but the area is growing in popularity for high tech industries, tourism and retirement. Although environmental quality is relatively high, scientific monitoring records continued deterioration of Flathead Lake water quality, loss of open space, fish and wildlife decline and diminishment of scenic values. Water quality has been steadily declining since 1977, manifested by increased algal growth and decreased water clarity. The Montana Department of Environmental Quality listed Flathead Lake in 1996 as an impaired water body in need of restoration. Consequently, total maximum daily loads (TMDL) were determined to help manage nutrient loads. Identified probable causes of impairment were: nutrients, siltation, suspended solids, flow alteration, organic enrichment, low dissolved oxygen, algal growth, PCB's, metals and noxious aquatic plants. The main sources of pollution include run off from urban sprawl, poor agricultural and timber harvest practices, old and poorly maintained septic systems and air pollution. Not wishing to wait for a drastic decline in ecosystem quality, such as has happened elsewhere, a small non-governmental organization (NGO), the Flathead Lakers, in 1999, initiated a pioneering effort to identify and protect the lands and waters most critical to the quality of Flathead Lake and is tributaries. This effort was initiated through member funding with subsequently some private foundation support. Partners in the effort include governments: county, state and federal, Salish-Kootenai Native American tribal council, a multi member basin commission, University of Montana and several NGO's. Key people, interested in the Flathead ecosystem, met in 1999 and developed science based criteria for identifying critical areas and associated threats to the ecosystem. They also helped evaluate threats, ecological defensibility of an area, and the feasibility for restoration/ conservation projects. Subsequently GIS malls were produced to assist in identifying critical lands and the threats. Flathead Lake Biological Station, University of Montana provided vital information for the effort. Based on this work, specific programs and projects have been identified for implementation. These include regulations prohibiting filling wetlands adjacent to the Lake, building restrictions, buffer zones and other land use tools for local governments, conservation easements on wetlands, restoration of riparian corridors, pristine farmlands, and priority tributaries. The project is unique and can be a model for other ecosystem wide restoration and protection efforts. Initiated and led by a small NGO, using a transparent, science-based approach; it has been able to bring together partners in action, overcoming the inertia that was prevailing. © International Scientific Publications, New Delhi.

TI  - Significance of perylene for source allocation of terrigenous organic matter in aquatic sediments
PY  - 2019
AB  - Perylene is a frequently abundant, and sometimes the only polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in aquatic sediments, but its origin has been subject of a longstanding debate in geochemical research and pollutant forensics because its historical record differs markedly from typical anthropogenic PAHs. Here we investigate whether perylene serves as a source-specific molecular marker of fungal activity in forest soils. We use a well-characterized sedimentary record (1735-1999) from the anoxic-bottom waters of the Pettaquamscutt River basin, RI to examine mass accumulation rates and isotope records of perylene, and compare them with total organic carbon and the anthropogenic PAH fluoranthene. We support our arguments with radiocarbon (14C) data of higher plant leaf-wax n-alkanoic acids. Isotope-mass balance-calculations of perylene and n-alkanoic acids indicate that ?40% of sedimentary organic matter is of terrestrial origin. Further, both terrestrial markers are pre-aged on millennial time-scales prior to burial in sediments and are insensitive to elevated 14C concentrations following nuclear weapons testing in the mid-20th Century. Instead, changes coincide with enhanced erosional flux during urban sprawl. These findings suggest that perylene is definitely a product of soil-derived fungi, and a powerful chemical tracer to study the spatial and temporal connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic environments. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Co-benefits of designing communities for active living: An exploration of literature
PY  - 2015
AB  - To reverse the global epidemic of physical inactivity that is responsible for more than 5 million deaths per year, many groups recommend creating \"activity-friendly environments.\" Such environments may have other benefits, beyond facilitating physical activity, but these potential co-benefits have not been well described. The purpose of the present paper is to explore a wide range of literature and conduct an initial summary of evidence on co-benefits of activityfriendly environments. An extensive but non-systematic review of scientific and \"gray\" literature was conducted. Five physical activity settings were defined: parks/open space/trails, urban design, transportation, schools, and workplaces/ buildings. Several evidence-based activity-friendly features were identified for each setting. Six potential outcomes/ co-benefits were searched: physical health, mental health, social benefits, safety/injury prevention, environmental sustainability, and economics. A total of 418 higher-quality findings were summarized. The overall summary indicated 22 of 30 setting by outcome combinations showed \"strong\" evidence of co-benefits. Each setting had strong evidence of at least three co-benefits, with only one occurrence of a net negative effect. All settings showed the potential to contribute to environmental sustainability and economic benefits. Specific environmental features with the strongest evidence of multiple co-benefits were park proximity, mixed land use, trees/greenery, accessibility and street connectivity, building design, and workplace physical activity policies/programs. The exploration revealed substantial evidence that designing community environments that make physical activity attractive and convenient is likely to produce additional important benefits. The extent of the evidence justifies systematic reviews and additional research to fill gaps. © 2015 Sallis et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

PY  - 2015
AB  - The Project aims at connecting Rangpo town (Sikkim State) with the existing Sivok Railway Station on N.F. Railway with a Broad Gauge Single Line in West Bengal State. This alignment will cross an area with steep hills, dense forests in the District of Darjeeling (West Bengal State) and East Sikkim (Sikkim State). Landslides are quite common in West Bengala and Sikkim causing relevant damages each year. The Special Publication no. 94 of the Geological Survey of India “An Inventory of Major Landslides in Sikkim—Darjeeling Himalaya” describes 164 major landslides: 32 rock slides, 33 debris slides and 99 complex slides. Landslides generally occur along one or more discrete surfaces and commonly involve earth and/or rock debris or bedrock, although sometimes both the bedrock and the shallow cover are involved. Local geological features and the high intensity of rainfall are the main causes of landslides occurrence. Yearly precipitation in the capital of Sikkim average ~3,539 mm, mainly occurring during the monsoon season. This work presents a landslide hazard map produced by combining a number of thematic raster datasets related to the triggering factors of shallow-landslides occurrence: Slope; Cover type; Vegetation; Prevailing mineralogical composition. Operational phases followed to produce the hazard map are the following: Data acquisition; Shallow landslide inventory map for the study area; Definition of unique condition units; Hazard assessment.

TI  - Channel rehabilitation at the brookside enhancement project, Oregon
PY  - 1998
AB  - Portland's Brookside Wetland and Stream Enhancement project is intended to exemplify a multi-objective approach to urban stream corridor management by providing numerous environmental benefits on one site. These include improvements such as augmented flood storage (the overriding objective of the project), streambank erosion control, and improved habitat conditions for fish. This paper focuses on the rehabilitation efforts undertaken along the approximately 0.8 kilometers ( 1/2 mile) of Johnson Creek traversing the project site. Before rehabilitation, the meandering channel was entrenched into a generally level floodplain as much as 4.5 meters (15 feet) and had rapidly eroding banks in many places. The channel also provided relatively limited habitat opportunities for salmonid fishes (which survive in small numbers in the creek), for which most inchannel habitat rehabilitation work was targeted. An important aspect of the project was the regrading of oversteepened channel banks to a lower, stable angle. Established streamside trees were preserved wherever possible and many additional riparian trees and shrubs will be planted this year and in 1998. Since soils are highly erodible, regraded channel banks were lined with coir matting to protect them until herbaceous vegetation can take hold. Biotechnical bank stabilization along eroding outer bend banks relied on vegetated geogrid treatments. These were constructed over a hardened bank toe comprised of large boulders and interspersed root wads. A unique bank cover/log crib revetment was also installed along a constructed channel cutoff. This provides a long section of artificial undercut bank, an extremely valuable type of fish habitat. Other improvements to fish habitat included the placement of large woody debris and boulders in the low-flow channel. All treatments will enhance channel complexity, providing both winter and summer holding habitat for fish. Excavation, grading, and the construction of streambank stabilization and instream habitat structures occurred during the summer of 1997. The author's experience in providing construction oversight highlighted a number of issues pertaining to the on-the-ground implementation of the project. Some of these are discussed in this paper.

TI  - Record-breaking wildfires in the world's largest continuous tropical wetland: Integrative fire management is urgently needed for both biodiversity and humans
PY  - 2021
AB  - In the Brazilian Pantanal, wildfire occurrence has increased, reaching record highs of over 40,000 km2 in 2020. Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Landscape dynamics around a hydropower plant in paraná state, brazil
PY  - 2020
AB  - Deforestation and fragmentation are two of the main factors responsible for climate change. The construction of large enterprises such as hydropower plants can modify landscape dynamics, boosting the urban centers and other economic land uses. We evaluated the landscape around Governador Bento Munhoz da Rocha Netto Hydropower Plant, Paraná, Brazil, aiming to identify the land use dynamics since its construction in 1980. Satellite images of the years 1976, 1984 and 2016 were obtained and landscape and patch metrics of composition, shape, core area, connectivity and isolation were calculated. The deforestation conversion profile was also evaluated. Our results showed a reduction of forest areas by 18.9%, with great replacement of forest stands. A large increase of small forest remnants was noted, indicating a high degree of landscape fragmentation and an expressive reduction of the core area. The deforestation profile revealed that the transformation rates were low, indicating gradual conversions. On the other hand, conversions of natural areas occurred in almost half the area in the initial years - which comprise the period after hydropower plant construction. Changes in the landscape may be related to the hydroelectric plant construction. However, the local economic cycle that happened naturally may have driven the forest fragmentation. © 2020 University of Sao Paolo. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identification of sources contributing to Mid-Atlantic regional aerosol
PY  - 2002
AB  - Source types or source regions contributing to the concentration of atmospheric fine particles measured at Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge, NJ, were identified using a factor analysis model called Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). Cluster analysis of backward air trajectories on days of high- and low-factor concentrations was used to link factors to potential source regions. Brigantine is a Class I visibility area with few local sources in the center of the eastern urban corridor and is therefore a good location to study Mid-Atlantic regional aerosol. Sulfate (expressed as ammonium sulfate) was the most abundant species, accounting for 49% of annual average fine mass. Organic compounds (22%; expressed as 1.4 × organic carbon) and ammonium nitrate (10%) were the next abundant species. Some evidence herein suggests that secondary organic aerosol formation is an important contributor to summertime regional aerosol. Nine factors were identified that contributed to PM2.5 mass concentrations: coal combustion factors (66%, summer and winter), sea salt factors (9%, fresh and aged), motor vehicle/mixed combustion (8%), diesel/Zn-Pb (6%), incinerator/industrial (5%), oil combustion (4%), and soil (2%). The aged sea salt concentrations were highest in springtime, when the land breeze-sea breeze cycle is strongest. Comparison of backward air trajectories of high- and low-concentration days suggests that Brigantine is surrounded by sources of oil combustion, motor vehicle/mixed combustion, and waste incinerator/industrial emissions that together account for 17% of PM2.5 mass. The diesel/Zn-Pb factor was associated with sources north and west of Brigantine. Coal combustion factors were associated with coal-fired power plants west and southwest of the site. Particulate carbon was associated not only with oil combustion, motor vehicle/mixed combustion, waste incinerator/industrial, and diesel/Pb-Zn, but also with the coal combustion factors, perhaps through common transport.

TI  - A review on spatial attributes of nature reserves and optimal site-selection methods
PY  - 2011
AB  - Nature reserves are considered effective means for protecting endangered and threatened species and critical ecosystems. Unfortunately, resources devoted to nature reserves are scarce, therefore establishing an effective conservation plan is an economic issue as much as it is ecological. Spatial attributes have been found important to affect the protected species' migration patterns, genetic exchanges, outside disturbances, etc. To promote the survival chances of protected species, spatial coherence of the reserve should be taken into account when choosing reserve sites. This raises two important issues: (1) what spatial attributes a reserve should possess to be an effective reserve, and (2) how can we select a subset from a large number of potential habitat sites to optimally allocate limited conservation resources. Although existing studies in the biological conservation literature do not provide explicit information about specific effects of different spatial attributes on protected species, generally large, compact, and contiguous reserve configurations are believed to work better. In the last decade, especially in recent years, many linear and nonlinear models were presented in the literature to incorporate various spatial attributes of the selected sites and their computational efficiency was demonstrated using empirical or hypothetic data. This paper summarizes the recent literature in this area with a particular focus on the modeling methods that addressed spatial attributes of the selected sites using linear integer programming. Four major spatial attributes are considered: (1) connectivity, (2) fragmentation and distance between selected sites, (3) boundary length and compactness, and (4) reserve area and core and buffer zones. Earlier studies have addressed these issues using rule-based heuristic algorithms. However, it has been shown in the literature that this method is inefficient in terms of optimal utilization of conservation resources because solutions obtained from heuristic algorithms often deviate significantly from the true optimal solutions. The spatial attributes mentioned above can also be modeled using linear integer programming that involves yes/no type decision variables, and small to medium scale reserve design models can be solved conveniently using off the shelf optimization software to find exact optimal solutions, and therefore to guide the optimal utilization of limited resources. Unfortunately, currently available optimization software have limited capability in solving large size site selection problems and their computational efficiency may be a bottleneck in practice. Furthermore, most of the models that incorporate spatial attributes are deterministic in the sense that they do not consider the uncertainty in species' occurrence in potential reserve sites or the probability of urban development for potential reserve sites. Some other models incorporated both types of uncertainty but they excluded spatial attributes of the selected sites. Incorporating both uncertainty and spatial attributes emerges as a new and important research direction in this area. The paper also elaborates on potential research topics in biodiversity and ecosystem conservation and related problems in China. Inefficient data, both on the species presence in potential sites and the cost-benefit values associated with individual sites may become an obstacle for applications of site selection models in real conservation practices in China.

TI  - From high rise to coast: Revitalizing riveira da barcarena
PY  - 2010
AB  - The Lisbon metropolitan region has grown rapidly in population since 1970, due largely to the immigration of people from former Portuguese colonies in Africa and from rural areas of the country in pursuit of higher living standards. Much of this population growth was accommodated clustered high-rise apartment blocks (many unpermitted) in the region west of Lisbon, in the municipalities Oeiras, Cascais, Sintra, and Amadora. These developments were largely unplanned, often did not provide for sewage treatment, and lack adequate mass transit or urban amenities such as parks and other open spaces. Moreover, because the main transport axes run east-west, it is difficult for residents of these apartment blocks to go the relatively short distance southward to the coast (e.g., only 10 km from Cacém to the coast). This region is drained by a set of subparallel streams (each draining about 20-50 km2), flowing roughly north-south through deeply incised valleys to debouch into the Atlantic between Lisbon and Cascais. With rapid urbanization peak runoff has increased, resulting from larger impervious surfaces and sewage from illegal housing settlements. Many reaches have been canalized within concrete walls to increase flood capacity, eliminating physical habitat complexity, and reducing amenity and recreational values. However, the urbanization has occurred mostly on uplands, leaving the bottomlands of the incised stream valleys in many reaches surprisingly unaltered. For decades, these drainages were largely neglected, managed mostly to convey floodwaters, although in some reaches there was strong informal use of the stream corridor and floodplains (such as garden plots). The Water Framework Directive (WFD) adopted by the EU Parliament (2000), has motivated extension and improvement of the regional sewer network to improve water quality. The WFD requires that all water bodies in member states achieve 'Good Ecological Status' by 2015, defined in terms of hydromorphological, biological, and physico-chemical quality elements of stream reaches, based on characteristics documented at reference sites. Located 15 km west of Lisbon, Ribeira da Barcarena-Jardas drains a 35 km2 catchment, whose uppermost reaches are forested, but otherwise alternates between urbanization and remnant agricultural and open-space uses. With improved sewage treatment and water quality, there is strong potential to preserve and restore ecological functions, consistent with goals of 'good ecological status.' As illustrated by the successful urban stream project in Cacém, there is tremendous potential for the stream corridor to provide parkland for the dense urban settlements. Through GIS analysis of remotely-sensed data, and field surveys of water quality, habitat structure, riparian vegetation, and fish populations, an interdisciplinary workshop of graduate students from Berkeley and Lisbon analyzed potential opportunities to enhance ecological values and human access along the stream. Our analysis indicated that implementation of stormwater management strategies via relatively unobtrusive retrofits of small open bits of urban land and floodplain within the catchment could mitigate many of the negative hydrologic effects of urbanization. By virtue of its linear nature, the stream corridors could provide pedestrian and bicycle connections from population centers (now under-served by parklands) to cultural features and to coastal beaches and trails. A trail could inspire similar efforts on neighboring, parallel basins that have undergone similar urbanization pressures and face similar challenges in providing underserved urban populations with access to recreation and contact with nature.

TI  - Factors in the design of an urban microbat flyway
PY  - 2011
AB  - Bat surveys were conducted during 2006 and 2007 in the Willoughby Local Government Area (LGA) in the northern suburbs of Sydney to determine the occurrence and movement of microbats. Based on the frequency of bat detections and the direction of bat movements, two major and five minor bat flyways were identified in the study area.The two major flyways were north-south movement corridors that occurred on the eastern and western margins of the LGA; each major flyway had minor flyways branching from them. The two major flyways were separated from each other by the Pacific Highway rise that runs north-south through the centre of the study area. The rise acts as an effective flyway barrier as tree corridors are completely disrupted by an exposed, noisy, night-illuminated residential and commercial strip. Minor bat flyways approach the Pacific Highway rise from the east and west and are only separated by a relatively short distance. Extending these flyways to create an east-west passage across the study area would greatly extend the foraging range of bats on either side of it. In order to link the major flyways, the eastern and western minor flyways need to be extended by the creation of a continuous tree canopy through residential areas to the Pacific Highway rise. Controlled street planting and supported private plantings of trees along strategic routes, together with modified street lighting could achieve this result. The crossing of the Pacific Highway would require the construction of a lightweight \"flyover bridge\" that commenced and ended in the extended tree canopies. This would provide a wind and light shielded crossing point for bats attempting to fly east-west across the Willoughby LGA.The components of the \"flyover bridge\" are discussed along with other considerations in achieving an effective extended flyway through a densely populated residential area.

TI  - Wildfire frequency varies with the size and shape of fuel types in southeastern France: Implications for environmental management
PY  - 2013
AB  - Characterizing time intervals between successive fires in the recent history is of main interest for fire hazard prevention and sustainable environmental management as it indicates what the typical fire return interval for each type of ecosystem is. We tested the extent to which fire return intervals (FRIs) depend on fuel type and age, and we compared FRI values between two fire-prone areas of south-eastern France (Provence). These areas had similar weather and roughly similar fuel types but fuels occurred in patches with different sizes and shapes in the landscape. We built a fire database (1960-2010) and we fitted Weibull distributions of FRI in order to compute the probability density function and the hazard of burning. Our results indicate maximal probability of burning again for shrublands (garrigues and maquis), and minimal values for mixed broadleaf-conifer forests and broadleaved forests. Most fuel types of Provence showed no effect of fuel age on the probability of burning again. Only the unmanaged maquis showed a linear increase of fire hazard in time due to a rapid postfire fuel build up. Rather long fire-free intervals and low age-dependency for most forest fuels of Provence suggest that reducing their biomass may not be sufficient to reduce fire risk. In contrast, the flammable shrublands have rather short fire return intervals and represent a high fire hazard for the whole study area. The two areas had statistically significant difference of fire return intervals for a same fuel type (e.g. 18-22 years for shrublands, 20-24 years for pine forests, and 24-27 years for oak forests). This suggested that size, shape and connectivity of fuels play a major role in the probability of burning again and should be taken into account for fire management. The present policy of fire prevention puts efforts into public information and prevention, and preferential management of fuels at risk in the vicinity of roads and wildland-urban interfaces where fires occur preferentially. However, fire suppression may also take advantage of favouring low-flammable fuels with low age-dependency on strategic places in the landscape. © 2012.

TI  - The town of Pag - an example of a 15 th century \"real town\"
PY  - 2012
AB  - The town of Pag, situated on the homonymous island in North Dalmatia is a unique example of a completely planned urban space whose construction started in 1443. In the course of the following thirty years, it mainly witnessed the execution of the final design stages which included the construction of town walls. They represent an original example of urban planning which has been well attested by archival documents. The creation of this new town, Citta Nouva, was said to have been prompted by the decision to relocate a smaller settlement called Old Pag which had been during the Trecento the centre of the insular community due to ancient salt plants built within the spacious bay in the centre of the uninhabited side of the island. The prehistoric and ancient Roman settlements with the capital Cissa were situated in a fertile valley further to the north, whereas Novalia - contemporary Novalja, was a settlement which developed during late antiquity exclusively as a sea port. The ethno-political changes that occurred during the early Middle Ages led to the abandonment of these settlements since the development of commerce on the Adriatic coast and in its hinterland stimulated construction of salt plants which came to be in the end of the 14 th century the biggest salt plants in the Croatian Littoral. Important natural resources were the reason the area was desired by Zadar, the town that in many respects presented competition to Venice. In order to defend themselves from constant military upsurges, the islanders of Pag voluntarily consented to the protection offered by Venice and in 1409 the island became part of Venice's Stato del Mar. This meant colonial dependence of the island of Pag on the imperial power of Serenissima, but also encouragement to the economic growth of the local community. Due to a misfortunate position of Old Pag, its community decided to move closer to the salt plants, which was also in the interest of Venice in that it eagerly wanted to keep its monopolistic position in salt trade. The establishment of New Pag was therefore approved by the Venice dodge and it took place on the site which was compared to that of Old Pag more appropriate for organized life of the community and maritime connection to the main centre of the Venetian Republic. According to written sources the foundations of St Mary's Church and of the main fort near the entrance to the town from the port were laid in 1443. Both buildings were built on the site which was soon after divided into four unequal quarters of the future town. The town was constructed gradually, but the planimetry of the site clearly shows that all components necessary for the town's functions were rationally planned from the very beginning. Particularities of the net-like system of streets attest primarily to the axial communication between the salt plants in the east and the port in the western part of the town, while the cardo of the transversally positioned Strada magna form the cross shaped plan with a square in the centre. Although geometrically completely irregular, the quadrangle space comprises the most important facilities for urban life: the Rectors' palace and the tower with a public clock positioned diagonally to the largest church and facing the communal loggia later on destroyed, situated on the opposite side of the parish church, and the Bishop's palace which never saw completion. Residential quarters were built in blocks composed of rows of axially attached private houses and perpendicularly positioned to the main road which was at places double-laned. In the northern section of the town the blocks were formed by two densely built rows of small houses, clearly intended for lower classes. In contrast, the rows in the southern section are double in size since they contained more spacious houses with back yards belonging to richer families. This social stratification was already established in the very cadastre which also confirms the morphological quality of the architecture although lagging behind the architectural achievements in other towns of the Venetian province of Dalmatia. The urban features of Novi Pag, congruent in typology to the town-colonies related to semi-industrial production, have been attested by the modest fortified walls which entirely surrounded the town. Their irregular pentagonal shape with each side adjusted to the terrain and defence strategy formed a ring around the town. The western side of the fortification retracted towards the town centre providing thus better protection of the port with the most strongly built corner forts. The south side faced the salt plants with warehouses and controlled the approaching space in front of them together with the western, shorter and functionally most neutral side. The longest, northern side protruding in a triangle- like formation contained a town gate facing the island fields. The walls of the fortification containing an interior corridor were easily and quickly accessible in case of enemy attacks. A more thorough analysis of town planning and design, which can be detected in the present urban core of Pag, reveals detailed rational approach to urban development guided by the politics of organized local administration and strategy of the powerful state authorities. If observed from within that context, a question might arise about the true origin of Pag which seems to be the centre of the enigma including arrivals of the most significant artists of the Croatian Quattrocento to Pag as well as interpretations of Pag as the precursor of the Renaissance ideal town. Attempting to dispel such misconceptions, this text draws attention to fragmentary records of terrain measurement performed by Venetian military engineers by which Citta Nuova was divided into quarters. Subsequently, in 1460, the galley commander Andrea Buon made the measurement of the wider are of the town. The fact that the Senate of the Venetian Republic for years allotted 300 ducats for the construction of Pag and even controlled land exchange supports the premise that the Venetian centralist state had a decided role in conceiving the initial urban project of Pag. The execution of the concept design must have been handed to the local authorities and aristocrats who commissioned builders from southern Adriatic towns. The most esteemed among them, Giorgio Mathei Dalmaticus, had until 1466 participated as a building contractor in the construction of the fortification, while other building work was done by his collaborators among who there was not a single foreigner. That is the reason the entire architectural heritage of Pag, with unsubstantial number of sculptural works conforms to the artistic character of the coastal Croatia. The paper further supports the view that New Pag should be valued as an exceptional example of \"real town\" adapted to the achievements of mature humanism in the Eastern Adriatic without insisting on stylistically defining it in terms of Renaissance which has been attempted, though questionably, in the history of urban theory and practice.

TI  - Total nitrogen inflow and outflow from a large river swamp basin to the Gulf of Mexico
PY  - 2006
AB  - River corridor wetland restoration and freshwater diversion from the lower Mississippi River are being considered as two major options to reduce nitrogen input to the Gulf of Mexico. However, it is largely uncertain how much nitrogen can actually be retained from the overflowing waters by these wetland systems. This study quantified the nitrogen inflow and outflow for the largest distributary basin of the Mississippi River, the Atchafalaya River Swamp basin. The goal of the study was to seek answers to three critical questions: (a) Does the Atchafalaya River Swamp remove a significant amount of nitrogen from the overflowing water, or is it releasing more nitrogen into the Gulf? (b) How do the nitrogen removal or release rates fluctuate seasonally and annually? (c) What are the relationships between the nitrogen removal capacity and the hydrological conditions in the basin such as river stage and discharge? By utilizing the long-term (1978-2002) river discharge and water quality data, monthly and annual nitrogen fluxes were quantified, and their relationships with the basin hydrological conditions investigated. A total nitrogen - sum of the total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen (NO3+NO2) - mass input-output balance between the upstream (Simmesport) and downstream (Morgan City and Wax Lake Outlet) locations was established to examine the nitrogen removal potential for this, the largest freshwater swamp basin in North America. The results from this study showed that, over the past 25 years, the Atchafalaya River Swamp basin acted as a source for NO3+NO2 nitrogen, although the average annual output of NO3+NO2 nitrogen (174 584 Mg) was only slightly higher (2.3%) than the average annual input of NO3+NO2 nitrogen (170 721 Mg). The higher NO3+NO2 mass outflow occurred throughout summer and autumn, indicating an active role of biological processes on nitrogen in the overflowing waters of the Atchafalaya. However, this swamp basin has served as a major sink for organic nitrogen: the annual averages of TKN mass input and output were 200 323 and 145 917 Mg year-1, respectively, presenting a 27.2% removal rate by the basin. This large TKN reduction appeared high during springs and low during late summers, corresponding with the fluctuation of the hydrological conditions of the river. Copyright © 2006 IAHS Press.

TI  - Tracking New Jersey's changing landscape
PY  - 2006
AB  - Sprawling urban growth has become one of the most important issues facing New Jersey at the onset of the new millennium. As befitting its reputation as the most densely populated state in the nation, New Jersey has the highest percentage of its land surface area in developed land, as well as among the highest rates of developed area growth.1 While the urbanization of New Jersey has been an ongoing process for much of the last century, the post-World War II years saw an acceleration of the conversion of farm and forest land to residential and commercial development. In the latter half of the twentieth century, the locus of urban growth moved from the densely settled bedroom communities immediately ringing the major metropolitan areas of New York and Philadelphia, expanding outward along the major commuting corridors. This trend has continued and even accelerated in terms of the \"leapfrogging\" of development out ahead of the urban/rural interface and the spawning of new growth centers. While present spatial patterns of development in some respects represent a continued evolutionary trend, what has appeared to change is the public's realization and indignation at the associated downsides of urban sprawl. Changes to the landscape are occurring every day, with significant implications for taxation, quality of life, water quality, agricultural viability, wildlife habitat, and social equity.2 While changes to the landscape due to urbanization are evident to most, measuring these landscape changes is a significant challenge. Land use and land cover are two approaches for describing land. Land use is a description of the way humans are utilizing any particular piece of land for one or many purposes. Land cover is the bio-physical material covering the earth's surface at any particular location. For example, an area that has a land cover of grass indicates that grass is the physical covering of the earth at that location. However, in a land use map, that same grass area could be labeled a recreational park or a cemetery or a corporate office park. Together, land use and land cover information provide a good indication of the landscape condition and processes that are occurring at a particular place. Time series of land use/land cover maps tell us how much of the landscape is changing, what changes have occurred, and where the changes are taking place, as well as provide some indication of where future change might occur. One of the most effective ways to map land use/land cover is through the use of remote sensing imagery collected from satellites and aircraft. Remote sensing satellites orbit at hundreds of miles above the earth, continually imaging the surface and transmitting the images back to ground stations for use by the research community. This technology is an excellent medium for monitoring the condition of land throughout the globe. Photography, both analog and digital, employed from airplanes is also useful, especially where greater detail of the land surface is needed. New satellite sensors are now approaching the detail once provided exclusively by aerial photography. Advanced computer processing techniques allow the images to be combined with other environmental datasets to classify and map land cover. Mapping land use requires visual interpretation by experienced image interpreters and though aided by digital image analysis techniques is still a time-consuming, labor-intensive process. The geographer D. Theobald states that most of the current discussions of urbanization and sprawl are limited by the use of coarse scale data aggregated at the state or county level.3 These aggregated data poorly capture the fine-grained pattern of land use change typical of rural and exurban areas. For example, while the Natural Resources Conservation Service's National Resource Inventory provides information on the conversion of farm and forest lands, the data are based on a statistical sample aggregated to a statewide estimate.4 Theobald states that while the fine-scale mapping of developed land use from aerial photographs provides one of the best ways to measure change at the urban fringe, this type of data is rarely available for broader geographical extents, for example, areas larger than a county.5 However, in this respect, New Jersey is blessed to have one of the few comprehensive statewide land use/land cover datasets that go beyond one or two dates of mapping.6 To the best of our knowledge, only the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts have similar land use/land cover change datasets. This paper explores statewide trends in urban growth and land use change occurring between 1986 and 1995 and between 1995 and 2000. Two primary data sources have been employed in this analysis: 1) the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) land use/land cover digital database, which contains detailed land use change information for the period of 1986 to 1995; and 2) the recently released Rutgers University Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis (CRSSA) 2000 developed land use change update. These datasets provide a synoptic perspective on the landscape changes occurring in the Garden State at the end of the twentieth century. Providing information on land use and land cover with the required categorical specificity and spatial detail is only one half of the equation. There is a great need for simplifying and synthesizing land use/land cover change data to provide information useful for land managers and policy makers. Within the environmental management literature, these simple metrics for analyzing, monitoring, and communicating information about change are often known as \"environmental indicators.\"8 For a period in the 1990s, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection adopted a statewide monitoring program that included several indicators dealing directly with land use/cover change (e.g., no net loss of wetlands).9 Hasse and Lathrop expanded this concept and developed a series of five \"land resource impact indicators\" for New Jersey to measure the \"ecological footprint\" of urban growth at a municipal scale.10 We continue this earlier work by employing a set of land use change indicators to examine the scope and location of natural resource losses. These indicators included: farmland conversion, forest conversion, and natural wetlands conversion. The geographic information system (GIS)-based analysis maps the spatial patterns of urban growth and identifies hotspots of natural resource lands conversion as a means of assessing the impacts of this urban growth on environmental quality.

TI  - Comparative study of high-speed passenger rail deployment in megaregion corridors: Current experiences and future opportunities
PY  - 2011
AB  - Deployment of high-speed passenger rail services has occurred around the world in densely-populated corridors, often with the effect of either creating or enhancing a unified economic \"megaregion\" agglomeration. This paper will review the technical characteristics of a variety of megaregion corridors, including Japan (Tokyo-Osaka), France (Paris-Lyon), and Germany (Frankfurt-Cologne), and their economic impacts. There are many lessons to be drawn from the deployment and ongoing operation of high-speed passenger rail service in these corridors for other countries now considering similar projects, such as the US and parts of the European Union. First, we will review three international cases, describing the physical development of each corridor as well as its measured impacts on economic development. In each case, the travel time reductions of the high-speed service transformed the economic boundaries of the urban agglomerations, integrating labor and consumer markets, while often simultaneously raising concerns about the balance of growth within the region. Moreover, high-speed travel within the regions has had important implications for the modes and patterns of travel beyond the region, particularly with respect to long-distance air travel. An example is the code-shared rail-air service between DeutscheBahn and Lufthansa in the Frankfurt-Cologne corridor. Next, we will examine the implications of these international experiences for high-speed rail deployment elsewhere in the world, particularly the US and Portugal, one of the EU countries investing in high-speed rail. Issues considered include the suitability of high-speed passenger rail service in existing megaregions as well as the potential for formation of megaregions in other corridors. By understanding the impact of high-speed passenger service on economic growth, labor markets, urban form, and the regional distribution of economic activity, planners can better anticipate and prepare countermeasures for any negative effects of highspeed rail. Examples of countermeasures include complementary investments in urban and regional transit connections and cooperation with airlines and other transportation service operators. High-speed passenger rail represents a substantial investment whose implementation and ultimate success depends on a wide range of factors. Among them is the ability of planners and decision-makers to make a strong case for the sharing of benefits across a broad geography, both within and beyond the megaregion (and potential megaregion) corridors where service is most likely to be provided. This paper provides some useful lessons based on international experiences. © 2011 by ASME.

TI  - Case study: Large-scale clean-up of NAPL in riverbed, river diversion and restoration - Fort Collins, Colorado, USA
PY  - 2006
AB  - A manufactured gas plant (MGP) operated near the downtown river corridor in Fort Collins, Colorado from 1905 to the 1920s. Downgradient of the site, a city landfill operated until the late 1960s and is now occupied by a community center, athletic fields, and a day care center. The Cache La Poudre River lies adjacent to the former landfill, approximately 700 feet from the MGP site. In 2002, the river was at a historic low, and a tar-like non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) was observed in riverbed sediments, Investigations conducted under the EPA Targeted Brownfields Program initially characterized environmental impacts, including potential sources of the NAPL. Further investigations revealed the presence of NAPL in bedrock fractures and alluvial sediment beneath the river, community center area, and adjacent athletic fields. It was also determined that fluctuations in river flow influence the appearance of NAPL and vertical flow mechanics in and around the river. With numerous stakeholders involved, remedy selection, design, and implementation were accelerated to accommodate river flow fluctuations, which limited available working time in the river. The final remedy included diverting a 900-foot stretch of river from January 2005 to April 2005, removing/ disposing of NAPL-impacted sediment and bedrock, installing a subsurface vertical barrier wall with hydraulic controls and subsequent water treatment, and completing comprehensive site restoration. The project was completed within the scheduled time frame, with acceptance by stakeholders achieved through successful community outreach.

TI  - River regulation, decline of ecological resources, and potential for restoration in a semi-arid lands river in the western USA
PY  - 2004
AB  - Societal needs for power generation, water management/use, and land uses (e.g., urban and agricultural) have often resulted in a significant departure from the natural processes of hydrologic regimes and material transport and deposition throughout most of the rivers flowing through arid and semi-arid landscapes of the western USA. We examine the compromised ecosystem integrity of one such river, the upper Snake River in eastern Idaho, below a large irrigation and power dam that has altered hydrologic regimes and reduced channel sediment supply. We review the ecological structure and function of gravel-bed rivers as they vary across a hierarchy of landscape scales with different spatial and temporal dimensions. Major linkages within the large, alluvial river systems of the western USA include exchange of water and materials along longitudinal connections from streams to rivers, lateral connections between river and floodplain systems, and vertical surface and subsurface (hyporheic) water exchanges. Longitudinal linkages dominate confined (canyon) river reaches while unconfined (floodplain) reaches show strong affinities for lateral and vertical exchange. Hydrogeomorphic processes, driven by river power and cut and fill alluviation, produce a dynamic landscape in floodplain reaches, which we refer to as a Shifting Habitat Mosaic (SHM). The SHM fosters high physical and ecological diversity of habitats, biotic communities, and ecosystem complexity. In this case study, we examine the dynamics of a series of floodplains along a 90 km river landscape, employing an airborne spectrophotometer, producing georeferenced hyperspectral imagery, coupled with ground truth measures of river hydraulics, river depth, riparian vegetation and other surface characteristics. From these data we derived estimates of the hydraulics and hydrographic regimes necessary to mobilize channel and riparian sediments, thus reestablishing the dynamics of the river SHM. We also evaluated subsequent variation in aquatic and riparian habitat characteristics. Evaluation of these factors, which affect interactions between the river channel and the surrounding river-riparian corridor, permitted us to develop a restoration strategy focused on normative variation among the various physical and biotic processes contributing to ecosystem integrity.

TI  - Grand design(er)s: David Moore, natural theology and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, Dublin, 1838-1879
PY  - 2007
AB  - Geographers have increasingly been investigating the role of space in the regulation and constitution of a range of scientific discourses from historical studies of natural history societies and zoological gardens to analyses of contemporary biotechnology industries. It is abundantly clear that geographical location and the spatial relationships underpinning such institutions form more than the material stage on which scientific activity takes place. These socially produced spaces themselves, and their internal and external connectivities, play an important role in the establishment and warranting of knowledge claims to specific interpretations of the natural world. Moreover, historically institutions such as botanical gardens not only displayed prevalent systems of taxonomic regulation; they also became sites for the investigation of order in the natural world. This paper investigates the relationship between David Moore's role as curator of Dublin's botanical garden and his delivery of an anti-evolution lecture in Belfast in 1874. For Moore, the structuring of the scientific garden and the botanical discourse attending plant life there revealed the workings of a beneficent designer and thus was a material expression of a natural theology. The classifying of plants into families, the orderly fashioning of the beds, the display of exotics in the hothouses all facilitated a particular reading of designed nature which confirmed his commitment to the existence of a divine designer, and this reading of nature was popularly translated in his Belfast lecture. © 2007 SAGE Publications.

TI  - Gastrointestinal parasites of howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) inhabiting the fragmented landscape of the Santa Marta mountain range, Veracruz, Mexico
PY  - 2010
AB  - In recent years populations of howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) in southeastern Mexico have decreased substantially due to the transformation and loss of natural habitats. This is especially evident in the Santa Marta mountain range, Veracruz, Mexico where several studies have evaluated the impact of fragmentation on howler monkey populations in order to propose management programs for their conservation. The conditions generated by fragmentation likely change the rates of parasitic infection and could decrease howler survival. In this study, gastrointestinal parasite species richness, prevalence, and egg density of infection were determined in howler groups inhabiting five forest fragments at the Santa Marta mountain range. Two hundred and seventy-eight fresh fecal samples were collected between October 2002 and April 2003. Three parasite species were found during the dry and the wet season in all forest fragments sampled: one unidentified species of Eimeriidae; Trypanoxyuris minutus (Oxyuridae); and Controrchis biliophilus (Dicrocoeliidae). Both the prevalence of T. minutus and infection density for all parasites differed between seasons and fragments (the largest fragment consistently differed from other fragments). Host density, distance to the nearest town, fragment size, fragment shape, and total basal area of food trees explained parasite prevalence, but each species had a different pattern. Although parasite richness was lower, prevalence and density were higher than values reported for howlers in conserved forests. These results suggest that the establishment of biological corridors and animal translocation programs must take into account the parasite ecology of each fragment to avoid higher infection rates and preclude potential consequent mortality. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Reconstructed Dynamics of Rapid Extinctions of Chaparral‐Requiring Birds in Urban Habitat Islands
PY  - 1988
AB  - The distribution of native, chaparral-requiring bird species was determined for 37 isolated fragments of canyon habitat ranging in size from 0.4 to 104 hectares in coasta4 urban San Diego County, California The area of chaparral habitat and canyon age (time since isolation of the habitat fragment) explains most of the variation in the number of chaparral-requiring bird species. In additiolz, the distribution of native predators may influence species num- ber. There is statistical evidence that coyotes control thepop- ulations of smallerpredators such as foxes and domestic cats. The absence of coyotes may lead to higher levels of predation by a process of mesopredator release. The distance of canyons from otherpatches of chaparral habitat does not add significantly to the explained variance in chaparral- requiring species number-probably because of the virtual inability of most chaparral-requiring species to disperse through developed areas and nonscrub habitats. These re- sults and other lines of evidence suggest that chaparral- requiring birds in isolated canyons have very high rates of extinction, in part because of their low vagility. The best predictors of vulnerability of the individual species are their abundances (densities) in undisturbed habitat and their

TI  - Anthropogenic and biogenic sources of Ethylene and the potential for human exposure: A literature review
PY  - 2015
AB  - This review examines available published information on ethylene emission sources, emission magnitudes, and inhalation exposures in order to assess those factors and circumstances that can affect human contact with this omnipresent gas. The results reveal that airborne ethylene concentrations at the ppb levels are commonplace and can arise in the vicinity of traffic corridors, forest fires, indoor kitchens, horticultural areas, oil fields, house fires, and petrochemical sites. The primary biogenic sources of ethylene derive from microbial activity in most soil and marine environments as well as its biological formation in wide variety of plant species. Sizable amounts of ethylene can also result from the burning of fossil fuels, forest and savanna fires, and crop residue combustion. Motor vehicle exhaust is the largest contributor to urban ethylene levels under most circumstances, but industrial flare releases and fugitive emissions may also be of relevance. Occupational exposures generally range up to about 50-100 ppm and have been documented for those working in the horticultural, petrochemical, and fire and rescue industries. Continuous personal monitoring at the community level has documented exposures of 3-4 ppb. These levels are more closely associated with the ethylene concentrations found indoors rather than outdoors indicating the importance of exposure sources found within the home. Indoor air sources of ethylene are associated with environmental tobacco smoke, wood or propane fuel use, fruit and vegetable storage, and cooking. Ethylene is not found in any consumer or commercial products and does not off-gas from building products to any appreciable extent. The review indicates that outdoor sources located some distance from the home do not make an appreciable contribution to personal exposures given the strength and variety of sources found in the immediate living environment. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Roads reduce amphibian abundance in ponds across a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - Roads threaten animal species through habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and direct mortality. It is crucial to understand how species respond to linear infrastructure for effective conservation of animal communities in fragmented landscapes. We assessed relationships between amphibian abundance and roads/ railways and habitat fragmentation. We examined whether the combined effects of habitat loss and roads or railways (accessible habitat) was a better predictor of amphibian abundance than (1) the total amount of habitat surrounding ponds, (2) distance to a highway or railway, or (3) surrounding road cover. Aquatic surveys for amphibian larvae were conducted at 30 freshwater ponds over the breeding season in a mixed peri-urban/ agricultural landscape in Hungary. Landscape variables were quantified within a 1000-m radius surrounding ponds and habitat variables were measured at the local (pond) scale. The larvae of seven amphibian species were detected. There were strong relationships between the abundance of amphibian larvae and the distance to a highway and the proportion of road cover within 1000 m of ponds. Relationships with accessible habitat and total habitat amount were uncertain, while there were no clear relationships with a major railway. Larval abundance increased with pond size, but there were mixed relationships with the presence of fish. Our results suggest that road effects were having a stronger impact on amphibian abundance than the combined effects of roads and habitat amount in the study area. Highways appeared to be negatively impacting amphibian communities within a wide road-effect zone up to 1 km from ponds. However, our results were obtained from a single-season snap-shot study and multi-season surveys are likely required to reduce uncertainty in the model predictions. Our analysis suggests that road mitigation projects for amphibians should create large ponds in areas with no highways and low road density, and with connectivity to surrounding habitats. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Uncertainty in estimates of bioenergy-induced land use change: The impact of inconsistent land cover data sets and land class definitions
PY  - 2017
AB  - While many data sets are increasingly available to describe land cover characteristics, these data require careful analysis and supplemental research before conclusions can be drawn about the scope, magnitude, and drivers of change. Land cover data, typically derived from remote sensing, are frequently analyzed to estimate land use change (LUC) that may be attributable to policies such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, which encourages bioenergy. However, land cover classifications such as grassland do not clearly differentiate among multiple land uses (pasture, fodder, crop, yard, wildlife corridor, decorative cover, and erosion control strip), many of which may occur on a single parcel simultaneously. A land cover class in one data set rarely corresponds exactly to the same land cover class in another data set. Further, persistent improvements in remote-sensing systems result in changes in spatial and temporal resolutions that lead to changes in classification methodology, which limit the ability to use those data sets to accurately measure changes occurring on the ground. Most LUC estimates are derived by comparing land cover across a few points in time and using aggregate land cover classes such as “forest,” “cropland” or “urban.” Analyses that cover short time spans or rely on just a few points in time are likely to generate spurious results if dynamic interacting classes such as U.S. cropland and grassland are considered. We review land cover dynamics in the Western Corn Belt (WCB) region, which comprises the U.S. states of Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota, to illustrate how the selection and manipulation of data can result in estimates of change associated with the cropland-grassland transition that vary by over 100%. © 2018 the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Improvement of the North Lead Rail Corridor
PY  - 2016
AB  - To accommodate growth in intermodal and bulk cargo demand, the Port of Tacoma initiated the North Lead project to construct new rail infrastructure within an approximately 1.5 mile long corridor within the Port, with an objective of optimizing intermodal fluidity and capacity in the Port and enhancing the efficiency of rail service to Port terminals. The project corridor is a nexus of rail infrastructure serving the Port, nearby industrial facilities, Class 1 interchange, and freight classification. Tacoma Rail, a city owned utility, provides rail service to the Port of Tacoma terminals and private industrial facilities nearby. Project planning was performed collaboratively by the Port of Tacoma, Tacoma Rail and the consultant team. Using detailed timing records for each train movement within the tideflats over a one month period, a simulation model was developed for the existing rail network and validated to match the actual performance. Alternatives for infrastructure development and operational strategies were modeled using current rail traffic and projected future rail traffic to identify the best short term and long term options to match capacity to demand, and maximize the efficiency of service to the Port's terminals. Options for infrastructure improvements were evaluated based on their ability to support multiple concurrent movements and flexible routings within the constrained rail corridor. Key elements of project design included phasing of construction while maintaining rail operations in the corridor and accommodating future expansion and extension of the corridor to match future growth in demand and increased train lengths. The complexity of rail movements within the constrained corridor were a particularly challenging aspect of project planning and design. A collaborative approach incorporating the unique perspectives of marine terminal operations, rail operations, track design, and construction was used to optimize the design. This paper will describe the approach that was used to identify and analyze alternatives for railway infrastructure, and select and design infrastructure improvements and operating strategies within the corridor to provide maximum improvement of capacity and efficiency in the rail network. © ASCE.

TI  - Planning, execution and geology of the Stuttgart 21 and Wendlingen-to-Ulm high-speed rail link projects
PY  - 2007
AB  - The Stuttgart 21 project and the new Wendlingen-Ulm rail link are both part of the trans-European high-speed railway network - the 'magistrale corridor' running from Paris via Strasbourg, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, Ulm, Munich, Vienna and Bratislava to Budapest. The existing rail infrastructure between Stuttgart and Ulm originally went into service in 1850. The gradient sections that serpentine their way over the Swabian Alb have track radii of less than 300 metres and the lowtrain speeds of 70 km/h imposed at these points are no longer in keeping with the needs of a modern, high-speed rail service. The two projects conceal the largest expansion plan ever devised by the public railway authorities of Baden-Württemberg since the nineteenth century, the existing infrastructure no longer being able to cope with the increasing traffic movements of the twenty-first century without an extensive modernisation and extension of the rail network. The Stuttgart 21 project involves the complete reorganization of the Stuttgart rail node system, including all the feeder lines. New tunnels will link rail stations at Feuerbach, Obertürkheim/ Untertürkheim and Bad Cannstatt with the existing track infrastructure, while to the south the new traffic node will connect up with the new high-speed rail link between Wendlingen and Ulm. From Wendlingen the inter-city line closely follows the motorway route and leads through two new tunnels beneath the Swabian Alb. The track then runs across the mountain plateau to Dornstadt before descending down to the existing section of line, which it joins at Ulm central station. The stated objective of the Stuttgart 21 project is to improve both long-distance and local rail services.

TI  - Between a rock and a hard place: rugged terrain features and human disturbance affect behaviour and habitat use of Sumatran elephants in Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Asian elephants are threatened throughout their range due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and conflict with humans. Limited data on spatial and temporal use of habitats in largely intact forests by elephants in Sumatra is a major hindrance for conservation and land use planning, and consequently human–elephant conflict mitigation. We analysed GPS data from collared elephants to investigate their use of habitat in relation to available land cover and human disturbance in Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia. We applied remote sensing techniques to extract environmental variables to use in state-space Hidden Markov Models and integrated Step Selection Function to analyse foraging strategies and land use selectivity, while using dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models and Minimum Convex Polygons to determine used and available habitat features within their home ranges. Our results show that Sumatran elephants in Aceh preferred areas with lower elevation (< 200 m) and slopes (0–10°), with minimal terrain ruggedness, which also happen to be areas selected by humans. Elephants closely adhered to rivers and mountain valleys when utilizing homogenous dense natural forests, and expanded from the rivers in heterogenous forests toward open, resource-dense, land use types. Overall, slope, vegetation, and human disturbance had the largest impact on each of the clans’ foraging strategies. Areas closer to human settlements were used more by night and less by day, indicating that human presence and activities influence elephant habitat use and avoidance. Our findings conclude future management decisions should focus on protecting the remaining lowland forests and preventing further urban encroachment in areas with lower elevation and slope, particularly in proximity to rivers which act as corridors between natural habitats, in order to mitigate human-elephant conflict and protect the species from extinction.

TI  - GIS-based planning tools to mitigate channel enlargement and water quality impacts resulting from impervious surfaces
PY  - 2005
AB  - Previous studies in Vermont alluvial streams have demonstrated statistical correlations between imperviousness and channel enlargement/ instability (CWP et al, 1999). Geomorphic stress has been demonstrated at total basin imperviousness of 2 % or more; active adjustment of channel form has been linked to imperviousness exceeding 9%. Increases in percent imperviousness have also been statistically correlated to decreases in biological diversity and overall macro-invertebrate health in receiving waters (CWP, 2000). Current estimates for two rural Vermont towns, based on 1991 to 1993 Landsat-derived land cover/ land use data, indicate imperviousness ranging from 2 to 5% (Underwood and Davis, unpublished). In-stream geomorphic assessments conducted in these towns have confirmed geomorphic degradation in response to development-related Stressors including floodplain encroachment, undersized bridge crossings, reduced riparian buffers, and conversion of agricultural and forested lands to residential and commercial use (VTDEC, 2003). Based on past development patterns, the towns expect build out under current zoning regulations to result in aggregate percent imperviousness exceeding the 9% threshold, similar to more urbanized townships in the Burlington area (4 to 25 %; Pease, 1997). Most residential development projects will not fall under State or Federal regulatory oversight, requiring stormwater management structures or practices. The authors have merged GIS-based, automated, land cover / land use-based calculations of percent imperviousness, with GIS-based community build-out analysis software to predict geomorphic condition resulting from increased development on a subwatershed basis. The methodologies / techniques serve as local planning tools to inform decision-making, facilitate consensus-building, and manage community development with the objectives of minimizing impacts to water quality and reducing future costs to the towns associated with channel erosion. Using the tools, the towns have explored specific planning and zoning alternatives (e.g., reduced development densities, stream corridor overlays) to minimize percent imperviousness and the consequences of stormwater runoff.

TI  - A Novel Collaborative IoD-Assisted VANET Approach for Coverage Area Maximization
PY  - 2021
AB  - Internet of Drones (IoD) is an efficient technique that can be integrated with vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to provide terrestrial communications by acting as an aerial relay when terrestrial infrastructure is unreliable or unavailable. To fully exploit the drones' flexibility and superiority, we propose a novel dynamic IoD collaborative communication approach for urban VANETs. Unlike most of the existing approaches, the IoD nodes are dynamically deployed based on current locations of ground vehicles to effectively mitigate inevitable isolated cars in conventional VANETs. For efficiently coordinating IoD, we model IoD to optimize coverage based on the location of vehicles. The goal is to obtain an efficient IoD deployment to maximize the number of covered vehicles, i.e., minimize the number of isolated vehicles in the target area. More importantly, the proposed approach provides sufficient interconnections between IoD nodes. To do so, an improved version of succinct population-based meta-heuristic, namely Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) inspired by food searching behavior of birds or fishes flock, is implemented for IoD assisted VANET (IoDAV). Moreover, the coverage, received signal quality, and IoD connectivity are achieved by IPSO's objective function for optimal IoD deployment at the same time. We carry out an extensive experiment based on the received signal at floating vehicles to examine the proposed IoDAV performance. We compare the results with the baseline VANET with no IoD (NIoD) and Fixed IoD assisted (FIoD). The comparisons are based on the coverage percentage of the ground vehicles and the quality of the received signal. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IoDAV approach allows finding the optimal IoD positions throughout the time based on the vehicle's movements and achieves better coverage and better quality of the received signal by finding the most appropriate IoD position compared with NIoD and FIoD schemes. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The preceding chapters document how climate change and climate variability will impact Texas: temperatures will rise, heat waves will occur more frequently, it will be drier west of the Interstate 35 corridor, severe weather will become more frequent, in-stream flows will fall, biodiversity will decline, and the sea level will rise. The exact timing of these changes and the speed at which they will occur remain uncertain. It is also unknown whether some of the predicted changes will occur gradually or suddenly after a tipping point has been reached. These findings echo what we presented in the first edition of this book, published in 1995. Results of more recent studies on climate change and Texas include: • In 1997 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report, Climate Change and the States, that came to similar conclusions (EPA 1997). Its findings are summarized in Table 10.1. • A national assessment published in 2000, \"The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change,\" added important points: The summer heat index (which combines temperature and humidity) will increase significantly, heat stress for people and livestock will be more severe, soil moisture will decline as precipitation decreases and evaporation increases, reductions in water supply and quality will pose problems primarily for urban and poor populations, the coastal zone will suffer significant loss of property and damage to ecosystems as a result of coastal flooding and erosion, oil refineries and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway will be at risk from more frequent and more intense storms, and the health of urban populations will be impaired by an increase in smog-forming gases from fossil fuel power plants (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2000). • Norwine and John (2007) concluded that South Texas by 2100 will be drier, hotter, and stormier. Barrier islands will have been lost, and saltwater intrusion will diminish water supplies. • A recent study by the U.S. Global Change Research Program emphasizes the risk of more intense droughts: \"The consensus of most climate-model projections is for a reduction of cool-season precipitation across the U.S. Southwest and northwest Mexico\" (NOAA 2008). The likely impacts for Texas fall within the range of changes predicted for North America by Working Group 2 of the 2007 IPCC Assessment (IPCC 2007): IPCC assigns \"very high confidence\" to stress and damage from extreme weather and rising sea level, as well as infrastructure, health, and safety issues (Table 10.2). Taken together, the findings about the expected impacts of climate change on Texas have not changed fundamentally over the last decade and a half, but the evidence is now more extensive and detailed. In contrast, the context for policy development has changed substantially. There are several reasons for this. First, decision makers have fewer excuses to defer action because of scientific uncertainty. Key questions that were controversial two decades ago have been resolved: Yes, warming occurs not only at the earth's surface but also at higher altitudes. Yes, increased water vapor in the atmosphere amplifies global warming. Only the regional distribution of precipitation and the exact timing of predicted changes remain uncertain and require more study. Second, climate change is no longer a distant possibility but is occurring now. \"Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases.\" This is in sharp contrast to our 1995 assumption that the impacts of climate change would be felt only by 2030. Third, the overwhelming majority of scientists are confident that observed and predicted changes in natural as well as social systems are caused by human actions. (These three statements are based on IPCC 2007.) As a result, the urgency to act on climate change has increased greatly since 1995. The 2007-2008 U.N. Human Development report starkly makes the point: \"Climate change is the defining human development challenge of the 21st Century⋯ Looking to the future, no country - however wealthy or powerful - will be immune to the impact of global warming\" (United Nations Development Program 2007). In this chapter I briefly review policy development in response to climate change at international, federal, state, and local levels and then discuss policy options for Texas. Several of the preceding chapters also discuss policy issues related to their subject matter. Here I focus on concrete policy measures that should be taken by state agencies and on development of a comprehensive state climate policy. (Table Presented).

TI  - Restoration of wildcelery, Vallisneria americana Michx., in the lower Detroit River of the Lake Huron-Lake Erie Corridor
PY  - 2007
AB  - American wildcelery (Vallisneria americana Michx.) is a valuable submersed aquatic plant that was negatively affected by pollution and urban runoff in the lower Detroit River for much of the 20th century. Following 25 years of water-pollution and urban-runoff abatement initiated in the early 1970s, we postulated that water clarity had increased and that this would allow restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, water clarity increased in the late 1980s due to water filtration and particulate removal by exotic dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis), which could contribute to potential wildcelery restoration. We sampled wildcelery in 1996-97 and compared these data to wildcelery data from 1950-51 and 1984-85. Over the 48-year period of comparison, areal density of wildcelery tubers decreased 72% (from 51.2 million to 14.4 million tubers) between 1950-51 and 1984-85 then increased 251% (from 14.4 million to 50.5 million tubers) between 1984-85 and 1996-97. As a result, overall areal abundance was about the same in 1950-51 as in fall 1996-97. However, tuber densities in spring 1996 were similar to historical low abundances in springs of 1984-85. Then between spring and fall 1996, tuber densities increased 333% and remained relatively abundant through October 1997 indicating the beginning of the restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, we believe further reductions of turbidity through continued pollution-abatement programs and water filtration by dreissenid mussels combined with habitat protection and active management of wildcelery will contribute even further to the restoration of wildcelery in the Detroit River in the 21st century.

TI  - Landscape ecology of lignite opencast mining and land reclamation in the Western Rhineland (Germany)- Some aspects inferred from floristic analysis
PY  - 2001
AB  - The largest forest area in the Western Niederrheinische Bucht will be destroyed by the open-cast mine Hambach, one of the \"deepest holes\" of the world. Open-cast mining also affects neighbouring wetlands by lowering ground water tables. The impact of these two processes on landscape ecology is documented by floristic data from four different landscape units near the town Jülich. Land reclaimed for forestry about twenty years ago shows a relatively high plant species diversity, although many plants are ephemeral and until recently, wood-land species from the former forests are poorly represented. Although there have been significant advances in reclamation techniques, there is still room for improvement from an ecological viewpoint. Because of their high ecological value, wetlands surrounding the open-cast mines must be protected from potential impacts. The riparian corridor is by far the most species-rich landscape unit.

TI  - Importance of early successional habitats to mammals in eastern forests
PY  - 2001
AB  - Populations of mammals that depend on early successional forests or shrub-dominated habitats are declining in portions of the eastern United States. Although much of this decline can be attributed to maturation of young forests that once dominated the East, fragmentation and suppression of natural disturbances also have been implicated. Responses by habitat specialists (e.g., New England cottontails [Sylvilagus transitionalis]) and carnivores with large area requirements that rely on prey associated with early successional habitats (e.g., bobcats [Lynx rufus]) have been most extreme. Populations of facultative or opportunistic users of early successional habitats (e.g., black bears [Ursus americanus] and little brown bats [Myotis lucifugus]) apparently have not been affected by fewer young stands. As eastern forests mature, biotic and abiotic forces will increase abundance of early successional habitats. However, maturation of these forests will take a century or more. In the meantime, using even-aged silviculture and applying controlled burns to native shrublands may be useful to alleviate current shortages. In landscapes modified substantially by suburban-urban developments and dense networks of roads, conventional management efforts likely will be insufficient. In these regions, increased populations of generalist predators are capable of exerting intense predation on mammalian herbivores that are restricted to small patches, and movement between patches by small mammals is limited. Mammals with large area requirements also are hampered in these landscapes by frequent road crossings. These limitations may require implementing habitat management programs for mammals that differ from those developed for other disturbance-dependent taxa. Large (> 10-ha), clustered patches of early successional habitat may be necessary to maintain viable populations. The effectiveness of these managed habitats will be further enhanced by positioning them close to existing land uses that are characterized by early successional habitats (e.g., powerline corridors). In agricultural landscapes, the representation of old-field habitats could be increased in set-aside programs.

TI  - The impact of world bank policies on indigenous communities
PY  - 2012
AB  - The neoliberal macroeconomic, agrarian, and environmental reforms implemented in Mexico since 1982 were designed to sustain economic growth, increase the population's standard of living, and fight poverty. The reforms acknowledged that the natural resources were being exploited and that those extracting these resources should assume the obligation of protecting and preserving the environment from a sustainability perspective. Nevertheless, under neoliberal reforms, economic development actually diminished, particularly within the peasant and indigenous sectors. As a result of the emphasis on urban-industrial development, natural resources were poorly regulated and are still intensively exploited, with adverse impacts not only on the environment but also on indigenous and peasant communities. This chapter reviews and analyzes why some of these programs failed. Neoliberalism, as defined in this book, includes economic policies such as deregulated markets, privatization, and democratization; diminished social programs (e.g., cuts to existing programs, reduced staff, less funding); and restructuring of public agencies. However, although economically developed countries expect open markets from others, they place tariffs and restrictions on the importation of competing products. Neoliberalism, as a technocratic, mercantilist, and macroeconomic (and not necessarily philosophical) movement, has a geopolitical dimension that is alienated from social and collective interests. Social anthropology in general opposes these principles, since the study of human diversity implies equilibrium in human relations that should preclude all forms of exploitation and colonialism. Neoliberal policies include multilateral trade agreements and government programs that underlie these social programs. For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in 1994 with the aim of achieving harmonious development among Mexico, Canada, and the United States; expanding world commerce; reducing commercial distortions; and ensuring a predictable commercial framework for planning productive activities and encouraging investments. Also, NAFTA was intended to create new job opportunities and improve labor conditions and standards of living in the three countries. It has been over thirty years since this agreement was signed, and the results have not been favorable for Mexico, although the agreement has benefited both the United States and Canada by eliminating obstacles for commerce and the border movement of goods and services. NAFTA was also supposed to create the necessary conditions for fair competition in this free trade area. Nevertheless, it has had a negative impact on the small farms of indigenous and peasant peoples in Mexico because they cannot compete with the large-scale farms that have replaced them (see Weaver, chapter 9, this volume). The Programa de Apoyos Directos al Campo (Program for Direct Support to Farmers [PROCAMPO]) was designed as a direct subsidy for rich and poor agricultural producers. Supposedly, this new subsidy would signify the withdrawal of all prior programs for the support of peasants, such as the Instituto Mexicana de Café (Mexican Coffee Institute [INMECAFE]), Productos Forestales de la Tarahumara (Tarahumara Forest Products [PROFORTARA]), Compañía Nacional de Subsistencias Populares (CONASUPO), Fideicomiso de Productus de Palma (Trust for Palm Products [FIDEPALM]), and Cordeles de Henequen de Mexico (Sisal Twine of Mexico [CORDEMEX]). Under PROCAMPO the government provided subsidies to support the production of coffee, forestry (for the Tarahumara of Chihuahua, for example), and the purchase of basic commodities such as corn, beans, wheat, and products containing palm or henequen fiber. This policy assured production of these products at a just price for farmers and their availability in national and international markets. Other policies had the intent of modernizing the Mexican countryside with the privatization of ejidos (communal properties for indigenous and mestizo peoples set up by the Land Reform Law in the early twentieth century) and communal properties. These programs are discussed later in this chapter. Guaranteed prices for corn, beans, wheat, coffee, and sugar were withdrawn in the belief that PROCAMPO would distort the market prices of food products. These subsidies were eliminated after NAFTA, with the result that rural farmers were no longer protected by state policies. A particularly onerous program was instituted in 2001 by the Inter-American Development Bank and other development agencies. The Plan Puebla-Panamá (PPP) was a program involving eight Mesoamerican countries, a region of over 1 million square kilometers with 64 million inhabitants. It hoped to develop regional projects that would include information, consultation, and social participation for peasants and indigenous peoples. This was, in anthropological terms, an integrative plan arbitrarily and vertically imposed on millions of indigenous peoples in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Panama. The riches of this vast Mesoamerican territory would supposedly be exploited \"sustainably,\" but at the heart of the matter was the intention to appropriate the region's natural resources to apply the principles and practices of neoliberalism. In theory, the main objective of the PPP was to stimulate regional cooperation to exploit-in a sustainable manner-the riches and comparative advantages of the Mesoamerican region, repair the historical deficit infrastructure, and reduce marked poverty levels as well as vulnerability to climate variability and natural disasters. In fact, the plan had the opposite effect. One of the programs included in the PPP was the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. As is the case with the other environmental program, Natural Protected Areas, the Biological Corridor is the responsibility of the Mexican Secretary for the Environment, a subsection of the Secretaria del Medio Ambiente (SEMARNAT). This agency also manages the Programa de Certificación de Derechos Ejidales y Solares (Program for the Certification of Ejidal Land Rights and the Titling of Urban House Plots [PROCEDE]), a program that regulates land tenure and privatization. Another example was the conversion of PULSAR, a private corporation that began as a company for the production of tobacco and was transformed into a multinational to introduce genetically engineered seeds and trees to peasants and indigenous farmers and foresters. This PPP company induced these people to re-pay for seeds with each new crop rather than use the seeds from prior crops. © 2012 by University Press of Colorado. All rights reserved.

TI  - European starlings expand into Patagonia. Time for action
PY  - 2022
AB  - European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were introduced ca. 40 years ago to South America, where they naturalized to central and northern Argentina, now reaching some neighboring countries. While Patagonia (southern Argentina and Chile) has remained free of European starlings (ES) in the past, they are now present along its northern boundary. Our objectives were to 1) investigate the factors explaining this recent invasion, and 2) predict how starlings might expand across southernmost America based on niche modeling using landform, land cover, and climatic variables representing conditions that may limit ES. Based on records from community science, informants, and our own observations, we conclude that two parallel processes generated new population nodes in northern Patagonia: 1) a southwards expansion from their core areas near the Atlantic coast (generating an incipient population node in NE Patagonia), and 2) birds released or escaped from captivity (generating an isolated population node in north-central Patagonia). Community science data was most useful from 2018 onwards, while data from informants was key to understand previous events (e.g., first ES confiscated from illegal trade in 2008; first free ranging ES seen in 2014). The most parsimonious model confirmed our prediction that human transformed lands in several portions within the target area are suitable for ES establishment, both in Chile and Argentina. Null suitability was modeled for the lands in southernmost Patagonia (all cover types). Desert lands (Patagonian steppe, Monte Desert, High Andes) that skirt the Andean temperate forests on the north, and most of the Andean forests, turned out to be unsuitable (especially with increasing latitude). Conversely, most of coastal Argentine Patagonia and the human-transformed lands of south-central Chile emerged as moderately suitable habitat for ES. Because the riverine areas under current ES colonization in northern Patagonia are fovourable for ES (i.e., agricultural and urban lands with abundant nesting sites), without control actions, this species might soon spread over ca. 5000 km2 around the Colorado and Negro rivers, affecting their agricultural industry. These rivers, which run west-east through desert lands unsuitable for ES, now represent corridors into south-Andean ecosystems, as they are surrounded by treed land (willows and poplars introduced from Europe) not originally available, connecting formerly separate ecoregions. In case ES manage to reach the eastern slopes of the Andes, they might cross to Chile through low elevation passes (<1000 masl) available south of ca. 38°S. The valleys of south-central Chile are both suitable habitat for ES and valuable productive lands that may be threatened by the invasion. We present management suggestions, and advocate for the development of a bi-national strategy to retard, prevent and alleviate the far-reaching impacts ES may exert on America's southernmost ecosystems and resources. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Impacts of land use at the catchment scale constrain the habitat benefits of stream riparian buffers
PY  - 2013
AB  - Stream conservation and restoration strategies commonly focus on preserving extant riparian forest and restoring riparian habitat. Though these practices are beneficial to stream habitat, they may not suffice to restore stream condition in catchments heavily influenced by intensive land use. To evaluate this hypothesis, we measured invertebrate populations in 12 streams affected by different land-use types (cultivated, developed, forested and grassland). Within each stream, we compared reaches with and without riparian buffers of remnant mature forest. Within each reach, we calculated the relative abundance of individuals from the insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (%EPT) and assessed specific conductance, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature and substratum composition. Forested catchments had the highest %EPT (average 23.8) followed by grassland (16.1), cultivated (1.96) and developed (0.31). Reaches with forested buffers present were not associated with higher %EPT in forested, cultivated or developed catchments. In grassland catchments, however, %EPT was about eightfold higher in reaches with forested buffers than those without. High values of %EPT were associated with large stream substratum and low specific conductance and temperature, which were most common in forested catchments. Developed and cultivated catchments did not follow this pattern, %EPT being uniformly low, even where abiotic conditions were similar to forested catchments. These results confirm that intensive urban and cultivated land uses at the catchment scale degrade stream biological communities. They also indicate that patchy forested riparian corridors, as found in many restoration projects, are probably insufficient to mitigate severe, large-scale biological degradation. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Sand drift potential impacts within desert railway corridors: a case study of the Sarakhs-Mashhad railway line
PY  - 2021
AB  - Railways play a key role in the connection between urban and rural areas and enhance the economic sectors of many countries. However, little is known about wind regimes within the railway corridors, particularly in developing countries. The main aim of this research is to identify and analyze wind regimes and sand drift potential (DP) within the Sarakhs-Mashhad railway corridor based on 3-h wind speed data collected during the last two decades (1996–2016). Our results showed that the highest frequency of winds in the three monitored stations was from the northwest (NW) and north (N) for the Sarakhs (NW=21.5%, N=9.3%) and Torbat-e Jam (N=16%, NW=28.4%), and from the south (S) and east (E) for the Mashhad (S=13.49%, E=13.3%). Monthly analysis of wind regime showed that the mean frequency of calm winds increased from 26% in Torbat-e Jam to 46% in Sarakhs. Annual assessment of the sand rose graph showed that Torbat-e Jam registered the highest DP values (DP= 336, RDP= 211) and the Mashhad area the lowest (DP= 71, RDP= 22). Looking at the complete Sarakhs-Mashhad railway line corridor, summer months (particularly July) recorded the highest frequency of sand drift potential, while the autumn season recorded the lowest values. Some railway stations such as Sarakhs, Gonbadli, and Robate Sharif in the vicinity of Sarakhs Erg have the greatest threats of damage by sand movement. We recommend an increase in the stabilizing activities using biological methods of native plant species, especially planting perpendicularly to the erosive prevailing wind direction (north–northwest).

TI  - Chemical loading into surface water along a hydrological, biogeochemical, and land use gradient: A holistic watershed approach
PY  - 2006
AB  - Identifying the sources and impacts of organic and inorganic contaminants at the watershed scale is a complex challenge because of the multitude of processes occurring in time and space. Investigation of geochemical transformations requires a systematic evaluation of hydrologic, landscape, and anthropogenic factors. The 1160 km2 Boulder Creek Watershed in the Colorado Front Range encompasses a gradient of geology, ecotypes, climate, and urbanization. Streamflow originates primarily as snowmelt and shows substantial annual variation. Water samples were collected along a 70-km transect during spring-runoff and base-flow conditions, and analyzed for major elements, trace elements, bulk organics, organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs), and pesticides. Major-element and trace-element concentrations were low in the headwaters, increased through the urban corridor, and had a step increase downstream from the first major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Boron, gadolinium, and lithium were useful inorganic tracers of anthropogenic inputs. Effluent from the WWTP accounted for as much as 75% of the flow in Boulder Creek and was the largest chemical input. Under both hydrological conditions, OWCs and pesticides were detected in Boulder Creek downstream from the WWTP outfall as well as in the headwater region, and loads of anthropogenic-derived contaminants increased as basin population density increased. This report documents a suite of potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals in a reach of stream with native fish populations showing indication of endocrine disruption.

TI  - Home range size, space use and resource selection of griffon vultures in an insular environment
PY  - 2021
AB  - The extent of home ranges of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) was studied on Crete (Greece) during 2005–2015 by monitoring 27 individuals with very high frequency radio-telemetry. Radio-tagged birds were followed for an average period of 13.1 months (n = 7–22), where a total of 1615 days of fieldwork produced 4420 radiolocations (x = 163.5 radiolocations per tagged bird, n = 142–328). Overall, the mean home range and mean core area of griffon vultures were estimated at 1560 ± 140 km2 (KDE 95%) and 373 ± 36 km2 (KDE 50%) respectively with significant age-related differences within seasons. Immature griffon vultures ranged on average about double the area ranged by adults in winter and occupied significantly larger core areas. The home range overlap in per cent and utilization distribution between adult and immature birds was also significantly less in winter than in summer. Foraging griffon vultures avoided northern slopes with unfavourable flight conditions and selected sites within rangelands with low diurnal temperature variations where overwintering livestock and suitable nesting cliffs occur. Foraging adults were restricted to the vicinity of the breeding colonies and favoured sites away from urban zones. In contrast, immature griffon vultures selected pastoral zones in marginal areas with mild winters and rugged terrain. The existence of predictable food sources in combination with suitable roosting sites and favourable flight conditions were the main factors differentiating the space-use pattern between the two age classes. We recommend that apart from the maintenance of traditional farming practices, sites, such as large communal roosts and flight corridors or entire ‘hotspot’ activity zones of immature birds, should be taken into account in conservation planning and sensitivity mapping for the species. © 2021 The Zoological Society of London

TI  - Food Chain Restoration for Pollinators: Regional Habitat Recovery Strategies Involving Protected Areas of the Southwest
PY  - 2016
AB  - The steep declines over the last quarter century of wild pollinators in the Southwest among native bees, monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.), hummingbirds, and nectar-feeding bats have come during a time of accelerated climate change, and are likely due to a variety of stresses interacting with climatic shifts. Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that declining availability and altered timing of floral resources along \"nectar corridors\" accessible to pollinators involves climatic shifts as a serious stressor that had been previously underestimated. Longitudinal studies from both urban heat islands and rural habitats in Southwestern North America suggest peak flowering of many wildflowers serving as floral resources for pollinators is occurring three to five weeks earlier in spring than a century ago, leaving \"phenological gaps\" in nectar resource availability for certain pollinators. To avoid the threat of what A. Dobson (Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University) and others have termed \"food web collapse,\" a range of groups have initiated ecological restoration efforts in semi-arid zones that attempt to (a) assemble more resilient plant-pollinator food chains, and (b) hydrologically restore watercourses to ensure water scarcity will be less likely to disrupt re-assembled food chains in the face of droughts, catastrophic floods, and other correlates of global climate change. We recommend \"bottom-up food chain restoration\" strategies for restoring nectar corridors in protected areas on or near geopolitical and land management boundaries in all regions, but particularly in the Southwest or US-Mexico desert border states. We highlight binational and multicultural workshops facilitated to communicate about, and initiate restoration of, mutualistic relationships among plants, pollinators, and people to protected area managers on both sides of the border.

TI  - Using conditional inference forests to identify the factors affecting crash severity on arterial corridors
PY  - 2009
AB  - Introduction: The study aims at identifying traffic/highway design/driver-vehicle information significantly related with fatal/severe crashes on urban arterials for different crash types. Since the data used in this study are observational (i.e., collected outside the purview of a designed experiment), an information discovery approach is adopted for this study. Method: Random Forests, which are ensembles of individual trees grown by CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm, are applied in numerous applications for this purpose. Specifically, conditional inference forests have been implemented. In each tree of the conditional inference forest, splits are based on how good the association is. Chi-square test statistics are used to measure the association. Apart from identifying the variables that improve classification accuracy, the methodology also clearly identifies the variables that are neutral to accuracy, and also those that decrease it. Results: The methodology is quite insightful in identifying the variables of interest in the database (e.g., alcohol/ drug use and higher posted speed limits contribute to severe crashes). Failure to use safety equipment by all passengers and presence of driver/passenger in the vulnerable age group (more than 55 years or less than 3 years) increased the severity of injuries given a crash had occurred. A new variable, 'element' has been used in this study, which assigns crashes to segments, intersections, or access points based on the information from site location, traffic control, and presence of signals. Impact: The authors were able to identify roadway locations where severe crashes tend to occur. For example, segments and access points were found to be riskier for single vehicle crashes. Higher skid resistance and k-factor also contributed toward increased severity of injuries in crashes. © 2009 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Characterization of modern and historical seismic– tsunamic events and their global–societal impacts
PY  - 2021
AB  - Earthquakes and tsunamis are high-impact geohazard events that can be extremely destructive when they occur at large magnitudes and intensities, although their causes and potential locations are, for the most part, predictable within the framework of plate tectonics. Amongst the main reasons for their high impact include enormous numbers of casualties, extensive property damage in vast areas and significant social and economic disruption in urban settings where populous residential areas, global banking centres, industrial factories and critical facilities (nuclear power plants, dams) may be located. In order to reduce the impact of these geohazards, nations, societies, professional organizations and governments need to collaborate to prepare more effective seismic and tsunami risk assessments, disaster management plans, educational and training programmes for increased preparedness of the public, and strategic plans and objectives for capacity building, skill and knowledge transfer, and building of societal resilience. Improved building design and construction codes and emergency preparedness and evacuation plans should be part of disaster management plans in countries where destructive earthquakes and tsunamis have occurred. The rapid increases in population along coastal corridors in developing and developed countries is likely to escalate the social and economic impacts of these geohazards exponentially in the future. The chapters in this book present case studies of some of the most salient earthquake and tsunami events in historical and modern times, their origins and manifestations, and efforts and the most effective practices of risk assessment and disaster management implemented by various governments, international organizations and inter-governmental agencies following these events. New methods of computing probabilistic seismic hazard risks, delineating respect distance and damage zones along and across seismically active faults and recognizing tsunamigenic and submarine landslides on the seafloor are introduced. The conclusions presented in the chapters show that: (1) scientific understanding of the characteristics of seismically active faults is paramount; (2) increased local (community), national and global resilience is necessary to empower societal preparedness for earthquake and tsunami events; and, (3) all stakeholders, including policy-makers, scientists, local, state and national governments, media and world organizations (UNESCO, IUGS, GeoHazards International, Global Geodetic Observing System, National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program) must work together to disseminate accurate and timely information on geohazards, to develop effective legislation for risk reduction and to prepare realistic and practical hazard mitigation and management measures. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - The health implications of increased manganese in the environment resulting from the combustion of fuel additives
PY  - 1984
AB  - Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) is effective In raising the octane level of gasoline and Is currently used In Canada for that purpose in a maximal concentration of 18 mg Mn/I (slightly less than 0.07 g Mn/U.S. gal). It has been estimated that If MMT were used in all U.S. gasoline In these amounts, the median Increase of Mn In ambient air would be not more than 0.05 μg Mn/m3, with Increments generally less than 0.5 μg Mn/m3 along urban corridors. The scientific literature was reviewed to determine how the increases in environmental manganese predicted from MMT use would relate to the amounts in the natural environment and necessary to life and to the concentrations associated with toxic effects. Even with additional manganese from the use of fuel additives, total Mn Intakes would remain within the range of average amounts absorbed from food and water. Respirable manganese In ambient air due to MMT combustion would be many order of magnitude below the concentrations associated with occupational manganism and respiratory problems and also below those reported in Isolated episodes of respiratory symptoms in communities near ferromanganese plants Evidence was reviewed on the possibilities of: (1) increased absorption of Inhaled man-ganese compared with ingested manganese; (2) hypersusceptibility of Infants and persons of advanced age; and (3) increased absorption associated with iron deficiency. While relevant to high levels of exposure, these factors would not be expected to lead to toxic effects from the very tow concentrations of Mn resulting from MMT use. Experimental animals that Inhaled the combustion products of MMT in concentrations of approximately 10, 100, and 1000 pg Mn/m3 for 9 mo did not show toxic effects, although there was temporary elevation of tissue levels of Mn. Rhesus monkeys, susceptible to the neurologic effects of Mn, showed no symptoms after inhaling the combustion products of MMT in concentrations of 100 μg Mn/m3 for up to 66 wk. Monkeys exposed to 5000 μg Mn/m3 also showed no symptoms. There Is thus a wide margin of safety between the Intakes of Mn essential to health and the high concentrations that have been associated with toxic effects. The small amounts of manganese added to the environment by the combustion of MMT used as a fuel additive would be comparable to the normal background and should not create health problems. © 1984 by Hemisphere Publishing Corporation.

TI  - The relationship between the occurrence of Colorado potato beetle, leptinotarsa decemlineata, and rivers based on GIS: A case study of shawan country
PY  - 2011
AB  - The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is native to Mexico. This important insect can completely defoliate and destroy potato crops. In 1993, it was first reported in the People's Republic of China in its northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. It spread rapidly along the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains from west to east at a rate of 80 km/ year. Had it not been controlled when it reached the western edge of the town of Dashitou in Mori Kazakh Autonomous County in 2003, it very likely would have threatened potato production in Gansu Province, China's main potato producing region. Previous studies have documented the life history, chemical control methods, insecticide resistance, and other information, but the effects of environmental factors on its distribution have rarely been studied. Rivers often play an important role as corridors for pest invasion while providing water for crop production in arid and semiarid regions. What role are rivers playing in the spread of the Colorado potato beetle in the northern areas of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region? This paper addresses the spread of the Colorado potato beetle in Shawan County by determining the role rivers are playing in its distribution in riparian habitats, using the spatial analysis tools of ArcGIS 8. 3 software. Survey data indicate the Colorado potato beetle was first found in t he towns of Boertonggu, Xigebi, and Dongwan in Shawan County in 1998. Damage levels to crops reached level four in these towns and the surrounding areas, the highest level. These areas were all more heavily impacted than other towns where this beetle arrived later. As the Colorado potato beetle spread from south to north along riparian habitats, the degree of impact gradually de clined so that northern towns and areas received less impact. The beetles arrived in central and northern Shawan County in areas around the towns and townships of Jinggouhe and Wulanwusu in 1999 and in Sidaohezi, Laoshawan, Liumaowan, and Shanghudi in 2000. The ArcGIS Directional Distribution (Standard Deviational Ellipse) tool was used to determine whether the distribution of the Colorado potato beetle exhibits a directional trend when compared with the direction of river flow in Shawan County. The results suggest the direction of the spread of Colorado potato beetle and the direction of river flows coincide; both go from south to north in Shawan County. The ArcGIS buffer zone tool was used to study the level of damage caused by Colorado potato beetles as they spread following water channels in riparian habitats. The damage levels from Colorado potato beetles were documented by calculating a series of nested buffer zones. A series of five 1-km-wide nested buffer zones were created along the rivers of the study area, with the combined buffer zones extending 5 km on each side of each river. The results show beetle impact was significantly different in each buffer zone: buffer zone 2 (1-2 km) > buffer zone 4 (3-4 km) > buffer zone 5 (4-5 km) > buffer zone 1 (0-1 km) > buffer zone 3 (2-3 km). Habitats along rivers also showed significantly different impacts from beetles: Jinggou River > Anjihai River > Manas River > Xi'an Canal.

TI  - Soil pollution with heavy metals in the area of copsa mica town - geographical considerations
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper explores an issue of maximum importance for the environment, namely the heavy metal pollution in the area of Copsa Mica town, a settlement known worldwide for the high pollution caused by the non-ferrous and chemical plants of its industrial site. Of great significance for this study are also the geographical location of the industrial site and the distribution of landforms along the wide valley corridor of the Tarnava Mare, which channels the air masses and encourages the deposition of solid and gaseous pollutants. The pollution triggered by SC Sometra SA has negatively impacted the human health (increasing morbidity) and the terrestrial and aquatic fauna, leading to the diminution or disappearance of certain living populations, as well as to the occurrence of pathological alterations. The assessment of soil quality in the region highlights its significant impairment on large areas with specific pollutants. The study has revealed the existence of three polluted areas, as follows: the most polluted area, the middle polluted area and the least polluted area.

TI  - Water consumption characteristic of Haloxylon ammodendron for sand binding in desert area
PY  - 2007
AB  - Owing to the result of adaption to drought, salinity, poor nutrition, strong wind, sand movement and high light intensity, Haloxylon ammodendron have traditionally been planted to break wind and fix sand against dust storm menace and sand movement for maintaining oasis ecological environment balance and economic sustainable development in arid region of Northwest China. Especially, H. ammodendron have been a significant species to planted wind break and sand fixation forest in Hexi corridor, arid region of Northwest China. Sand-fixation forest is 4. 46 X 104 hm2 in the middle Reaches of Heihe River Basin and H. ammodendron forest cover an area of 10%. In arid area where the precipitation is 100 to 200mm, H. ammodendron growth depend highly on the precipitation or and) groundwater. To explore water consumption in artificial H. ammodendron forests, individual H. ammodendron sap flow was measured by heat pulse technology -F300, Greenspan technology Pty Ltd, Australian). The result can help to providing scientific basis for arid-forestation and integrating evaluation for management. H. ammodendron forest selected as sampling plots was planted at Pinchuan town in Linze county, Gansu province in 1980. The initial planted density is 5000 -6000 individual hm 2and the existing density is 1600 individual hm 2. During the experiment, 8 standard samples of H. ammodendron were selected according to different size basal stem class. The measured periods are from May 21 to June 1; June 21 to July 1; July 21 to Aug. 1; and Aug. 21 to Sept. 1. The sap flow was measured by using heat pulses lasting 1.6 seconds every 30 minutes. Soil moisture content was measured every 10 days from 10 May to 1 Sept.Climatic data were measured by EERIL3 IMK0; German) include short-wave incoming radiation CM7B; KippN Zonen; Delft; Netherlands); air temperature and relative humidity RMP45D; Vaisala; Vantaa; Finland); and wind-speed (RS2 rotronic AG; Bassersdrof; Switzerland). Short-wave radiation; air temperature; relative humidity and wind-speed were recorded every 5 minutes and stored in a datalogger as mean values of 30min periods; precipitation was recorded an accumulated value everyday. Daily sap flow of H. ammodendron for sand binding was continuously measured by the heat-pulse velocity method in desert during growing season to identify its individual water consumption and to determine the relationship between water consumption and environmental factor. The results showed that the sap flow velocity on a sapwood area basis were fluctuated small between day and night and the daily average sap flow velocity on a sapwood area basis varied from 5. 9 ±0.7) g cm h to 14.5 ±3.6) g cm h. The mean of daily water consumption was 0. 3 ± 0. 2) mm d and water consumption was 49. 4mm. The response sensitivity of sap flow velocity to climatic variables differs in different growing stages. The multivariate analysis showed association of the sap flow velocity and daily water consumption with climatic variables; respectively. The result also showed daily water consumption and its canopy projective area; basal diameter; product of basal diameter square and height; sapwood and sapwood area were being better linear relationships during growing season.

TI  - Spatial analysis of anthropogenic disturbance regimes and roadside shrubs in a fragmented agricultural landscape
PY  - 2004
AB  - In fragmented woodlands in agricultural regions of Australia, roadside environments (road verges) provide important refuges for threatened native fauna and isolated populations of plant species. However, as roads are transport corridors for humans and their vehicles, species survival is affected through destruction, fragmentation and modification of remaining habitat by human activity. Few studies have recognised the effects of anthropogenic disturbances, in the form of historical roadworks activities, on adjacent roadside plant populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soil disturbance from roadworks on the spatial patterns and structural dynamics of roadside Acacia populations in an agricultural area in southeastern Australia. Stem size and disturbance data were collected from 135 roadside populations of three species of Acacia shrubs in the Lockhart Shire area. Spatial pattern analysis using the Network K-function and Discriminant Function analyses showed that road verge width, road category, disturbance intensity and distance to nearest town were highly significant variables in relation to disturbance from roadworks and shrub structural dynamics. Colonising populations were more abundant along gravel roads where soil disturbance intensity was high, whereas stable populations were more abundant where soil disturbance intensity was low. Senescent populations were more abundant in narrow, little used road verge corridors 4-6 km from nearby towns. These results suggest that anthropogenic disturbance regimes may be critical to shrub recruitment and persistence in roadside environments, which has important consequences for conservation of threatened native flora and fauna in agricultural landscapes.
