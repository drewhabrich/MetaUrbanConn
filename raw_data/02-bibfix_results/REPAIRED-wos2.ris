TI  - The history and future directions of greenways in Japanese New Towns
PY  - 2006
AB  - A number of societal changes such as an ageing population and a lack of economic prosperity mean that Japanese greenway planners will be faced with a number of new challenges in the coming decades. These societal changes will be particularly dramatic in the Japanese New Towns, which were constructed in the late 1950s. Some of these New Towns marked a departure for Japanese planning by including a network of greenways, which were planned to provide pleasant corridors for pedestrians and bikers. Around 30 years have passed since these areas were developed; today the greenways in these New Towns have become corridors with dense and rich greenery. Such matured greenways, which were supposed to provide an amenity for local residents, have increasingly come to be regarded as a cause of fear of crime. To try and mitigate this, trees and shrubs along the greenways are now closely trimmed or even removed. However, such mature vegetation along the greenways may be regarded as a feature that maintains the history of the town. Such vegetation is also expected to provide ecological corridors that accommodate wildlife species which were abundant in the rural areas surrounding these New Towns. Within the context of proposing an optimum management scheme for Japanese greenways, the following study aims to explain and discuss how the fear of crime on greenways can be prevented whilst maintaining their ecological and historical functions.

TI  - Environmental factors are primary determinants of different facets of pond macroinvertebrate alpha and beta diversity in a human-modified landscape
PY  - 2019
AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns and environmental drivers of freshwater diversity and community structure is a key challenge in biogeography and conservation biology. However, previous studies have focussed primarily on taxonomic diversity and have largely ignored the phylogenetic and functional facets resulting in an incomplete understanding of the community assembly. Here, we examine the influence of local environmental, hydrological proximity effects, land-use type and spatial structuring on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic (using taxonomic relatedness as a proxy) alpha and beta diversity (including the turnover and nestedness-resultant components) of pond macroinvertebrate communities. Ninety-five ponds across urban and non-urban land-uses in Leicestershire, UK were examined. Functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity were negatively correlated with species richness. At the alpha scale, functional diversity and taxonomic richness were primarily determined by local environmental factors while phylogenetic alpha diversity was driven by spatial factors. Compositional variation (beta diversity) of the different facets and components of functional and phylogenetic diversity were largely determined by local environmental variables. Pond surface area, dry phase length and macrophyte cover were consistently important predictors of the different facets and components of alpha and beta diversity. Our results suggest that pond management activities aimed at improving biodiversity should focus on improving and/or restoring local environmental conditions. Quantifying alpha and beta diversity of the different biodiversity facets facilitates a more accurate assessment of patterns in diversity and community structure. Integrating taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity into conservation strategies will increase their efficiency and effectiveness, and maximise biodiversity protection in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Influence of human population size and the built environment on avian assemblages in urban green spaces
PY  - 2013
AB  - While studies of how habitat patch dynamics structures avian communities in urban environments has received some attention, there is considerably less known of how the built environment and human population size may influence the structuring of urban bird communities. We investigated bird populations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) through replicated point count surveys of breeding birds in 50 parks and cemeteries of varying sizes. We counted 4,435 individual birds in 441 counts. Of the 61 species detected, 27 were rare (detected at < 8 points). Migratory species accounted for 46.1 % of all individuals, while 23.2 % of all individuals were of introduced species. Species richness increased significantly with green area size, as did the number of rare species. Species diversity decreased significantly with an increase in the proportion of individuals of introduced species; in particular, cavity nesters were less abundant when introduced species were present. Elements of the built urban environment including commercial development and transportation corridors were associated with significant reductions in park-wide species richness, mean number of species per point, and mean number of individual birds recorded per point. Human population size was positively related to increased numbers of individuals of introduced species, but a lower mean number of species per point. Ours is among the first to identify specific relationships between avian population characteristics and human population size, as few other studies have specifically incorporated human population size into a local, fine grain study design. Our data suggest that human population size is an important parameter that can be measured independently of characteristics of the built environment and the physical characteristics of the park itself as a correlate of avian diversity and abundance. Our study points to a variety of trade-offs needed to manage habitat for birds in urban settings.

TI  - Methodology proposed for photogrammetric monitoring of the exotic species Hovenia dulcis Thunb. in the Green Belt area surrounding the city of Santa Cruz do Sul, RS, Brazil
PY  - 2020
AB  - The spread of the exotic species Hovenia dulcis known as Japanese raisin tree, coming from Asia, detected in a protected area of 465.0 ha surrounding the city of Santa Cruz do Sul, RS, Brazil, named \"Green Belt.\" In this context, this research aimed at developing an aerial monitoring system able to identify and quantify the extension in the Green Belt area that this species invaded, as well as describing the impacts caused on the local forest community. We collected data from an ultralight Flyer GT aircraft equipped with a vertical camera. The images were taking in June and July 2015, when H. dulcis trees have shed their leaves, displaying a gray color, and September and October 2015, when the leaves are young and with a light green color. Based on the methodology proposed trough aerial monitoring by photogrammetry, the results indicated that the total invaded area by H. dulcis in the Green Belt of Santa Cruz do Sul County, RS, was 131.8 ha, corresponding to 20.9% of the total area. To validate this method, a quantitative comparison between the result from a terrestrial fieldwork carried out and the proposed method showed no significant differences in the estimated area occupied by H. dulcis. We concluded that these results validate the proposed aerial assessment method.

TI  - Spatial population genetics in heavily managed species: Separating patterns of historical translocation from contemporary gene flow in white-tailed deer
PY  - 2021
AB  - Approximately 100 years ago, unregulated harvest nearly eliminated white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from eastern North America, which subsequently served to catalyze wildlife management as a national priority. An extensive stock-replenishment effort soon followed, with deer broadly translocated among states as a means of re-establishment. However, an unintended consequence was that natural patterns of gene flow became obscured and pretranslocation signatures of population structure were replaced. We applied cutting-edge molecular and biogeographic tools to disentangle genetic signatures of historical management from those reflecting spatially heterogeneous dispersal by evaluating 35,099 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived via reduced-representation genomic sequencing from 1143 deer sampled statewide in Arkansas. We then employed Simpson's diversity index to summarize ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub-sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of re-colonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a statewide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas is also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories.

TI  - Artificial light may change flight patterns of bats near bridges along urban waterways
PY  - 2021
AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is considered as a major threat to biodiversity, especially to nocturnal species, as it reduces availability, quality and functionality of habitats. However, its effects on the way species use landscape elements such as rivers are still largely understudied, especially the effect of crossing infrastructure lighting on bridges. These elements are nevertheless key commuting and foraging habitats in heavily urbanised landscapes for several taxa such as bats that are particularly affected by ALAN. We studied the effects of the illumination of facades and undersides of bridges on the relative abundance of pipistrelle bats, on their 3D distribution and their behavioural response (i.e. flight speed) close to bridges. We set-up an innovative approach based on a microphone-array to reconstruct positions and flight trajectories in 3D. We studied the effect of lighting on bats in the close proximity of six similar bridges, mostly differentiated by the presence or absence of lighting (3 lit and 3 unlit). All bridges cross the same waterway, within a uniformly and highly urbanized agglomeration (Toulouse, France). We found that bat activity was 1.7 times lower in lit sites. Bats tended to keep a larger distance, and to fly faster close to illuminated bridges. These results suggest that bridge lighting strongly reduces habitat availability and likely connectivity for bats. In that case, results call for switching off the illumination of such bridges crossing riverine ecosystems to preserve their functionality as habitats and corridors for bats.

TI  - Considering habitat conversion and fragmentation in characterisation factors for land-use impacts on vertebrate species richness
PY  - 2021
AB  - Human land use is one of the primary threats to terrestrial species richness and is considered a priority for meeting global sustainability and biodiversity targets. Decision-support tools, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), are widely used for developing strategies to achieve such objectives. Currently available life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods apply the countryside species-area relationship (c-SAR) to quantify habitat conversion impacts on species richness. However, additional effects of habitat fragmentation are yet ignored in these assessments. We use the species-habitat relationship (SHR), an adaptation of the c-SAR that considers both habitat conversion and fragmentation effects, to develop a new set of land-use characterisation factors for 702 terrestrial ecoregions (in 238 countries), four land-use types (urban, cropland, pasture, and forestry), and four taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles; plus the aggregate of these vertebrate groups). The SHR generally predicts higher per-area impacts of land-use than the impacts estimated by the c-SAR (a median relative difference of +9%), indicating that land-use impacts may be systematically underestimated when ignoring fragmentation effects. Whereas per-area impacts of land-use on regional species richness are highest in temperate regions, reflecting the diminished extent of natural habitat, per-area impacts of land-use on global species richness are highest in the subtropics, reflecting the importance of tropical regions and islands to global vertebrate species diversity. The large variety in magnitude of land-use impacts across the world's regions emphasizes the importance of regionalised assessments. The set of characterisation factors proposed here can be readily used in environmental decision-making. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Multi-Agent-Based Urban Vegetation Design
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban vegetation is an essential element of the urban city pedestrian walkway. Despite city forest regulations and urban planning best practices, vegetation planning lacks clear comprehension and compatibility with other urban elements surrounding it. Urban planners and academic researchers currently devote vital attention to include most of the urban elements and their impact on the occupants and the environment in the planning stage of urban development. With the advancement in computational design, they have developed various algorithms to generate design alternatives and measure their impact on the environment that meets occupants' needs and perceptions of their city. In particular, multi-agent-based simulations show great promise in developing rule compliance with urban vegetation design tools. This paper proposed an automatic urban vegetation city rule compliance approach for pedestrian pathway vegetation, leveraging multi-agent system and algorithmic modeling tools. This approach comprises three modules: rule compliance (T-Rule), street vegetation design tool (T-Design), and multi-agent alternative generation (T-Agent). Notably, the scope of the paper is limited to trees, shrubbery, and seating area configurations in the urban pathway context. To validate the developed design tool, a case study was tested, and the vegetation design tool generated the expected results successfully. A questionnaire was conducted to give feedback on the use of the developed tool for enhancing positive experience of the developed tool. It is anticipated that the proposed tool has the potential to aid urban planners in decision-making and develop more practical vegetation planting plans compared with the conventional Two-Dimensional (2D) plans, and give the city occupants the chance to take part in shaping their city by merely selecting from predefined parameters in a user interface to generate their neighborhood pathway vegetation plans. Moreover, this approach can be extended to be embedded in an interactive map where city occupants can shape their neighborhood greenery and give feedback to urban planners for decision-making.

TI  - Host relatedness and landscape connectivity shape pathogen spread in the puma, a large secretive carnivore
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban expansion can fundamentally alter wildlife movement and gene flow, but how urbanization alters pathogen spread is poorly understood. Here, we combine high resolution host and viral genomic data with landscape variables to examine the context of viral spread in puma (Puma concolor) from two contrasting regions: one bounded by the wildland urban interface (WUI) and one unbounded with minimal anthropogenic development (UB). We found landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) spread in the WUI, but not in the unbounded region. The most important predictors of viral spread also differed; host spatial proximity, host relatedness, and mountain ranges played a role in FIV spread in the WUI, whereas roads might have facilitated viral spread in the unbounded region. Our research demonstrates how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread, providing a more nuanced understanding of host-pathogen relationships to inform disease ecology in free-ranging species. Nick Fountain-Jones et al. use genomic and spatial data to examine how urbanization affects the spread of the pathogen feline immunodeficiency virus in pumas from areas of varying anthropogenic development. Their results show that landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation in virus spread in a region bounded by urban development but did not in a more wild landscape, demonstrating how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread.

TI  - Urban open spaces from a dispersal perspective: lessons from an individual-based model approach to assess the effects of landscape patterns on the viability of wildlife populations
PY  - 2021
AB  - Green areas drawn on a city plan represent open spaces that have different meanings for humans and wildlife. Diverse kinds of green may influence species viability in urban environments. It is necessary to understand what those areas mean for wildlife populations and how land-use changes affect habitats and movements for making scientifically defensible planning and design decisions. My objective was to demonstrate how open space and urban development patterns affect the viability of wildlife populations in urbanizing landscapes from a movements perspective. Eight scenarios for 2060 for an urbanizing area near Portland, Oregon combined four open space (none, corridors, parks, and network) with two urban development patterns (compact and dispersed). Dispersal model HexSim simulated three target species - Red-legged frog (Rana aurora aurora), Western meadowlark (Sturnella neclecta) and Douglas squirrel (Tamasciurus douglasii) - movements on those scenarios to compare and contrast sustained populations to the ca. 2010 baseline landscape. Network scenarios presented the largest number of frog breeders. Greenway scenarios showed the largest populations of squirrels. Park and network scenarios sustained viable populations of meadowlarks, but park scenarios performed best. Compact development scenarios performed best for most indicators, while dispersed development scenarios performed better for meadowlarks. Network scenarios performed best when considering the collective of species. Networks presented more diverse habitats, sustaining higher diversity of species. For plans to sustain more species, more comprehensive and diverse habitats must be promoted, otherwise trade-offs should be expected - like the extinction of meadowlarks in greenway scenarios.

TI  - Genetic distinction between contiguous urban and rural multimammate mice in Tanzania despite gene flow
PY  - 2016
AB  - Special conditions are required for genetic differentiation to arise at a local geographical scale in the face of gene flow. The Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, is the most widely distributed and abundant rodent in sub-Saharan Africa. A notorious agricultural pest and a natural host for many zoonotic diseases, it can live in close proximity to humans and appears to compete with other rodents for the synanthropic niche. We surveyed its population genetic structure across a 180-km transect in central Tanzania along which the landscape varied between agricultural land in a rural setting and natural woody vegetation, rivers, roads and a city (Morogoro). We sampled M. natalensis across 10 localities and genotyped 15 microsatellite loci from 515 individuals. Hierarchical STRUCTURE analyses show a K-invariant pattern distinguishing Morogoro suburbs (located in the centre of the transect) from nine surrounding rural localities. Landscape connectivity analyses in Circuitscape and comparison of rainfall patterns suggest that neither geographical isolation nor natural breeding asynchrony could explain the genetic differentiation of the urban population. Using the isolation-with-migration model implemented in IMa2, we inferred that a split between suburban and rural populations would have occurred recently (<150 years ago) with higher urban effective population density consistent with an urban source to rural sink of effective migration. The observed genetic differentiation of urban multimammate mice is striking given the uninterrupted distribution of the animal throughout the landscape and the high estimates of effective migration (2N(e)M = 3.0 and 29.7), suggesting a strong selection gradient across the urban boundary.

TI  - Acoustic diversity of forested landscapes: Relationships to habitat structure and anthropogenic pressure
PY  - 2022
AB  - Understanding how human-dominated landscapes affect biodiversity and ecosystems is essential for effective conservation planning. This work aims to understand the relationship between the acoustic diversity of forested landscapes, and descriptors of habitat structure, composition, and anthropogenic pressure, as well as to identify the characteristic scale at which acoustic community diversity relates to those metrics in central Massachusetts. Ten passive acoustic recorders were placed within forest areas in central Massachusetts, during the breeding season. Mono audio recordings were collected during the dawn chorus. The relationship between acoustic indices (AI), and core habitat quality, connectivity, vegetation productivity, percent tree cover, human edge, artificial illumination, and traffic noise were assessed. Significant relationships were found between AI and variables related to habitat structure and human pressure. Sounds related to biota (biophony) and acoustic complexity were positively correlated with core habitat quality, connectivity, and vegetation while negatively correlated with human pressure variables, including nighttime lights, traffic noise, and human edge. AI can therefore act as successful indicators of habitat quality in highly modified landscapes The highest correlations were found at buffers between 1.5 and 3 Km. This response of AI to the broad spatial context and not to the local site characteristics indicate that they can act as robust landscapescale indicators. The large characteristic scale indicates that urban planning should consider potential impacts acting at scales beyond site planning. Moreover, conservation planning can benefit from managing the context matrix to support biodiversity, particularly traffic noise and artificial illumination reduction initiatives.

TI  - Ecological traits and landscape characteristics predicting bird sensitivity to urbanization in city parks
PY  - 2022
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation caused by urbanization often have negative impacts on wildlife in cities. There are considerable studies investigating the relationship between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. However, so far, very few studies have examined the influence of species traits combined with landscape factors on vulnerability to urbanization in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we investigated how species traits and park characteristics influenced bird sensitivity to urbanization in the highly urbanized city of Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks. For each bird species, we collected data on nine life-history and ecological traits that are commonly assumed to influence urbanization vulnerability. For each park, we selected six landscape variables that are commonly considered to influence bird response to urbanization. After phylogenetic correction, the nine species traits were used separately and in combination to evaluate their associations with species abundance, an indicator of urbanization vulnerability. We then used the RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to test relationships between species traits and environmental variables. We found that the 75 species analyzed demonstrated considerable variation in vulnerability to urbanization. Using PGLS analyses and model averaging, we found that habitat specificity was the single best ecological predictor of urbanization vulnerability in birds in Nanjing city parks. The RLQ analysis showed that body size and habitat specificity were correlated with distance to city center and connectivity of the parks, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit species with smaller body mass and lower habitat specificity in urbanized landscape. Therefore, conservation efforts giving priority to species with high habitat specificity and to parks with high connectivity and far away from the city center may prove effective for the preservation of bird diversity in our highly urbanized system. Meanwhile, preventing future habitat loss and destruction in existing city parks may also effectively conserve these vulnerable species.

TI  - Spatiotemporal assessment and trade-offs of multiple ecosystem services based on land use changes in Zengcheng, China
PY  - 2017
AB  - Driven by rapid urbanization, land use change has become a significant factor influencing ecosystem services (ESs). To support the decision-making process of city planners and policy makers, assessing the spatiotemporal changes associated with multiple ESs is vital. In this study, we developed a general structure to assess the changes of multiple ESs in Zengcheng, China. A new index also was developed to measure the comprehensive ecosystem service (CES). Trade-offs of various ESs were analyzed by using correlation analysis. We then designed four alternate scenarios to explore the optimal land use strategies to increase the CES value and minimize trade-offs among various ESs. Results demonstrated that rapid expansion of built-up land and traffic land resulted in a decrease of CES in Zengcheng from 2003 to 2013. Although the water supply, water purification, and vegetable and fruit production services increased, the climate regulation, soil conservation, biodiversity protection, recreation opportunity and grain production services decreased during the ten-year period. Government should implement land use policies and ecological engineering measures to improve soil conservation in the northern region; recreation opportunity in the central region; and carbon storage, water purification, biodiversity protection and recreation opportunity in the southern region. Among all alternative scenarios, woodland buffer and soil conservation scenarios exhibit the highest CES values, indicating that policies such as the \"Ecological corridor construction\" project and the \"Grain for Green\" project should be implemented. However, a caveat is that these policies improve the ESs at the expense of food production due to significant trade-off relationships. To minimize the trade-offs, a more sustainable intensification of agriculture should be adopted to increase food production without decreasing other ESs or occupying additional land. The land use strategies and ecological engineering measures in this study can provide a reliable reference for sustainable development of other urbanized regions in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Abundance and diversity of pollinators on green roofs are affected by environmental factors
PY  - 2019
AB  - Bees provide a variety of ecological services for urban ecosystems, while green roofs can also be of high value to bees through providing habitats and foraging sites. In this study, four hypotheses about impacts on abundance and diversity of pollinators were proposed from the roof and the surrounding environment. The evidences revealed that the height of the building affected the diversity of some bee species; increasing proportions of surrounding green space helped to increase abundance of bees and wasps; the colonies of bees were significantly affected by habitat connectivity, a frequent movement of bees and other mobile insects between roofs and ground guaranteed pollination of plants; plentiful plants combination was better than a single species in roof ecosystem services, and native forbs were beneficial for pollinations and foraging of pollinators; using fine substrate on green roofs may have a greater ecological value than common soil.

TI  - Functional connectivity of the white-footed mouse in Southern Quebec, Canada
PY  - 2017
AB  - Purpose The white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is an important reservoir host for the pathogen responsible for Lyme disease in eastern North-America. Indigenous cases of Lyme disease in southern Quebec have increased from two cases in 2004 to 160 cases in 2015. Because of the strong relationship between the white-footed mouse occurrence and the Lyme disease pathogen prevalence, we can estimate the risk of Lyme disease by finding areas of high contact between mice. In this study, we inferred the movement patterns and contact rate of the white-footed mouse in southern Quebec. Methods We used pattern-orientated modelling to estimate a directional measure of functional connectivity from an Individual-Based Model. We replicated the spatial pattern observed in previously published molecular analysis of a white-footed mouse population. Results A perceptual range of 80 m best explained the genetic structure of the white-footed mouse in the region. The paths of individuals generally overlapped the edges of urban centers and the boundary of linear obstacles such as highways and water bodies. We show that the contact probability of mice was a good predictor of the number of mice caught in the field. Conclusions Our findings highlight the usefulness of individual-based models to potentially predict high contact areas and disease hotspots across landscapes.

TI  - Bee Guilds' Responses to Urbanization in Neotropics: A Case Study
PY  - 2021
AB  - The consequent deforestation of urban sprawl is one of the causes of the decline of wild bee communities. In this context, urban green areas (UGA) may play an important role and constitute refuge areas for bees. This study analyzed the influence of UGA conditions and their surroundings in bee guilds' responses in a medium-sized Brazilian city (Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ). The bees were sampled for 12 months (2017-2018) in 12 UGAs, and bee abundance and species richness were evaluated in guilds considering: nesting behavior, nesting site, and trophic specialization. We used as explanatory variables conditions of UGAs-the number of trees (NT), diameter at breast height (DBH), flower cover (FC), plant richness (PR), percentage of paving (PV)-and of their surroundings-paving (SPV) and the number of buildings (NB). Results showed 80% of eusocial bees, 82% nest in cavities, and 99% were generalists. FC, DBH, and NB mainly explained the responses of different guilds in study areas from all explanatory variables. Thus, this study confirms different responses associated with bee guilds' attributes. In order to conserve bee diversity, city planning must include more green areas with large flower covers and avoid long corridors of high buildings that can impact bee dispersion.

TI  - Loss of coastal ecosystem spatial connectivity and services by urbanization: Natural-to-urban integration for bay management
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization has negative consequences for the integrity of ecosystems and services they provide, by reducing their extent and quality in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Few studies have explored how urban infrastructure expansion affects the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems by provoking their fragmentation and loss. Here we explore changes in the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems due to urbanization, analyzing ecosystem extent and concatenation with urban infrastructures (shared perimeter) in four bays of the Coquimbo region of northern Chile (from 29 degrees S to 32 degrees S) as model systems. Increase in natural-to-urban concatenation patterns were observed in most urbanized bays; sandy beaches and wetlands were the habitats most connected with urban infrastructures like roads and coastal artificial defenses. Availability of ecosystem services is compromised by progressive loss of natural connectivity and poor governance structure, which seems to confer high vulnerability to urbanized bays with future urban expansion. Complementary actions are proposed to reduce the vulnerability of coastal urban systems, considering 1) investment in nature-based infrastructures for coastal defenses, 2) restoration-rehabilitation of natural (remnant) urban ecosystems and eco-engineering of current artificial infrastructures, focusing on reestablishment of biodiversity patterns and habitat connectivity, and 3) limitation of coastal town and village expansion. Management strategies can improve coastal adaptation to natural hazards, stabilizing changes in the natural-urban concatenation mosaic present in coastal urban systems like bays.

TI  - A multi-criterion approach for prioritizing areas in urban ecosystems for active restoration following invasive plant control
PY  - 2018
AB  - Resources for biodiversity conservation and invasive plant management are limited, and restoring invaded vegetation is labour-intensive and expensive. Managers must prioritize their actions to achieve their goals efficiently and effectively. They must distinguish between areas that require only the removal of invasive alien plants (\"passive restoration\"D) from those that require additional restoration measures (\"active restoration\"). This study used a multi-criterion approach (Analytical Hierarchical Process) to develop a framework for identifying areas that require active restoration, and then to prioritize these areas for active restoration. The South African city of Cape Town is used as a test case to illustrate the utility of the framework. Framework criteria selected in determining the need for active restoration included: dominant alien species invading the area, density of invasion, duration of invasion, indigenous vegetation cover, adjacent land use, level of disturbance, size of the area, aspect, soil texture, soil depth and erodibility, slope and vegetation type. In deciding which areas to prioritize for active restoration, factors such as vegetation conservation status, selection in a regional conservation plan and connectivity function were assessed. Importance in ecosystem functioning (by providing a diversity of habitats and soil conservation) and the delivery of ecosystem service benefits were also considered. The resulting framework provides an objective tool for prioritizing sites for active restoration.

TI  - Butterfly communities of urban forest fragments in Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil: Structure, instability, environmental correlates, and conservation
PY  - 2002
AB  - A comparative study of butterfly communities in 15 urban/suburban remnants of tropical semideciduous forest in Campinas (Sao Paulo state, SE Brazil; 24 degrees S, 47 degrees W), with areas from 1.0 to 252 ha and widely varying histories and environments, shows that the most significant factors, besides area and sampling time, distinguishing the sites and influencing their diversity (80-702 species) and composition are connectivity, permanent water, vegetation, flowers, and human impact (negative, including pollution). The diversified Nymphalidae butterflies (38-213 species) and especially two fermented-bait-attracted groups (Satyrinae, 2-30 species, and Biblidini, 9-44 species), are among the more useful indicators of the quality and diversity of the environments in these fragments. Effective conservation of butterfly communities in tropical cities may be achieved by maintenance of arboreal green corridors along streets and watercourses between moderately large (>10 ha) humid areas, not near to the most built-up or polluted city centre(s), and the inclusion within these areas of ponds or streams, diversified native forest, and open vegetation including abundant nectar-rich flowers.

TI  - Selection of important ecological source patches base on Green Infrastructure theory: A case study of Wuhan city
PY  - 2018
AB  - Selecting urban ecological patches is of great significance for constructing urban green infrastructure network, protecting urban biodiversity and ecological environment. With the support of GIS technology, a criterion for selecting sources of patches was developed according to existing planning Then ecological source patches of terrestrial organism, aquatic and amphibious organism were selected in Wuhan city. To increase the connectivity of the ecological patches and achieve greater ecological protection benefits, the green infrastructure networks in Wuhan city were constructed with the minimum path analysis method. Finally, the characteristics of ecological source patches were analyzed with landscape metrics, and ecological protection importance degree of ecological source patches were evaluated comprehensively. The results showed that there were 23 important ecological source patches in Wuhan city, among which Sushan Temple Forest Patch, Lu Lake and Shangshe Lake Wetland Patch were the most important in all kinds of patches for ecological protection. This study can provide a scientific basis for the preservation of urban ecological space, the delineation of natural conservation areas and the protection of biological diversity.

TI  - Landscape Context Influences the Abundance and Richness of Native Lady Beetles Occupying Urban Vacant Land
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban insect communities are structured by hierarchical filters including regional processes, human facilitation, and species interactions. We sought to inform future urban conservation endeavors by identifying how landscape composition and configuration as well as the management of vacant lot greenspaces affect native lady beetle (Coccinellidae) community structure within the city of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. We found no effect of habitat treatment on native lady beetle abundance when comparing vacant lots seeded with native wildflowers and those with naturally occurring weedy vegetation mown monthly or annually. Nonetheless, establishing conservation plantings that vary in plant height, biomass, and bloom abundance could aid in supporting a greater richness of coccinellid species, as these variables had differential effects on the abundance of fungivorous and aphidophagous feeding guilds. Further, we found that vacant lots embedded within landscapes with increased impervious surface and a high degree of greenspace isolation contained fewer aphidophagous native and exotic lady beetles. Our findings suggest that landscape context is a critical consideration when aiming to utilize vacant land as conservation habitat for coccinellids. Given their large holdings of vacant land, shrinking cities offer a unique opportunity to incorporate landscape-scale planning into future sustainable development initiatives. For instance, with over 27,000 vacant lots, the city of Cleveland could aid lady beetle conservation by electing to maintain vacant lots that promote greenspace connectivity while targeting isolated lots within intact neighborhoods for new residential development.

TI  - Dispersal-related traits of the snail Cornu aspersum along an urbanisation gradient: maintenance of mobility across life stages despite high costs
PY  - 2016
AB  - The extreme fragmentation of natural habitats due to urbanisation can influence the evolution of dispersal strategies in species persisting in cities. The brown garden snail Cornu aspersum is an anthropophilic species, capable of maintaining its populations in highly fragmented habitats despite a high cost of movement. In this species, we studied the variation of dispersal-related behaviours and traits along an urbanisation gradient characterised at two biologically relevant spatial scales (10 and 50 m), in order to identify the effects of habitat fragmentation on movement. The olfactory perceptual range was low, between 1 and 2.5 m, meaning that snails should perceive a large range of landscapes as fragmented. In line with previous results, subadults were more prone to explore than adults in the least urbanised populations. The boundary-crossing behaviour of subadults was not affected by urbanisation, while exploration propensity of adult snails increased with urbanisation at the 50 m (long-distance dispersal) scale, to reach subadult levels in more urban sites. Foot mass (a correlate of movement speed) and perceptual range were not affected by urbanisation. These results are interpreted in relation to the different levels of competition snails are likely to experience in different environments, the high risk of local extinction in urban fragmented landscapes, and the available opportunities for reproduction. They indicate that benefits of dispersal still need to be considered even in situations where movement costs are extremely important. The maintenance of relatively high mobility and its extension to the adult stage in response to anthropogenic changes may thus play a major role in the success of Cornu aspersum in urban habitats.

TI  - The Function of A Set-Aside Railway Bridge in Connecting Urban Habitats for Animals: A Case Study
PY  - 2020
AB  - As elements of green infrastructure, railway embankments are important corridors in urban environments connecting otherwise isolated habitat fragments. They are interrupted when railways cross major roads. It is not known whether dispersing animals use railway bridges to cross roads. We examined the function of a set-aside iron-steel railway bridge crossing a 12 m wide road with high traffic density in Basel (Switzerland) for dispersing animals. We installed drift fences with traps on a single-track, 32 m long and 6 m wide railway bridge with a simple gravel bed, and collected animals daily for 9 months. We captured more than 1200 animals crossing the bridge: small mammals, reptiles and amphibians as well as numerous invertebrates including snails, woodlice, spiders, harvestmen, millipedes, carabids, rove beetles and ants. For some animals it is likely that the gravel bed, at least temporarily, serves as a habitat. Many animals, however, were apparently dispersing, using the bridge to cross the busy road. We found season- and daytime -dependent differences in the frequency the bridge was used. Our findings indicate an important function of a set-aside railway bridges for connecting urban habitats. As most animal dispersal was recorded during the night, railway bridges with no (or little) traffic during the night may also contribute to animal dispersal. As important elements of green infrastructure, set-aside railway bridges should be considered in future urban planning.

TI  - Agroforestry Contributions to Urban River Rehabilitation
PY  - 2022
AB  - The context of urban rivers is one of pollution of their courses, the degradation of riparian habitats, the loss of biodiversity, and the marginalization of the human populations that live next to them. Due to urban growth, the hydrological dynamics in entire basins and the hydromorphology of rivers are changing. This situation increases flooding, decreases the availability of water for human use, and disconnects the rivers from the dynamics of the city. Agroforestry is the integration of cultural, wild, and domesticated diversity with use, conservation, and restoration objectives. These practices in cities can contribute to addressing the problems mentioned. We analyze agroforestry practices and the socio-ecological contributions to urban river rehabilitation. We review 37 experiences worldwide. Agroforestry practices included in the review are trees and hedgerows; wetland agroforestry; aquatic, botanical, edible, educational, and rain gardens; bioswales; green parking lots; food forestry; vegetation in alleys and streets; vertical terrace walls, among others. Agroforestry contributes to efforts to solve urban river problems, improve water quality and access, restore riparian habitats, enhance river hydromorphology, support local economies, and create a river culture. We emphasize promoting multi-relational people-river interactions based on theoretical and practical frameworks that integrate diverse disciplines, perspectives, and experiences.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of landscape pattern and structure in the Greater Bay Area, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - Landscape fragmentation and structural changes are associated with spatial ecological and social processes. Landscape fragmentation modeling and land use distribution analysis provide a framework within which landscape pattern and structure can be studied and quantified. The Greater Bay Area (GBA) is one of the fastest growing urban agglomeration in China and due to the speedy socioeconomic development and urban expansion, the landscape became more diverse, fragmented, and complex in land use, structure, and shape. This study analyses the spatiotemporal variations in landscape pattern and structure in the Greater Bay Area based on the 40 years' time-series remote sensing data (19802020), fragmentation modeling, and structure change analysis. We used the fragmentation analysis at category and patch level and analyzed the fragmentation over forest, cropland, and grassland. We further employed the economic model of spatial Lorenz Curve and Gini Index for estimating the distribution of land use land cover (LULC) categories and structure changes. The results indicated that the landscape pattern indices of Greater Bay Area as whole, and its eleven cities had an obvious variations and diversity during 1980 to 2020. However, the diffusion and coalescence processes in each city follow distinct patterns. Due to the anthropogenic modifications, the landscape pattern and structural complexity increased gradually during the study period.

TI  - Recovering the landscape history behind a Mediterranean edge environment (The Congost Valley, Catalonia, 1854-2005): The importance of agroforestry systems in biological conservation
PY  - 2014
AB  - The three main landscape dynamics now underway in Europe urban sprawl, agricultural intensification and rural abandonment are observed in a Catalan study area located in an edge environment between a metropolitan fringe and two natural protected sites. In this context, ecological connectivity becomes a key to host biodiversity. By applying to the available land cover maps several landscape metrics and modelling, we perform a historical landscape analysis of the changes experienced in land-use patterns and ecological processes. The results show up the relevant connectivity role played by the traditional agro-forest mosaics that linked both sides of the edge, providing a heterogeneous but continuous land matrix able to maintain high species richness. However these agro-forest mosaics are currently disappearing due to the ongoing urban sprawl and agricultural intensification in the plain, and reforestation leading to rural abandonment in the mountains. The current location of Mediterranean orchids in the study area is used to demonstrate that the results obtained through the ecological landscape assessment are not an analytical construct, but reflect the actual loss of meadows and open grazing spaces formerly created in woodland areas by a traditional multiple-use of forest and pastures now abandoned. The results show up that recovering the historical dynamics behind the current land-use patterns is a necessity for the emerging approaches to integrated biological conservation seeking a more complex and multidimensional management of sustainable cultural landscapes.

TI  - Arthropod diversity and ecological processes on green roofs in a semi-rural area of Argentina: Similarity to neighbor ground habitats and landscape effects
PY  - 2020
AB  - Green roofs could mitigate the negative effects of urbanization by providing habitats for arthropods. However, more studies are necessary to understand if these new ecosystems can harbor similar numbers of species and levels of ecological processes than habitats at the ground-level. In 15 houses of 1-2 floors with extensive green roofs from a semi-rural area in Cordoba (central Argentina), we analyzed the species richness and abundance of arthropods on green roofs and their neighboring ground-level habitats and evaluated the influence of landscape composition (proportion of buildings, grasslands, and streets). We focus on feeding groups (herbivores, predators, omnivores, detritivores, parasitoids, and pollinators) and two ecological processes (herbivory and predation). Moreover, we tested two factors that may drive the communities on ground-level habitats and green roofs: habitat area and plant species richness. Species richness and abundance of arthropods (total and by feeding groups), and predation rates were significantly higher in ground-level habitats than on green roofs. Nevertheless, arthropod diversity on living roofs was striking, with almost 400 species from different feeding groups. Street cover in the landscape negatively affected total richness and several feeding groups. On ground-level habitats, herbivory increased with street cover and predation with grassland cover. The main factor driving arthropods in both green roofs and ground-level habitats was habitat area, whereas plant richness had a positive effect only in predators, detritivores, and omnivores. Our results reinforce the role of green roofs as habitat for arthropod species in semi-rural areas of Latin-American countries, where the evidence was so far lacking.

TI  - Classification of urban forest fragments based on landscape metrics
PY  - 2019
AB  - The urbanization in Campinas, Sao Paulo state, and the surrounding region had occurred in a fast and intensive way, causing big changes in the landscape and resulting in an expressive devastation of the forest areas and its natural vegetation cover. This circumstance had given rise to the forest fragmentation process. Therefore, mapping these fragments and evaluating them according to some environmental indicators is very important because it allows to evaluate the basin conditions and to identify the priority areas for the implementation of recovery and management actions. Thus, this work presents a classification of the forest fragments identified in 'Ribeirao Anhumas' watershed, Campinas, SP state, using as indicators the following landscape metrics: size, nuclear area and circularity index. Therefore, a Group Analysis was carried out using the statistical software XSTAT, as a way to identify the similarities between the fragments, considering the aforementioned indicators, and grouping them into classes. A correlation between them has also been developed in order to identify possible relationships of interdependence. It was found that this river basin is highly urbanized, where there are fewer fragments with smaller sizes and in most cases isolated. Although the fragments were generally classified as good, there is a considerable aggravating factor for the environmental quality of these fragments: the nuclear area index was quite low, about 25%, this implies that much of the area covered by fragments is subject to edge effects. Furthermore, through the cluster analyses the fragments had been grouped into three classes, where the size had been one of the most determinant factor. It was also identified the sub-basin of the low course as the less urbanized region, with larger fragments and greater potential for the implementation of management and recovery actions on the forest fragments, such as ecological corridors.

TI  - Small-Scale Habitat Conditions Are More Important Than Site Context for Influencing Pollinator Visitation
PY  - 2021
AB  - The ability of insects to persist in urban greenspace depends on their ability to usefully interact with available plant resources. Greenspace design influences plant-insect interactions by: (1) limiting the plant-species pool available for interaction through plant choice, (2) limiting the insects that are available for interaction through site-occupancy dynamics, and (3) mediating insect preferences based on the context of particular plant-insect interactions through structural barriers, microclimatic changes or competition. We designed an experiment to measure the effect of greenspace design attributes on site occupancy and insect preferences while keeping plant availability constant. Using a set of five functionally distinct flowering plant species (\"phytometres\"), we used occupancy-detection modelling to test factors affecting probability of visitation for eight groups of pollinating insects (ants, beetles, butterflies, bumblebees, honeybees, small bees, and hoverflies amend other flies) across 102 urban squares in Munich, Germany. We found that the probability of detecting an interaction was low for most functional groups, and situational factors, such as weather or competition from co-occurring flowers, were the primary drivers of visitation. Increasing the proportion of unsealed surfaces and quantity or diversity of flowers on the site had a positive influence on the probability of interaction, and, to a lesser extent, on probability of occupancy. Landscape connectivity and site area were important for only a few groups. Together, our results suggest that small-scale habitat conditions are more important than site context for influencing pollinator visitation. Designers can encourage interaction through contiguous provision of floral resources and unsealed surfaces while limiting internal barriers.

TI  - BIODIVERSITY AND URBAN DESIGN: SEEKING AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION
PY  - 2009
AB  - Life on earth is remarkably diverse. Plants, animals, and microorganisms, in response to local and regional environmental conditions have created distinct adaptations that collectively form the interconnected \"web of life.\" This biological diversity and its associated ecological processes represent the planets \"natural capital\" that underpins human activities, providing us with the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the materials that clothe and shelter us, countless medical remedies, and the cathartic psychological relief green spaces provide for us. This biological diversity also helps shape our \"sense of place.\" There is a growing awareness that the health of the planets biological diversity will to a large degree, determine our own destiny. There is also a growing sense of urgency that biodiversity requires substantially more protection than has occurred to date (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). The Convention on Biological Diversity (1992), adopted by over 150 countries, provided a strategy for addressing the decline in biodiversity around the world. The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development identified the centrality of biodiversity and the importance of setting conservation targets. And the IUCNs Countdown 2010 program was established to help monitor progress toward stemming biodiversity loss. In terms of urban biodiversity the Curitiba Declaration on Cities and Biodiversity (2007) affirmed the importance of biodiversity within cities, signalling the need \"to integrate biodiversity concerns into urban planning and development, with a view to improving the lives of urban residents...\" Yet, while enhancing biodiversity within cities is a laudable goal, it is a daunting challenge. The scale and pace of urban growth is responsible for the radical transformation of the spatial configuration and ecological processes of local and regional landscapes around the world (Alberti 2005, Dale et al. 2000, McDonnell et al. 1997 Dramstad et al. 1996, McDonnel and Pickett 1990). Natural areas are fragmented. Indigenous fauna are marginalised and extirpated. Hydrologic cycles are irrevocably altered while impervious surfaces increase. Productive soils, centuries in the making, are contaminated compacted, and/or removed. One key challenge in addressing urban biodiversity is overcoming the misunderstanding that biodiversity conservation is an optional field of action, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Few local governments have dedicated resources to establishing planning frameworks and implementation strategies to explicitly address biodiversity. This complacency can he attributed, in part, to the complexity and abstraction as to what constitutes biodiversity. Consequently urban planners, elected officials, the development community, and the public continue to focus on land use, zoning, transportation, and infrastructure in isolation of their ecological consequences. Fortunately in North America some local governments have begun to engage the complexities of biodiversity conservation by developing regionally integrated spatial frameworks based in large part on Landscape Ecology's patch-corridor-matrix principles (Forman 1995). Simultaneously, proactive site planning and design practices at the neighbourhood and site scale are including biodiversity conservation as an essential program objective. Collectively these initiatives begin to illustrate bow urban design can conserve and enhance biodiversity across a region.

TI  - Functional and taxonomic perspectives for understanding the underlying mechanisms of native and alien plant distributions
PY  - 2018
AB  - Land-use changes often facilitate alien species invasion, impacting on biodiversity and ecosystem processes at the regional scale. Transport infrastructure is a potential corridor for biological invasion, but processes underlying invasion of alien species from human settlements along transport networks are uncertain. We surveyed alien and native plant species and their functional traits in roadside vegetation in Shiretoko National Park, Japan. The site is unique because there is a single invasion source (i.e., town). Vegetation, environmental and spatial factors were measured in 362 quadrats on two transects established along roads. Mean species richness within each quadrat (taxonomic alpha-diversity) was higher for alien assemblages, whereas mean functional richness (functional alpha-diversity) was higher for native assemblages. Alien species shared similar traits as generalists, which show lower functional diversity than specialists. Functional alpha-diversity of alien assemblages decreased with increasing distance from the source town, and the nestedness-resultant component of functional beta-diversity of alien assemblages accounted for a relatively high proportion of their total functional beta-diversity. Alien species with high dispersal ability were widely distributed, whereas other alien species were still limited to areas adjacent to the human settlement. Alien species showed a greater probability of having seed floss, lower percentage of perennial species, and lower seed dry mass than native species. Thus, alien species showed superior dispersal and competitive abilities compared with native species, and exclusion of all alien species is likely impractical. Consideration of functional traits may aid selection of alien species of particular concern for implementation of control and extermination measures.

TI  - Importance of local habitat conditions and past and present habitat connectivity for the species richness of grassland plants and butterflies in power line clearings
PY  - 2018
AB  - Agricultural intensification has caused drastic declines in the area and species richness of semi-natural grasslands across Europe. Novel habitats, such as power line clearings, provide alternative habitats and niches for grassland species, and might therefore mitigate these declines. However, it is not fully understood which environmental factors determine the occurrence of grassland species in the clearings. Identifying the most important drivers for grassland species occurrence would help understand the value of the clearings for grassland conservation and target enhanced management into clearings with most potential as grassland habitat. We studied the effects of local environmental conditions, and past and present connectivity to semi-natural grasslands, on the species richness of grassland plants and butterflies in 43 power line clearings in Finland. The results of generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning showed that increasing time since clear-cut and amount of clearing residue decreased the species richness of both species groups, while the cover of mesic habitats increased it. However, the two species groups showed also divergent responses. Present-day local environmental conditions appeared to be the sole driver of grassland butterfly species richness, whereas the richness of grassland plants was related both to current conditions and historical connectivity to grasslands in 1870-1880s. This suggests the presence of an extinction debt in the studied grassland plant communities, emphasizing the need for enhanced management to increase suitable grassland habitat in the clearings. This would diminish the potential future losses of grassland plant species in the clearings and create valuable habitat for grassland butterflies as well.

TI  - Consequences of low mobility in spatially and temporally heterogeneous ecosystems
PY  - 2004
AB  - 1. Spatially explicit landscape models have revealed the importance of spatial arrangement of habitat patches in the behaviour of mobile organisms. Such models fail to account for creation and destruction of habitat, which may interrupt the movement of slowly migrating species such as forest herbs. 2. To explore the interaction of habitat turnover and population migration, we present a dynamic landscape model inhabited by a dispersing species. The landscape is represented as a square lattice in which individual cells may be either habitat or non-habitat, and a hypothetical species may spread among habitat cells. Rate of species spread, habitat frequency and habitat clearance and regeneration are allowed to vary. 3. In static landscapes, the fraction of the landscape occupied by the species is limited by connectivity among habitat patches and rate of population migration. Slow species often cannot reach all available habitat despite the presence of continuous paths to it. 4. In dynamic landscapes, slow-moving species show reduced map-scale frequency and high risk of extinction due to the cumulative effects of habitat patch destruction and the failure to colonize newly created habitat. Such species decline cannot be predicted based on static descriptions of habitat connectivity or migration rate. 5. Fast-moving species may be reduced in dynamic landscapes by the cumulative effect of numerous local isolation events. Fast-moving species may also experience a modest range expansion in low-connectivity landscapes due to the cumulative effects of short-lived patch adjacency. 6. These results suggest a novel mechanism that could account for species impoverishment in fragmented landscapes. They emphasize the importance of maintaining habitat connectivity on a time-scale that accommodates slow-migrating species such as forest herbs.

TI  - Using bird-habitat relationships to inform urban planning
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urbanisation is a rapidly growing phenomenon that is affecting global biodiversity, but the integration of conservation goals into urban planning can minimise ecological damage. Conservation planning for birds can be informed by knowledge of species-habitat relationships, but opportunities for studying these relationships before urbanisation occurs are rare. Our study took place in the Molonglo Valley, southeastern Australia, where approximately 30% of the area will be developed for new human settlement over the next 30 years. We surveyed 80 sites for birds and used multiple regression to explore the role that land use, vegetation cover and structure play on total species richness, woodland species richness and prevalence (proportion of total species), and also on the presence of 10 woodland species. We found that total species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodland. Woodland species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodlands, and when leaf litter was present. Woodland species prevalence was higher in river corridors and when leaf litter and eucalypt regeneration were present. Individual woodland species showed a range of responses to five main structural and compositional categories: (1) land use, (2) tree cover and composition, (3) eucalypt regeneration, (4) shrub cover, and (5) ground cover attributes. We use these data on bird-habitat relationships to develop five recommendations on: (1) eucalypt woodland. (2) high quality riparian areas, (3) scattered trees, (4) eucalypt regeneration, and (5) structurally complex habitats, to aid policy makers, planners and developers to integrate conservation for woodland birds into their urban planning.

TI  - Pollen dispersal in an insect-pollinated wet meadow herb along an urban river
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urban sprawl has led over wide areas to alteration and fragmentation of so many ecosystem types that it becomes essential to consider biodiversity conservation in urban planning. As the urbanisation is usually irreversible, the urban context has to be taken into account when defining appropriate management measures to sustain viable populations. Connectivity through pollen flow appears to be a key-factor for the long-term persistence of populations of insect-pollinated plant species. We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue in Lychnis flos-cuculi, an insect-pollinated wetland herb, along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with particles mainly deposited on neighbouring individuals and populations. The mean distance of dye transfer was 133.6 m, with a maximal distance of 523.7 m. Dye deposition was positively related to the number of potential recipient plants when distance to dye source was held constant. This may be associated with a higher flowering plant density across the flying distance that increases attractiveness and visitation rate of pollinators, and/or with secondary dye transfer. When connected, small and large populations only differed in response to the number of potential recipients. The small isolated population received little immigrant pollen flow, but remained a dye donor. Our study demonstrates that small populations of L. flos-cucli along an urban river may still exchange pollen thanks to pollinator movements, and might therefore be regarded in management planning as potential connecting components between populations.

TI  - Establishing the ecological planning principles from empirical studies in agricultural environments of Taiwan
PY  - 2020
AB  - Studies have suggested that the heterogeneity and arrangement of landscape structures are influential to the faunal biodiversity of environments. How does the landscape structure in agricultural landscape arrangements improve the functions of the natural ecosystem? Previous research has uncovered a great amount of information on the relationships between landscape structure and wildlife; however, for landscape designers and planners, such information is site-specific and has limited utilization. Hence, this study aimed to organize and categorize the relationships between environments and biodiversity and transfer this information into design principles in agricultural landscapes. This study attempted to integrate aspects of previous research into a systematic framework. The current study searched literature between 2007 and 2016 from the following journals: Landscape Ecology, Landscape and Urban Planning, and Journal of Applied Ecology. In all, this study collected 58 empirical studies of agricultural environments similar to that of Taiwan and revealed the valuable relationship between wildlife and agricultural environments. The outcomes reviewed from the literature were categorized by semi-natural elements and divided into six sub-categories: forests, hedgerows, grasslands, flowers, water, and heterogeneity of the natural landscape. The landscape attributes that were frequently discussed included patch number, patch area, connectivity, species richness, edge area, distance from semi-natural elements, and complexity. The landscape attributes formed by these elements were organized into a table as a checklist for designers' convenience. The checklist will help landscape planners and designers to create agricultural landscapes with integral ecosystems.

TI  - Species richness of urban and rural fish assemblages in the Grijalva Basin floodplain, southern Gulf of Mexico
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban sprawl poses a major threat to aquatic biodiversity. The species richness in fish assemblages of fifteen ecosystems with different degrees of hydraulic connectivity in the floodplain of the Grijalva River watershed has been analysed and described along five years. After human interventions, four lagoons are permanently disconnected and three are temporarily connected. The other three lagoons stay permanently interconnected. Native cichlids and poeciliids dominated in number of species, representing 24 of the 55 listed species. These 55 species include six non-native invasive species in the Usumacinta Province. The lowest number of species was recorded in urban lagoons, while they were similar in rural lagoons and rivers. In addition, 60% of the fish absent in the lagoons of the Metropolitan Area of Villahermosa (MAV) are species with a marine or an estuarine affinity; thus, the permanently disconnected MAV lagoons have seven species less than the permanently connected rural lagoons. Diversity corresponds to that reported in the literature. In urban lagoons, low diversity and the high percentage of lacking fish with a marine or an estuarine affinity indicate that ichthyological diversity is favoured by the interconnection of rivers and rural lagoons in the floodplain of the Grijalva River Basin.

TI  - Habitat use by mammals varies along an exurban development gradient in northern Colorado
PY  - 2014
AB  - Exurban development, defined as residential development outside of cities and towns, occupies nearly five times more land in the United States than urban and suburban development combined. Understanding the effects of exurban development on biodiversity thus has important and wide-ranging implications for the planning, construction and stewardship of sustainable communities and surrounding rural lands. To assess the impact of exurban development on mammalian habitat use, wildlife cameras were placed along a unique gradient of landscape permeability through varying densities and configurations of housing development in a rapidly growing rural region of Colorado. Multiple-season species occupancy and relative activity levels were measured in summer and winter seasons. The impacts of exurban housing on mammals were species specific and varied along the development gradient. Bobcats (Lynx rufus), elk (Cervus canadensis), and coyotes (Canis latrans), showed decreased activity and occupancy levels in more developed areas, whereas red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) occurred more frequently in these areas. Other species did not show significant responses to exurban development. In addition, black bears (Ursus americanus) used embedded greenbelts more frequently in high-density exurban subdivisions. Using our development gradient provides ecologically relevant insight into how mammals respond to residential development, and our results demonstrate that some species respond positively to residential development, but that others decline or disappear as the development gradient intensifies. Incorporating well-designed and naturally vegetated open spaces into development projects and minimizing human disturbance could mitigate impacts to mid-large sized mammals in regions undergoing exurban expansion.

TI  - Understanding the genetic effects of recent habitat fragmentation in the context of evolutionary history: phylogeography and landscape genetics of a southern California endemic Jerusalem cricket (Orthoptera : Stenopelmatidae : Stenopelmatus)
PY  - 2007
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation due to urbanization are the most pervasive threats to biodiversity in southern California. Loss of habitat and fragmentation can lower migration rates and genetic connectivity among remaining populations of native species, reducing genetic variability and increasing extinction risk. However, it may be difficult to separate the effects of recent anthropogenic fragmentation from the genetic signature of prehistoric fragmentation due to previous natural geological and climatic changes. To address these challenges, we examined the phylogenetic and population genetic structure of a flightless insect endemic to cismontane southern California, Stenopelmatus 'mahogani' (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae). Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data suggest that diversification across southern California began during the Pleistocene, with most haplotypes currently restricted to a single population. Patterns of genetic divergence correlate with contemporary urbanization, even after correcting for (geographical information system) GIS-based reconstructions of fragmentation during the Pleistocene. Theoretical simulations confirm that contemporary patterns of genetic structure could be produced by recent urban fragmentation using biologically reasonable assumptions about model parameters. Diversity within populations was positively correlated with current fragment size, but not prehistoric fragment size, suggesting that the effects of increased drift following anthropogenic fragmentation are already being seen. Loss of genetic connectivity and diversity can hinder a population's ability to adapt to ecological perturbations commonly associated with urbanization, such as habitat degradation, climatic changes and introduced species. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of preserving and restoring landscape connectivity for long-term persistence of low vagility native species.

TI  - The Heterogeneous Impact of High-Speed Railway on Urban Expansion in China
PY  - 2021
AB  - High-speed railway (HSR) promote the efficient flow of the population and materials between cities and have profoundly affected urban economic development in China. However, there is currently limited research about how HSR influences urban expansion, especially related to the variable impacts on different urban agglomerations, different size cities, and the conversion of non-urban land to urban land. In this study, from two levels of regional heterogeneity and type heterogeneity, a multi-stage difference-in-differences (multi-stage DID) model and land use remote sensing data are used to investigate these research areas. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The first opening of HSR had a more significant role in promoting urban expansion than HSR frequency, but several years after opening, HSR no longer promotes urban expansion. (2) The opening of HSR only played a significant role in promoting urban expansion in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. HSR frequency had a significant role in promoting urban expansion in the Yangtze River Delta. (3) The opening of HSR had no significant impact on urban expansion for different size cities, and HSR frequency only had a significant negative impact on urban expansion of small cities. (4) The first opening of HSR led to urban expansion dominated by the occupation of cultivated land. Cities in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia mainly converted barren land and vegetation cover to urban land after the first opening of HSR. In northeast China, the first opening of HSR made the conversion of vegetation cover and cultivated land to urban land roughly equivalent in size. The results of this study are helpful to understand the impact of the first opening of HSR and the scale of conversion of different types of non-urban land into urban land on urban expansion. In the era of HSR, these findings provide a valuable reference for regional planning and preventing the disorderly expansion of cities.

TI  - The application of graph theory and percolation analysis for assessing change in the spatial configuration of pond networks
PY  - 2018
AB  - Pond networks support high levels of biodiversity when compared to other freshwater ecosystems such as rivers, lakes and streams. The persistence of species in these small, sometimes ephemeral, aquatic habitats depends on the dispersal of individuals among ponds in the landscape. However, the number of ponds across the landscape is at a historical low as urbanisation and intensified agricultural practices have led to a substantial loss of ponds (nodes in the pond network) over more than a century. Here, we examine the extent and drivers of pond loss in a heavily urbanised landscape (Birmingham, UK) over 105 years and determine how pond loss influences key structural properties of the pond network using graph theoretic approaches. Specifically, we calculated minimum spanning trees (MST) and performed percolation analyses to determine changes in both the spatial configuration and resilience of the pond network through time. Pond numbers declined by 82% between ca1904 and 2009, such that pond density decreased from 7.1 km(-2) to 1.3 km(-2). The MST analyses revealed increased distance between ponds in the network (i.e. edge length increased) by up to 49% over the 105-year period, indicating that ponds in the modern landscape (2009) were considerably more isolated, with fewer neighbours. This study demonstrates that graph theory has an excellent potential to inform the management of pond networks in order to support ecological communities that are less vulnerable to environmental change.

TI  - Consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation for wetland amphibian assemblages
PY  - 1999
AB  - Landscape-level variables operating at multiple spatial scales likely influence wetland amphibian assemblages but have not been investigated in detail. We examined the significance of habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as selected within-wetland conditions, affecting amphibian assemblages in twenty-one glacial marshes. Wetlands were located within urban and agricultural regions of central and southwestern Minnesota, USA and were distributed across two ecoregions: tallgrass prairie and northern hardwood forest. We surveyed amphibian assemblages and used a geographic information system to quantify land-use variables at three scales: 500, 1000, and 2500 m. Ten species of amphibians were detected, the most abundant being Rana pipiens, Ambystoma tigrinum, and Bufo americanus. Amphibian species richness was lower with greater wetland isolation and road density at all spatial scales in both ecoregions. Amphibian species richness also had a negative relationship with the proportion of urban land-use at all spatial scales in the hardwood forest ecoregion, and species richness was greater in wetlands with fish and Ambystoma tigrinum. These biotic relationships are less consistent and more difficult to interpret than are land-use relationships. The data presented here suggest that decreases in landscape connectivity via fragmentation and habitat loss can affect amphibian assemblages, and reversing those landscape changes should be an important part of a regional conservation strategy.

TI  - Conservation subdivisions: A wildlife perspective
PY  - 2009
AB  - Conservation subdivision is a design concept used by landscape architects and other built environment professionals to conserve wildlife habitat within growing communities. The idea is by Clustering homes together to maximize open space. one can conserve urban biodiversity. It is a popular concept used by many planners and landscape architects and is used in many municipalities as an alternative to conventional urban development. In this review paper, we systematically review Randall Arendt's book, Conservation Design for Subdivisions: A Practical Guide to Creating Open Space Networks, which has championed the conservation design concept. Through this review and our experiences with how the conservation design concept has been applied, we provide suggestions that will (1) maximize the potential of conservation subdivisions to conserve wildlife and their habitats, and (2) promote positive wildlife experiences for residents of conservation subdivisions. We found several recommended design elements that could negatively impact wildlife but of significance, we found that most guidelines and effort in conservation subdivisions are placed on the design phase: construction and post-construction phases are neglected. We discuss the social and ecological elements that warrant consideration during the construction and post-construction phases and how they are necessary in order to conserve functional wildlife habitat within a conservation subdivision.

TI  - Paths of coexistence: Spatially predicting acceptance of grizzly bears along key movement corridors
PY  - 2022
AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for conserving wildlife in spaces shared with humans. Yet, differences in human attitudes and behaviors within movement corridors can lead to spatial variation in the risks humans pose to wildlife. Mapping the spatial pattern of attitudes toward wildlife provides a useful tool for measuring this variation and promoting connectivity. We surveyed ranchers (n = 505) in the High Divide region in eastern Idaho and western Montana (United States) about their attitudes toward grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) - a species that can pose risks to livestock and human safety. We assessed spatial variation in rancher acceptance of grizzly bears by combining survey and spatial predictors. Ranchers surrounded by more conservation easements and wildland-urban interface reported more positive attitudes toward grizzlies. Ranch size, experience with bears, and off-ranch income sources helped to further explain relationships between predictors and ranchers' acceptance of grizzlies. Our predictive map of acceptance provides spatially explicit information for targeted, pre-emptive conflict mitigation and a baseline for examining spatiotemporal changes in human attitudes as grizzly bear populations expand in the region. Integrating human social factors into spatial connectivity planning may better inform how organizations approach landowners and allow for a more strategic, sustainable approach to connectivity and conservation decision-making.

TI  - Responses of anuran communities to rapid urban growth in Shanghai, China
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanization affects amphibian communities through habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat quality. The effects of these changes in habitat at different scales vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. We assessed the breeding distribution of anurans along an urban-rural gradient in Shanghai, China, a region experiencing intensive urbanization. Our results showed that urban density had a significantly negative influence on the overall anuran abundance and diversity and that the responses of individual species to urbanization varied. Pond age was an overall predictor in models describing the responses of Pelophylax nigromaculatus, Fejervarya multistriata, and M. fissipes and total anuran abundance. The quality of habitat at a pond was also important, and the high abundance of Bufo gargarizans and Pelophy lax plancyi was associated with ponds with aquatic vegetation coverage. Urban density showed strong negative effects on B. gargarizans, total anuran abundance, and species richness. The broad-scale landscape variables associated with forests, agricultural fields, and wetlands surrounding breeding ponds have been shown to affect anuran abundance and species richness. The response of individual species, total abundance, and species richness to urbanization reflected differences in their ecological requirements. We quantified the effects of urbanization on frogs in a rapidly urbanizing region, and our results demonstrated that both multi-spatial and temporal variables affect anurans in Shanghai. Our results emphasized the importance of anuran conservation planning in urbanized areas to preserve and/or restore terrestrial habitat and to improve connectivity between ponds and other wetlands.

TI  - Short perceptual range and yet successful invasion of a fragmented landscape: the case of the red-bellied tree squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus) in Argentina
PY  - 2012
AB  - Dispersal is a key element of the invasion process for introduced species, and is influenced by landscape connectivity. The red-bellied squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus) was introduced to Argentina in 1970. Suitable forest habitat for this arboreal species is highly fragmented in a rural-urban matrix, but despite this, the squirrel population has spread. Squirrels disperse into new habitat patches using connective features such as forest corridors. They may also cross gaps but up to what extent is not known. Gap crossing success is influenced by perceptual range, which is the distance from which animals can perceive suitable habitat. Perceptual range has been previously estimated for vulnerable species, but not for introduced species. We used a model relating perceptual range to body mass to predict the perceptual range of the red-bellied tree squirrel in Argentina. We then tested our prediction of 202-221 m by releasing squirrels in an unfamiliar arable field at different distances (300, 200, 100 and 20 m) from woodland habitat. We assumed that if woodland could be perceived, squirrels would orientate toward it. We estimated perceptual range to be between 20 and 100 m, considerably lower than predicted. Our results indicate that squirrels can potentially cross small habitat gaps, but dispersal over greater distances lacking connectivity is less likely. Incorporating this information when modelling the spread of exotic squirrels in the Pampas Region can yield more accurate prediction of the invasion process and guide management practices to minimise their expansion.

TI  - Riparian degradation, stream position in watershed, and proximity to towns facilitate invasion by Hedychium coronarium
PY  - 2021
AB  - Hedychium coronarium is an invasive plant widespread in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, especially in riparian areas. However, its distribution along streams is not continuous and the factors that are related to its local occurrence are unknown. We investigated which natural and anthropogenic drivers, particularly concerning dispersal and disturbance, facilitate establishment of H. coronarium. We sampled 148 randomly chosen riparian sites (each containing two plots) in a subtropical basin in southern Brazil and recorded presence/absence of the plant and some environmental variables in situ; other variables were extracted via GIS software. We performed a GLMM with presence/absence as the response variable, sampling site as a random factor and five predictors: intensity of ecosystem degradation, dominant type of terrestrial vegetation, river substrate size class, Strahler stream order and downstream distance to the nearest urban centre. Our results point out that invader presence is favoured by local human disturbance (high riparian degradation and presence of non-native forest), and possibly dispersal, as there is a higher H. coronarium presence probability in proximity to urban centres. Furthermore, a higher presence probability in downstream sections (higher Strahler order) might be explained by hydrologic dispersal of rhizome fragments. Our study illustrates that in the case of riparian invasions it is important to consider terrestrial and aquatic drivers, both natural and anthropogenic.

TI  - Detecting the response of bird communities and biodiversity to habitat loss and fragmentation due to urbanization
PY  - 2018
AB  - Birds are considered a good model for indicators of biodiversity response to habitat variations, as they are very sensitive to environmental change. However, continuous observations of habitat alterations from undisturbed landscapes to human-dominated ones, as well as the associated effects on bird biodiversity, are lacking. In this study, New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai, China was selected to illustrate the response of bird species, and thus biodiversity, to habitat loss and fragmentation. land use/land cover (LULC) data and bird records from 2002 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. The results suggested that, due to urban sprawl, the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by 82.4% and 87.3% by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the landscape. To measure bird biodiversity, species richness and relative abundance were calculated, and they could account for the overall trend in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an indicator of biodiversity accounting, the mean species abundance (MSA) of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in its calculation, and its value decreased from 100% to 76.8% to 52.2% to 24.5% in the four corresponding stages. Finally, suggested by redundant analysis, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird biodiversity differed in various bird communities, and the area and connectivity of wetlands were the most significant variables. Our findings could provide important information to inform bird biodiversity protection and habitat restoration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The role of small secondary biotopes in a highly fragmented landscape as habitat and connectivity providers for dragonflies (Insecta: Odonata)
PY  - 2017
AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are considered major threats to freshwater biodiversity and to invertebrates in particular. These often irreversible processes may lead to local and regional extinctions of species, most notably of stenotopic taxa. In spite of this, a number of studies have shown that small habitat patches can sustain rich and abundant communities. The present work assesses the relevance of a group of four small man-made (secondary) wildlife ponds to Odonata species diversity and abundance. Results obtained on pond recruiting capacity, species richness, abundance and habitat use by means of exuviae collection and monitoring of adults using a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method indicate the potential suitability of these small aquatic biotopes and the surrounding landscape as habitat providers and stepping stone connectors in the VallSs lowlands (Catalonia, Spain). This region, close to the metropolitan area of Barcelona, has severely degraded natural habitats and high landscape fragmentation due to infrastructure, urban and industrial expansion. A comparison among a greater number of sites (ponds and sections of streams and rivers) distributed across the region showed that adequately managed small waterbodies harbour richer Odonata communities than others that are unmanaged or managed specifically for other types of fauna or uses. Appropriate care of these small biotopes avoids disturbance and keeps them free from vertebrates like fish and waterfowl which, under certain conditions, may have a strong influence on the invertebrate communities because, apart from feeding on larvae, they may have a negative impact on macrophyte development and water quality. While rivers and streams, the only natural aquatic habitats in the area, may be both expensive and technically challenging to restore and manage successfully, the creation and/or restoration of small ponds and short river sections in suitable locations can be a cost-effective method for enhancing freshwater vegetation and invertebrate diversity in this impacted landscape.

TI  - Colonization and extinction dynamics among the plant species at tree bases in Paris (France)
PY  - 2019
AB  - In cities, trees planted along streets could play an important ecological role for spontaneous plants growing at their bases. For example, these trees could represent corridors by potentially connecting large green spaces (e.g., parks, gardens), which allow species to move within the urban matrix. We considered sets of urban trees in 15 streets in Paris, France, as metapopulations for 15 plant species. Our objective was to determine the factors influencing the dynamics of colonization and extinction of populations based on the distance of the streets to green spaces and biological traits of each species. Plant species in 1,324 tree bases of the Bercy District of Paris were surveyed annually from 2009 to 2015. For each species and each street, we used SPOMSIM software to identify the best-fit metapopulation model between four models with different colonization and extinction functions: propagule rain model (PRM) and Levins' model with or without rescue effect. Results demonstrated that species more often conformed to the PRM in streets near green spaces, which suggested that green spaces could act as sources for the populations in those streets. Species with seeds with long-term persistence more often conformed to the PRM, indicating that a soil seed bank helps species invade entire streets. Finally, a higher percentage of species with a short height conformed to models with a rescue effect, which indicated that those small species resisted the effects of weeding by the city technical services better than taller species. Synthesis and applications. This study showed how biological traits of species and geography of the district determine the dynamics of plants in the streets, and these results may provide important information for biodiversity management in cities.

TI  - Vegetated roofs in boreal climate support mobile open habitat arthropods, with differentiation between meadow and succulent roofs
PY  - 2020
AB  - Vegetated roofs are hoped to benefit urban wildlife, yet there are few empirical results regarding the conservation potential of such roofs. In this paper, we focus on arthropods on vegetated roofs. We vacuum sampled 17 succulent, meadow or succulent-meadow roofs, in Helsinki, Finland, and used order to species level information together with trait data to describe the communities. We evaluated the importance of biophysical roof characteristics on shaping arthropod assemblages to provide information concerning roof designs that promote rich arthropod fauna. Arthropod communities differed between the three roof types and the influence of roof variables varied between and within arthropod orders. The main local drivers of arthropod abundance across the individually analysed taxa were roof height and vegetation, with mainly positive effects of height (up to 11 m) and litter cover, and mainly negative effects of grass cover. Based on trait data from true bugs, spiders and ants, the roofs consisted mainly of common dispersive species that are generalist feeders and associated with dry open habitats or have wide habitat tolerance. We found one true bug species new to the country and assume that it arrived with imported vegetation. Based on these findings, vegetated roofs of varying height and size benefit common generalists and fauna of open dry habitats, but seem to lack rare native specialists and may introduce non-natives if imported plant material is used. Because the responses to vegetation characteristics are taxon-specific, high diversity of roof vegetation types would benefit arthropod conservation.

TI  - Impact model of urban development on steppic birds in natura 2000 spaces
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization is one of the agents that contribute most to habitat fragmentation and is therefore a threat to biodiversity conservation. Connectivity improvement is the adaptation strategy most often cited to address species conservation in a changing environment. Many studies of protection at local and regional level zones usually show separate portions of habitat, defining the protected area, but they do not provide guidance on where and how to act to preserve the habitat quality and connectivity of the populations, on a consistent scale with planning units. In this paper, the analysis of fragmentation-connectivity focuses on cereal steppes of the Jarama and Henares rivers (Spain) to study the habitat and connectivity of steppic birds populations into protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, quantifying the effect on this protected area and on the species of interest caused by the massive development of infrastructure and urbanization due to the expansion of Madrid metropolitan area. In this sense, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) was used as a bioindicator, due to its high demand for habitat quality. The proposed methodology only needs to be based on data from wildlife sightings and land use. Once the variables (density, biophysics and urbanization) were defined, it was possible to determine the values of influence, applying them to generate the map of areas of probability of presence and movement of the Great Bustard. This can be used to support conservation plans based on habitat connectivity.

TI  - Urban tree isolation affects the abundance of its pests and their natural enemies
PY  - 2022
AB  - The proximity to transportation hubs and the large movement of goods and people in cities make trees especially prone to invasive insect pests. Urban tree arrangements, in isolated tree sites or in forest patches, may alter their susceptibility to insect herbivory. Surprisingly little is known about how urban tree spatial arrangements influence pest abundance and top-down regulation by natural enemies. We sampled the abundance of an invasive pest of Eucalyptus, the psyllid Glycaspis brimblecombei, and of two of its natural enemies, the specialist exotic parasitoid Psyllaephagus bliteus and the generalist native predator Anthocoris nemoralis over two years. We measured insect abundances in isolated trees versus monospecific planted forest patches in 17 pairs of sites, each within a Portuguese city. The abundance of the exotic pest was three-fold higher in forest patches than in isolated trees. The parasitism rate was similar to 30 times higher in forest patches (11.5 %) than in isolated trees (0.4 %). The interdependence among insect species abundances also differed between spatial arrangements. In isolated trees, predator and parasitoid abundances depended markedly on prey abundance. In forest patches, we found a marked dependence of the predator on the composition of the surrounding landscape. Our study adds empirical data indicating that urban tree isolation matters for pest abundance and regulation by its enemies. In similar systems, avoiding dense monospecific patches of exotic trees and increasing the compositional heterogeneity of the landscape are promising paths to maintain the sustainability of urban trees and their environmental and societal benefits.

TI  - Sampling arthropod diversity for urban ecological landscaping in a species-rich southern hemisphere botanic garden
PY  - 1997
AB  - Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, sticky traps, sweep netting, Malaise traps and visual sampling at a national botanic garden, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the taxonomic impediment is great. The aims were to compare two sites, one of native vegetation and the other of mainly exotic plants, to determine the possible localized extent of biodiversity change across the land mosaic, and to test and compare methodologies and indicator taxa and to make recommendations for ecological landscaping of a botanic garden. Species richness and evenness varied considerably with sampling technique used. From results of a single replicate of data from all trapping methods including 821 arthropod species and 3831 individuals, a number of conclusions could be drawn. Trapping procedures such as sweep netting and pitfall traps, which focus on species with restricted mobility and/or host plant requirements, indicated greatest differences in diversity between two closely located sites. Taxa varied in sensitivity to microlandscape, again depending on the extent of their mobility. Cicindelid and carabid beetles were particularly good indicators of habitat disturbance and type. The management recommendations are that in a species-rich urban botanic garden such as this, as many ecotopes as possible should be preserved or created. These should vary in topography, landscape characteristics and vegetation composition, with as much connectivity as possible. This is a feasible blanket approach to give home to a large number of nameless species and morphs. Patches of different ecotopes should not be separated by more than a few metres by expanses of mown lawn which isolates much of the fauna.

TI  - Diversity and specificity of host-natural enemy interactions in an urban-rural interface
PY  - 2016
AB  - 1. Urbanisation and agricultural intensification cause the replacement of natural ecosystems but might also create novel habitats in urban and rural ecosystems promoting some insect communities by providing food and nesting resources. 2. This study investigated how host natural enemy communities change in urban and rural landscapes and their transitional zone, the urban rural interface, by using trap nests for cavity-nesting Hymenoptera in gardens and rapeseed fields that were either isolated or paired in the urban rural interface. 3. Host dynamics were important for natural enemy occurrence, species richness and parasitism rates, and landscape effects were evident for natural enemy variables except for the richness of bee natural enemies. The number of parasitised brood cells was at its highest in the urban rural interface, but the highest parasitism rates of bees were observed in isolated gardens. Parasitism rates of bees were negatively affected by host abundance, while parasitism rates of wasps were positively affected. 4. Higher specialisation and lower connectivity of host natural enemy interactions were found in paired habitats than in isolated habitats. This indicates that paired habitats comprise more specific natural enemies and vulnerable interactions, while isolated habitats comprise more generalist natural enemies, and thus interactions appear more stable. 5. These results confirm that host dynamics play an essential role in the abundance and richness of natural enemies and drive parasitism. However, high habitat heterogeneity found in the urban rural interface can also have an effect on host natural enemy communities. This highlights that the provisioning of resources in the urban rural interface can benefit insect communities in these areas.

TI  - Invasion of freshwater ecosystems is promoted by network connectivity to hotspots of human activity
PY  - 2020
AB  - Aim Hotspots of human activity are focal points for ecosystem disturbance and non-native introduction, from which invading populations disperse and spread. As such, connectivity to locations used by humans may influence the likelihood of invasion. Moreover, connectivity in freshwater ecosystems may follow the hydrological network. Here we tested whether multiple forms of connectivity to human recreational activities promotes biological invasion of freshwater ecosystems. Location England, UK. Time period 1990-2018. Major taxa studied One hundred and twenty-six non-native freshwater birds, crustaceans, fish, molluscs and plants. Methods Machine learning was used to predict spatial gradients in human recreation and two high risk activities for invasion (fishing and water sports). Connectivity indices were developed for each activity, in which human influence decayed from activity hotspots according to Euclidean distance (spatial connectivity) or hydrological network distance (downstream, upstream and along-channel connectivity). Generalized linear mixed models identified the connectivity type most associated to invasive species richness of each group, while controlling for other anthropogenic and environmental drivers. Results Connectivity to humans generally had stronger positive effects on invasion than all other drivers except recording effort. Recreation had stronger influence than urban land cover, and for most groups high risk activities had stronger effects than general recreation. Downstream human connectivity was most important for invasion by most of the groups, potentially reflecting predominantly hydrological dispersal. An exception was birds, for which spatial connectivity was most important, possibly because of overland dispersal capacity. Main conclusions These findings support the hypothesis that freshwater invasion is partly determined by an interaction between human activity and species dispersal in the hydrological network. By comparing alternative connectivity types for different human activities, our approach could enable robust inference of specific pathways and spread mechanisms associated with particular taxa. This would provide evidence to support better prioritization of surveillance and management for invasive non-native species.

TI  - Network Environ Analysis of Spatial Arrangement for Reserves in Wuyishan Nature Reserve, China
PY  - 2010
AB  - The spatial arrangement of reserves within a network is critical to the long-term persistence of dispersing species. In this paper, based on network environ analysis, an approach is presented to explicitly measure such ecological function, in which the dispersal-based interactions between reserves are considered from a holistic view by exploring not only species' direct dispersals but also their indirect ones. The proposed method first defines the ecological function of spatial arrangement of reserves as the probability that a species will survive for long time in a reserve network, and then expands this function by taking the reserve loss into account when evaluating a species' extinction probability at each reserve. A case study for L. nycthemera and M. thibetana from Wuyishan Nature Reserve, Fujian Province, China, is further conducted. The highest probabilities of lone-term survival are identified for both species in the reserve networks that contain several migrations with high successful dispersal probability. In addition, the path number of each common reserve under neighboring scenarios is found to be influenced by the changes of direct dispersal, from which the criteria for protecting and optimizing the spatial configuration of reserves in a nature reserve are derived. For Wuyishan Nature Reserve, these criteria may act as important bases to restrict and guide the development of tourism of surrounding cities and the socio-economic activities of local residents. It is concluded that the proposed method can provide an effective way to examine the ecological function of spatial arrangement of reserve network and contribute to species' long-term persistence in nature reserves.

TI  - A preliminary assessment of green areas of Matera city and their potential role in climate change
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban greening offers a series of services including the improvement of air quality, water cycle, through several functions (e.g., absorption of air pollutants, increasing water catchment operated by soil). There is increasing attention to quantify urban green areas and the related benefits to the extent that the Italian National Statistics Institute (ISTAT) scores the \"green value\" of the main cities. There are still uncertainties on the classification of the green areas and their potential to provide services that collectively improve the urban life quality. This study analysed the green areas of the urban environment of Matera city, focussing on their category (private gardens, school gardens, green streets and urban parks) and size and their potential to serve as CO2 sink. The analyses were carried out on four representative areas and the size of the various categories was assessed through cadastral and other municipal data. The urbanization process had influences on urban ecosystems including plant biodiversity, increasing the abundance of plant alien species. Knowledge on the spread of alien plant species might help to prevent the biodiversity loss. Therefore, a qualitative survey of the existing alien plant species in the urban environment was performed. Preliminary results show that the urban green area calculated in this study is 90 ha. In addition, private gardens share a higher surface of urban green areas, reflecting a good greening aptitude of citizens. Considering that the green areas within built environment is most beneficial for human well-being, a possible scenario related to the carbon (C) sequestration by these areas in Matera city will be presented. A potential green corridor connecting some existing spot green areas to promote social aspects and improve well-being of citizens and environmental sustainability will also be discussed. This study might be supportive for urban planners and local policy makers, contributing to drive future decisions towards a greener built environment of Matera city.

TI  - Anthropogenic refuges for freshwater biodiversity: Their ecological characteristics and management
PY  - 2013
AB  - We reviewed literature describing the potential for freshwater anthropogenic waterbodies to act as refuges from disturbance. We identified research related to the refuge potential of a wide range of waterbodies, using waterbody names as keywords along with 'artificial' and 'freshwater'. Potential freshwater anthropogenic refuges were more often standing than running waters. Agricultural ponds, rural and urban drainage ditches and transport canals were the most diverse for all aquatic taxa, whereas irrigation infrastructure was least diverse. Comparatively little is known about the refuge role of fire dams, urban artificial ponds, golf course lakes, disused industrial ponds and retaining walls. Local-scale attributes associated with high biodiversity were: presence of macrophytes (for animals), absence of fish (for amphibians, invertebrates), natural bed materials and hydroperiod (all biota). Landscape variables associated with high biodiversity were proximity to and connectivity with other waterbodies and to natural terrestrial vegetation. Moderate levels of management intervention were also associated with higher biodiversity. Many knowledge gaps about the function of anthropogenic refuges within landscapes exist and require further research. One of the most important limitations to the provision of refuges for freshwater biodiversity by anthropogenic waterbodies is the lack of recognition of their actual or potential biodiversity value. Anthropogenic waterbodies need to be recognised for their potential to support biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation for freshwater species, while being managed to prevent the spread of invasive species.

TI  - Community assembly on extensive green roofs: Effects of dispersal-, abiotic- and biotic filtering on the spontaneous species- and functional diversity
PY  - 2019
AB  - Questions Extensive green roofs (EGRs) are novel ecosystems and essential tools in mitigating the negative effects of urbanization. However, the extent to which traditional community assembly insights apply to spontaneous plant and trait diversity and composition on EGRs and novel ecosystems in general is unclear: (a) is a dispersal filter present because of EGRs' fragmented nature (e.g., roof height, urban environment); (b) can we confirm the strong abiotic filtering due to extreme EGR conditions (e.g., limited substrate depth); and (c) does the presence of the planted vegetation lead to biotic filtering? Location The Flanders and Brussels region of Belgium. Methods The vegetation of 129 EGRs was sampled during a field campaign. Information on local (e.g., substrate, roof height) and regional characteristics (e.g., connectivity indices) were collected and species traits were collected from multiple databases. All data were used to construct (generalized) linear mixed models that tested the effects of the dispersal-, local abiotic- and local biotic filters on plant community formation. Redundancy analysis was used to investigate predictor effects on functional composition and null models were constructed to assess trait divergence/convergence. Results Our results show that the spontaneous plant species diversity is not affected by their landscape context (dispersal filtering), while their functional composition is. Additionally, the importance of abiotic filtering is confirmed, as substrate depth and exposure have a strong impact on species diversity and decreasing substrate depth negatively impacts functional diversity. Finally, we show that biotic filtering by increased planted species cover leads to trait divergence, changes in functional composition and reduced cover of spontaneous species. Conclusions We find that a broad perspective that includes the regional and local biotic and abiotic environment is needed to assess all factors that influence the vegetation on EGRs. As biotic interactions are present, EGRs should not be considered as static systems.

TI  - Effect of catchment urbanization on ant diversity in remnant riparian corridors
PY  - 2013
AB  - The conversion of rural land to residential use is occurring rapidly as the global trend of city expansion continues. The impact of this land use change on riparian biodiversity was investigated by examining ant communities from 12 remnant riparian corridors in northwest Sydney, Australia. Ants were sampled from rural and urban catchments using pitfall traps. Data on vegetation floristics, habitat structure and stream water quality were also collected. No significant differences in ant diversity metrics or assemblage structure were found between urban and rural sites. Similarly, very few environmental variables revealed significant differences between land use types. One exception, however, was the percentage cover of exotic plants, which was related to ant assemblage structure. Small-leaved and broad-leaved privet (Ligustrum spp.) were highly correlated with total weed cover. The results suggest that ants respond mostly to small-scale habitat characteristics, especially those related to the dominance of exotic plants. As all sites had experienced some level of human impact, it is possible that all the sites have already transgressed an ecological threshold due to the earlier catchment land use change from natural to agricultural use. This apparent sensitivity may explain the failure to observe any significant differences between the urban and rural catchments examined in this study. It is recommended that managers looking to protect the integrity of riparian invertebrate communities should focus on addressing local habitat pressures in human-modified catchments.

TI  - Aquatic diversity in a former floodplain: Remediation in an urban context
PY  - 2009
AB  - The Lobau, a former floodplain area of the Danube River situated within the city limits of Vienna (Austria), was strongly affected by the river regulation in 1875. The reduced hydrological connectivity led to an increasing loss of aquatic habitats. A water enhancement scheme with a maximum water input of 0.5 m(3) s(-1) was initiated in 2001. The present study assesses the effect of this scheme on biodiversity using three target species groups - aquatic molluscs, dragonflies and fish - following a common Before-After Control-impact design (BACI). Dragonflies and molluscs were positively affected, reflecting the habitat alterations in the system. For fish. no significant impact was observed. The aim of the scheme has been achieved: increased habitat diversity and improved habitat conditions for the system's initial community and further rheophilic/rheotolerant species. Water enhancement schemes can be effective remediation measures and deserve further attention in the management of urban wetlands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Urban Green Space Pattern in Core Cities of the Greater Bay Area Based on Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) play a crucial role in supporting urban ecological systems and improving human well-being in cities. The spatial patterns of UGS are vital bases for analyzing various ecological processes. However, few studies have investigated morphological UGS patterns, especially in high-density cities. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China is one of the four major bay areas in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and distributions of UGS in the core GBA cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Hong Kong, and Macao), and discuss the shortcomings and potential environmental impacts of the contemporary patterns of UGS. Morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was used to analyze the spatial UGS pattern. Seven MSPA metrics (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, and branch) were assessed to measure morphological UGS patterns. The results showed that: (1) Hong Kong has the highest quality habitat, with a large and continuous distribution of UGSs, and a few smaller green spaces scattered in built-up areas; (2) Guangzhou's UGSs are unevenly distributed, with large green spaces concentrated in the northern part of the city and many small, scattered green spaces distributed in built-up areas, demonstrating the most prominent pattern of green space fragmentation; (3) green space patches in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong region exhibit a relatively complex form; and (4) the UGS in Zhuhai-Macao is relatively discrete, and its connectivity is relatively low. These findings not only improve the depth of understanding of the spatial pattern of UGS in the GBA, but also confirm the applicability of MSPA in the analysis of spatial patterns of UGS.

TI  - Urban Rivers as Dispersal Corridors: Which Factors Are Important for the Spread of Alien Woody Species along the Danube?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Cities are hotspots of invasions, and this is particularly the case for urban rivers, which are known to serve as corridors for the spread of alien plant species to floodplain forests. Here, we present a case study on woody (shrubs, trees) species invasions across a gradient from a metropolis (Vienna) to rural regions along the Danube River in eastern Austria. In total, we identified 44 native and 25 alien woody species in 75 plots. Five alien woody species occur in at least 10 plots. The most wide-spread ones were species of floodplain forests (Acer negundo, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, and Populus x canadensis), while Ailanthus altissima and Robinia pseudoacacia-which prefer dry sites-were recorded substantially less often. The average level of invasion-i.e., the relative proportion of alien to native woody species in plots-was high across all three study regions. Still, there was a moderate decline of alien woody species richness along the urban-peri-urban-rural gradient. Generalized Linear Mixed Models showed that population density and the proportion of urban habitats in the environs of the plots is significantly positively correlated with the presence of Acer negundo and Ailanthus altissima. Conversely, the occurrence of Robinia pseudoacacia is negatively correlated with surrounding population density and urban habitats. Occurrence of Acer negundo is positively correlated with urban habitats. For Fraxinus pennsylvanica, we found no significant relationships. Our results confirm that gallery forests at river banks are highly susceptible to invasions. We argue that managing alien woody species in urban and peri-urban sites is not appropriate and useful, given that re-invasion is likely in most cases (from adjacent urban green spaces). We acknowledge that this recommendation entails the implicit recognition that gallery forests along urban sections of the Danube will contain a substantial-and likely further increasing-proportion of alien woody species.

TI  - Using the commons to understand the Dutch elm disease epidemic in Syracuse, NY
PY  - 2019
AB  - Prior to the arrival of Dutch elm disease to the United States in 1930, American elm (Ulmus americana) had become one of the most beloved and commonly planted urban trees throughout the country, especially in the Northeastern United States. The trees were revered for their beauty, hardiness, and the corridor-like shade provided to city streets. Syracuse, NY stands as an example of this popularity: in 1951, when the disease first arrived in the city, over 50,000 elms grew in the city. But over the course of twenty years, nearly all elms in the city had become infected and succumbed to the disease. Although efforts to control the fungus in Syracuse ultimately failed to stop elm loss, the case study can be used to better inform contemporary urban forest management practices today by highlighting the effects of mixed property ownership in cities and its effects on pest management.

TI  - Conservation corridors in the United States: Benefits and planning guidelines
PY  - 1999
AB  - The landscape of rural America is changing. Wildlife habitats are being converted to agricultural uses, corridors (linear patches that differ from their surroundings) are removed to expand fields, and urban development spreads across farms, forests, and prairies. The result is a fragmented landscape with fewer, smaller, less-connected patches of wildlife habitat and increasingly-degraded water quality that stresses aquatic ecosystems. The landscape's capacity to sustain a diversity of plant, animal, and aquatic species is declining at an decelerating rate. The loss of biodiversity has become a national concern. Land use planners are increasingly advocating the use of conservation corridors, including riparian buffers, windbreaks/shelterbelts, filter strips, field borders, and grassed waterways to improve water quality and wildlife habitat Since many of the ecological functions of conservation corridors operate more efficiently at scales larger than an individual corridor, planning at the watershed scale offers the best opportunity to optimize these functions.

TI  - Conservation where people live and work
PY  - 2002
AB  - Effective conservation planning requires information from well-designed studies across a spectrum of land uses, ranging from wildlands to highly, modified production landscapes and large cities, There is currently, a lack of such information about human settlement, even though this is it major source of land-use change with serious implications for biodiversity. Fewer than 6% of the papers in recent volumes of Conservation Biology described work conducted in urban, suburban, or exurban areas or studies In which human settlement was considered explicitly For a variety of reasons, conservation bets tended to focus oil lands with a relatively, small human presence, often dominated by resource extraction and agriculture. Urbanization is occurring in numerous biodiversity, hotspots worldwide, however, and has been identified as a primary. cause of declines in many, threatened and endangered species. Suburban and exurban growth art, affecting biodiversity, in many,places once thought of as too remote to attract such levels of development, Conservation biologists must address the issue of human settlement to enhance the habitat value of unreserved lands for native species, to increase landscape connectivity, between reserves, and to mitigate adverse influences oil reserves from adjacent lands. Conservation and restoration of native habitats in densely, settled areas also have social and educational value. We therefore suggest a more balanced approach in conservation biology to addressing the effects of human land use through increased attention to areas where people live and work.

TI  - Measuring 30 years of improvements to aquatic connectivity in the Greater Toronto Area
PY  - 2018
AB  - Instream barriers (e.g. dams, weirs and road crossings) fragment aquatic habitat and prevent the upstream movement of fish, impairing the ability of fishes to complete critical life stages, access critical habitat and for dispersal among local populations. Mitigation efforts have improved aquatic connectivity to some degree, but it has been challenging to quantify the overall improvement in connectivity without long-term and costly field assessments. The development of spatially explicit habitat connectivity indices make it possible to evaluate current stream connectivity, and quantify the improvement prior mitigation projects have had on connectivity. We combined a list of instream barrier mitigation projects completed in five watersheds in the Toronto (Ontario, Canada) area from 1987-2016 (mitigated barriers) and a previously established inventory of all known instream barriers in 2016 (current barriers). The cumulative improvement to connectivity was measured for potadromous (remain in tributaries) and diadromous (move between tributaries and lake) fish species using the dendritic connectivity index. Aquatic connectivity improved for diadromous species between 0 and 14.5% and for potadromous species between 0.1 and 4.4% in the five studied watersheds. Some variation in improvement among the watersheds can likely be attributed to differences in mitigation strategies among the watersheds and a historical emphasis on mitigating instream barriers to benefit migratory salmonid species.

TI  - Qualitative variation in roadside weed vegetation along an urban-rural road gradient
PY  - 2012
AB  - Information on mechanisms of differentiation or homogenization of urban floras is deficient, despite their importance for urban nature conservation and urban land management. Roads, as a major human promoter of urbanization, can be an initial habitat for plants dispersed by transportations. We assumed that variation in weed vegetation along urban-rural roadside gradients is small, particularly in curbside cracks. We classified vegetation occurring in curbside cracks along the National Route 3 in southern japan and compared the characteristics of the vegetation types recognized. Species in curbside cracks were recorded on 40 plots. Three vegetation types were classified, in part related to surrounding land-use types. Although the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the number of native species clearly differed among the vegetation types in the curbside cracks, no significant differences between the three floristic vegetation types were found in the number of non-natives and invasive alien species. This may result from the small specificity and complexity of landscape structures, due to the continuity and connectivity of paved-road networks. Of the 122 species, 44 were non-natives or invasive alien species. The vegetation types generally involved the same plant families, with large numbers of species from the Asteraceae and Poaceae, regardless of vegetation types, but frequency of occurrence of the two families clearly differed between natives and non-natives and invasive alien species. Ephemeral non-natives and invasive alien species. particularly Asteraceae and Poaceae, seem to have advantageous dispersal strategies or low habitat dependency facilitating their occurrence in curbside cracks, regardless of adjacent land uses and the urban-rural landscape gradient. Expansion of these species may cause a homogenization of regional floras along roads. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Impact of Urban Expansion on Plant Diversity Change in Karst Regions of Southwest China
PY  - 2022
AB  - Biodiversity is vital for the integrity and stability of ecosystems and sustainable development. Karst regions of Southwest China is featured for undulating and broken karst terrain as well as high plant diversity. Land use changes induced by the growing population and expanding human settlement have threatened biodiversity preservation in this region. However, the impact of urban expansion on plant diversity remains unclear here. This study focuses on how expanding countryside landscapes affect the recovery rate of plant diversity and demonstrate how urban expansion affects plant diversity conservation in karst regions of Southwest China. In situ biodiversity investigations and multisource remote sensing images were combined to analyze the role of human settlement evolution in the conservation of plant diversity using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Unmanned vehicle images, historical aerial photographs, and long-term remote sensing images were used to observe the human settlement pattern changes over 40 yr and found that plant diversity is restored faster in countryside ecosystems than in island ecosystems restricted by water. Forests, however, contribute the most to plant diversity conservation in both ecosystems. While the forest area is stable during urban expansion, massive forest patches play an essential role in plant diversity conservation. Arable lands and grasslands shrank but with a fragmenting trend, which was conducive to preserving plant diversity, whereas increased and regularized large patches of built-up areas were not beneficial to plant diversity. Accordingly, forest protection should be prioritized to coordinate future socioeconomic development and plant diversity conservation in karst and broader regions. Furthermore, large built-up patches should be limited, and the irregularity should be improved during urban expansion. Irregular shaped cultivated land and grassland were suggested to promote biological information exchanges as landscape corridors.

TI  - Lessons in ecology and conservation from a tropical forest fragment in Singapore
PY  - 2021
AB  - Forest fragments are increasingly common in the tropics as pristine forests are cleared. Fragments stranded within cities are especially stress-prone due to their greatly altered environment and high human impacts. We review biodiversity and ecological studies from Bukit Timah, a tropical forest fragment in Singapore, to ask how this forest has contributed to our understanding of tropical ecology and fragmentation effects, and list the conservation values of this forest. Evidence from Amazonian fragments predicts that losses in diversity and forest function follow fragmentation, and although Bukit Timah has adhered to some of those predictions, other aspects of the forest appeared remarkably resilient. As might be expected, declines in plant, invertebrate, bird, and mammal diversity occurred not only historically but also across two surveys made about 20 years apart. In other ways Bukit Timah proved surprising. Aboveground biomass fluctuated but did not plummet drastically, and was comparable to levels found in primary forests in the region. The extirpation of large fauna did not appear to reduce the dispersal of large seeded plant species, likely due to continued dispersal by small-mammals and birds. Exotic tree species are confined to recovering secondary forest fringes and do not threaten the primary forest, except for perhaps shade tolerant Par ' a rubber and a handful of cultivated fruit trees. Studies of birds and plants found that life history differences could account for differences in genetic connectivity or isolation for different species, with population genetic implications for other taxa. Despite being a small fragment, new species of plants and animals continue to be discovered or re-discovered. Clearly, there are reasons to celebrate Bukit Timah as a forest fragment that withstood two centuries of human impacts. Nonetheless, many measures can be implemented to better secure its future.

TI  - Roads and forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus dispersion
PY  - 2022
AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for a wide range of ecological processes, including to disease spread, once it describes the degree to which landscapes facilitate or impede vector and hosts dispersion. Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Private farmers' compensation and viability of protected areas: the case of Nairobi National Park and Kitengela dispersal corridor
PY  - 2012
AB  - Nairobi National Park (NNP) is unable to incorporate the spatial and temporal dynamics of many migratory mammals that rely on the area as a dry season refuge because of its small size. During the wet season, wildlife must be able to migrate to the south into the Kitengela dispersal area. This area is privately owned and rapidly undergoing land-use change, which affects the structure and function of the dispersal corridors, jeopardising the ecological sustainability of the park. Private landholders in Kitengela incur most of the costs of keeping the dispersal areas open, but do not receive any compensation or revenue from benefits derived from tourism in the park. Here we present an analysis of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for Nairobi and Kitengela residents for a new land management scheme in the dispersal area, in which local pastoralists leave their land open to wildlife and, by not engaging in fencing, land subdivision or poaching activities, receive monetary compensation for the incremental costs derived from use of their properties as a wildlife dispersal area. The results suggest that the aggregated financial support of urban residents might represent around $1.2 million per year for 5 years. This amount exceeds the economic losses caused by wildlife in the dispersal area, and different financial schemes of fund investment and the prioritisation of conservation regions could be implemented to ensure payments and keep the dispersal corridors open in perpetuity.

TI  - Urbanization affects oak-pathogen interactions across spatial scales
PY  - 2022
AB  - The world is rapidly urbanizing, thereby transforming natural landscapes and changing the abundance and distribution of organisms. However, insights into the effects of urbanization on species interactions, and plant-pathogen interactions in particular, are lacking. We investigated the effects of urbanization on powdery mildew infection on Quercus robur at continental and within-city scales. At the continental scale, we compared infection levels between urban and rural areas of different-sized cities in Europe, and investigated whether plant traits, climatic variables and CO2 emissions mediated the effect of urbanization on infection levels. Within one large city (Stockholm, Sweden), we further explored whether local habitat features and spatial connectivity influenced infection levels during multiple years. At the continental scale, infection severity was consistently higher on trees in urban than rural areas, with some indication that temperature mediated this effect. Within Stockholm city, temperature had no effect, while local accumulation of leaf litter negatively affected powdery mildew incidence in one out of three years, and more connected trees had lower infection levels. This study is the first to describe the effects of urbanization on plant-pathogen interactions both within and among cities, and to uncover the potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns at each scale.

TI  - Use of urban bushland remnants by the western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis): short-term home-range size and habitat use in Albany, Western Australia
PY  - 2018
AB  - Management of wildlife in habitats fragmented by urbanisation requires an understanding of a species' habitat use. Known populations of the critically endangered western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis) are largely restricted to bushland remnants in rapidly urbanising areas of south-western Australia. Habitat use is thought to be driven by nutritional content, structure and connectivity of canopy vegetation. At the southernmost extent of the species' range, habitat use is largely unknown, although it is expected to be different from previous descriptions due to differences in vegetation characteristics. We used VHF and global positioning system tracking collars to determine short-term home-range size, diurnal refuge use and night-time tree use of western ringtail possums in bushland remnants within Albany City. Possums had small home ranges (0.88ha) that were negatively correlated with percentage canopy cover; used a variety of daytime refuges (predominantly dreys); and preferentially utilised marri (Corymbia calophylla) and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) at night. These results confirm that differences in habitat use among populations exist and suggests that the species is reasonably flexible in its use of habitat. Management of western ringtail possums needs to be population specific and will benefit from further examination of habitat use in the variety of occupied habitats.

TI  - Spatial variation in the willingness to accept payments for conservation of a migratory wildlife corridor in the Athi-Kaputiei Plains, Kenya
PY  - 2014
AB  - To be effective in promoting the conservation of migratory wildlife, recipients of payment for ecosystem services (PES) most be willing to accept payment along the entire migratory corridor. This paper investigates spatial variation in willingness to accept. (WTA) payments made by the Wildlife Conservation Lease Program in the Athi-Kaputiei plains of Kenya. The program, designed as an incentive to keep land open for wildlife and livestock, offers land owners 10 US$ per ha per year, irrespective of location. We model the relation between WTA and distances to roads, towns and rivers, annual precipitation arid slope and display the predicted spatial variation in WTA. The results reveal significant spatial variation in willingness to accept payments for availing land for conservation, with higher WTA concentrated away from roads and also in the Southeast of the plains. The results further suggest that wildlife movement will be blocked due to low WTA in the proximity of towns and tarmacked roads. We conclude that an effective strategy to keep the land open for migratory wildlife should consider spatial variation in WTA payment for land lease. It is suggested to consider stratifying the lease rates geographically to reflect the underlying spatial variation in WTA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Responses of insectivorous bats and nocturnal insects to local changes in street light technology
PY  - 2019
AB  - Artificial light at night is a pervasive anthropogenic stressor for biodiversity. Many fast-flying insectivorous bat species feed on insects that are attracted to light-emitting ultraviolet radiation (10-400 nm). Several countries are currently focused on replacing mercury vapour lamps, which emit ultraviolet light, with more cost-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) lights, which emit less ultraviolet radiation. This reduction in ultraviolet light may cause declines in insect densities in cities, predatory fast-flying bats, and some edge-foraging and slow-flying bats. Capitalising on a scheme to update streetlights from high ultraviolet mercury vapour to low ultraviolet LED in Sydney, Australia, we measured the activity of individual bat species, the activity of different functional groups and the bat and insect communities, before and after the change in technology. We also surveyed sites with already LED lights, sites with mercury vapour lights and unlit bushland remnants. Species adapted to foraging in cluttered vegetation, and some edge-space foraging species, were more active in unlit bushland sites than in all lit sites and decreased in activity at lit sites after the change to LED lights. The change to LED streetlights caused a decrease in the fast-flying Chalinolobus gouldii but not Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis, the latter being more influenced by seasonal and environmental variables. Insect biomass was not affected by changing light types, but instead was negatively correlated with the moon's percentage illuminance. Changing streetlights to LEDs could result in a decline in some insectivorous bats in cities. This study confirms that unlit urban bushland remnants are important refuges for high bat diversity, particularly for more clutter-adapted species and some edge-space foraging species. Preventing light penetration into unlit bushland patches and corridors remains essential to protect the urban bat community.

TI  - Hedgerows as Ecosystems: Service Delivery, Management, and Restoration
PY  - 2020
AB  - Hedge density, structure, and function vary with primary production and slope gradient and are subject to other diverse factors. Hedgerows are emerging ecosystems with both above- and belowground components. Functions of hedges can be categorized as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ecosystem services; these functions include food production, noncrop food and wood production, firewood production, pollination, pest control, soil conservation and quality improvement, mitigation of water flux and availability, carbon sequestration, landscape connectivity and character maintenance, and contributions to biodiversity. Urban hedges provide a relatively equitable microclimate and critical connections between green spaces and enhance human health and well-being through contact with biodiversity. Soil and water conservation are well researched in tropical hedges but less is known about their contribution to pollination, pest control, and biodiversity. Establishing a minimum hedge width and longer intervals between cutting of temperate hedges would enhance biosecurity and promote carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Hedges have a global role in mitigating biodiversity loss and climate change, which restoration should maximize, notwithstanding regional character.

TI  - Agricultural subsistence, land use and long-distance mobility within the Early Bronze Age southern Levant: Archaeobotanical evidence from the urban site of Tell es-Safi/Gath
PY  - 2021
AB  - The ongoing discussion on the nature of the organization of Early Bronze Age settlements and their social structure in an intensely settled part of the southern Levant (independent 'city-states' vs 'neither cities nor states') calls for data on which to base our understanding of shared economic patterns and regional connections. Here, we report the results of our macrobotanical investigation of the Early Bronze Age III (2,680-2,600 cal BCE) levels at Tell es-Safi/Gath, a large fortified settlement in central Canaan. A dense residential neighborhood was sampled at high resolution for a multi-faceted analysis of plant use in order to address its economic strategies and regional relationships. The resulting rich and diverse plant assemblage enables reconstruction of the diversity of agriculture, fuel sources, land use practices, mobility, and connectivity. Results of the study provide, for the first time, direct botanical evidence for the structural patterns of an intensive localized agro-pastoral economy and enable comparative analysis of the regional diet. Moreover, the results shed light on rare yet continuous long-distance plant dispersal and human mobility across biogeographical boundaries within the southern Levant.

TI  - The social connectivity of urban rivers
PY  - 2017
AB  - By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other riversfor hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation. The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of 'closeness' of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15 m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers similar to 50 to similar to 200 m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a 'lively' atmosphere. At widths over similar to 200 m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaldng in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity. In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Do We Need More Urban Green Space to Alleviate PM2.(5) Pollution? A Case Study inWuhan, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban green space can help to reduce PM2.5 concentration by absorption and deposition processes. However, few studies have focused on the historical influence of green space on PM2.5 at a fine grid scale. Taking the central city of Wuhan as an example, this study has analyzed the spatiotemporal trend and the relationship between green space and PM2.5 in the last two decades. The results have shown that: (1) PM2.5 concentration reached a maximum value (139 mu g/m(3)) in 2010 and decreased thereafter. Moran's I index values of PM2.5 were in a downward trend, which indicates a sparser distribution; (2) from 2000 to 2019, the total area of green space decreased by 25.83%. The reduction in larger patches, increment in land cover diversity, and less connectivity led to fragmented spatial patterns of green space; and (3) the regression results showed that large patches of green space significantly correlated with PM2.5 concentration. The land use/cover diversity negatively correlated with the PM2.5 concentration in the ordinary linear regression. In conclusion, preserving large native natural habitats can be a supplemental measure to enlarge the air purification function of the green space. For cities in the process of PM2.5 reduction, enhancing the landscape patterns of green space provides a win-win solution to handle air pollution and raise human well-being.

TI  - A multi-method approach for analyzing hierarchical genetic structures: a case study with cougars Puma concolor
PY  - 2014
AB  - Genetic data are increasingly used to describe the structure of wildlife populations and to infer landscape influences on functional connectivity. To accomplish this, genetic structure can be described with a multitude of methods that vary in their assumptions, advantages and limitations. While some methods discriminate distinct subpopulations separated by sharp genetic boundaries (i.e. barrier detection or clustering methods), other methods estimate gradient genetic structures using individual-based genetic distances. We present an analytical framework based on individual ancestry values that combines these different approaches and can be used to a) test for local barriers to gene flow and b) evaluate effects of landscape gradients through individual-based genetic distances that account for hierarchical genetic structure. We illustrate the approach with a data set of 371 cougars Puma concolor from a 217 000 km(2) study area in Idaho and western Montana (USA) that were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci. Results suggest that cougars in the region show a complex, hierarchical genetic structure that is influenced by a local barrier to gene flow (an urban population cluster connected by high traffic volumes), different landscape features (the Snake River Plain, forested habitat), and geographic distance. Our novel approach helped to elucidate the relative influence of these factors on different hierarchical levels of population structure, which was not possible when using either clustering methods or standard genetic distances. Results obtained with our analytical framework highlight the need for multi-scale management of cougars in the region and show that landscape heterogeneity can create complex genetic structures, even in generalist species with high dispersal capabilities.

TI  - Ten years of pulling: Ecosystem recovery after long-term weed management in Garry oak savanna
PY  - 2019
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is the practice of assisting recovery in degraded ecological communities. The aims of restoration are typically broad, involving the reinstatement of composition, structure, function, and resilience to disturbances. One common restoration tactic in degraded urban systems is to control invasive species, relying on passive restoration for further ecosystem-level recovery. Here, we test whether this is an effective restoration strategy in Garry oak savanna, a highly threatened and ecologically important community in the North American Pacific Northwest. In urban savanna patches surrounding Victoria, British Columbia, community members have been actively removing aggressive invasive exotic species for over a decade. Based on vegetation surveys from 2007, we tested ecosystem changes in structure, composition, and resilience (i.e., functional redundancy and response diversity) across 10 years of varied management levels. We expected higher levels of invasive species management would correspond with improvements to these ecosystem metrics. However, management explained little of the patterns found over the 10-year-period. Woody encroachment was a complicated process of native and exotic invasion, while resilience and compositional changes were most closely tied with landscape connectivity. Thus, though invasive species management may prevent further degradation, active restoration strategies after removal are likely required for recovery of the ecosystem.

TI  - Urban ecology in a developing world: why advanced socioecological theory needs Africa
PY  - 2013
AB  - Socioecological theory, developed through the study of urban environments, has recently led to a proliferation of research focusing on comparative analyses of cities. This research emphasis has been concentrated in the more developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere (often referred to as the \"Global North\"), yet urbanization is now occurring mostly in the developing world, with the fastest rates of growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Countries like South Africa are experiencing a variety of land-cover changes that may challenge current assumptions about the differences between urban and rural environments and about the connectivity of these dynamic socioecological systems. Furthermore, questions concerning ecosystem services, landscape preferences, and conservation - when analyzed through rural livelihood frameworks - may provide insights into the social and ecological resilience of human settlements. Increasing research on urban development processes occurring in Africa, and on patterns of kinship and migration in the less developed countries of the \"Global South\", will advance a more comprehensive worldview of how future urbanization will influence the progress of sustainable societies.

TI  - Ecosystem services provided by urban ponds and green spaces: a detailed study of a semi-natural site with global importance for research
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ponds and the adjacent green spaces are an important part of urban blue-green Infrastructure (BGI) and contribute to a number of ecosystem services, including alleviation of flood risk, amelioration of climatic fluctuations, and improvement of runoff water quality, as well as biodiversity and amenity values. Multiple benefits associated with urban ponds have only recently started to be appreciated, and examples of in-depth interdisciplinary insights remain rare. This paper gives an account of the ecosystem services provided by Blackford Pond, a semi-natural water body located within a nature reserve and nominated as a site globally important for scientific research. Despite elevated levels of polluting substances and eutrophication, the overall species richness of the site is high and the biodiversity of the locality is enhanced by the ecotone effect. The diversity of available plant hosts and substrates appears to benefit the fungal community and the abundance of aquatic invertebrate fauna appears to benefit the higher trophic levels. Hydrological modelling clearly shows that the pond increases the flood resilience of the surrounding area, despite not having been designed as a drainage feature. The application of the Natural Capital Planning Tool (NCPT) also reveals higher values (in relation to the values of amenity grassland) of such ecosystem services categories as biodiversity (+4.76 per hectare), aesthetic values (+4.67), flood risk regulation (+0.41), air quality (+0.28), local (+0.6) and global (+0.14) climate regulations. The discussion highlights a number of trade-offs among different ecosystem services (e.g. water quality vs. diatom research value, flood resilience vs. air quality and carbon capture, biodiversity of ectomycorrhizal vs. lichenised fungi), and considers which of the multiple benefits provided by the site may have not been fully reflected in NCPT calculations or the economic estimates obtained using contingent valuation (e.g. effects on hydrology, water quality, wildlife corridors, education and research value). The simultaneous consideration of biodiversity, hydrology, water chemistry and amenity, education, research and other values presented in this paper contributes towards a better understanding of the ecology and overall functioning of urban ponds, and helps to increase appreciation of their benefits and promote their public acceptability and further implementation.

TI  - Butterfly extirpations, discoveries and rediscoveries in Singapore over 28 years
PY  - 2018
AB  - Habitat loss and urbanisation in the tropics have been recognised as major drivers of species extinctions. Concurrently, novel habitats such as urban parks have been shown to be important as habitats and stepping stones in urban ecosystems around the world. However, few studies have assessed long-tenn patterns of species extinctions and discoveries in response to these drivers in the tropics. We know little about long-term persistence and utility of novel habitats in tropical urban ecosystems. In this study, we produced an updated and exhaustive butterfly checklist of species recorded from Singapore till December 2017 to investigate trends in butterfly extirpations (local extinctions), discoveries (new country records) and rediscoveries and how these relate to land use change in 28 years (1990-2017) in Singapore. Up to 144 butterfly species were identified to be extirpated in Singapore by 1990. From 1990-2017, an additional nine butterfly extirpations have potentially occurred, which suggests a maximum of 153 butterfly extirpations to date. The rate of extirpations between 1990 to 2017 (< 0.33 extirpations per year) was much lower than the rate of extirpations between 1926 to 1989 (> 1.52 extirpations per year). The majority of potentially extirpated butterflies between 1990 to 2017 were species restricted to mature forests. Over this period, 51 new species were discovered, while 65 species were rediscovered, which collectively represent 24% of the total and 35% of the extant butterfly fauna of Singapore. Interestingly, 33% of discovered species were only observed in degraded secondary forests or urban parks in Singapore, the former maturing with age and the latter having increased in area during the same time period. We hypothesise that the current slowdown in butterfly extirpations may be representative of habitat recovery and/or improved habitat connectivity, lower undetected extirpations, and/or lengthening of extinction debts. A slowdown in extirpations and an increased utilisation of novel habitats by discovered species present a window of conservation opportunity to restore native habitats and increase habitat connectivity among existing patches of managed vegetation.

TI  - Assessing the landscape and ecological quality of urban green spaces in a compact city
PY  - 2014
AB  - The interrelated nature of landscape metrics calls for their joint application in analyzing complicated landscape patterns and associated ecological processes. Using geographic information system, remote-sensing and factor-analysis techniques, the landscape patterns of urban green spaces (UGS) in the compact city of Hong Kong were analyzed for their landscape-ecological quality in different land uses and districts. Using the Fragstat software, some key indices were selected to characterize the landscape mosaic with reference to patch size, patch shape, proximity relationship and edge configuration. Some old districts have smaller and more heterogeneous UGS than newer ones due to relatively low-quality landscape attributes. The landscape patterns of UGS have not improved with old-town renewal and new-town developments. In land uses with less human disturbance, UGS tend to be larger, and more homogeneous to enhance ecosystem services, and are closer to each other with more green cover to enhance connectivity and facilitate movements of organisms and people between proximal patches. Furthermore, vegetation-dominated land uses often have more complicated and hence longer UGS edges than other land uses to augment interfacial benefits. Of the 11 land uses, Government, institution and community and open space have more complicated UGS edges than more human-dominated types. The findings could inform the landscape-pattern design of UGS in compact cities to optimize their ecological qualities and benefits to both nature and residents, and to reinforce urban nature conservation.

TI  - Roadless and Low-Traffic Areas as Conservation Targets in Europe
PY  - 2011
AB  - With increasing road encroachment, habitat fragmentation by transport infrastructures has been a serious threat for European biodiversity. Areas with no roads or little traffic (\"roadless and low-traffic areas\") represent relatively undisturbed natural habitats and functioning ecosystems. They provide many benefits for biodiversity and human societies (e.g., landscape connectivity, barrier against pests and invasions, ecosystem services). Roadless and low-traffic areas, with a lower level of anthropogenic disturbances, are of special relevance in Europe because of their rarity and, in the context of climate change, because of their contribution to higher resilience and buffering capacity within landscape ecosystems. An analysis of European legal instruments illustrates that, although most laws aimed at protecting targets which are inherent to fragmentation, like connectivity, ecosystem processes or integrity, roadless areas are widely neglected as a legal target. A case study in Germany underlines this finding. Although the Natura 2000 network covers a significant proportion of the country (16%), Natura 2000 sites are highly fragmented and most low-traffic areas (75%) lie unprotected outside this network. This proportion is even higher for the old Federal States (western Germany), where only 20% of the low-traffic areas are protected. We propose that the few remaining roadless and low-traffic areas in Europe should be an important focus of conservation efforts; they should be urgently inventoried, included more explicitly in the law and accounted for in transport and urban planning. Considering them as complementary conservation targets would represent a concrete step towards the strengthening and adaptation of the Natura 2000 network to climate change.

TI  - Influence of urbanization on riparian forest diversity and structure in the Georgia Piedmont, US
PY  - 2008
AB  - Riparian forests are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. This study examined the relationships between landscape characteristics and woody plant diversity, structure, and composition of small order riparian corridors along an urban-rural land use gradient in the Georgia Piedmont, US. Riparian plant diversity, structure, and composition were related to landscape metrics and land use. Species richness was negatively associated with impervious surfaces and landscape diversity, and positively associated with forest cover and largest forest patch index. Shannon species diversity was strongly related to the biomass of non-native species, especially for the regeneration layer. Urban sites were characterized by high richness of non-native and pioneer species. Developing sites were dominated by the non-native shrub, Ligustrum sinense Lour., and several native overstory trees, mainly Acer negundo L. While agricultural and managed forest sites were composed of ubiquitous species, unmanaged forest sites had a structurally distinct midstory indicative of reduced disturbance. Urban and agricultural land uses showed decreased native stem densities and signs of overstory tree regeneration failure. Results from this study highlight the impact of the surrounding landscape matrix upon riparian forest plant diversity and structure.

TI  - Contrasting effects of mangroves and armoured shorelines on fish assemblages in tropical estuarine seascapes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Coastal seascapes are composed of a diversity of habitats that are linked in space and time by the movement of organisms. The context and configuration of coastal ecosystems shapes many important properties of animal assemblages, but potential seascape effects of natural and artificial habitats on nearby habitats are typically considered in isolation. We test whether, and how, the seascape context of natural and urban habitats modified fish assemblages across estuaries. Fish were sampled with underwater videos in five habitat types (mangroves, rock bars, log snags, unvegetated sediments, armoured shorelines) in 17 estuaries in eastern Australia. Different habitats supported distinct fish assemblages, but the spatial context of mangroves and armoured shorelines had pervasive ecological effects that extended across entire estuaries. In most estuarine habitats, fish diversity and abundance was greatest when they were in close proximity of mangroves, and decreased due to the proximity of armoured shorelines. Many cities are centred on estuaries, and urban expansion is often associated with the fragmentation of mangrove forests. Our findings emphasize that these transformations of urban estuarine landscapes are likely to propagate to broader ecological impacts detectable in multiple habitats beyond mangrove forests.

TI  - Habitat recovery and restoration in aquatic ecosystems: current progress and future challenges
PY  - 2016
AB  - 1. Aquatic ecosystems are degraded by a variety of pressures as a result of the growing human population. Global-scale impacts include homogenization of biological communities, removal of top predators and ecosystem engineers, chemical pollution by excess nutrients and contaminants as well as deteriorating structural diversity, connectivity and process dynamics. There is a pressing societal need to reverse the decline in biodiversity and replace lost ecosystem functioning and services in aquatic ecosystems by enabling natural recovery or by active restoration. 2. Common concepts and approaches for conservation, recovery and restoration in freshwater and marine ecosystems, aided by recent advances in ecological theory, include decision criteria on priorities for conservation, harnessing natural recovery by cessation of impacts, restoring connectivity and meso-habitat diversity as well as the geomorphological structural template including hydrodynamic processes. Re-oligotrophication at catchment or regional sea-scale benefits from integrating freshwater and marine restoration. Species or assemblages that convey biogenic structure or act as ecosystem engineers and keystone species should be given priority. Top-down control can be reinstated in closed systems. 3. Differences between freshwater and marine ecosystems include the greater spatial restriction of many species in fresh water, the importance of rooted vegetation and insects in freshwater, and the much greater dispersal and connectivity in marine systems. These differences dictate different approaches, with more scope for active restoration work in fresh water and harnessing natural recovery in marine systems. 4. Restoration schemes need clearly defined target states. They should generally take a process-oriented and stepwise adaptive management approach judging success against reference or control sites. Societal and political expectations need to be managed and restoration schemes should not promise too much. Even minor rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems can put back some biodiversity and key services. Sometimes 'Ersatz'-ecosystems are better than nothing and the best that can be achieved, especially in urban settings. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - DO WE NEED PROTECTIVE PLANTATIONS ALONG RAILWAYS (LITHUANIAN CASE STUDY)?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Differently to other European countries Lithuania has inherited from Soviet time period quite width protection zones of state importance with wooden plantations along railways. Those protection zones vary from 20 m (in cities) up to 45-70 m (in rural areas) in one side. The planted or spontaneous wooden plantations within those zones occupy over 2 thous. ha. The status of protective plantations serve for multifunctional purposes by ensuring railway traffic safety, mitigating negative impact of railway traffic, exhibiting Lithuanian landscape for travellers, improving landscape connectivity, living and working environment quality. At the same time there is a challenge for proper management of those plantations and profitability. In the middle of XX century planted pioneer species reach or is going to reach mature age. There is the threat of increasing number of dangerous trees, challenge for ensuring continuous cover of protective plantations, their services and structure match for predominating function. This study presents the challenges for future development and society preferences to services of protective lineside plantations along railways. The results of analysis of present condition of railway lineside vegetation, as well the results of social survey showed, what it is not enough just to manage the dangerous trees for railway safeness but it is essential complex means for protective plantations development, services succession.

TI  - Landscape factors affecting the distribution of the great tit in fragmented urban forests of Seoul, South Korea
PY  - 2016
AB  - Seoul City, as the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea, has high population density, and its remaining forests are extremely fragmented as a result of intensive development. The purpose of this study is to analyze the distribution of the great tit (Parus major) and develop a habitat model. Tits have been known as forest birds that inhabit urban forests in Seoul City. A Seoul biotope map and land cover map were combined, and the urban forest areas were delineated on these maps. As factors affecting the distribution of the great tit, landscape indices were calculated by separating them into intrapatch indices, namely logged patch area (PA), area-weighted mean patch shape index (PSI), tree rate (TR), and tree area (TA), and interpatch indices, namely patch degree (PD), patch betweenness (PB), patch proximity (PP), and difference probability of connectivity (DPC), to analyze the internal properties of the patches and their connectivity by tit occurrence data. The results of a t test analyzing the differences of habitat variables by great tit presence/absence and distribution showed differences in PA (p < 0.05), PSI (p < 0.001), TR (p < 0.01), TA (p < 0.001), PD (p < 0.05), PB (p < 0.01), PP (p < 0.05), and DPC (p < 0.1). In the results of logistic regression modeling, in most cases, more than one model had Delta AICc less than 2.0, suggesting that multiple models may be the best model. In the comprehensive models, the TR, PB, and DPC metrics were the best predictors. Among all variables in the intrahabitat model, PSI was the best predictor of species occurrence. Within the interhabitat model, DPC was the best predictor and had a positive relationship with species occurrence, which is the most important of all the factors. In other words, the great tit is more likely to be found in a large circular forest patch than a small and long-shaped forest patch, and connectivity in the threshold distance is the most important factor in predicting great tit occurrence. These results suggest that ecological potential, not only \"location potential\" but also \"supply potential,\" should be considered in fragmented urban forests.

TI  - Emerging Practices in public space projects: the case of via Argentina in Panama City
PY  - 2021
AB  - This article uses an urban intervention in Panama City to discuss fundamental concepts in public space projects from a critical and theoretical perspective. First, the functions of the street as a basic structure of public space are illustrated. Its importance is recognized not only as an element of urban connectivity, but also as a place of movement, encounter, support and creation of urban meanings and social identities. Secondly, our case study is contextualized: the urban renewal of via Argentina, a street in the urban center whose environment was in a state of degradation like most streets in the city, largely occupied by the presence of vehicles. The intervention is part of a series of urban projects aimed at improving the physical structure of the city. The third section begins a critical analysis of the actions on Via Argentina, starting with the redistribution of street space, the relationship between vehicles and pedestrians, and the consolidation of public space. Next, we discuss in detail the new primary elements used for the urbanization of the street. Curbs, fords, pavement, rigola, gutters, tree surrounds and bollards become part of a system that must maintain a coherent relationship between all its parts. In addition, emphasis is placed on the design of the ground and the application of the pavement as a tool for the construction of an urban image and identity. Finally, the article ends with an analysis of the parameters of accessibility in the project, relating the concept to the use of the pavement and the configuration in some sections of the street as a single platform. The article uses a wide repertoire of documentary photography to contextualize the case study.

TI  - Ruins of the smart city: a visual intervention
PY  - 2020
AB  - The visual imaginary of the future city is increasingly dichotomized between visions of hyper-technological digital urbanism and the city in a state of ruin, without people, overtaken by nature. These alternating imaginaries key into concerns over urban futures, as questions of sustainability and rising inequality come to bear on urban life. Such binary imaginaries produce volumes of visual material, lauding and critiquing philosophies of newness, endless progress and the city without decline. This article uses an inventive visual methodology to ask how these imaginaries become situated in the everyday ecologies of living. This methodology focuses on several so-called 'brownfield' sites in Salford, UK, and the 'smart' Oxford Road Corridor in neighbouring Manchester, to playfully and visually map the entanglement of digital urban ecologies through the themes of wilderness, play and compost. These three themes relate to the pleasure of urban wilderness described by Rose Macaulay, reflecting on London's wild ruins after the Second World War; the playful contrast between smart urbanism and urban wastelands, understood through interdisciplinary visual methods; and Haraway's notion of compost as the fertile ground of collaboration that marks a material-semiotic entanglement between place, people and nature. The authors investigate how these frameworks reflect the diversity of urban ecology (animals, plants and humans) and might provide an alternative vision of how the city could be, a vision built from how the city currently is.

TI  - Butterflies and diurnal moths along road verges: Does road type affect diversity and abundance?
PY  - 2005
AB  - Roadsides form potential habitats for several grassland species adapted to regular mowing management. We studied the communities of butterflies and day-active moths in 51 sites along the verges of the three road types, i.e., highways, urban roads and rural roads. Despite different traffic densities and widths of the road and verge, the groups were rather similar with regard to soil properties, vegetation structure and mowing intensity. The species richness and total abundance of butterflies (53 species, 5964 individuals) and diurnal moths (46 species, 4626 individuals) were also rather similar in each road type, although a preference for wider verges was observed. Butterfly diversity increased (but not significantly) from the verges of narrow rural roads to wider highways. The highest numbers of meadow species were recorded along highways and the total abundance, especially of diurnal moths, decreased in accordance with the road size. High nectar abundance was the most important factor increasing the numbers of meadow butterflies along road verges, while meadow moths were mostly favoured by shelter provided by tall vegetation. Verges surrounded by cultivated fields were generally related to low numbers of both Lepidoptera groups, whereas adjacent forests increased the total number of all species and favoured several butterflies inhabiting forest edges. The adjacent environment inflicted compositional differences on the Lepidoptera fauna of the three road types. The results indicate that road verges should be considered an important reserve for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands in Finland. A growing interest in accommodating current roadside management for conserving biodiversity is likely to benefit Lepidoptera communities in the verge habitats. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Characterizing and measuring transportation infrastructure diversity through linkages with ecological stability theory
PY  - 2019
AB  - Transportation infrastructure is critical to any community. Disturbances such as natural hazards can hinder transportation infrastructure performance impacting a community's quality of life through disruptions in service and effects on interdependent systems. Ecological systems are robust and resilient and have similarities with infrastructure systems. Diversity is a fundamental element of ecological resilience and is recognized as an important factor in transportation resilience. However, measures of transportation diversity are not well-developed. Accordingly, this paper adapts the ecological diversity concepts of richness and evenness to develop an approach to characterize transportation system diversity and distinguishes the approach from existing methods. Measures of transportation functional richness and evenness are derived and applied to New York City at the zip code level. The results facilitate identification of zip codes in New York City with varying levels of transportation diversity. Those zip codes with low diversity generally have limited availability (low richness) and disproportionate distribution (low evenness) of alternative transportation modes. Further, these zip codes are potentially susceptible to system disturbances as a consequence of routine disruptions or natural hazards. For instance, many low diversity zip codes are in hurricane evacuation zones. Limited complementarity in the transportation system of these zip codes will likely impact evacuations during hurricanes and recovery to pre-disturbance performance levels. Ultimately, the transportation diversity approach presented should lead to better understanding of transportation system characteristics such as inherent and augmented complementarity, which will enhance transportation system performance in urban communities.

TI  - Differential response of migratory guilds of birds to park area and urbanization
PY  - 
AB  - Variation in species richness and density of native birds in urban parks and greenspaces (\"parks\") is often substantial. Understanding why differences exist, and whether all migratory guilds are equally affected, is poorly known. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 48 undeveloped forested parks in Portland, Oregon, USA, to determine the contributions of park area, shape, connectivity, landscape composition surrounding parks, and differences in structure/composition of local habitat to variation in richness and density of residents, long-distance migrants, and short-distance/partial migrants. Migratory guilds responded differently to environmental factors. Richness and density of long-distance migrants increased with park area and abundance of small (< 10 cm DBH), mostly native, tree species. Resident richness also increased with the abundance of small trees. However, resident and short-distance/partial migrant richness was independent of park area, and resident density declined with increasing area. Park shape, connectivity, and landscape composition did not influence richness or density of any migratory guilds, possibly because of relatively high tree cover in Portland's landscape. Separate analyses of forest-dependent species of all migratory guilds revealed that area was the primary contributor to variation in density of residents and long-distance migrants, structural habitat features contributed to variation in density of residents but not long-distance migrants, and that density of long-distance migrants declined with elongated park shape. Few forest-dependent species existed in parks below 10 ha, and their minimum area requirements for maintaining populations were estimated to be 30 to 40 ha. Without such parks most long-distance migrants would likely disappear from Portland's landscape.

TI  - Unexpected Gene-Flow in Urban Environments: The Example of the European Hedgehog
PY  - 2020
AB  - Simple Summary An urban environment holds many barriers for mammals with limited mobility such as hedgehogs. These barriers appear often unsurmountable (e.g., rivers, highways, fences) and thus hinder contact between hedgehogs, leading to genetic isolation. In our study we tested whether these barriers affect the hedgehog population of urban Berlin, Germany. As Berlin has many of these barriers, we were expecting a strong genetic differentiation among hedgehog populations. However, when we looked at unrelated individuals, we did not see genetic differentiation among populations. The latter was only detected when we included related individuals too, a 'family clan' structure that is referred to as gamodemes. We conclude that the high percentage of greenery in Berlin provides sufficient habitat for hedgehogs to maintain connectivity across the city. We use the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a mammal with limited mobility, as a model species to study whether the structural matrix of the urban environment has an influence on population genetic structure of such species in the city of Berlin (Germany). Using ten established microsatellite loci we genotyped 143 hedgehogs from numerous sites throughout Berlin. Inclusion of all individuals in the cluster analysis yielded three genetic clusters, likely reflecting spatial associations of kin (larger family groups, known as gamodemes). To examine the potential bias in the cluster analysis caused by closely related individuals, we determined all pairwise relationships and excluded close relatives before repeating the cluster analysis. For this data subset (N = 65) both clustering algorithms applied (Structure, Baps) indicated the presence of a single genetic cluster. These results suggest that the high proportion of green patches in the city of Berlin provides numerous steppingstone habitats potentially linking local subpopulations. Alternatively, translocation of individuals across the city by hedgehog rescue facilities may also explain the existence of only a single cluster. We therefore propose that information about management activities such as releases by animal rescue centres should include location data (as exactly as possible) regarding both the collection and the release site, which can then be used in population genetic studies.

TI  - LEFTA web-based tool for the remote measurement and estimation of ecological value across global landscapes
PY  - 2018
AB  - The overall aim in the development of the Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT) was to design a web-based tool that could provide quickly obtained quantitative data on ecological risk to assist landowners when making land-use change decisions. The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool works for almost any region in the world and uses freely available satellite imagery, biotic and abiotic data from existing global databases, models and algorithms to deliver a customised report for a selected area within one hour of job submission. Biotic data automatically obtained for a selected landscape includes terrestrial vertebrate and plant species occurrence data, information on their conservation status and remotely sensed vegetation productivity. Abiotic information obtained includes temperature, precipitation, water availability, insolation, topography, elevation, distribution of urban infrastructure and location of wetlands. The tool performs a number of analyses on the biotic and abiotic data to produce maps for the selected area at a 30m resolution depicting land cover type, numbers of globally threatened terrestrial vertebrate and plant species, beta-diversity of terrestrial vertebrates and plants, habitat intactness, wetland habitat connectivity, numbers of migratory species and vegetation resilience. Results are also aggregated to produce a summary map demonstrating areas of high and low ecological risk across the selected area. The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool has been designed to be intuitive to use, requiring no specialised software or user expertise. Input is extremely easy and requires the user to highlight the area of interest on a map or using grid co-ordinates. Output is delivered via the web application and comprises a customised PDF containing the maps and a zip file of geographical information system (GIS) data for the area requested. Users may run an unlimited number of LEFT analyses and download reports free of charge. In addition to the free tool described in this paper, there is also a paid service: individual LEFT analyses can be upgraded for a charge to allow access to the geographically subsetted datasets generated for each report. These data are supplied as a zip file containing raster datasets for the layers in the LEFT analysis in GeoTIFF format. These can be opened and queried in a GIS software package.

TI  - To Preserve Green Buffer under Polarization and Diffusion Effects of a Fast-Developing Megalopolis
PY  - 2022
AB  - The polarization and diffusion effects of landscape patterns are important features of megalopolis development. Under the urbanized effects, green space is a key spatial unit in delivering vital ecosystem services for sustainable urban planning. However, currently, fast urban developing is swamping the green space. In this study, by tracing landscape pattern changes of a fast-developing megalopolis, the Chengdu-Chongqing Megalopolis in the southeast of China, and using land-use data from 1980 to 2020, we aimed to determine the polarization and diffusion effects of the megalopolis and their impacts on the green space within and between the cities. We found that: (1) during the past four decades, spatial expansion of the megalopolis mainly occupied grassland and farmland, triggering an increase in landscape fragmentation; (2) based on socio-economic indicators, the spatialattraction network analysis showed a significant polarization effect; however, based on the natural landscape, this analysis demonstrated a more scattered pattern; (3) importantly, the megalopolis developed at quite a similar pace, which caused the green rural area between the central cities demonstrating an encroached trend by the urbanization. To promote sustainability of the fast-developing megalopolis, we suggest that the boundary of the green space should be broadened to form a green network in which natural green space and urban green space are interconnected, improving the connectivity of habitats within the megalopolis for urban biodiversity. Our study implied that maintaining the green buffer shall be considered in advance for sustainable megaregional planning and establishing resilience of the fast-developing megalopolis.

TI  - The winter bird community of river corridors in eastern England in relation to habitat variables
PY  - 2006
AB  - Most river corridors have been highly modified and managed but they still support diverse assemblages of birds. To aid conservation it is important to know which river corridor habitats support the greatest diversity and numbers of bird species. All birds were counted on three occasions in winter along 50 one kin stretches of lowland rivers in eastern England, and habitat variables were recorded. A total of 81 species was recorded. Species richness was greatest on tidal stretches of river, followed by urban/amenity sites, with lowest richness on rural stretches. Mute Swans, Mallards and Moorhens were significantly more numerous at urban/amenity stretches and were scarce or absent in headwater reaches. Three terrestrial species also occurred in significantly greater numbers in urban/amenity stretches. No species was significantly more numerous in rural stretches. TWINSPAN analysis separated out tidal and urban/amenity stretches, while bird species were separated into those associated with riparian trees and shrubs, and those of more open stretches, with further groups associated with wider rivers and the tidal stretches. A CANOCO analysis showed river width to be the most significant factor explaining bird distributions, followed by presence of floodbanks, riparian tree cover and amount of thick marginal vegetation. The rivers studied and their immediate floodplains have long been managed and modified from source and this has an overriding influence on habitat quality and on the species richness and numbers of birds utilizing any particular stretch.

TI  - Main roads and land cover shaped the genetic structure of a Mediterranean island wild boar population
PY  - 2022
AB  - Patterns of genetic differentiation within and among animal populations might vary due to the simple effect of distance or landscape features hindering gene flow. An assessment of how landscape connectivity affects gene flow can help guide management, especially in fragmented landscapes. Our objective was to analyze population genetic structure and landscape genetics of the native wild boar (Sus scrofa meridionalis) population inhabiting the island of Sardinia (Italy), and test for the existence of Isolation-by-Distance (IBD), Isolation-by-Barrier (IBB), and Isolation-by-Resistance (IBR). A total of 393 Sardinian wild boar samples were analyzed using a set of 16 microsatellite loci. Signals of genetic introgression from introduced non-native wild boars or from domestic pigs were revealed by a Bayesian cluster analysis including 250 reference individuals belonging to European wild populations and domestic breeds. After removal of introgressed individuals, genetic structure in the population was investigated by different statistical approaches, supporting a partition into five discrete subpopulations, corresponding to five geographic areas on the island: north-west (NW), central west (CW), south-west (SW), north-central east (NCE), and south-east (SE). To test the IBD, IBB, and IBR hypotheses, we optimized resistance surfaces using genetic algorithms and linear mixed-effects models with a maximum likelihood population effects parameterization. Landscape genetics analyses revealed that genetic discontinuities between subpopulations can be explained by landscape elements, suggesting that main roads, urban settings, and intensively cultivated areas are hampering gene flow (and thus individual movements) within the Sardinian wild boar population. Our results reveal how human-transformed landscapes can affect genetic connectivity even in a large-sized and highly mobile mammal such as the wild boar, and provide crucial information to manage the spread of pathogens, including the African Swine Fever virus, endemic in Sardinia.

TI  - Wetland Network Design for Mitigation of Saltwater Intrusion by Transferring Tidal Discharge
PY  - 2012
AB  - With the interactions of river discharge and tide, the balances between water and saline in estuaries are helpful for maintaining biodiversity and landscape diversity. However, the delicate balances have been broken in many estuaries especially in some areas where prosperous cities have been developed. Saltwater intrusion causes serious adverse effects on estuary ecosystems in Pearl River estuary (PRE), China. This paper tries to use a wetland network which is a methodology to divert saltwater to explain how to address the adverse effects of saltwater intrusion and aims to mitigate such intrusion. The existing wetland patches and corridors are connected and form a wetland network with structural and functional connectivity. The patches in the wetland network are assigned to attributes that represent storage capacity of wetlands, and the corridors are assigned to attributes that represent water flow of channels. The results demonstrated that the saltwater intrusion length follows a linear relationship with tidal discharge in the southern part of Guangzhou (SPG, a part of PRE). When the upstream discharge changed slightly, saltwater intrusion cannot be effectively mitigated merely by diverting water from river channels to wetland network during spring tides. This paper provides new insight for management of saltwater intrusion in estuaries.

TI  - Trait-based approaches for understanding how biodiversity generates sustainable benefits in urban vegetated green infrastructure
PY  - 2022
AB  - While it is appreciated that the biodiversity within vegetated green infrastructure generates ecosystem services that improve the well-being of urban residents, advances in urban sustainability are hindered because we lack a solid mechanistic understanding of how biodiversity provides these services. Here, we outline a trait-based urban ecology agenda for researching how species' traits provide ecosystem services (trait-service relationships) in tandem with how species with desired service-providing traits establish in vegetated green infrastructure (community assembly). Because trait-service relationships and community assembly processes can differ in urban versus natural environments, this agenda will fill major knowledge gaps of how biodiversity promotes urban sustainability. Results from our research agenda can be implemented by planners and managers to enhance service provisioning and ultimately improve urban sustainability.

TI  - Habitat filtering and adult dispersal determine the taxonomic composition of stream insects in an urbanizing landscape
PY  - 2015
AB  - Suitability of the local habitat (habitat filtering') and dispersal between stream reaches determines the composition of insect communities, and urban land use may affect both processes. While urban streams are often poor habitats for insects and dispersal between them is often hindered, conservation and restoration activities generally focus solely on the local (in-stream) environment. We determined whether in-stream habitat filtering (a local' process) or dispersal between reaches (a regional' process) controlled assemblage composition in a landscape subject to ongoing urban development (urbanizing'). We compared models incorporating geographic distance between sites, environmental dissimilarity, and land-use/land-cover attributes of dispersal pathways in an attempt to explain the dissimilarity of stream insect assemblages. Distance and land-use/land-cover attributes were characterised along both overland (straight line) and corridor pathways. Both in-stream habitat filtering and dispersal affected assemblage composition, but habitat had a stronger influence. Overland distance was a better predictor of assemblage dissimilarity than corridor distance, implying stream insect dispersal occurs across catchment boundaries as well as along stream corridors. The best model incorporated land-use/land-cover attributes along dispersal pathways, which supported the idea that urban land-use in the terrestrial environment mediates dispersal. Conservation and restoration strategies for streams in urbanizing landscapes that focus on local habitat quality and ignore dispersal are missing a potentially important mechanism affecting insect assemblage composition. While the primary focus should be on maintaining or improving the local habitat, potential dispersal pathways should also be considered.

TI  - Management of urban waterways in Melbourne, Australia: 2 - integration and future directions
PY  - 
AB  - This paper continues the analysis of the management of urban waterways in Greater Melbourne, Australia, commenced with our first paper. We focus first on the increasing emphasis on waterways and their corridors as part of Melbourne's liveability, and then on the future management of waterways and their corridors in the face of the three most pressing future challenges - climate change, population increase, and urban expansion and densification. The long history of the development of parks, gardens and open spaces in Melbourne is reviewed. These open-spaces initially occurred with quite strong linkage to the waterways, enabled by the city's unique institutional arrangements, but were substantially weakened as a result of policy and governance reforms in the 1990s. Melbourne will need to substantially improve the integration of the management of urban waterways and their corridors with the planning, development and management of the city's associated green spaces if it is to achieve the expected community liveability standards in the face of the above three future challenges. Additionally, if waterway management remains with the existing agency (Melbourne Water), the authorising environment and the culture and mindset of this agency will need to change its focus from the current 'city servicing' institutional model to a 'city shaping' model.

TI  - Matrix mediates avian movements in tropical forested landscapes: Inference from experimental translocations
PY  - 2010
AB  - Maintaining animal movement in fragmented landscapes depends upon the levels of connectivity among habitat patches, which in turn may depend upon the landscape matrix. Little is known about how the matrix affects dispersal abilities, in part because few experimental tests have been conducted. We experimentally translocated 142 migratory American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) and resident Jamaican Todies (Todus todus) 0.6-4 km from their territories across landscapes fragmented by pen-urban development and bauxite mining and continuous forest. Redstarts returned more rapidly and with greater success than todies across all landscapes, with 95% of redstarts returning in an average of 2.5 days versus 60% of todies in >20 days. Return success was best predicted by translocation distance for redstarts and by sex for todies, with a trend of fewer birds returning when released in bauxite landscapes. Return time was strongly affected by matrix type, with both species returning more rapidly in a forested relative to a bauxite matrix and intermediately in a pen-urban matrix. These findings provide strong experimental evidence that land cover surrounding forested habitat influences species mobility. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Home range and habitat use of Trumpeter Hornbills Bycanistes bucinator in an urban-forest mosaic, Eshowe, South Africa
PY  - 2017
AB  - Despite the negative impacts of urbanisation, some species adapt to pressures of habitat loss and fragmentation. Trumpeter Hornbills Bycanistes bucinator are a large avian forest frugivore that uses urban environments in South Africa. Consequently, we used GPS/UHF transmitters to study their home range size, movement and habitat use in an urban-forest mosaic in Eshowe, South Africa from March to October 2014. We estimated the home range size using three methods: minimum convex polygon (MCP), kernel density estimation (KDE) and local convex hull (LoCoH). Our results showed that overall monthly home range size was 5.1 +/- 1.28 km(2) (mean +/- SE; 95% MCP), 4.6 +/- 1.14 km(2) (95% KDE) and 1.9 +/- 0. 46 km(2) (95% LoCoH). However, individual home range sizes varied monthly and seasonally. We found that all individuals tagged used mostly the indigenous forest and frequently utilised urban residential areas (gardens) with little or no use of cultivated land. Observed individual variations in monthly and seasonal home ranges could be a response to variations in availability of key fruit resources in the urban residential and indigenous forest mosaic. This study supports the use of more than one method of home range estimation for insight regarding home range and habitat use in urban-forest mosaics for this large forest frugivore.

TI  - Rapid Vulnerability Assessment of Lavizan Urban Forest Park
PY  - 2018
AB  - Although the vulnerability assessment of forest parks is used to determine the threats they face, a rapid and holistic framework has not been established well. The primary objective of this study is to adopt a framework for rapid assessment of forest parks vulnerability, examined in Lavizan forest park in Tehran (Iran) as the case study. The vulnerability assessment has been conducted, using the evaluation matrix on the basis of landscape and ecological values and threats. In this model, the most important values and threatening factors of the Lavizan forest park have been identified and assessed, based on the intensity of their effect as well as occurrence probability. Finally, this article proposes five strategies to reduce the vulnerability. Results from this research indicate that the most important values have been air purifcation, wildlife, flora and fauna species, environment regulation, mental health, and scientific resources and the most important threats have included reduction of habitat diversity, intensive exploitation of the resources, fire, woodcutting, and reduction of ecological connectivity. Based on these vulnerabilities, the most important strategies propose the use of affordance strategy formulation framework to preserve and enhance ecological and landscape values of the park.

TI  - Principles for management of aquatic-breeding amphibians
PY  - 2000
AB  - Coordinated efforts by ecologists and natural resource managers are necessary to balance the conservation of biological diversity with the potential for sustained economic development. Because some amphibians have suffered world-wide declines during the last 20 years, it is important to consider biologically based management strategies that will preserve local and regional populations. This paper provides a brief overview of potential threats to local and regional populations, the state of knowledge on population and landscape processes, and the critical elements needed for an effective management plan for amphibians. Local population dynamics and ecological connectivity of amphibian metapopulations must be considered in effective management plans. There are 3 critical factors to consider in a management plan (1) the number or density of individuals dispersing from individual wetlands, (2) the diversity of wetlands with regard to hydroperiod, and (3) the probability of dispersal among adjacent wetlands or the rescue and recolonization of local populations. Wetland losses reduce the total number of sites where pond-breeding amphibians can reproduce and recruit juveniles into the breeding population. Loss of small, temporary wetlands (<4.0 ha) may be especially harmful to amphibians because of their abundance and high species diversity. Alteration of wetlands, particularly hydrologic cycles, can severely impair completion of larval metamorphosis through either early pond drying (if hydroperiod is shortened) or through increased predation (if hydroperiod is lengthened or connections made with. fish-infested lakes, rivers, or canals). Wetland loss also increases the distance between neighboring wetlands that is critical to metapopulation source-sink processes. Reduction in wetland density reduces the probablity that populations will be rescued from extinction by nearby source populations. Local populations cannot be considered independent of source-sink processes that connect wetlands at the landscape or regional level. Further, the fragmentation of natural habitats From timber harvesting, agriculture, roads, drainage canals, or urban development impedes or prevents dispersal and decreases the probability of wetland recolonization. If our goal is to maintain or enhance present levels of amphibian diversity, then resource managers must incorporate critical elements into plans that protect population and landscape processes thereby maintaining viable populations and communities of amphibians.

TI  - New forces influencing savanna conservation: increasing land prices driven by gentrification and speculation at the landscape scale
PY  - 2021
AB  - Land transformation reduces biodiversity and regional sustainability, with land price being an indicator of the opportunity cost to a landowner of resisting land conversion. However, reliable spatially explicit databases of current land prices are generally lacking in developing countries. We used tools from data science to scrape 1,487 georeferenced land prices in southern Kenya from the internet. Prices were higher for land near cities and in areas of high agricultural productivity, but also around the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Predicted land prices ranged from US$662 to US$4,618,805 per acre. Land speculation associated with expanding urbanization increases the opportunity and acquisition costs of maintaining conservation buffer zones, corridors, and dispersal areas. However, high land values are also found adjacent to a world-famous tourist destination. Profit-driven turnover of ownership, subdivision, and transformation of land is occurring at a rapid pace in southern Kenya, to the detriment of savanna biodiversity and the sustainability of the pastoral social-ecological system.

TI  - An agent-based movement model to assess the impact of landscape fragmentation on disease transmission
PY  - 2014
AB  - Landscape changes can result in habitat fragmentation and reduced landscape connectivity, limiting the ability of animals to move across space and altering infectious disease dynamics in wildlife. In this study, we develop and implement an agent-based model to assess the impacts of animal movement behavior and landscape structure on disease dynamics. We model a susceptible/infective disease state system applicable to the transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus in bobcats in the urbanized landscape of coastal southern California. Our agent-based model incorporates animal movement behavior, pathogen prevalence, transmission probability, and habitat fragmentation to evaluate how these variables influence disease spread in urbanizing landscapes. We performed a sensitivity analysis by simulating the system under 4200 different combinations of model parameters and evaluating disease transmission outcomes. Our model reveals that host movement behavior and response to landscape features play a pivotal role in determining how habitat fragmentation influences disease dynamics. Importantly, interactions among habitat fragmentation and movement had non-linear and counter-intuitive effects on disease transmission. For example, the model predicts that an intermediate level of non-habitat permeability and directionality will result in the highest rates of between-patch disease transmission. Agent-based models serve as computational laboratories that provide a powerful approach for quantitatively and visually exploring the role of animal behavior and anthropogenic landscape change on contacts among agents and the spread of disease. Such questions are challenging to study empirically given that it is difficult or impossible to experimentally manipulate actual landscapes and the animals and pathogens that move through them. Modeling the relationship between habitat fragmentation, animal movement behavior, and disease spread will improve understanding of the spread of potentially destructive pathogens through wildlife populations, as well as domestic animals and humans.

TI  - Roadkill distribution at the wildland-urban interface
PY  - 2019
AB  - The growing wildland-urban interface is a frontier of human-wildlife conflict worldwide. Where natural and developed areas meet, there is potential for negative interactions between humans and wild animals, including wildlife-vehicle collisions. Understanding the environmental and anthropogenic factors leading to these collisions can inform transportation and habitat planning, with an objective of reducing animal mortality and human costs. We investigated spatial, temporal, and species-specific patterns of roadkill on Interstate-280 (I-280) in California, USA, and examined the effects of land cover, fencing, lighting, and traffic. The highway is situated just south of San Francisco, dividing a large wildlife refuge to the west from dense residential areas to the east, and therefore presents a major barrier to wildlife movement. Areas with a higher percentage of developed land east of I-280 and areas with more open space on the west side of I-280 were associated with an increase in overall roadkill, suggesting that hard boundaries at the wildland-urban interface may be zones of high risk for dispersing animals. This pattern was especially strong for raccoons (Procyon lotor) and black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus). The presence of lighting correlated with increased roadkill with the exception of coyote (Canis latrans). Contrary to our expectations, we found weak evidence that fencing increases roadkill, perhaps because animals become trapped on roadways or because fencing is not sufficient to block access to the road by wildlife. Finally, we found strong evidence for roadkill seasonality, correlated with differences in movement and dispersal across life-history stages. We highlight the value of citizen-science datasets for monitoring human-wildlife conflict and suggest potential mitigation measures to reduce the negative effects of wildlife-vehicle collisions for people and wildlife.

TI  - Urbanisation supplements ecosystem functioning in disturbed estuaries
PY  - 2018
AB  - Humans have urbanised and fragmented landscapes across the globe, with detrimental impacts to biodiversity, habitats and food webs in most biomes. Urbanisation might also modify the provision of ecological functions, but these putative effects of landscape transformation are rarely measured. Coastal cities are typically located near estuaries, and we tested for potential impacts of these on ecological functions. Our study used 22 estuaries in eastern Australia as model systems to examine how urbanisation shapes the consumption of carrion by fish, a pivotal ecological function in estuaries. Fish assemblages varied among estuaries according to the extent of shoreline hardening, and this was correlated with changes in the rate of carrion consumption. In estuaries with low levels of shoreline hardening and abundant remnant mangroves, most carrion was consumed by toadfishes (Tetraodontidae). By contrast, in moderately urban estuaries (i.e. where 20-60% of shorelines had been hardened with artificial structures) yellowfin bream (Sparidae) replaced toadfish and performed the bulk of the scavenging function. Bream are particularly effective scavengers that utilize artificial structures as habitat for both foraging and sheltering. We show that by augmenting habitat for an important species of scavenger, the moderate addition of urban structures to estuarine shorelines also helped to supplement a key ecological function in estuaries. Urbanisation impacts diversity in all ecosystems, but many opportunistic species flourish in urban habitats. Identifying and conserving taxa that perform important roles in urban environments is now a critical conservation challenge for maintaining ecological functions across disturbed landscapes.

TI  - Urban connectors. Santander Street. A transformation project for Urban Cohesion (2016)
PY  - 2018
AB  - The urban design project proposed for possible intervention in Carrer de Santander seeks to provide quality public space, due to its peripheral location and its edge character., is not properly integrated into the various spaces surrounding it. Along the street both residential and industrial zones are present. Integration problems between the street and these spaces are evident in situations such as changing number of vehicle lanes, lack of facilities, excessive use of street parking and the lack of pedestrian flow. As a result of these situations can be observed an important deterioration of sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, squares and parterres. In this sense, through the reorganization of the space, its remodeling and the construction of new facilities, the project seeks to promote urban cohesion. The renovation of the public space will not only improve the urban quality of the sector and the connectivity with the neighborhoods nearby and with the rest of the city, but will also encourage the appropriation of this space by neighbors and the general public. In order to favor urban cohesion, several specific and general interventions along the street are proposed: the widening of pavements, the construction of bicycle lanes, the implementation of urban furniture, the renovation of lighting fixtures, the reduction of areas of separation to a single lane and the planting of vegetation of a wide chromatic and olfactory range. Thus, these interventions focused on the generation of a public space that integrates the physical diversities of this and the different needs of its users. The new sports facilities will also be another measure that will seek to integrate Santander Street with the rest of the city, with the objective of supplying the lack of spaces for the practice of minority sports in Barcelona. The reorganization of the space aims to revitalize places such as the Mossen Joan Cortinas square and allow the proper use of the Molinet bridge by pedestrians and bike users.

TI  - SHRUBBY TREE COMPONENT OF RIPARIAN CORRIDORS IN RESTORATION AND NATURAL REMAINING AREAS OF MATRIX FORESTRY, RIO NEGRINHO, SC STATE
PY  - 2014
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the shrubby tree component in riparian corridors in restoration process and natural remainders in a matrix forestry. We identified the richness, diversity, dispersal and pollination syndromes of the individuals and estimate the floristic similarity. The study was conducted at the producing farm of Pinus spp. wood Santa Alice, located in Rio Negrinho city, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. We adopted the center-quarter method for survey the shrubby tree component in four sample groups: CA (advanced stage of riparian corridors vegetation), CR (riparian corridors in restoration), MA (advanced stage of natural remaining), MI (intermediate stage of natural remaining). We found the highest richness and diversity index in MA and CR. Regarding the number of individuals, the dispersal and pollination syndromes predominant in all sample groups were zoochory and zoophilia. CR and CA had the highest percentage of floristic similarity while MA and MI did not form clusters. The sample group CR has composition, richness and diversity more similar to CA. This indicates that the restoration of riparian zones has conditions to rescue the components and the interactions of an ecological community.

TI  - Can Orchards Help Connect Mediterranean Ecosystems? Animal Movement Data Alter Conservation Priorities
PY  - 2015
AB  - As natural habitats become fragmented by human activities, animals must increasingly move through human-dominated systems, particularly agricultural landscapes. Mapping areas important for animal movement has therefore become a key part of conservation planning. Models of landscape connectivity are often parameterized using expert opinion and seldom distinguish between the risks and barriers presented by different crop types. Recent research, however, suggests different crop types, such as row crops and orchards, differ in the degree to which they facilitate or impede species movements. Like many mammalian carnivores, bobcats (Lynx rufus) are sensitive to fragmentation and loss of connectivity between habitat patches. We investigated how distinguishing between different agricultural land covers might change conclusions about the relative conservation importance of different land uses in a Mediterranean ecosystem. Bobcats moved relatively quickly in row crops but relatively slowly in orchards, at rates similar to those in natural habitats of woodlands and scrub. We found that parameterizing a connectivity model using empirical data on bobcat movements in agricultural lands and other land covers, instead of parameterizing the model using habitat suitability indices based on expert opinion, altered locations of predicted animal movement routes. These results emphasize that differentiating between types of agriculture can alter conservation planning outcomes.

TI  - Determinants of extinction in fragmented plant populations: Crepis sancta (asteraceae) in urban environments
PY  - 2012
AB  - Local populations are subject to recurrent extinctions, and small populations are particularly prone to extinction. Both demographic (stochasticity and the Allee effect) and genetic factors (drift load and inbreeding depression) potentially affect extinction. In fragmented populations, regular dispersal may boost population sizes (demographic rescue effect) or/and reduce the local inbreeding level and genetic drift (genetic rescue effect), which can affect extinction risks. We studied extinction processes in highly fragmented populations of the common species Crepis sancta (Asteraceae) in urban habitats exhibiting a rapid turnover of patches. A four-year demographic monitoring survey and microsatellite genotyping of individuals allowed us to study the determinants of extinction. We documented a low genetic structure and an absence of inbreeding (estimated by multilocus heterozygosity), which suggest that genetic factors were not a major cause of patch extinction. On the contrary, local population size was the main factor in extinction, whereas connectivity was shown to decrease patch extinction, which we interpreted as a demographic rescue effect that was likely due to better pollination services for reproduction. This coupling of demographic and genetic tools highlighted the importance of dispersal in local patch extinctions of small fragmented populations connected by gene flow.

TI  - Species turnover and geographic distance in an urban river network
PY  - 2013
AB  - AimUnderstanding the relationships between species turnover, environmental features and the geographic distance between sites can provide important insights into the processes driving species diversity. This is particularly relevant where the effective distance between sites may be a function of the habitat or topographic features of the landscape and the means of dispersal of the organism. River networks, in particular in human-modified landscapes, are a striking example of such a situation. Here, we use data for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms across an urban river network to examine patterns of species turnover and to determine whether these patterns differ between different taxonomic groups. LocationSheffield area, UK. MethodsAquatic (macroinvertebrates, diatoms) and terrestrial (birds, plants, butterflies) organisms were surveyed at 41 sites across an urban river network. We assessed the relationship between turnover and three alternative geographic distance measures (Euclidean, network and flow distance), whilst also taking into account the environmental distance between sites, using Mantel and partial Mantel tests. ResultsTurnover of all taxonomic groups apart from butterflies was significantly correlated with at least one measure of geographic distance. The aquatic taxonomic groups showed the strongest correlations with the geographic distance measures, and in particular with network distance. Terrestrial taxa were more closely associated with environmental than any of the geographic distance measures, although network distance remained significant for birds and some plant groups after removing the effect of environmental distance. Water-dispersed and neophyte plant groups were significantly related to network and flow distance. Main conclusionsThe results suggest that aquatic communities are strongly influenced by spatial processes occurring within the river network. Terrestrial taxa have a more complex relationship with distance, with different components of these communities displaying different responses. Nevertheless, it is clear that connectivity along the river corridor is important for both aquatic and terrestrial communities.

TI  - POPULATION GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE BLUE CRAB CALLINECTES SAPIDUS USING GENOTYPING-BY-SEQUENCING
PY  - 2017
AB  - Previous genetic studies of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts have reported weak or temporally variable spatial structure, suggesting high gene flow among distant populations possibly facilitated by long-distance larval dispersal or other features of blue crab life history. The use of relatively few genetic markers, however, may have limited power to detect subtle but significant structure that could inform fisheries management. In this study, the potential for genome-scale datasets to uncover subtle patterns of population structure in the blue crab was examined using a high-throughput genotyping approach (genotyping-by-sequencing) that generated data for more than 9,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in crabs from three populations: Panama City Beach, FL, Agawam River, MA, and Porto Alegre, Brazil. Principle components analyses among the three populations revealed very distinct clustering of the Brazilian samples from U.S. populations, likely reflecting restricted gene flow across the equator. Detailed analysis of population structure between the two U. S. populations revealed low but significant genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.0103), with F-ST values ranging from -0.05 to 0.48. Previous studies have failed to detect significant genetic structure on a similar geographic scale. F-ST outlier analysis identified 242 loci (2.45% of total) with statistically extreme values at the false discovery rate alpha = 0.05 level, only 16 of which showed significant sequence homology to annotated proteins via BLASTx alignment. Top BLASTx hits were to crustacean or arthropod sequences and 8 of the 16 had high sequence similarity to transposable elements or related machinery. Finally, results of population assignment tests for the two U. S. populations showed that the full marker dataset provided good power to assign individuals back to their population of origin (similar to 83% and 92% success for Panama City Beach and Agawam River, respectively), which dropped significantly when using only 500 randomly selected SNPs (similar to 61% and 72% success). Overall, this study demonstrates the great utility of high-throughput sequencing technologies for characterizing fine-scale patterns of genetic structure in blue crabs, and this approach should substantially improve the delineation of stock structure and further advance our understanding of blue crab population connectivity and ecology.

TI  - Diverging conditions of current and potential future urban forest patches
PY  - 2022
AB  - Forested natural areas in cities provide a range of social, ecological, economic, and health benefits. Ensuring the delivery of these benefits requires an understanding of current and potential future forest conditions, yet urban forest dynamics are not well-understood. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining forest structure and composition in 126 plots distributed across three forest patch sizes (large [95-126 ha], medium [1-19 ha], and small [0.05-0.65 ha] patches) in the city of New Haven, CT. We detected significant shifts in forest structure and composition suggesting a suite of distinct successional trajectories within each patch size. Large patches comprised 95% native tree species in the canopy (>5 cm dbh), sapling (1-5 cm dbh), and seedling (<1 cm dbh) layers, suggesting that these large patches will continue to be native-dominated in the future-a primary objective for urban forest management. Moreover, in these large patches, shifts in the dominant species in each stratum suggest that as large patches move through succession they will transition from moderately shade-tolerant forest types (i.e., oaks) to shade-tolerant types (i.e., American beech)-a similar successional trajectory to surrounding second-growth forests in the region. Medium patches were the most heterogeneous patch size sampled. Despite this heterogeneity, they generally resembled large patches in the canopy and sapling layers but diverged in the seedling layer. In medium patches, the invasive Norway maple replaced American beech as primary seedling species suggesting a future shift toward non-native-dominated forest in the future. Small patches were the most compositionally and structurally distinct patch size sampled. Only 36% of the canopy trees and saplings in small patches were native species; however, this increased to 71% native in the seedling layer. Additionally, the most important seedling species included those that are bird-dispersed highlighting the potentially valuable role that these small, non-native, forest fragments play as wildlife corridors. Collectively, our study demonstrates that multiple forest types, dynamics, and conditions can be found within a single city and that forest patch size offers a helpful framework to begin to parse out these differences.

TI  - Habitat-Specific Movement and Edge-Mediated Behavior of the Saproxylic Insect Odontotaenius disjunctus (Coleoptera: Passalidae)
PY  - 2009
AB  - The ability to disperse among patches is central to population dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Although saproxylic (=dead wood dependent) insects live in extremely fragmented forest ecosystems and comprise a significant proportion of the biodiversity therein, few studies have focused on dispersal of members in this group. We quantified the terrestrial movements of Odontotaenius disjunctus Illiger, a common saproxylic beetle in eastern North American forests. Movement behavior of individual beetles was measured in deciduous forest and two common matrix (=unsuitable) habitats (urban lawn and cattle pasture). Probability of emigrating from a forest fragment was assessed at the high-contrast boundary between forest and pasture. Seasonal, diurnal, and sex-biased patterns of O. disjunctus dispersal were determined from captures at drift fences encircling inhabited logs. Movement was 1.6 and 2.7 times faster and 1.1 and 1.5 times more linear in suitable habitat (forest) than in unsuitable matrix (lawn and pasture, respectively). Net displacement in the forest exceeded predictions of a correlated random walk, but net displacement in matrix habitats was less than expected. When confronted with a high-contrast boundary, O. disjunctus was 14 times more likely to move toward the forest than the pasture. The importance of temperature was indicated by its positive relationship with movement rate and increased diurnal and warm season dispersal activity. Reluctance to cross boundaries into open fields and slow movement within open fields suggest a low likelihood of terrestrial O. disjunctus movement among forest fragments.

TI  - Urban rivers as dispersal corridors for primarily wind-dispersed invasive tree species
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urbanization may have a large affect on biodiversity patterns by enhancing biological invasions. Urban habitats harbour high numbers of introduced plant species and may function as starting points for invasions along urban-rural gradients. As information on underlying mechanisms is critical for managing biological invasions, we test the role of rivers as dispersal corridors for primarily wind-dispersed ornamentals. We released tagged fruits of three invasive tree species in the Spree River (Berlin, Germany) and directly observed the fate of the floating samaras. The number of floating samaras declined exponentially with distance from the release point. A quarter floated 1200 m within 3 h. Despite marked differences in fruit morphology, there were no interspecific differences in floating capacity. We showed hydrochory to be an effective dispersal agent in wind-dispersed tree species, extending wind-related transport distances by several times. In this way, rivers are expected to link urban propagule sources with natural habitats downstream. Our results suggest that planting native tree species along river corridors would help prevent invasion risks and contribute to implementing principles of ecological design in urban greenways and generally consider the importance of eradicating wind-dispersed invasive tree species in floodplains in early invasion stages to prevent further water-mediated dispersal.

TI  - Ecological resistance in urban streams: the role of natural and legacy attributes
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urbanization substantially changes the physicochemical and biological characteristics of streams. The trajectory of negative effect is broadly similar around the world, but the nature and magnitude of ecological responses to urban growth differ among locations. Some heterogeneity in response arises from differences in the level of urban development and attributes of urban water management. However, the heterogeneity also may arise from variation in hydrologic, biological, and physicochemical templates that shaped stream ecosystems before urban development. We present a framework to develop hypotheses that predict how natural watershed and channel attributes in the pre-urban-development state may confer ecological resistance to urbanization. We present 6 testable hypotheses that explore the expression of such attributes under our framework: 1) greater water storage capacity mitigates hydrologic regime shifts, 2) coarse substrates and a balance between erosive forces and sediment supply buffer morphological changes, 3) naturally high ionic concentrations and pH pre-adapt biota to water quality stress, 4) metapopulation connectivity results in retention of species richness, 5) high functional redundancy buffers trophic function from species loss, and 6) landuse history mutes or reverses the expected trajectory of eutrophication. Data from past comparative analyses support these hypotheses, but rigorous testing will require targeted investigations that account for confounding or interacting factors, such as diversity in urban infrastructure attributes. Improved understanding of the susceptibility or resistance of stream ecosystems could substantially strengthen conservation, management, and monitoring efforts in urban streams. We hope that these preliminary, conceptual hypotheses will encourage others to explore these ideas further and generate additional explanations for the heterogeneity observed in urban streams.

TI  - Scale impacts of land cover and vegetation corridors on urban thermal behavior in Nanjing, China
PY  - 2008
AB  - In order to integrate urban microclimatic pattern, heat island intensity, land cover and cooling effect of vegetation corridors in a more comprehensive way, both fixed and mobile observations at two types of scale have been made simultaneously in different weather conditions during hot weather in Nanjing, China. Then the air temperature distribution of Nanjing and its impact factor were detected and quantified, and vegetation cooling models were developed in this paper. There was a significant day-to-day variation of urban heat island (UHI), and the average intensity of UHI during the measurement period was 2.0 degrees C. The strong UHI usually occurred around midnight; however, a peak UHI was frequently observed 2-3 h after sunset. During daytime, several isolated hot areas were observed next to cooler ones, indicating a negative UHI. The air temperature distributions of the vegetation corridors at mesoscale in the evening were similar to those at micro-scale at noon. The influence of the Purple Mountain was very obvious with the maximum cooling effect up to 3.0 degrees C/100 m at microscale and 0.4 degrees C/km at mesoscale. This research indicated that the pattern of the UHI in Nanjing is a function of the climatic conditions, the local topography, the effect of the Purple Mountain and the Yangtze River and the urban characteristics such as land uses, vegetation, building density, traffic loads, construction materials and anthropogenic heat sources, which should be taken into account for urban planning and ecologically comfortable residence. The results have further relevance for environmental implications in a subtropical city on the Yangtze River.

TI  - Regional assessment on influence of landscape configuration and connectivity on range size of white-tailed deer
PY  - 2009
AB  - Variation in the size of home range of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has broad implications for managing populations, agricultural damage, and disease spread and transmission. Size of home range of deer also varies seasonally because plant phenology dictates the vegetation types that are used as foraging or resting sites. Knowledge of the landscape configuration and connectivity that contributes to variation in size of home range of deer for the region is needed to fully understand differences and similarities of deer ecology throughout the Midwest. We developed a research team from four Midwestern states to investigate how size of home range of deer in agro-forested landscapes is influenced by variations in landscape characteristics that provide essential habitat components. We found that for resident female deer, annual size of home range in Illinois (mean = 0.99 km(2)), Michigan (mean = 1.34 km(2)), Nebraska (mean = 1.20 km(2)), and Wisconsin (mean = 1.47 km(2)) did not differ across the region (F (3,175) = 0.42, P = 0.737), but differences between agricultural growing and nongrowing periods were apparent. Variables influencing size of home range included: distance to forests, roads, and urban development from the centroid of deer home range, and percent of crop as well as four landscape pattern indices (contrast-weighted edge density, mean nearest neighbor, area-weighted mean shape index, and patch size coefficient of variation). We also identified differences in model selection for four landscapes created hierarchically to reflect levels of landscape connectivity determined from perceived ability of deer to traverse the landscape. Connectivity of selected forested regions within agro-forested ecosystems across the Midwest plays a greater role in understanding the size of home ranges than traditional definitions of deer habitat conditions and landscape configuration.

TI  - The Analysis of Urban Fluvial Landscapes in the Centre of Spain, Their Characterization, Values and Interventions
PY  - 2020
AB  - River areas are undoubtedly among the most valuable territorial areas in Europe, not only in terms of their eco-landscape and use but also, culturally. However, there is currently a sharp reduction in the extension and increase of deterioration of riverbanks around the world. A substantial part of losses and deterioration are associated with the artificialization of the territories, derived mainly from a less than respectful urbanization around these landscapes. Urban and peri-urban riverbanks are landscapes in expansion due to the continuous growth of built-up spaces. Therefore, they should be areas of preferential consideration, especially in territories with a marked tendency to dryness, like the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. This article aims to contribute to our understanding of these spaces through the study of four distinct cases in the centre of the peninsula, in particular: the river Manzanares running through the city of Madrid, the river Tagus in Toledo and running through Talavera de la Reina, and the river Henares in Guadalajara. Three of the four urban water courses analyzed are zones of special interest for waterfowl: they sustain a winter population that varies between 745 and 1529 birds and they provide a home to some globally threatened species. The density of the riparian birds is also very high during winter, these values oscillating between a mean of 141.16 and 240.12 birds/10 ha. It should be noted that the diversity of this group of birds in the four regions studies is also high (H > 2.4 nats). The article also examines the interventions and the urban planning criteria applied to these urban and peri-urban river spaces, inferring the need to reassess urban planning in river areas to ensure it is compatible with their operation, values and possible uses.

TI  - Effects of extreme land fragmentation on wildlife and livestock population abundance and distribution
PY  - 2016
AB  - Fragmentation, degradation and loss of natural habitats are now recognised as major threats to wildlife conservation and mobile pastoralism in East African savannas. These processes are driven primarily by land tenure and policy, increasing human population, expansion of settlements and agricultural farms, road networks, urban development and fencing. To understand and characterise the forces driving habitat fragmentation, we analyse how biophysical (soils, slope, rainfall, rivers) and human-created (roads, towns, parks, quarries) features influence where people choose to fence the land in the Athi-Kaputiei ecosystem of Kenya. We also explore the consequences of land fragmentation through fencing on the abundance and distribution of wildlife and livestock populations. We show that fences are most highly concentrated along the major roads and around the major urban centres. Movements of migratory wildebeest and zebra between the Nairobi National Park and the pastoral Kitengela Plains adjoining the park on the south are getting increasingly impeded by increasing concentration of fences. Populations of wildebeest and other herbivores have collapsed to a small fraction of their former abundance largely owing to destruction of their habitats and obstruction of their movements between the park and the pastoral lands by fences and other land use developments. Conserving the key seasonal wildlife dispersal areas in the Athi-Kaputiei Plains is critical to ensuring the future viability of several key wildlife species in Nairobi National Park. Several initiatives, including a conservation land lease program has been launched, but their spatial coverage and funding levels would need to be greatly expanded to secure sufficient open spaces for both wildlife and livestock.

TI  - Planning by the rules: A fair chance for the environment in a land-use conflict area
PY  - 2018
AB  - The establishment of protected areas is one of the most common environmental policy tools which can effectively contribute to landscape protection, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem services provision. In this sense, the Brazilian Law on Native Vegetation Protection establishes the legal reserves, mandatory protected spaces within private rural lands, which seek to maintain and restore ecological functions and promote biodiversity conservation. This paper aims to present an approach that attempted to locate potential protected spaces, in the form of legal reserves, in the East Zone of Ribeirao Preto - a recharge zone of the Guarani Aquifer System. We made use of seven criteria to create five possible scenarios with varying priorities for native vegetation protection or restoration. Then, we used eight landscape metrics, as well as the level of compliance with the law, to discuss the viability of each scenario in terms of ecological thresholds and landscape indicators. We found only one scenario (the broader perspective on recovering the natural vegetation corridors) capable of meeting the ecological and legal requirements. We conclude that using less data-demanding methods, such as the one applied in this research, could be useful in assisting decision-making regarding the selection of areas for conservation or restoration.

TI  - Community-driven skyrise greenery in a dense tropical city provides biodiversity and ecosystem service benefits
PY  - 2018
AB  - Community-driven vertical greenery provides a previously under-appreciated resource that could be an important component of tropical urban ecology. While the corridors of buildings have been designed to facilitate the circulation of residents between spaces, this study shows that such corridors incidentally served as an informal space for community-driven vertical greenery. Across 1.86 ha of surveyed corridors, a total of 265 plant species and cultivars were present, with an average richness of 124 species per hectare. This is beneficial to urban ecology through its high species diversity, occurrence of endangered and vulnerable native species. Based on a classification of specific plant attributes referenced from literature, provision of food and medicinal resources (77.5%), and aesthetic benefits (72.3%) were the key ecosystem services provided by the species present. Community-driven vertical greenery could function as refugia for native species of conservation interest through providing an additional buffer against further losses in the wild. It also provides immediate opportunities for interactions between humans and nature. This study finds that corridors with larger areas and simpler geometries typically hold a higher abundance of plant pots. Future efforts to increase the abundance and diversity of vertical greenery, and its concomitant increase in the provision of ecosystem services, could be driven by local communities, rather than be formally planned by landscape architects, engineers and urban planners.

TI  - Do Bottom-up Effects Define The Structuring of Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Communities In A Restinga Remnant?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Restingas are lowland sandy ecosystems located between mountain ranges and the sea. For living organisms in this ecosystem, restingas can be seen as habitats formed by islands of vegetation separated by a sandy matrix. These organisms are highly influenced by the environmental conditions and physical characteristics of the landscape, including size, connectivity and environmental heterogeneity. Given the recognized effectiveness of ants as bioindicators, this study uses these organisms as a model to assess how do the physical characteristics of a landscape influence the structures of ant communities. The study was carried out in the Parque das Dunas, Salvador - Bahia, Brazil. Within this park, four categories of vegetation islands (Small, Medium, Large and Continuous) were delimited, where the ant fauna was sampled and the forms of vegetal life were analyzed, using the Raunkiaer analysis. A total of 69 ant species were collected from 31 genera and six subfamilies. We found a positive relationship between ant richness and diversity of plant life forms (Shannon index). In general, there was a significant difference in the composition of ant species between the areas of continuous vegetation and the different vegetation islands. We conclude that there is a bottom up effect mediating the ant community associated with dune vegetation, where the local richness of ant species responds to vegetation heterogeneity.

TI  - Increased body size along urbanization gradients at both community and intraspecific level in macro-moths
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urbanization involves a cocktail of human-induced rapid environmental changes and is forecasted to gain further importance. Urban-heat-island effects result in increased metabolic costs expected to drive shifts towards smaller body sizes. However, urban environments are also characterized by strong habitat fragmentation, often selecting for dispersal phenotypes. Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-mothsan insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal linksat both the community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean body size because of stronger filtering against small species along urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local and landscape scales (50-3,200m radius), depending on the species. Hence, measuressuch as creating and improving urban green infrastructureto mitigate the effects of urbanization on body size will have to be implemented at multiple spatial scales in order to be most effective.

TI  - The conservation value of urban riparian areas for landbirds during spring migration: Land cover, scale, and vegetation effects
PY  - 2008
AB  - Urbanization changes bird community structure during the breeding season but little is known about its effects on migrating birds. We examined patterns of habitat use by birds at the local and landscape level during 2002 spring migration at 71 riparian plots along an urban gradient in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Using linear regression, we examined variation in relative density, species richness, and evenness of four migratory guilds associated with natural land covers and building area at four scales (50, 100, 250, 500 m radial buffers). We also examined the influence of local vegetation using multiple regression models. As building area increased, riparian forests tended to be narrower and have fewer native trees and shrubs. In general, native birds were positively associated with tree cover (within 250500 m of stream) and native vegetation, and negatively with building area (within 250 m); exotic species responded inversely to these measures. Short-distance migrants and permanent residents displayed the weakest responses to landscape and vegetation measures. Neotropical migrants responded strongest to landscape and vegetation measures and were positively correlated with areas of wide riparian forests and less development (>250 m). Resident Neotropical migrants increased with wider riparian forests (>500 m) without buildings, while en-route migrants utilized areas having a wide buffer of tree cover (250500 m) regardless of buildings; both were positively associated with native vegetation composition and mature trees. Consequently, developed areas incorporating high native tree cover are important for conserving Neotropical migrants during stopover. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improvement of aquatic vegetation in urban waterways using protected artificial shallows
PY  - 2012
AB  - Wave- and current-protected shallows have been constructed in the heavily modified, urban River Spree to create a littoral habitat with reduced hydrodynamical disturbances by navigation. Five years after construction and an initial planting of various macrophytes, abiotic conditions were measured and the establishment of aquatic and riparian vegetation was assessed. This study aimed to quantify the effective reduction of hydrodynamic disturbances and to assess the rehabilitation of aquatic plants and the improvement of the macrophytes-based ecological status by means of the reference index (RI). Wave stress has been successfully reduced and a diverse, abundant community of aquatic and riparian plants developed resembling the vegetation of natural oxbows. Most of the planted species were still present after five years, and in addition, several new species became established. The aquatic plants at the rehabilitated site indicated a \"good\" ecological status and even the \"high\" status if planted species were excluded from the RI. In contrast, the control site remained largely unvegetated indicating a \"bad\" status. Abiotic conditions other than wave action confirmed low hydrological connectivity and the ecosystem-engineering capabilities of vegetation. Low oxygen saturation and the accumulation of organic material limit the habitat suitability for other biota. Principally, wave-protected shallows are well suited to improve aquatic macrophytes in urban waterways. They will be rapidly naturally colonized, while planting of macrophytes, especially of species typical for advanced stages of succession should be omitted. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A planning strategy to augment the diversity and biomass of roadside trees in urban Hong Kong
PY  - 1999
AB  - Hong Kong's urban environment has an extremely high development density pervasively filled by buildings and roads. Little ground-level space is left for amenity planting within and without town lots, resulting in a cramped city matrix with inadequate green cover. The community desires for more and better trees for cityscape enhancement and environmental amelioration. A city-wide roadside-tree census was conducted recently together with a survey of potential planting sites (PPS) with a view to augmenting tree biomass and diversity in the long run. Sites with a suitable plantable corridor were evaluated in detail in the field to glean data on growing-space geometry (configuration and dimensions) and qualitative attributes (adjacent land use, building setback, unpaved soil, and air quality). Some 1094 PPS with a total capacity for 12 063 trees had been studied. Most PPS are spatially scattered and small, each with <14 trees capacity. A suite of III species had been selected for suitable dimensional and amenity attributes to fit the harsh and tight roadside sites, and to avoid the currently rampant discordance between trees and habitats. Environmental conditions within and in the vicinity of individual PPS, with an emphasis on plantable-space geometry, were matched with species characters. A strategy was adopted to maximize final biomass, floristic variety and ornamental functions especially attractive flowers and seasonal changes. A 5 year master planting plan was designed with site-specific species recommendations and a schedule giving priority to tree-deficient and readily-available localities. The landscape in 398 more streets will be improved with congruous trees. A similar green-planning strategy could be applied to other cities with a congested urban morphology.

TI  - Unsheltered Homelessness in Urban Parks: Perspectives on Environment, Health, and Justice in Salt Lake City, Utah
PY  - 2019
AB  - Unsheltered homelessness in the United States forces hundreds of thousands of people to sleep, eat, and live in the public sphere. Urban parks often become temporary homes for individuals facing poverty, substance addiction, mental illness, servitude, and other social concerns. For individuals facing homelessness, these parks are primary sources of stability in often desperate situations. Residing in parks and protected areas, however, raises concerns for the residents in terms of personal health and safety, and raises other concerns for public health, public safety, and environmental impacts. This research considers the relationships between unsheltered homelessness and perspectives of local environmental conditions. Surveys were completed by recreational users (n = 332) of City Creek Canyon, a riparian corridor in Salt Lake City, Utah, to understand visitors' perspectives of the social and environmental impacts of unsheltered homelessness in the area. Results indicate an overall awareness of homelessness in the area, and a simultaneous indication that homelessness does little to affect either recreational behavior or perceived environmental impacts to the water, wildlife, or overall ecological functioning. Implications from this research illuminate that common responses of forced displacement of individuals facing homelessness from parks-by law enforcement, health department, or park management officials-represent not only social justice concerns but also environmental justice concerns for those facing homelessness. Similar to \"right to the city\" movements, access to environmental resources, in this case a place to live, represents an environmental justice issue for some of the most marginalized members of our communities.

TI  - Flood control structures in tidal creeks associated with reduction in nursery potential for native fishes and creation of hotspots for invasive species
PY  - 2016
AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem processes yet globally is highly restricted by anthropogenic actions. Anthropogenic barriers are common in aquatic ecosystems; however, the effects of smallscale barriers such as floodgates have received relatively little study. Here we assess fish communities in ten tributaries over the spring-summer season of the lower Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada), five with floodgates and five reference sites without barriers, located primarily in agricultural land use areas. While the Fraser River supports the largest salmon runs in Canada, the lower Fraser river-floodplain ecosystem has numerous dikes and floodgates to protect valuable agricultural and urban developments. Floodgate presence was associated with reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, threefold greater abundance of invasive fish species, and decreased abundances of five native fish species, including two salmon species. These findings provide evidence that floodgates decrease suitable habitat for native fishes, and become hotspots for non-native species. Given climate change, sea-level rise, and aging flood protection infrastructure, there is an opportunity to incorporate biodiversity considerations into further development or restoration of this infrastructure.

TI  - A widened array of metrics (WAM) approach to characterize the urban acoustic environment; a case comparison of urban mixed-use and forest
PY  - 2022
AB  - Sound pressure levels (SPL) in dB are the traditional noise measurement, but dB measures alone limit characterization of the complex urban acoustic environment. The aim of this paper is to apply alpha and beta ecoacoustic indices from soundscape ecology at two contrasting locations corresponding to an urban mixed-use corridor and a deciduous forest. Twenty acoustic indices and mean dB(A) are calculated from 2,798 three-minute recordings taken every 26 min over a 28-day period. Acoustic indices are summarized by case with mean hour-of-day plots and 7- and 28-day time series plots to identify temporal patterns. Correlations to assess index relationships for each case separately and combined are presented. Acoustic indices provide complimentary information beyond SPL measures alone, especially in frequency and temporal domains, useful to identify patterns in the acoustic environment. Correlation between specific multiple indices at individual locations is a promising approach to identification of anthrophonic and biophonic dominated sonotopes. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Urban habituation, ecological connectivity and epidemic dampening: the emergence of Hendra virus from flying foxes (Pteropus spp.)
PY  - 2011
AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change is often implicated in the emergence of new zoonoses from wildlife; however, there is little mechanistic understanding of these causal links. Here, we examine the transmission dynamics of an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus, Hendra virus (HeV), in its endemic host, Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or flying foxes). HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen, with a high case-fatality rate in humans and horses. With models parametrized from field and laboratory data, we explore a set of probable contributory mechanisms that explain the spatial and temporal pattern of HeV emergence; including urban habituation and decreased migration-two widely observed changes in flying fox ecology that result from anthropogenic transformation of bat habitat in Australia. Urban habituation increases the number of flying foxes in contact with human and domestic animal populations, and our models suggest that, in addition, decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in population immunity, giving rise to more intense outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. Ten of the 14 known HeV outbreaks occurred near urbanized or sedentary flying fox populations, supporting these predictions. We also demonstrate that by incorporating waning maternal immunity into our models, the peak modelled prevalence coincides with the peak annual spill-over hazard for HeV. These results provide the first detailed mechanistic framework for understanding the sporadic temporal pattern of HeV emergence, and of the urban/peri-urban distribution of HeV outbreaks in horses and people.

TI  - Outside the forest stand: Analysis of urban forest buffer zones to implement nature-based solutions-A case study of Pozna? (Poland)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban forests are important and highly valuable natural elements of urban green infrastructure (GI). The tightening of developed areas in the vicinity of urban forests results in negative changes in water relations, the disruption of the continuity of wildlife corridors, and the growing number of users, which has an impact on the degradation of urban forest ecosystems. This study, conducted in Pozna??, Poland, provides an analysis of urban forest buffer zones regarding land use type, the high greenery ratio, and the planning decisions that could serve as a nature???based solution (NbS). The study shows a significant change in developed land area in the urban forest buffer zones with the width of 500 m and 100 m. That change occurred between 1997 and 2019 and should be a matter of concern. Coverage of the buffer zones with high greenery, which turned out to be very diverse, could be treated as a forest extension and an element mitigating the negative transition between the forest and the city. Different land use types were taken into consideration, especially in developed areas. The buffer zones of urban forests should be devel??? oped with spatial planning tools like data management and decision???making to mitigate the negative impact of the developed areas on the forests. The development of the concept of sup??? porting green infrastructure in urban forest buffer zones, regardless of land use type was also part of the study.

TI  - A long-term assessment of fire regimes in a Brazilian ecotone between seasonally dry tropical forests and savannah
PY  - 2020
AB  - Fire is a recurrent phenomenon in semiarid seasonal ecosystems. The study of the relationship between fire and climate could provide new approaches for understanding fire dynamics in semiarid regions, which could be useful for strategically managing the loss and recovery of natural resources under threat. Here, we evaluated the patterns of fires occurrence in a semiarid Caatinga-Cerrado ecotone in the Northeast Region of Brazil by characterizing their spatiotemporal dynamics associated with climatic conditions. Using a temporal series of 306 Landsat images, we mapped a burned area database at a fine spatial resolution (30 m) from 1999 to 2017 in the Capivara-Confusoes Mosaic of protected areas and their surroundings. Fire seasonality was analyzed through climatic seasons, distinguishing between the rainy season (RS), early dry season (EDS), middle dry season (MDS) and late dry season (LDS), by analysis of the daily precipitation of ground-based stations in the area. We created yearly, seasonal and recurrence maps of burned areas to assess fire regimes. The results showed that the 48% of the area was burned during the 19-year long period considered. Serra das Confusoes National Park (SCoNP) had 302,644 ha burned, Serra da Capivara National Park (SCaNP) had 2056 ha burned and the ecological corridor had 215,718 ha burned. Most of the burned area was registered during the MDS (36% of the study area), there was almost no burned area in the EDS (< 0.01%), while the LDS (7%) and the RS (4%) had similar dimensions burned. The years that burned the most (2001, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015) were followed by years with considerably less burned area. We identified a multiple-year process, consisting of a climatological year with above-average precipitation and consequent low burned area, followed by a climatological year with below-average precipitation and resulting in large extensions of burned area (periods: 1999-2001, 2008-2010, 2010-2012). Fire recurrence reached a maximum value of ten, with 47% of the area burned presenting some degree of recurrence. SCaNP presented no fire recurrence, while SCoNP had a maximum recurrence parameter of four. Areas with moderate fire recurrence were near roads, settlements or cities. Some recurrently burned areas presented similar shapes, which were associated with topography limiting the spread of the fires. The patterns that we described here constitute the first step toward understanding the fire regimes of the region to establish directions for improving management strategies and orienting policies in the area.

TI  - Age and sex-dependent effects of landscape cover and trapping on the spatial genetic structure of the stone marten (Martes foina)
PY  - 2016
AB  - Maintenance of genetic variation is of critical importance for wild populations since low levels limit the species' ability to respond to different threats (diseases, predators, environmental changes) in both the long and the short term. Human activities could impact the genetic variation of wild species in multiple ways, including via fragmentation and harvesting. We used an individual-based landscape genetics approach to describe the impact of landscape elements and trapping pressure on the spatial genetic structure of a large sample (n = 370) of the stone marten (Martes foina) in central-eastern France (Bresse). An analysis of isolation-by-resistance using a causal modeling approach showed an influence of landscape cover and/or trapping pressure on gene flow according to age and sex class. Overall, the connectivity in the study area is provided mainly by vegetation cover, while roads and open areas partially impede it. Unexpectedly for this \"urban adapter\" species, buildings could reduce gene flow. We also emphasized the sex-dependent effect of trapping on gene flow. Genetic differentiation in males was influenced by trapping pressure and landscape structure while only the latter influenced genetic differentiation in females. A stronger isolation by distance in males than in females suggested that at the scale of the study area, males are more exposed to trapping pressure, which reduces effective dispersal. Overall, the combination of both landscape and trapping costs might create an 'ecological trap' that could disrupt gene flow, leading to a north-south division in the study area.

TI  - Disturbance, microclimate and historical habitat connectivity determine the population performance of the threatened grassland specialist Carex caryophyllea in remnant grasslands
PY  - 2019
AB  - Many grassland specialist plant populations in Europe have become restricted to remnant habitats. The performance of these populations depends on both species-specific traits and local and landscape level aspects of habitat quality. Understanding which specific local or landscape level conditions determine the performance of grassland species populations in remnant habitats would help design the restoration of the habitats and to detect the conditions that favour the long-term persistence of grassland species in them. Such information is especially needed in urbanised landscapes, where remnant habitats engulfed by urban land use types may experience increased erosion, higher temperatures and invasion by alien species. This study investigates the population performance determinants of Carex caryophyllea (VU), a grassland specialist, in 43 remnant grasslands in an urban-rural gradient in Finland. The population performance was assessed with metrics of persistence, establishment and reproduction, and related to environmental conditions with generalized additive models and redundancy analysis. The most important positive determinants for the performance of C. caryophyllea populations were disturbance through management or ground erosion, a warm microclimate, large habitat area and high historical connectivity to suitable grassland habitats. Present connectivity to other C. caryophyllea populations had a weak and near-significant positive relationship with population performance. Urbanisation of the surrounding landscape correlated with population performance as well, possibly due to the high historical cover of grasslands in presently urbanised landscapes. The results imply that the most effective restoration method of remnant C. caryophyllea populations would be reinstating disturbance regimes in overgrown habitats with warm microclimates close to suitable habitats and other existing populations, whether urban or rural. This would counteract the species future decline due to possible extinction debts and help the species persist in the study area in the long term.

TI  - Assessing spatial population structure and heterogeneity in the dronefly
PY  - 2015
AB  - In order to secure pollination services and improve conservation strategies, a better understanding of factors influencing population structure of pollinator species is vital. Here, we aimed to empirically evaluate various individual-and population-based statistical methods for characterization of genetic structure of the widespread dronefly, Eristalis tenax. Thirty-five European populations, comprising 888 individuals, were genotyped at five polymorphic allozyme loci. Three Bayesian genotypic clustering approaches (STRUCTURE, BAPS and Geneland), pairwise F-ST estimates, analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA), principle component analysis (PCA) and Mantel tests were applied in a comparative way in attempt to reveal the patterns of gene flow that occurs at various spatial scales in E. tenax. STRUCTURE analysis and PCA results provided no evidence of conspecific differentiation. In contrast, BAPS and Geneland clustering solutions did acknowledge low but significant proportion of among-populations genetic variation revealed by AMOVA. Similarly, pairwise FST estimates partially argue against genetic homogeneity across Europe. The lack of correlation between genetic distance and both latitude and longitude variation suggests that the flies disperse in multiple directions. Therefore, our results indicate that continued long-range dispersal tend to homogenize populations over time, resulting in little population structure in E. tenax across the European landmass. On the other hand, significant differentiations between geographically proximate populations indicate that dispersal potential may not be realized and that gene flow patterns in E. tenax might be geographically complex. Using information from our genetic approaches will be useful for identifying patterns of migration and population connectivity across continent, which is an important issue for conservation efforts. Since E. tenax is an important pollinator, our results contribute to understanding the potential extent to which this taxon can facilitate gene flow among plant populations across natural and semi-natural habitats, agroecosystems and urban environments. Dronefly-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant-dronefly conservation will require large-scale action.

TI  - The Current Use of Indigenous Trees on Irish Golf Courses
PY  - 2010
AB  - In Ireland the profile of golf has increased significantly over the last decade. Today golf course superintendents are aware of the need to manage their golf courses in an environmentally friendly manner, to improve existing habitats, plant indigenous trees to increase biodiversity and create wildlife reservoirs. Four parkland golf courses comprising two rural (Gowran Park, \"K Club\") and two urban/(Elm Park, and Rockmount) were selected to determine the range, selection, management and use of native Irish trees on Irish golf courses in 2005. The courses were selected on the basis of their age, location and land area. A system was developed to grade native material based on the number of insects that different trees support, thus valuing the potential of a particular tree species on its ability to increase biodiversity. Using this method, a table was developed to classify the biodiversity potential of the existing trees on each of the four golf courses. The results show that native Irish tree species such as Quercus, Salix and Betula support more than two hundred insect species while Fraxinus, Sorbus and Taxus support between ten and sixty nine. It was also found that the cultivation of native trees on Irish golf courses was low, with non-native material accounting for most of the tree species found in each of the golf courses thereby limiting the potential to enhance biodiversity. The haphazard nature of the plantings and the lack of connectivity between tree stands indicated little planning of new planting schemes. It is recommended that native trees with local provenance be planted on Irish golf courses to increase biological diversity to create an environment where land use and habitat work harmoniously.

TI  - Multiscale determinants of Pacific chorus frog occurrence in a developed landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla) populations have persisted despite urban and rural development throughout the species' range; yet it is possible thatP. regilla, like other anurans with which it historically co-occurred, will become extirpated from cities and suburbs if urbanization intensifies as predicted. An improved understanding of the conditions that enable this species to persist in developed landscapes is needed to identify and conserve suitable habitats. We investigated species-habitat relationships forP. regillain a mixed urban-rural landscape in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to identify potential criteria for habitat suitability. We conducted repeat auditory surveys of chorusing males at 52 potential breeding wetlands and modeled occupancy at 26 of these sites using local and landscape variables representing competing hypotheses and spatial scales of influence. The models that best explainedP. regillaoccupancy included a combination of terrestrial habitat and connectivity factors and the presence of non-native predators. We found that the proportion of impervious cover within 250 m of a wetland had the strongest negative impact on occupancy. Our findings suggest that availability of terrestrial habitat adjacent to breeding sites is the primary driver of species presence in the developed landscape. Conservation efforts should seek to limit impervious cover to less than 20% within a 250-m buffer around breeding wetlands. Further, restored and created wetlands in urban and rural areas may be more likely to supportP. regillaif they are designed with a seasonal hydroperiod that excludes non-native aquatic predators and are placed in an area of high pond density.

TI  - Population genetics of fire salamanders in a pre-Alpine urbanized area (Salzburg, Austria)
PY  - 2015
AB  - Habitat alteration has been identified as one of the major causes of amphibian decline. In this study, the genetic structure of seven fire salamander subpopulations in the urbanized area of Salzburg (Austria) was investigated based on seven polymorphic microsatellite loci. We combined Bayesian clustering approaches (STRUCTURE, TESS) with the traditional F-statistics to evaluate the effect of potential barriers on gene flow. Both clustering approaches suggested that all sampled individuals belong to a single genetic pool (K = 1). While no clear-cut sign of genetic differentiation could be detected, pairwise FST-values suggest that the city of Salzburg potentially has an effect, but the effect of the highway leading to it remains hypothetical. This study corroborates that habitat alteration effects might take several generations before leading to isolated genetic pools, particularly in long-lived species. Such delayed effects have to be taken into account for population genetic analyses, in particular when it comes to conservation management and planning.

TI  - Increasing the conservation value of powerline corridors for wild bees through vegetation management: an experimental approach
PY  - 2018
AB  - Mounting evidence suggests declines in the abundance and diversity of wild bees. Increasing habitat that provides forage and nesting sites could boost struggling populations, particularly in urban, suburban and agricultural landscapes. The millions of acres beneath aerial electric transmission lines, sometimes referred to as easements or rights-of-way, must be kept free of tall-growing vegetation and hence have the potential to provide suitable habitat for many native species. Prior work has demonstrated that bee communities in easements managed using alternatives to episodic mowing were more diverse than in nearby open areas, however true control sites within the easements were unavailable. In order to compare vegetation management protocols, we conducted a two-year study which enabled us to directly compare transmission line easements in three locations currently undergoing Integrated Vegetation Management-a dynamic form of management involving spot removal and herbicide treatment of unwanted species (treatment) with nearby sites undergoing standard management protocols of yearly or biyearly mowing (control). Results show that treatment sites had significantly higher abundance and species richness than controls. Seasonal differences were pronounced, with the spring fauna most affected by differences in vegetation management. In addition, the older treatment sites house more social bees, more parasitic species and a more even distribution of bees across nesting guilds. Finally, we established that treatment sites had distinct bee communities, further increasing their value as sources for native bee populations in the landscape. Overall, the data clearly show the value of implementing alternative active vegetation management in the land under powerlines to achieve an increase in the abundance and diversity of wild bees.

TI  - Economic valuation of a seed dispersal service in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden
PY  - 2006
AB  - Most economic valuation studies of species derive from stated preferences methods. These methods fail to take into account biodiversity values that the general public is not (made) informed about or has no experience with. Hence, production function (PF) and replacement cost (RC) approaches to valuation may be preferable in situations where species perform key life support functions in ecosystems, such as seed dispersal, pollination, or pest regulation. We conduct an RC analysis of the seed dispersal service performed by the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden. The park holds one of the largest populations of giant oaks in Europe, and the oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petrea) represents a keystone species in the hemiboreal forests. The primary objective was to estimate the number of seed-dispersed oak trees that resulted from jays and to determine the costs of replacing this service though human means. Results show that depending upon seeding or planting technique chosen, the RC per pair of jays in the park is SEK 35,000 (USD 4900) and SEK 160,000 (USD 22,500), respectively. Based on the park's aggregated oak forest-area, average RC for natural oak forest regeneration by jays is SEK 15,000 (USD 2100) to SEK 67,000 (USD 9400) per hectare, respectively. These estimates help motivating investments in management strategies that secure critical breeding and foraging habitats of jays, including coniferous forests and jay movement corridors. The analysis also illustrates the need for detailed ecological-economic knowledge in a PF or RC analysis. The continuous temporal and spatial oak dispersal service provided by jays holds several benefits compared to a man-made replacement of this service. PF and RC approaches are particularly motivated in cases of known functional ecological relationships, and critically important in estimating management measures where mobile link organisms and keystone species form key mutual relationships that generate high biodiversity benefits. In relation to obtained results, we discuss insights for conducting valuation studies on particular species. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The selection and design of multiple-species habitat preserves
PY  - 2000
AB  - Multiple-species habitat conservation plans (MSHCPs) are designed to eliminate project-by-project review and minimize species-by-species conflicts; but these onetime, short-term processes invariably compress the divergent expectations of interest groups into an exercise driven by economic, amenity, and aesthetic values rather than scientific values. Participants may define an MSHCP as an exchange of habitat preserves for federal permits to take populations of endangered animals and plants, but the outcome is typically driven by overarching arguments over land development and suburban sprawl. Existing land uses also constrain the size, shape, and linkages among wildlife habitats, leading to a divergence of MSHCPs from the scientific preserve selection and design literature. Problems created by constraints to preserve configuration (e.g., land costs, fragmentation, pre-existing amounts of edge, lack of connectivity) must be resolved by long-term, post facto management. To date, estimates of preserve persistence have not been used in MSHCPs. Rather than focus on map-based exercises of preserve elements, it may be more productive to set goals for the persistence of species (states) and ecosystems (processes) within the preserves-accepting that preserve configurations and arrays will be defined by the landscape and politics of suburban areas and that long-term management will provide the primary means of maintaining biodiversity along the wildland/urban interlace.

TI  - A Case Study of Urban and Peri-urban Mammal Communities: Implications for the Management of National Park Service Areas
PY  - 2013
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to compare urban and peri-urban mammal assemblages and relate variation in these communities to local differences in vegetation. We surveyed 15 locations in both urban and peri-urban habitats (n = 30). Boundaries of our survey areas coincided with those of National Park Service (NPS) areas in central Virginia. Over a 14-month period, we used five trap-types to document species in three guilds. A total of 9 and 15 species were documented at urban and peri-urban locations, respectively. Top predators Canis latrans (Coyote) and Felis rufus (Bobcat) were undetected at urban sites, while mesopredators were consistently more abundant. The absence of four small prey species and reduced abundances of the most common native generalist, Peromyscus leucopus (White-footed Mouse), were also associated with urban locations. Multivariate analyses of relative abundance data indicated significantly dissimilar mammal communities in urban and peri-urban locations. Shrub cover was highest in peri-urban locations, while grass cover was highest in urban sitesa pattern that was only marginally significant due to greater variability among these sites. The exotic grass Microstegium vimineum (Japanese Stiltgrass) was present at several urban sites and contributed to the complex relationship between percent grass cover and the small-mammal assemblages that we surveyed. Our results suggest that disturbances that reduce the recruitment of shrubs and other native plants and promote the spread of invasive grasses may have severe consequences for small-mammal communities. In addition, culturally preserved areas within both survey sites (i.e., battlefields planted with fescue grasses) were inhospitable to most small-mammal species and wildlife in general. In many NPS areas, there is great opportunity for development of adaptive management strategies that integrate ongoing NPS efforts to control invasive plant species with the enhancement of wildlife habitat in both culturally and naturally preserved areas. There is an urgent need for the conservation of native habitat in NPS areas and non-park sites threatened by urbanization. The primary focus of these efforts should include the control of exotic species and mesopredators, facilitation of native shrub recruitment, and, in many of these areas, the ecological restoration of historic sites. NPS lands in urbanized areas offer unique conditions for wildlife management and abundant opportunities for conserving native communities.

TI  - River-valleys as an intra-city natural feature
PY  - 2007
AB  - Intra-city natural structures have always had a key role in creating sustainable urban greenspaces. Adapting to natural features and relating the intra-city greenspaces to such natural structures as river-valleys, hillsides, lakes and forests, guarantee the endurance, sustainability and longevity of the natural quality of city. This paper looks at intra-city natural structures which have undergone wholesale changes and been ruined, and considers the lives of these invaluable natural structures which have been endangered due to gross human interference and pressure, regardless of physical and biological features. River-valleys in Tehran have always had a significant role in offering valuable bio-environmental services to the city From the time of Qadjar era, villages enjoying favorable climate were built outside the city, and the villa of the governors and affluent people were built near hillsides across river-valleys because of the abundance of running water, cool weather in the summer and natural plant life. Little by little green corridors of Shemiranat were built near river-valleys, which formed the axes of the development of the city at the time Pahlavi dynasty. From then, the development of the city towards hillsides, regardless of these natural structures, increased and the destruction of these urban natural spaces have posed serious problems nowadays. Familiarity with these natural structures, their preservation and organization, and making the optimum use of them seem to be a very critical issue. Taking an ecological approach in this paper, is an attempt to look at the intra-city river-valleys. To do so, the data collected from a natural river-valley is used as evidence to back up any claims made in this regard.

TI  - Social network analysis for poultry HPAI transmission
PY  - 2018
AB  - In this survey study, the networks among poultry farms and related poultry enterprises in two counties in China (Feixi County in Anhui Province and Beizhen city in Liaoning Province) were analysed and evaluated focusing on the connectivity of contacts, movements, and potential pathogen transmission. The Feixi County poultry production network exhibited greater connectivity, which incorporated approximately 94% of the farms interviewed in a major component (a set of connected farms not linked with each other), mainly due to linkages of backyard farms through local produce stores and individual agents, whilst the Beizhen City network was more fragmented owing to independent in-house operations (from breed, raise, to slaughter and process) of a few large companies, with multiple smaller components. A range of factors influencing the contacts/movements among farms (act as bridges) were identified in this study. Ability to predict the pathway with the network characteristics on the basis of the factors, such as entity type and geographic location, is useful for developing risk-based approaches for disease prevention, surveillance, early detection, and effective controlling.

TI  - Causes of habitat loss in a Neotropical landscape: The Panama Canal corridor
PY  - 2008
AB  - We studied drivers of habitat conversion in the Panama Canal region, where rich biodiversity in tropical rainforests currently coexists with two major growing cities and a plethora of economic opportunities. We examined existing administrative units (counties) with known biophysical (e.g., rainfall, topography) and socio-economic (e.g., Population density, road density) characteristics. To identify associations between those characteristics and likelihood of habitat conversion to agriculture or urbanization, we used canonical correlation analysis. Two axes accounted for most of the variation among administrative units: one for urbanization and the other for agriculture. Rainfall and topography were negatively associated with urbanization, whereas population wealth was positively associated with land conversion to urban. Agriculture was most strongly associated with elevation variability and topographic complexity. To a lesser extent, agriculture was associated with rural population density, mean annual human population growth and poverty level. We hypothesize that most future habitat loss in the Panama Canal region will be from urbanization as Panama City expands and populations grow along the highway system. Decision-makers will need to emphasize preservation of forests on the edge of developments, where risk of loss is highest. These forested lands tend to become more expensive as urbanization approaches, putting them at greater risk of being converted. Nevertheless, they are still important for protection of the Canal watershed and the high levels of biodiversity in watershed forests. Land planners and decision-makers should consider the influence of socio-economic and biophysical factors when selecting forests to protect for conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Modelling the Influence of Aquatic Vegetation on the Hydrodynamics of an Alternative Bank Protection Measure in a Navigable Waterway
PY  - 2016
AB  - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an effective tool for assessing hydrodynamics in complex environments. This paper reports on a CFD study of navigation-induced flows in a shallow, wave-protected, littoral habitat of the urban Spree River. It was constructed as a rehabilitation structure for aquatic organisms and subject to abundant growth of aquatic and riparian vegetation. This study aims to quantify the hydrodynamics induced by vessel movements and its consequences for water exchange and lateral connectivity between the habitat and the main channel with three representative, natural densities of aquatic plants. The simulations revealed both high efficiency of the rehabilitation structure in reducing hydrodynamic forces in the littoral and a superimposed reduction of hydrodynamic forces, and increase of flushing time with increased plant cover. Higher vegetation density resulted in lower wave propagation and lower connectivity of the rehabilitation structure with the fairway. Thus, natural succession of aquatic vegetation in the shallow habitats leads to increasing isolation and finally to terrestrialization. Maintaining the functionality of the rehabilitation structure as habitat for other aquatic organisms requires either plant removal or preferably adaptive modification, e.g. by successively increasing the openings to the main channel and letting the plants take over the protective function of the technical facilities. The developed CFD model helps to find hydrodynamically optimized solutions and to support decision-making process for maintaining littoral refuges for plants and weak swimming organisms in navigable waterways.

TI  - Home gardening in Singapore: A feasibility study on the utilization of the vertical space of retrofitted high-rise public housing apartment buildings to increase urban vegetable self-sufficiency
PY  - 2022
AB  - In land-scarce cities, high-rise apartment buildings may provide vertical spaces for natural-light home gardening along corridors, rooftops, balconies as well as facades. The vertical space can improve not only urban envi-ronmental sustainability but also food security. Using an experimental approach, we investigated the food production potential of a high-rise public housing apartment building based on different gardening systems, food crops, and sunlight availability. A gardening prototype system for building corridors was shown to increase the unit area yield of corridor gardening by fivefold compared to a commercial trough planter system. Additionally, this commercial trough planter system was mainly for leafy vegetable production, whereas the gardening pro-totype system for corridors is also suitable for climbing crops, such as legumes and cucurbits. Nevertheless, because of the limited space along corridors of the apartment building and the relatively low-light levels on average, corridor gardening was estimated to meet only 0.5 % of the demand for vegetables of the residents living in the apartment building. Rooftop gardening with shallow growing medium (depth < 15 cm) was esti-mated to meet 3 % of demand, and facade gardening 43 %, given the larger space available. Although the vegetable production potential in this study was estimated based on a particular typology of public housing apartment buildings in Singapore, our results showed that vegetable production in public housing apartment buildings is feasible, and home gardening can produce a substantial amount of vegetables for consumption if well deployed. Governments of highly urbanized cities may wish to invest in better home garden designs for high-rise public housing apartment buildings and encourage residents' participation in home gardening, which would increase high-rise greenery coverage and improve urban food system resilience. Future studies should also investigate the environmental sustainability and food safety aspects of home gardening in highly urbanized cities.

TI  - Bird Flight Resistance Analysis and Planning Strategies in Urban Regeneration Areas: A Case Study of a Certain Area in Shenzhen, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - At present, the sharp decline in urban biodiversity worldwide is severe. Conducting biological perspective analysis and proposing space construction solutions during urban regeneration can greatly alleviate the contradiction between urban construction and biodiversity conservation. In this study, birds were taken as biological representatives, and a certain area in Shenzhen with strong conservation needs was used as an example. Based on a thorough analysis of bird status, the minimum resistance model was applied to establish a resistance surface describing the real flight movement of the indicator species and to construct a bird conservation pattern from the flight process of birds. The results show that: (1) bird flight resistance is the lowest in the southern green space and northern woodland around the reservoir in the research region, and the resistance is higher in the central part, but the path of least resistance therein has the potential to become a corridor. (2) From the perspective of the community structure of green space vegetation, the sparse woodland and shrubland in the research region have low resistance and high richness, which are the most ideal green space forms for birds; from the perspective of architecture, bird flight resistance shows a negative correlation with building height and a positive correlation with building density. The final urban regeneration design plan is thus derived, and the validity of the method is verified based on the biodiversity index. This study reveals the possibility of applying bird flight resistance analysis based on the minimum resistance model to small and medium-scale urban regeneration areas, and also provides insight into the correlation between flight resistance and spatial design elements, which can assist decision-makers, planners and developers in spatial design and planning from a biological standpoint.

TI  - Identifying the spatial mixture distribution of bird diversity across urban and suburban areas in the metropolis: A case study in Taipei Basin of Taiwan
PY  - 2011
AB  - This study utilized a finite mixture distribution model (FMDM) to identify the distribution of bird diversity in urban and suburban areas of the Taipei basin. The spatial patterns of Shannon's diversity index were estimated using Sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) with bird investigation data. To validate the results of FMDM, bird groups were classified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) based on bird presence-absence records. The probabilities exceeding FMDM's cut-off values for suburban bird communities were obtained from SGS realizations. The results showed that bird diversity in the Taipei basin could be comprised of two-component mixture distributions for urban and suburban bird communities, respectively. The FMDM bird diversity classifications fit the TWINSPAN groups of urban and suburban species. The spatial maps of bird diversity in the study area provide evidence that a metropolis can cause changes in the spatial characteristics of bird communities at the landscape level. Furthermore, the bird diversity and land use maps could be useful for future conservation and urban planning in Taipei Basin, particularly urban green spaces and wetlands. The maps could also be utilized in network planning of green belts or corridors for ecological conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The influence of street trees on pedestrian perceptions of safety: Results from environmental justice areas of Massachusetts, US
PY  - 2021
AB  - Previous research has shown that trees and other roadside vegetation can mitigate adverse environmental conditions on urban street corridors, and, in turn, positively contribute to pedestrian perceptions of safety and walkability. In this study, pedestrian surveys (n = 181) were collected from three Massachusetts post-industrial cities to understand if street trees moderate pedestrian perceptions of safety. Three street tree conditions - sparse street tree abundance, mature street trees, and new street tree plantings - were compared as study settings. Several methods were used to correlate perceived safety with street trees and sociodemographic variables, including repeated measures and between-group ANOVA, qualitative open-coding, exploratory factor analysis, and simple moderation analysis. This study did not find empirical evidence that street trees influence people's perceived safety, nor that street trees substantively contribute to feelings of safety while walking. These findings suggest that pedestrians do not have universal experiences of safety in walking environments, and different sociocultural backgrounds may contribute to diverging experiences of safety or fear when walking. Our research supports previous findings on the ways in which pedestrians value street trees; this can be extended to municipal or regional Complete Streets guidance and technical assistance programs.

TI  - Vegetation of road verges on an urbanisation gradient in Potchefstroom, South Africa
PY  - 2000
AB  - A vegetation survey of road verges along an urban to rural gradient in the Potchefstroom Municipal Area was conducted. Important applications of these studies include understanding of the role of indigenous (native) and exotic species in the overall synanthropisation of vegetation. The present study forms part of a research programme on spontaneous vegetation in urban open spaces in the North-West Province of South Africa. A numerical classification technique (TWINSPAN) was used as a first approximation and the classification was refined using Braun-Blanquet procedures, The result is a phytosociological table from which 13 plant communities and seven sub-communities were recognised. Although some of these communities and subcommunities are similar to previously described vegetation types in natural and disturbed areas, most of them were not described before in South Africa. Two ordination scatter diagrams show the distribution of the plant communities along gradients which were related to the depth of the soil water table, habitat type, trampling, soil compaction and percentage of gravel in the soil surface. Similarities between roadside vegetation in this study and those overseas are discussed, as well as the possible role of road verges as dispersal corridors between natural and disturbed areas.

TI  - \"Blue-green\" corridors as a tool for erosion and stream control in highly urbanized areas - case study of Belgrade city
PY  - 2014
AB  - Highly urbanized areas constantly need new surfaces for building of commercial, residential or infrastructure objects. Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, is a large regional centre with a population of 2 000 000 dwellers, covering a territory of 3500 km(2). The territory of Belgrade is intersected by 187 streams, with watersheds mostly rural in higher parts, urbanized and highly urbanized in lower parts. Torrential floods that once occurred rarely during pre-development period have now become more frequent and destructive due to the transformation of the watershed from rural to urban land uses. Authorities of Belgrade defined a strategy for erosion control and protection from torrential floods, based on the restoration of \"blue-green\" corridors (residuals of open streams and fragments of forest vegetation). The restoration of \"blue-green\" corridors helps the establishment of new recreational areas, the preservation of biodiversity and the mitigation of effects of climate change.

TI  - The influence of urban land use on seed dispersal and wetland invasibility
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urban habitats are generally considered highly invaded by exotic species due to the frequency and extent of disturbance caused by human activities and development. Our previous study had demonstrated that forested wetlands within residential areas are more extensively invaded than wetlands within industrial-commercial areas. In this study, we investigate whether the structure of the forest edge and seed dispersal can explain the differential in the invasion of wetlands surrounded by industrial and residential land use. Our results indicate that edges of industrially bordered wetlands are denser, with vegetation concentrated at the boundary of tree growth, whereas the edges of residentially bordered wetlands are more open and diffuse. This difference influences the number of seeds and species capable of dispersing into the wetland. Less dense edges resulted in a higher number of seeds entering residential wetlands; however, there were no differences in the numbers of exotic seeds or exotic species in the seed rain residential and industrial wetlands. Although seed dispersal could not directly explain differences in the current extent of invasion of these sites, seed dispersal did follow corridor pathways, including ditches and trails that breach the edges and extend through the wetlands. These disturbances act as corridors for seed dispersal into both types wetlands and may play a role in introducing new species to the interior of the wetland, an outcome supported by a higher number of exotic species in the seed banks of residential sites. Our results suggest that both the type of adjoining land use and the provision of access to people on trails in urban wetlands can affect the composition of these communities.

TI  - Wildlife restoration: Mainstreaming translocations to keep common species common
PY  - 2015
AB  - In most urban and agricultural landscapes, remnants of native vegetation are surrounded by an inhospitable matrix. Although vagile species come and go, many reptiles, amphibians and small mammals are effectively stranded and declining towards local extinction. In the same landscapes, other areas where these species are absent are improving in habitat quality, both through natural regeneration and active restoration efforts. So, for many species in many domesticated landscapes, there are too many individuals in some patches of decreasing quality and no individuals in patches of increasing quality. One solution to this situation is to move animals from those areas where there are plenty to suitable areas where there are none. These targeted translocations apply lessons learned from revegetation to dispersal-limited animals to in-fill distributional ranges, increase population size and improve both demographic and genetic connectivity, pushing nonequilibrial metapopulations away from extinction via an imposed mass effect. In contrast to conventional reintroduction schemes expensive, reactive interventions involving highly-trained specialists and captive-raised endangered species these inexpensive, proactive, community-driven initiatives aim to avert future declines by keeping common species common. Having introduced the wildlife restoration vision, we use two scenarios to illustrate the benefits of the approach to species, ecosystem function, ecological understanding, restoration practise and public engagement. As well as adhering to best-practise reintroduction techniques to ensure animal welfare is not compromised and avoid detrimental effects to source populations or release sites, we emphasize community participation, data quality and long-term accessibility as paramount to maximize learning opportunities.

TI  - Multi-level, multi-scale resource selection functions and resistance surfaces for conservation planning: Pumas as a case study
PY  - 2017
AB  - The importance of examining multiple hierarchical levels when modeling resource use for wildlife has been acknowledged for decades. Multi-level resource selection functions have recently been promoted as a method to synthesize resource use across nested organizational levels into a single predictive surface. Analyzing multiple scales of selection within each hierarchical level further strengthens multi-level resource selection functions. We extend this multi-level, multi-scale framework to modeling resistance for wildlife by combining multi-scale resistance surfaces from two data types, genetic and movement. Resistance estimation has typically been conducted with one of these data types, or compared between the two. However, we contend it is not an either/or issue and that resistance may be better-modeled using a combination of resistance surfaces that represent processes at different hierarchical levels. Resistance surfaces estimated from genetic data characterize temporally broad-scale dispersal and successful breeding over generations, whereas resistance surfaces estimated from movement data represent fine-scale travel and contextualized movement decisions. We used telemetry and genetic data from a long-term study on pumas (Puma concolor) in a highly developed landscape in southern California to develop a multilevel, multi-scale resource selection function and a multi-level, multi-scale resistance surface. We used these multi-level, multi-scale surfaces to identify resource use patches and resistant kernel corridors. Across levels, we found puma avoided urban, agricultural areas, and roads and preferred riparian areas and more rugged terrain. For other landscape features, selection differed among levels, as did the scales of selection for each feature. With these results, we developed a conservation plan for one of the most isolated puma populations in the U.S. Our approach captured a wide spectrum of ecological relationships for a population, resulted in effective conservation planning, and can be readily applied to other wildlife species.

TI  - Informing conservation decisions to target private lands of highest ecological value and risk of loss
PY  - 2022
AB  - Natural habitats on private lands are potentially important components of national biodiversity conservation strategies, yet they are being rapidly lost to development. Conservation easements and other means of protecting these habitats have expanded in use and will be most effective if they target private lands of highest biodiversity value and risk of loss. We developed a Biodiversity Conservation Priority Index (BCPI) based on ecological value and risk of habitat loss for remaining areas of natural vegetation cover (NVC) in the northwestern United States and addressed two questions: (1) Which remaining NVC on private lands is the highest priority for biodiversity conservation based on ecological value and risk of development? And (2) are conservation easements in NVC placed preferentially in locations of high biodiversity conservation priority? Drawing on the concept of ecological integrity, we integrated five metrics of ecological structure, function, and composition to quantify ecological value of NVC. These included net primary productivity, species richness, ecosystem type representation, imperiled species range rarity, and connectivity among \"Greater Wildland Ecosystems.\" Risk of habitat loss was derived from analysis of biophysical and sociodemographic predictors of NVC loss. Ecological value and risk of loss were combined into the BCPI. We then analyzed spatial patterns of BCPI to identify the NVC highest in biodiversity conservation priority and examined the relationship between BCPI and conservation easement status. We found that BCPI varied spatially across the study area and was highest in western and southern portions of the study area. High BCPI was associated with suburban and rural development, roads, urban proximity, valley bottom landforms, and low intensity of current development. Existing conservation easements were distributed more towards lower BCPI values than unprotected NVC at both the study area and region scales. The BCPI can be used to better inform land use decision making at local, regional, and potentially national scales in order to better achieve biodiversity goals.

TI  - Sustainable living neighbourhoods: Measuring public space quality and walking environment in Lisbon
PY  - 2022
AB  - Obesity and global warming are two major challenges that affect communities' health and quality of life. Providing good walking environments, with appropriate pedestrian infrastructure, green areas and access to commercial retail and transport hubs favour liveable, healthy, and sustainable cities. The Lisbon City Hall has implemented an intervention program in the public space as a strategy to improve environmental quality and mitigate the effects of climate change. The program \"A square in each neighbourhood \" intends not only to reinforce the economic base of Lisbon, namely tourism, restaurants, commerce, and creative activities but also to promote physical activity and improve the quality of living of all citizens. For studying the impact of the public space quality on the walking environment, Campolide, a typical Lisbon neighbourhood, Portugal, which includes one of the requalified squares, was selected. A two-step methodology based on spatial modelling is proposed. In the first step, the public space quality was evaluated based on a set of 13 urban quality attributes. Attributes, intended for the street level, were collected from open data platforms and complemented with a field survey. Then, through spatial analysis, these attributes were used to build the Pedestrian Environment Quality Indicator and the Priority Intervention Indicator. Using these indicators, walking-friendly streets were mapped and the most critical sites that require priority intervention were identified to prepare for the requalification planning process. The street with the highest quality in the study area according to the dimensions evaluated -connectivity, convenience, comfort, cleanliness, and conviviality -has a great offer of trees, bus stops, commercial establishments, commercial diversity, crossings, paper bins/eco points and esplanades. On the opposite side of the rank, the street with the lowest quality has no trees or green areas, transport stops, benches and tables, or commercial activity. The urban quality indicators constitute a helpful tool for city planners and policymakers when planning sustainable living neighbourhoods.

TI  - Integration of landscape fragmentation analysis into regional planning: A statewide multi-scale case study from California, USA
PY  - 2008
AB  - Landscape fragmentation due to urban development, transportation infrastructure, and agriculture poses a threat to environmental integrity. There is a need to quantify the level of landscape fragmentation in an ecologically meaningful way for inclusion in planning and decision-making. Effective mesh size (m(eff)) is an ecologically relevant metric that quantifies landscape fragmentation based on the probability that two randomly chosen points in a region are located in the same non-fragmented patch. We investigated variation in meff measured by transportation districts, municipal counties, and six spatial levels of watersheds within the state of California. Four fragmentation geometries were developed by overlaying highways, roads, urbanized areas, agricultural areas, and natural fragmenting features. Two m(eff) calculation methods were compared: one where planning unit boundaries fragment the landscape (CUT), the other allowing for cross-boundary connections (CBC). The CUT procedure always produced lower m(eff) values than CBC, with greater differences occurring in smaller planning units, confirming the bias introduced using boundaries with landscape metrics. Calculated m(eff) values varied from 0 to 20 885 km(2) across 6994 units in California. Roads contributed the most to fragmentation, while agriculture contributed little, as California's agricultural areas are already heavily fragmented by roads. This paper provides a systematic, quantitative, and intuitive method for transportation, land use and environmental planners to analyze cumulative impacts of multiple fragmenting features across a range of spatial scales within a variety of planning units. This approach could be used for analyzing the impact of future land development scenarios, and integrated into regional planning processes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Stormwater basins of the New Jersey coastal plain: Subsidies or sinks for frogs and toads?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Stormwater basins are commonly employed structures designed to mitigate the negative effects of urban runoff. They are ubiquitous in the urbanized landscape; yet the effect of these basins on anurans has only recently been addressed. Stormwater basins have the potential to influence the breeding distribution of anurans by being sources for some species and sinks for others. Our study aims to determine which species benefit from the existence of stormwater basins, which species are negatively impacted, and what variables are the best predictors of these effects. We monitored thirty-six permanently-ponded basins in southern New Jersey for the presence of anuran larvae and calling males by aural surveys, dip-netting and trapping. We assessed fish presence by interviews, visual encounters, dip-netting, and traps. We divided near shore buffer areas into impervious surface and managed or unmanaged categories for both grass and woody vegetation. Two connectivity metrics, distance to canopied corridor and percent of undeveloped upland were analyzed with ArcGIS. Fish were detected in 92% of the basins. Resistance to fish predation distinguished successful species, those with larvae present, from unsuccessful species, those with calling activity but no larval presence. Connectivity to and availability of terrestrial habitat were significant predictors of the breeding species richness at the basins. Number of calling species increased as access to and amount of terrestrial habitat increased. Therefore, design, management, and placement of permanently-ponded basins can impact anuran communities. Additionally, as wet basins are sources for Rana catesbeiana, where bullfrogs are invasive, basins will likely increase propagule pressure.

TI  - Ancient Burial Mounds Provide Safe Havens for Grassland Specialist Plants in Transformed Landscapes-A Trait-Based Analysis
PY  - 2021
AB  - Due to the intensified land use in transformed landscapes, grassland biodiversity is often restricted to habitat fragments inadequate for arable use or for urban development. In continental parts of Eurasia, the similar to 600,000 ancient burial mounds (called \"kurgans\") built by nomadic tribes of the steppes are amongst the most widespread landmarks providing refuge for dry grassland species. In our study by using plant functional groups and functional traits, we aimed at gaining insight into the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping the structure and the composition of assemblages of grassland specialist plant species on kurgans embedded in the agricultural landscapes of East-Hungary. As a comparison, we also studied roadside verges and pristine extensive grasslands in the same region. We found that despite their small size, due to the lack of human disturbances and high microhabitat diversity kurgans can maintain a high species richness and percentage cover of specialists, especially when compared to verges. We revealed that assemblages of specialist plants on kurgans are characterized by traits typical to terrestrial habitat islands such as self-compatibility, large seed mass and tall stature. Kurgans and extensive grasslands were characterized by higher functional diversity (both at the level of single traits and multi-trait based functional dispersion) which is probably due to the higher level of environmental heterogeneity compared to the homogeneous environment in verges.

TI  - Orchid Bees of forest fragments in Southwestern Amazonia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Bees of the tribe Euglossini are known as orchid-bees. In general, areas with more vegetation cover have greater abundance and diversity of these bees. This study investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on assemblages of the euglossine bees in the region of Rio Branco municipality, State of Acre, and surrounding areas. Ten forest fragments with varying sizes were selected for the study and were classified as urban or rural. The bees were sampled between December 2005 and August 2006. A total of 3,675 bees in 36 species and 4 genera were collected. In general abundance and richness of bees did not differ statistically between urban and rural fragments. The index of edge in fragments was a predictor of richness and diversity of bees. The connectivity estimated was also an adequate predictor for richness. Fragments with greater similarity in relation to their landscape structure were also more similar in relation to faunal composition.

TI  - Feather corticosterone does not correlate with environmental stressors or body condition in an endangered waterbird
PY  - 2020
AB  - Physiological metrics are becoming popular tools for assessing individual condition and population health to inform wildlife management and conservation decisions. Corticosterone assays can provide information on howanimals cope with individual and habitat-level stressors, and the recent development of feather assays is an exciting innovation that could yield important insights for conservation of wild birds. Due to the widespread enthusiasm for feather corticosterone as a potential bioindicator, studies are needed to assess the ability of this technique to detect meaningful differences in physiological stress across a variety of stressor types and intensities. We examined feather corticosterone from 144 individuals among the 13 known breeding populations of Hawaiian gallinule (Gallinula galeata sandvicensis), an endangered waterbird, on the island of O'ahu. These ecologically independent subpopulations are known to have low genetic connectivity and movement rates and differ largely across a number of important conditions, including level of predator management, human disturbance, proximity to urban development and conspecific population density. This system is well suited for assessing the performance of feather corticosterone as a bioindicator of different known habitat-level threats common to this and many other conservation-reliant species. We found no statistically significant relationship between feather corticosterone and level of predator control, level of humandisturbance, gallinule population density, percent urban cover or body condition across all sites despite the substantial difference in stressor magnitude in our dataset. We did find that gallinules in habitats with larger population densities were in worse body condition. These findings suggest that feather corticosterone is not a consistent indicator of anthropogenic impacts on populations. Furthermore, they suggest that feather corticosterone may be a poor bioindicator of known habitat-level threats for Hawaiian gallinules and that it should be used with caution in other avian taxa of conservation concern.

TI  - Spatial Effects of Landscape Patterns of Urban Patches with Different Vegetation Fractions on Urban Thermal Environment
PY  - 2022
AB  - The landscape patterns of urban green spaces have been proven to be important factors that affect urban thermal environments. However, the spatial effect of the landscape patterns of urban patches with different vegetation densities on land surface temperature (LST) has not been investigated in detail. In this study, the built-up area of Xuzhou City was taken as the study region, and the four phases of Landsat 8 images and their corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020 were selected as the basic data. Normalized spectral mixture analysis and an improved mono-window algorithm were used to invert the vegetation component fraction (VF) and LST maps of the study area, respectively, and the surface patches were classified into five levels according to the VF values, from low to high. Four landscape-level and five class-level metrics were then selected to represent the landscape characteristics of each VF-level patch. The tested values of 60 and 780 m were regarded as the best grain size and spatial extent, respectively, in the calculation of all landscape metrics of ALL VF-level patches (VFLM) using the moving-window method. The results of bivariate Moran's I for VFLM and LST showed the following: (1) for landscape-level metrics, only the Shannon diversity index and patch diversity have substantial negative spatial correlations with LST (with average |Moran's I| < 0.2), indicating that the types of VF levels and the number of patches exert weak negative effects on the thermal environment for a certain area; (2) for class-level metrics such as percentage of landscape, patch cohesion index, largest patch index, landscape shape index, and aggregation index, only the class-level metrics of sub-high VF (LV4) and extreme-high (LV5) VF levels patches have significant negative spatial correlations with LST (with high Moran's I value, and high-high and low-high distributions in local indications of spatial association cluster maps), indicating that only the patches of high VF levels can effectively alleviate LST and that patch proportion, natural connectivity degree, predominance degree, shape complexity, and aggregation degree are important landscape factors for regulating the thermal environment. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression were applied to determine the impact weights of the class-level VFLMs of LV4 and LV5 patches on LST, which revealed the contributions of these landscape metrics to mitigating the urban heat island effect (UHI). These results signify the importance of and differences in the spatial patterns of various VF-level patches for UHI regulation; these patterns can provide new perspectives and references for urban green space planning and climate management.

TI  - Habitat Suitability Based Models for Ungulate Roadkill Prognosis
PY  - 2020
AB  - Simple Summary Red deer, roe deer and wild boar movements and crossings of the two highways in Lithuania were modeled. Validity of obtained models was tested by comparing the pathway predictions to the real roadkill and roadkill cluster locations in 2002-2009 (at the time the models were created) and in 2010-2017 (testing the prognostic value of these models). Across both periods and on both highways, the roe deer roadkill locations were significantly closer to the model-predicted pathways than to randomly selected points. The prediction of roadkill locations was also good for wild boar. The roe deer roadkill clusters and multi-species clusters were significantly better represented by the model than by random distribution. Thus, habitat suitability-based models of ungulate movement are recommended as an additional tool for planning wildlife-vehicle collision mitigation measures. Roads do not only have a detrimental effect on nature (fragmenting habitats, isolating populations and threatening biodiversity), but the increasing numbers of wildlife-vehicle collisions are also a direct threat to humans and property. Therefore, mitigation measures should be placed with respect to animal distribution and movements across the roads. We simulated red deer, roe deer and wild boar movements in Lithuania, focusing on the two main highways A1 and A2. Using regional habitat suitability and linkage models, we calculated movement pathways and the most probable crossing zones in 2009. The prognostic value of these models was tested by comparing the pathway predictions to the real roadkill and roadkill cluster locations in 2002-2009 and 2010-2017. Across both periods and on both highways, the roe deer roadkill locations were significantly closer to the model-predicted pathways than to randomly selected points. The prediction of roadkill locations was also good for wild boar. The roe deer roadkill clusters and multi-species clusters were significantly better represented by the model than by random distribution. On both highways, the biggest differences in distance from the predicted locations were near big cities. We recommended wildlife movement models as an additional tool for planning wildlife-vehicle collision mitigation measures and we advise measures for increasing their predicting power.

TI  - \"Liaisons dangereuses\": The invasive red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer), a disperser of exotic plant species in New Caledonia
PY  - 2018
AB  - The biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia hosts high levels of endemism (74% of flora) that is threatened increasingly by climate change, habitat reduction, and invasive species. The fruit-eating red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) is currently invading the main island of the archipelago, and its recent dispersal out of urbanized habitats raises questions about its potential to disperse noxious plant seeds along urban corridors and beyond. Indeed, the red-vented bulbul is considered a vector of several introduced plant species in its alien range including Miconia calvescens, Lantana camara, and Schinus terebinthifolius. We conducted a quantitative assessment of the bulbul's fruits consumption by analyzing the gut contents of shot birds. We estimated gut passage times for four species of fruit found in gut contents (S.terebinthifolius, Myrtastrum rufopunctatum, Passiflora suberosa, and Ficus prolixa) and tested the effects of bird digestion on seed germination rates for two species. Finally, we monitored the movements of individual VHF radio-tagged red-vented bulbuls. All of the consumed fruit species we identified here have red fleshy diaspore, including fruit of the shrub M.rufopunctatum that occurred frequently (9.6%) in bulbul gut samples. Median gut passage times were short (15-41min), corresponding to short-distance seed transportation (77-92m). The effect of gut passage was positive for the germination of the invasive S.terebinthifolius and negative for the endemic M.rufopunctatum, suggesting a potential bias in the contribution to the dispersal toward alien species. This study provides the first integrated assessment of mechanisms involved in the seed dispersal effectiveness of this high-concern invasive bird species that is expected to face similar plant communities in most of its alien range in tropical islands. More generally, our results enhance knowledge of synergies between non-native frugivores and plant species dispersal.

TI  - Pavement and riparian forest shape the bird community along an urban river corridor
PY  - 2015
AB  - Knowledge of habitat use by animals within urban-riparian corridors during the breeding season is important for conservation, yet remains understudied. We examined the bird community along an urban-riparian corridor through metropolitan Boise, Idaho and predicted that occupancy of individual species and species richness would be greater in forested areas than in urbanized areas. We surveyed birds throughout the summers of 2009 and 2010 and quantified the m(2) of each cover-type within 50-m, 100-m, and 200-m buffers surrounding each survey location using satellite imagery. Occupancy modeling revealed that eight of 14 species analyzed were positively associated with riparian forest, and no species avoided forest. Species richness was negatively associated with the amount of paved surface within 100 m of a survey site with richness declining by more than two species for every hectare of paved surface. Most associations with cover-types - especially riparian forest-were at >= 100 m. Therefore, the riparian forest within 100 m of a given site along an urban-riparian corridor should be the most important for maintaining species richness. (C) 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Can Road-Crossing Structures Improve Population Viability of an Urban Gliding Mammal?
PY  - 2009
AB  - Tree-dwelling mammals are potentially highly vulnerable to discontinuities in habitat created by roads. We used population modeling to assess the viability of a metapopulation of Australia's largest gliding marsupial, the greater glider (Petauroides volans), occurring in forest remnants in the fastest-urbanizing region of Australia, where habitat is dissected by major roads. Crossing structures for arboreal mammals (consisting of a land bridge with wooden poles for gliding and adjacent rope canopy bridges) have been installed over an arterial road that separates two of these remnants (one large, one small). It is currently unknown whether this species will use the crossing structures, but available tree height and spacing do not allow a glide crossing, and fences with metal flashing prevent access to the road by terrestrial and arboreal mammals. Our modeling reveals that even a relatively low rate of dispersal facilitated by these structures would substantially reduce the probability of extinction of the smaller subpopulation. This rate of dispersal is plausible given the small distance involved (about 55 m). The inclusion of wildfire as a catastrophe in our model suggests that these two remnants may encounter an undesirable level of extinction risk. This can be reduced to an acceptable level by including inter-patch movement via dispersal among other forest remnants. However, this requires connection to a very large remnant 8 km away, through a set of remnants that straddle two motorways. These motorways create discontinuities in forest cover that are beyond the gliding ability of this species. Crossing structures will be required to enable inter-patch movement. A priority for future research should be whether the greater glider will use road-crossing structures. Loss of habitat and habitat connections is continuing in this landscape and is likely to have dire consequences for wildlife if land managers are unable to retain appropriate habitat cover with corridors and install effective wildlife road-crossing structures where large roads intersect wildlife habitat.

TI  - The Flows of Nature to People, and of People to Nature: Applying Movement Concepts to Ecosystem Services
PY  - 2021
AB  - To date, the provision of ecosystem services has largely been estimated based on spatial patterns of land cover alone, using benefit transfer analysis. Although it is increasingly being recognised that the distribution of the human population affects whether a potential service translates into a realised service, this misses key steps in the process and assumes that everyone accesses ecosystem services in the same way. Here we describe a conceptual approach to ecosystem services in terms of movement and flows. We highlight that ecosystem service flows can be broken down into 'nature to people' (the movement of nature towards beneficiaries) and 'people to nature' (the movement of beneficiaries towards nature). The former has been relatively well described. Here, we explore the latter by reviewing research on human migration, animal foraging and landscape connectivity. We assess if and how existing theories might be useful in describing how people seek out ecosystem services. We consider some of the ways in which flows of people to nature can be measured. Such measurements may reveal which movement theories best represent how people seek out and access ecosystem services. Overall, our review aims to improve the future modelling of ecosystem services by more explicitly considering how people access potential services and therefore realise them.

TI  - Large, connected floodplain forests prone to flooding best sustain plant diversity
PY  - 2016
AB  - Dams, levees, and water withdrawals disrupt hydrologic regimes and associated floodplain forests. Because these forests are also responding to changes in land use, species invasions, and climate change, the relative effects of these factors are hard to disentangle. Most studies of floodplain forests lack historic data, requiring us to rely on recent data or contemporary spatial relationships to these drivers to infer those causes of vegetation dynamics. Here, we use survey data from the 1950s to reconstruct plant community changes across 40 floodplain forests in Wisconsin. We applied two partial least squares regression (PLS) models to evaluate how current site and landscape scale conditions and changes in these conditions since the 1950s influence contemporary patterns of community diversity and composition. Local site variables were among the most important in explaining current composition metrics and their changes, but historic landscape variables and changes in these were also important. Current local diversity () was the highest at sites prone to frequent flooding, even at sites in fragmented landscapes. Sites along sinuous rivers in large watershed areas with more contiguous forest had the highest abundance of wetland indicator plants in the re-survey and had the largest increases in diversity since the 1950s, despite having the highest presence of exotic species then. These same sites have converged in composition, reflecting increases in wetland indicator plants and common native species. These patterns of increasing diversity coupled with declines in community distinctiveness are uncommon among long-term studies. Increases in wetland plants may indicate that sites have become wetter with hydrologic changes, but these increases may also reflect improved colonization and establishment processes involving a robust regional pool of generalist wetland taxa. Woody and exotic plants typical of upland forests increased at rarely flooded sites in fragmented and urbanizing landscapes, indicating shifts towards a later-successional conditions and a dampened disturbance regime. This has reduced local species diversity and increased regional distinctness at some sites. As hydrologic connections appear to best maintain native species diversity and composition, even in fragmented landscapes, managers should seek to recreate these whenever feasible.

TI  - Quercus and Pinus cover are determined by landscape structure and dynamics in peri-urban Mediterranean forest patches
PY  - 2008
AB  - Successional dynamics in Mediterranean forests have been modulated by anthropogenic disturbances during thousands of years, especially in areas densely populated since ancient times. Our objective is to determine whether pine tree cover (early-successional species) and oak tree cover (late-successional species), used as a surrogate of successional stage of peri-urban fragmented forests in the Valles lowlands (Catalonia, NE, Spain), are primarily determined by (1) climate and topography; (2) anthropogenic disturbances; (3) patch structure; or (4) patch dynamics from 1956 to 1993. Quercus spp. and Pinus spp. tree cover were separately recorded on 252 randomly selected plots of 100 m(2), within forest patches ranging in size from 0.25 to 218 ha. Multiple linear regressions indicated that forest patch history is the most important variable determining oak and pine tree cover: new forest patches showed higher pine and lower oak tree cover than recently split patches (i.e. those that became fragmented from large forest areas after 1956). Patches already existing as such in 1956 (pre-existent patches) showed higher pine cover than recently split patches. Oak cover increased and pine cover decreased with increasing forest connectivity of the patch. Finally, highly frequented forests were related to high cover of pines. Climatic and topographic variables were not significant. We conclude that pine and oak cover in these peri-urban forests are mainly determined by recent patch dynamics, but also by the spatial pattern of patches. However, human-induced disturbance can modulate this as there is some evidence for pine being associated with a high human frequentation.

TI  - The distribution of aquatic macrophytes in man-modified waterbodies of the Danube River in Bratislava region (Slovakia)
PY  - 2005
AB  - In course of our survey of aquatic vegetation, 49 species (Table 1) in three different man-modified waterbodies - two altered river-arms of the Danube river and one seepage canal - in the area of Bratislava city were evaluated in 2000-2001. The greatest impact on the richness of species diversity was caused by the loss of connectivity with the Danube river system. A continuous type of macrophyte distribution prevailed in the canalised bed. Timing of flood disturbances and historical genesis of the habitats have reflected in proportion of growth forms. The submersed hydrophytes dominated in the most recently created aquatic habitat, alternating with the local patches of acro-pleustophytes. The higher presence of floating leaf rhizophytes was recorded in more advanced successive stages. To retard the process of succession towards the terrestrial ecosystem, future management should consider the restoration of flow conditions in analysed habitats.

TI  - Suitability index for restoration in landscapes: An alternative proposal for restoration projects
PY  - 2016
AB  - Forest fragmentation constitutes one of the main consequences of land cover change worldwide. Through this process gaps in habitat coverage are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban (10.6%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4%). Although the land cover class \"wood sites\" increased, the data of SIR revealed that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able to use this model to determine local patches of high value for conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Is the riparian habitat creation an effective measure of plant conservation within the urbanized area?
PY  - 2015
AB  - The study presents results of habitat creation and riparian vegetation recovery in artificial oxbow lakes in urbanized area within the large river valley. The investigation of open water, rush and wet meadows flora and vegetation in three ponds located in the city centre of Opole was conducted in years 2001-2013. Oxbow lakes were constructed as a compensation measure and no vegetation was transplanted into the ponds on purpose. 13-years observation showed that (1) the red-listed species are able to spontaneous reoccurrence after habitat restoration, but they can thrive only in first years of oxbow lakes recolonisation process, (2) there are some restoration constraints, especially in relation to Phragmites australis and Nuphar lutea expansion, but alien species invasions were insignificant and (3) the species number and vegetation cover was constantly increasing during the recolonisation process in recreated oxbow lakes. The dynamic of vegetation was considerable, especially in first 6 years of experiment when the significant increase in diversity and richness of native plant species was observed. After that time, the increasing expansion of P. australis and N. lutea was noted causing the decline of several species and vegetation types. So, restoring just the environmental conditions may be sufficient for a limited period of time only. Strong disturbances, much intense that moderate inundations, imitating disastrous flooding within the valley each 10-13 years are need to maintain the ecological niches for river corridor and riparian species.

TI  - Assessment of light adequacy for vertical farming in a tropical city
PY  - 2018
AB  - The pursuit of urban agriculture as part of a city's green infrastructure is often a challenge, particularly within compact cities, where there is a limited amount of space between buildings for urban farming and gardening. Instead, such high-rise urban developments present often under-utilized spaces on the vertical surfaces of buildings. A key unknown is the adequacy of light for plant growth. Many leafy vegetables that require high amounts of light form a significant proportion of the staple diet in many Asian countries. We report on the assessment of sunlight adequacy for growing leafy vegetables in a compact tropical city, based on the high-rise and high-density residential environment of Singapore. Leaf physiological traits of seven leafy vegetables were assessed and used to estimate plant light requirements. A survey of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) along exposed corridors showed that the daily light integral (DLI) value ranged from 2 to 35 mol m(-2) d(-1) under relatively ideal weather conditions during days with abundant solar insolation, and facades that experienced a minimum of half-day direct insolation matched the light requirements of vegetables within the moderate to very high-light categories. With regard to the building form, PAR increased gradually with height, but remains highly influenced by facade orientation and configuration. Owing to the annual north-south oscillation of the sun's path, reduced annual PAR variability and higher total annual PAR at facades, buildings with an east-west orientation will better support continuous vegetable cultivation, especially for basic building typologies without self-shading configurations. However, excessive PAR and temperatures during mid-day hours may hinder plant growth. By highlighting such patterns in levels of PAR, this study confirms the potential for high-rise and high-density conditions in the tropics to support farming using typically under-utilized vertical spaces of residential buildings.

TI  - Conserving metapopulations in human-altered landscapes at the urban-rural fringe
PY  - 2013
AB  - The conversion of natural areas to human-dominated land uses results in loss, degradation, and fragmentation of wildlife habitat which often lead to species endangerment and local extinction. The risk of endangerment may be particularly acute for species that exist as metapopulations in which viability of the species is contingent upon dispersal of individuals among local sub-populations. This paper uses an optimization framework to investigate the problem of conserving metapopulations residing in areas at the urban-rural fringe. We compare the optimal allocation of preservation to outcomes of four other policy alternatives including the reserve-site-selection option that fully preserves habitat patches while allowing full development of the intervening dispersal matrix. In general, the optimal allocation includes some amount of preservation in both habitat patches and dispersal matrix, with the level of protection typically greater in habitat patches. The reserve-site-selection conservation option is optimal in only a few cases. Heterogeneity in terms of land use and landscape structure adds complexity to the optimal solution such that no one policy works well across all land units and in situations where the landscape structure is skewed, full protection of some land units and full development of others becomes more common.

TI  - Analyzing Land Cover Change and Urban Growth Trajectories of the Mega-Urban Region of Dhaka Using Remotely Sensed Data and an Ensemble Classifier
PY  - 2018
AB  - Accurate information on, and human interpretation of, urban land cover using satellite-derived sensor imagery is critical given the intricate nature and niches of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors occurring at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Foresta non-parametric ensemble classifier-has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km(2) in 1972 to 378 km(2) in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

TI  - Implementation of IoT Networks Based on MQTT for Wildlife Monitoring System
PY  - 2019
AB  - With the widespread use of the Internet of Things (IoT), use cases in IoT have been considered for solving social problems in various fields such as agriculture, welfare, disaster prevention, and transportation infrastructure. Additionally, crop damage caused by animals is a common occurrence all over the world. An example of such damage is the damage to agricultural crops and threat to elderly people owing to animals in Hakusan city, Ishikawa prefecture, where the Hakusan campus of the authors' university is located. Presently, measures against damage caused by animals are being implemented by installing animal traps and cages; however, it is necessary to patrol the conditions of capture, thereby increasing human effort. To solve this problem, the authors considered a wildlife monitoring system to remotely manage a cage by using a sensor or camera with Internet connectivity. Assuming that a large number of IoT devices would be used in such a system, the authors visualize a high network load problem. Therefore, the authors aim to reduce the load on the IoT network. In this paper, the part of the wildlife-monitoring system that is concerned the evaluation and consideration of network using MQTT is described.

TI  - You Can Bend Me but Can't Break Me: Vegetation Regeneration After Hurricane Maria Passed Over an Urban Coastal Wetland in Northeastern Puerto Rico
PY  - 2021
AB  - Tropical urban coastal wetland regeneration is complex. Wetland plant biodiversity varies due to past and present land use, nutrient inputs, hydrological conditions, and terrestrial/marine connectivity. The intensity of atmospheric disturbances, such as hurricanes, will determine these systems' level of disturbance and regeneration capacity. On September 20, 2017, category 4 hurricane Maria passed over Puerto Rico, leaving behind a path of destruction across the entire island, especially in coastal ecosystems, from the combined effects of winds, severe storm surges, and urban runoff. Our question was: to what extent do human-influenced coastal urban wetlands regenerate after such a massive event. This study determines the spatio-temporal regeneration dynamics of plant cover and composition during the first 2 years after hurricane Maria in a coastal urban wetland, cienaga Las Cucharillas, located in San Juan Bay. We assessed the distribution of plant functional types using small unmanned aerial vehicles (s-UAV) and monitored climate and environmental data (salinity, phreatic water levels, and precipitation). Wetland vegetation cover had a high recovery rate - 16 months after the hurricane, vegetation cover occupied 87% of the study area. We found a successional pattern of plant regeneration that seemed to be partly explained by the fast-slow continuum. Plants with high specific leaf area (SLA) colonized bare soil spaces first. Plant regeneration also varied according to changes in phreatic water conductivity and waterlogging. Isotopic analyses of plant species signaled high nutrient availability, increasing the system's regeneration speed. After 2 years, the wetland's plant cover and composition of functional plant types proved resilient to the initial hurricane effect and subsequent changes in conductivity and freshwater conditions. Further studies will expand how spatio-temporal conditions will affect long-term plant community dynamics.

TI  - AMPHIBIAN DIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION IN THE EJIDO TIERRA y LIBERTAD, SOUTHWESTERN CHIAPAS, MEXICO
PY  - 2022
AB  - constitute one of the richest and most endangered groups in Mexico; however, their diversity and threat factors at the regional level remain little known in many parts of the country, including in protected areas. We analyzed amphibian diversity of the Ejido Tierra y Libertad, Municipality of Jiquipilas, Chiapas, Mexico, 40% of which occurs within the La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biosfera La Sepultura, or REBISE). We conducted fieldwork from January 2016 to April 2020, including 980 person-hours of systematic sampling across 11 transects spanning different habitat types. We documented 20 amphibian species, including the first record of the Yellowbelly Mushroomtongue Salamander (Bolitoglossa flaviventris) for the REBISE. Seven of these amphibian species are included in some risk category: three in the NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 of the Mexican federal government, two in the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and two categorized in both. The Common Leaf-litter Frog (Craugastor loki) was the most abundant species, and together with four other anuran species, constituted 82.1% of the total abundance observed. Inter-transect faunal similarity was generally associated with proximity, forest corridor connectivity, and the presence of water. Conserved Semi-Deciduous Forest had the highest alpha diversity, but somewhat surprisingly, urban and some disturbed habitats had the highest species richness. Pasture was the least rich and diverse habitat, however, so we discuss the consequences of ongoing expansion of pastures on amphibian populations. We propose conservation measures intended to promote both amphibian diversity and human health.

TI  - Enlightenments from potted landscapes (Bonsai and Penjing) for urban revegetation in the built environment
PY  - 2020
AB  - Impervious surfaces in modern cities can be used for revegetation. However, the ecological quality of below-ground ecosystem components and constrained soil space are crucial factors that limit habitat restoration. The long-term development of Bonsai (Penjing) trees has resulted in mature theories and techniques that suggest optimal root-canopy ratios. Considering the similarities with constrained pot landscapes, some \"enlightenments\", or key findings, derived from Bonsai theory can also be applied to urban special revegetation (USR). In this study, we analyzed the root-shoot correlations of the different styles of Bonsai trees and provide and assessment on the relationships between Bonsai theory and USR. Using an on-site survey and biomass experiment, nine \"enlightenments\" from Bonsai theory are proposed: positive root-canopy correlation, environmental stress increasing the root-shoot ratio, connectivity of the tree bark \"water line\", rebalancing after disruption of the root-canopy balance, precise root and canopy design, artificial auxiliary fixation of the root, control of growth, horticultural reshaping skills, and plant diversity. In particular, for the successful establishment of urban rebuilt environments, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of root-canopy correlations. Therefore, we suggest that the four main types of USR (green roofs, vertical greening, container gardening, and street trees) should follow the core principle based on the root-shoot balance to effectively design both the root and canopy.

TI  - EECASC: an energy efficient communication approach in smart cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - The power consumption and connectivity of mobile nodes to the network are two essential issues in smart cities. In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized approach for mobility management of mobile nodes in smart cities. We propose a customized communication protocol compliant with 6LoWPAN along with the scheme that consumes less power regarding previous solutions. The proposed approach organizes static nodes as a tree for efficient routing, automatic addressing, and handling movement of mobile nodes. The proposed approach has a hybrid data transmission capability by proactively choosing multi-hop or single-hop routing to reduce power consumption of mobile nodes. It is evaluated based on different factors. The results show the superiority of the approach compared with the previous works. The promising analytical results manifest the higher performance (about 10% compared to the best scheme) of the proposed approach specifically in reducing the power consumption of mobile nodes.

TI  - Connectivity: insights from the US Long Term Ecological Research Network
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex and surprising ways. Ongoing demand for critical ecosystem services requires an understanding of the populations and communities in these ecosystems in the future. This paper represents a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the core research area of \"populations and communities.\" The objective of this effort was to show the importance of long-term data collection and experiments for addressing the hardest questions in scientific ecology that have significant implications for environmental policy and management. Each LTER site developed at least one compelling case study about what their site could look like in 50-100 yr as human and environmental drivers influencing specific ecosystems change. As the case studies were prepared, five themes emerged, and the studies were grouped into papers in this LTER Futures Special Feature addressing state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the \"connectivity\" theme and has examples from the Phoenix (urban), Niwot Ridge (alpine tundra), McMurdo Dry Valleys (polar desert), Plum Island (coastal), Santa Barbara Coastal (coastal), and Jornada (arid grassland and shrubland) sites. Connectivity has multiple dimensions, ranging from multi-scalar interactions in space to complex interactions over time that govern the transport of materials and the distribution and movement of organisms. The case studies presented here range widely, showing how land-use legacies interact with climate to alter the structure and function of arid ecosystems and flows of resources and organisms in Antarctic polar desert, alpine, urban, and coastal marine ecosystems. Long-term ecological research demonstrates that connectivity can, in some circumstances, sustain valuable ecosystem functions, such as the persistence of foundation species and their associated biodiversity or, it can be an agent of state change, as when it increases wind and water erosion. Increased connectivity due to warming can also lead to species range expansions or contractions and the introduction of undesirable species. Continued long-term studies are essential for addressing the complexities of connectivity. The diversity of ecosystems within the LTER network is a strong platform for these studies.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCENARIOS FOR LAND PLANNING OF PERMANENT PRESERVATION AREAS IN SOROCABA, SP
PY  - 2014
AB  - The present study aimed to analyze the importance of the Permanent Preservation Areas (PPA) for the forest remnants maintenance in the city of Sorocaba, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A forest remnants map was made using aerial photographs from 2006, and hydrographic and slope maps were used to PPA determination. Two scenarios were compared with landscape metrics: real (with current forest) and ideal ( current forest adding the PPA restoration). The results showed that 19% of the city territory were classified as PPA, and from this area, only 45% have forest cover. The preserved PPA represents 50% of all forest cover in the landscape. Restoring the PPA would increase from 16.68% to 28% of forest cover landscape and enable the emergence of fragments larger than 3,000 ha. In the real scenario, the bigger fragments have 300 ha. The presence of forest remnants is closely related to PPA areas: riverbanks, floodplains and hillside, where urban occupation was hampered and there is legal protection. The situation shows that the PPA play a fundamental role in forest patches conservation in a largely urbanized city, where natural areas support pressure. The evaluation of the scenarios showed that the incorporation of the legal provisions in planning and territorial ordering subsides the strategies for the maintenance of natural habitats and, consequently the reduction of the negative effects on biodiversity. However, the recent changes in Forest Code may represent a retrocession in the environmental scenario against to the increasing urbanization.

TI  - An urban fern refugium: Municipal Ecological Reserve of Avellaneda (Eco Area) (Buenos Aires, Argentina)
PY  - 2021
AB  - The riparian forest is one of the most diverse environments of the La Plata River plains. It is represented by patches of humid forests, which are a valuable source of ecosystem services and have recreational and educational potential. However, the riparian forest has undergone constant modification, worsened by private real-estate developments and a lack of government regulation. Among the reserves that protect the riparian forest, the Municipal Ecological Reserve of Avellaneda is the closest to the southern limit of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Although there are around 300 species of wild fauna and flora informally registered in the area, there are only a few studies published about its biodiversity. In this work, the diversity of thirteen native and exotic ferns in the core area (Eco area) of the reserve is characterized, the origin of the species is also evaluated and comparisons are made with other nearby protected areas. The Eco area of the Reserve plays an important role as part of the urban reserve corridor of the La Plata River plains and constitutes a refuge for both native and exotic ruderal species. The present work represents the basis for future studies about the population dynamics and the colonization strategies of the ferns.

TI  - The importance of habitat design and aquatic connectivity in amphibian use of urban stormwater retention ponds
PY  - 2012
AB  - Stormwater retention ponds in urbanizing catchments are constructed to collect and treat runoff from impervious surfaces. Amphibians often inhabit retention ponds, which may partly offset the loss of natural wetlands resulting from urbanization. We investigated the use of retention ponds by frogs in a rapidly-urbanizing region of south-eastern Australia to (1) determine the habitat attributes associated with individual species, and (2) recommend specific wetland design criteria to enhance populations of frog species in the region and in other urbanizing areas throughout their distribution. We detected nine species of frogs during calling surveys at 30 retention pond sites in Greater Melbourne, 2008-2010. There were contrasting differences in habitat associations among five species for which we produced regression models of abundance or occurrence. The mean abundance of Crinia signifera increased with site area, whereas Limnodynastes dumerilii was associated with smaller sites. The occurrence of L. dumerilii was positively associated with waterbody shore depth, whereas L. peronii and L. tasmaniensis were associated with shallow shores. Two species were positively associated with time since construction or since dredging of a site, whereas the occurrence of L. dumerilii decreased with site age. Aquatic vegetation at a site was important for the occurrence of L. peronii and Litoria ewingii. There was evidence for a positive effect of aquatic connectivity on the occurrence of Limnodynastes peronii, which emphasizes the importance of riparian corridors in urban settings. These results highlight the contrasting differences in habitat associations among species in the region. We recommend that retention ponds in our region and elsewhere be constructed or enhanced to include specific habitat attributes that were found to be associated with different amphibian species. We recommend long-term monitoring at sites to determine whether retention ponds augment existing frog populations or contribute to declines.

TI  - Natural Plant Establishment along an Urban Stream, Onondaga Creek, New York
PY  - 2014
AB  - Urbanization results in a suite of harmful effects to streams, including removal or degradation of riparian vegetation. Many stream-restoration programs address this by adding plants, with limited quantitative knowledge about vegetation dynamics already occurring within the stream corridor. This project examined natural plant establishment along an urbanized stream channel in Syracuse, NY. It had three objectives: first, to relate plant establishment along an urban stream gradient to substrate condition; second, to quantify seeds dormant in the soil at those same sites; and third, to indicate what passive revegetation responses might occur to various treatments along a rural-to-urban gradient. Three sites were selected along such a gradient on Onondaga Creek, near Syracuse, NY. Vegetation plots were established at each site to assess plant germination and establishment under substrate conditions designed to mimic restoration interventions. We also conducted a seedbank study using soil cores collected from these sites. Plant communities were dominated by grasses and forbs. Numbers of alien species increased from 34% at more rural sites to 51% at more urban sites. Seedlings of native riparian trees nonetheless germinated at all three sites along the gradient. Recruitment of native riparian trees (especially Populus deltoides [Eastern Cottonwood], Fraxinus pennsylvanica [Green Ash], and Acer negundo [Boxelder]) exceeded non-native and invasive ones. The riparian seedbank showed disproportionate dominance by herbaceous plants (95.5% of individuals) at all locations surveyed, and invasive species were common (about 25% of all germinants). This study shows some potential for natural regeneration of native trees, but also found a significant source of invasive plants in the soil seedbank that could reduce restoration success. Notably, the study recorded the presence of 16 bryophyte taxa, and the common ones were those typically associated with disturbances.

TI  - Urban resilience and green infrastructure systems: towards a multidimensional evaluation
PY  - 2020
AB  - Multifunctional and connected green infrastructure (GI) systems have been linked to urban resilience. Although there have been significant scholarly efforts to assess resilience and to evaluate the benefits of GI, it remains unclear the degree in which GI efforts enhance resilience. Following theoretical frameworks that study coupled infrastructure systems, this paper explores the state of the art on the contribution of GI to urban resilience from multiple dimensions: (1) policy - that promotes the adoption of GI, (2) performance - assessment of GI impacts on water infrastructure systems resilience, (3) connectivity - evaluation of human and wildlife movement through GI, and (4) social - community cohesion as a result of GI efforts. We argue that beyond their individual contributions to supporting urban resilience, the interactions across the various dimensions are key to enhancing resilience. Ultimately, participatory processes are needed to assess resilience originating from GI systems and avoid injustice.

TI  - THE AVIAN POPULATION OF AN URBAN BUSHLAND RESERVE AT WOLLONGONG, NEW-SOUTH-WALES - IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT
PY  - 1993
AB  - This study focuses on the avian ecology and management of a 43.5 ha remnant hind-dune and estuary ecosystem in suburban Wollongong (population 200 000). In total, 62 land-bird species and 24 water-bird species were present between July 1984 and February 1987 (32 months). During area searches (n = 12) in each calendar month, an average of 427 individuals of 31 species was recorded with an average species diversity of 70%. The avian population was characterised by a small number of species with high abundance and vice versa. Five species were migratory. Resident species ranged in abundance from the Eastern Whipbird Psophodes olivaceus (maximum population eight birds) to the New Holland Honeyeater Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (maximum population 200 birds). Numbers of the latter species increased markedly in autumn and winter when banksia and coral trees were rich with nectar. Most terrestrial species were habitat specialists, linked to the various microhabitats for food, nesting or protection. Recommendations to preserve the bird community are as follows: (1) the catchment should be managed to control siltation and contamination of the wetland, rather than dredging the estuary itself, (2) wetland diversity should be maintained by allowing water levels to vary naturally; (3) terrestrial microhabitats should be preserved by maintaining their structural and floristic diversity; (4) refuge areas should be established to minimise the impact of human-related disturbance; (5) a network of corridors should be provided to facilitate movement of birds into the reserve; (6) a buffer zone should be maintained around the reserve to shield the birdlife from suburban disturbance and domestic animals.

TI  - Water dispersal of vegetative bulbils of the invasive exotic Dioscorea oppositifolia L. in southern Illinois
PY  - 2005
AB  - Riparian corridors promote dispersal of several species of exotic invasives worldwide. Dispersal plays a role in the colonization of exotic invasive species into new areas and this study was conducted to determine if the invasiveness of Dioscorea oppositifolia L. (Chinese yam) is facilitated by secondary dispersal of vegetative diaspores (bulbils) by water. Since seed production of this plant has not been observed in the United States, bulbils represent the only means of dispersal to new habitats. Dispersal was monitored by placing aquatic traps, tethered bulbils, and painted bulbil caches in a tributary of Drury Creek, Giant City State Park, Illinois. Results indicate that high-energy flow in the creek accelerated secondary dispersal of bulbils downstream and onto the floodplain. The longest recorded dispersal distance was 206.2 in downstream. Dispersal distance of tethered bulbils was not related to rainfall or flow velocity in the creek; however the total number of bulbils trapped was positively related to flow velocity. We conclude that secondary dispersal by water in streams can facilitate dispersal of vegetative bulbils of this exotic species.

TI  - Conifer plantations consistently act as barriers to movement in a deciduous forest songbird: A translocation experiment
PY  - 2012
AB  - Many authors have concluded that habitat loss has a greater influence on biodiversity than habitat fragmentation per se. Yet, several animal species have been shown to be reluctant to move across inhospitable landscape matrices, a phenomenon that would be expected to exacerbate fragmentation effects. In this study, we tested the ability of a forest songbird (Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapilla) to move across two contrasting landscapes whose matrix (intensively managed forest) would be expected to be relatively permeable compared to agricultural or urban matrices. We hypothesized that males would be less likely to return to their territory in a landscape dominated by forest generally unsuitable for breeding (spruce plantations) than in another dominated by potential breeding habitat (deciduous forest). The probability of resighting translocated males (n = 48) on their territory was significantly lower in the plantation landscape and this relationship was consistent over two successive years. Neither translocation time nor body mass, time of capture, or structural size were significant predictors of probability of resighting. Although this species is sufficiently vagile to return quickly to its territory (e.g. one male returning in less than 2 h), these results indicate that even a forested matrix may impose a resistance to the movements of a forest bird species when its structure or composition differs from that of breeding habitat. Matrix resistance to movements potentially restricts the ability of individuals to detect and colonize suitable habitat fragments. Less vagile species would be even more affected and, therefore, we submit that a more inclusive perspective on effects of landscape change is warranted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Urban green infrastructure as a tool for controlling the resilience of urban sprawl
PY  - 2021
AB  - This paper is aimed to analyze the existing relationships and controlling functions between the urban green infrastructures on the resilience of the urban sprawl. The analysis begins questioning whether urban sprawl sustainable growth can be controlled after achieving urban supported by urban green infrastructure. The analytic method used is based on developing a conceptual and theoretical framework of reference to review the literature on the main variables of the research: Green infrastructure, resilience, and urban sprawl. It is concluded that while it is difficult to find linear causality in a direct relationship among the variables of the analysis, it is supported by the existence of more holistic connectivity leading to the controlling of the urban sprawl. The analysis suggests that a holistic approach is required to build urban resilience based on green infrastructure by addressing a fuller range of ecosystem disturbances and disasters, to create the outcomes that develop the environmental and ecological benefits of urban spectrum of ecosystem disturbances and disasters, to create the outcomes that develop the environmental and ecological benefits of urban sprawl.

TI  - Habitat management lessons from the environs of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge
PY  - 2014
AB  - The Detroit River and western Lake Erie, located in the heart of the Great Lakes basin, support a great diversity of fish and wildlife, and their habitats, despite the enormity of habitat losses due to urban development and industrialization. This ecosystem also links Canada and the U.S. who share a long history of cooperative conservation. The river and lake are: at the intersection of two major North American bird migration flyways (i.e., the Atlantic and Mississippi); a significant fish migration corridor; and well recognized for their unique biodiversity. Over the past three decades much has been done to improve environmental conditions and to restore and conserve habitats. This paper reviews habitat management efforts within the environs of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge and provides advice to improve such efforts in the future. Ecological improvements resulting from these habitat projects, as well as the cumulative effects of these changes, have yet to be quantified or evaluated against existing program goals or targets. Habitat management remains a fragmented responsibility among many agencies and interests, which is often an obstacle to realizing ecological improvements, recovery, and sustainability. Moreover, cumulative habitat modifications are not reviewed often enough with respect to their impacts on the goals and targets established in existing programs, as well as their impacts on ecosystem results (e.g., fish or wildlife productivity). Clearly, there is a need to share experiences, synthesize science, learn from mistakes and successes, coordinate activities, and transfer knowledge on best practices and ecological effectiveness of habitat management.

TI  - Richness, composition and abundance of species in a riparian plant community in the Santa Catarina river, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon
PY  - 2020
AB  - Riparian vegetation constitutes a key element for the maintenance of fluvial ecosystems, especially for those that are surrounded by ur\" Jan zones. The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition and variation of riparian vegetation in a stretch of the Santa Catarina river, over two cities of the Monterrey Metropolitan Area. For the analysis of the vegetation, sampling transects were established in a section of 15.65 km. The high stratum (shrub and tree plants) was analyzed using a Bray-Curtis ordering model and a dominance-diversity plot. The Jaccard similarity coefficient was used for the low stratum (herbaceous plants). In the high stratum, 16 families belonging to 25 genera and 28 species were recorded. The species with the highest number of individuals were Salix nigra, Leucaena leucocephala, Ricinus communis and Parkinsonia aculeata. The composition of the vegetation has a similarity level of intermediate to high. because the groups vary between 60 % to 71.53 %. In thelow stratum. 25 families. 53 genera and 60 species were recorded with a similarity level of low to intermediate, because the groups vary between 23 to 47 %. The species that were mostly registered in the low stratum were Cyperus involucratus in 7 sites, and Eragrostis mexicana, Heliantus annuus, Melinis repens, Polygonum pensylvanicum and Typha domingensis in six sites each one. The composition of the vegetation is in a secondary successional state, because the species with greater presence are exotic or invasive, such as Leucaena leucocephala and Ricinus communis for the high stratum and Cyperus involucratus, Typha aomingensis and Melinis repens for the low stratum.

TI  - Prospecting the potential of ecosystem restoration: A proposed framework and a case study
PY  - 2017
AB  - Projects focusing on the restoration of degraded ecosystems have to be financially appealing, spatially multiscaled, and ecologically efficient. Considering such premises, a model was elaborated to assess the locals in relation to the kind of management to be adopted (conservation or restoration) and, for locals indicated for restoration, the kind of restoration to be adopted (assisted or passive). Furthermore, we propose a set of ecologically-based alternatives at medium-and local-scaleto assist the restoration of areas considered unsuitable for passive restoration. Such techniques are: install artificial connectors among forest fragments near each other, or, for areas where forest fragments are far each other, install nucleation techniques, revitalization of concrete-lined urban rivers, and the control of erosion and invasive plant species. We tested the potential of our model through a case study carried out in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The study area is predominantly occupied by pasture lands, but urbanization also is an important land cover category. There are 661 forest fragments, being 25 of them larger than 50 ha. From the area considered \"non-habitat\", i.e., modified due to human usage, 35.5% of the total study area and 45.5% of the study area classified as non-habitat is suitable for passive restoration, and the rest of the area needs is suitable only for assisted restoration techniques. We verified that the facility and low cost of installation are advantageous features of such techniques and the results obtained by mean of application of the assisted techniques indicate that the alternatives tend to accelerate the process of establishing connectivity of the landscape in locals devoid of connections.

TI  - Low redundancy and complementarity shape ecosystem functioning in a low-diversity ecosystem
PY  - 2020
AB  - Ecosystem functioning is positively linked to biodiversity on land and in the sea. In high-diversity systems (e.g. coral reefs), species coexist by sharing resources and providing similar functions at different temporal or spatial scales. How species combine to deliver the ecological function they provide is pivotal for maintaining the structure, functioning and resilience of some ecosystems, but the significance of this is rarely examined in low-diversity systems such as estuaries. We tested whether an ecological function is shaped by biodiversity in a low-diversity ecosystem by measuring the consumption of carrion by estuarine scavengers. Carrion (e.g. decaying animal flesh) is opportunistically fed on by a large number of species across numerous ecosystems. Estuaries were chosen as the model system because carrion consumption is a pivotal ecological function in coastal seascapes, and estuaries are thought to support diverse scavenger assemblages, which are modified by changes in water quality and the urbanization of estuarine shorelines. We used baited underwater video arrays to record scavengers and measure the rate at which carrion was consumed by fish in 39 estuaries across 1,000 km of coastline in eastern Australia. Carrion consumption was positively correlated with the abundance of only one species, yellowfin bream Acanthopagrus australis, which consumed 58% of all deployed carrion. The consumption of carrion by yellowfin bream was greatest in urban estuaries with moderately hardened shorelines (20%-60%) and relatively large subtidal rock bars (>0.1 km(2)). Our findings demonstrate that an ecological function can be maintained across estuarine seascapes despite both limited redundancy (i.e. dominated by one species) and complementarity (i.e. there is no spatial context where the function is delivered significantly when yellowfin bream are not present) in the functional traits of animal assemblages. The continued functioning of estuaries, and other low-diversity ecosystems, might therefore not be tightly linked to biodiversity, and we suggest that the preservation of functionally dominant species that maintain functions in these systems could help to improve conservation outcomes for coastal seascapes.

TI  - The skipper butterflies (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) of the Reserva Ecologica Leonelo Oviedo, San Jose, Costa Rica
PY  - 2019
AB  - Hesperiidae is one of the most diverse families of butterflies in Costa Rica, with approximately 486 species. Even so, there are few butterfly lists where this group has been included. In this paper, we present information on seasonality, abundance and natural history features of this family for the Leonelo Oviedo Ecological Reserve (RELO), a 2 ha forest embedded in an urban matrix. Over the course of two years, a monthly sampling was carried out on a 270 m trail across the Reserve from 08:00 to 12:00, collecting all the individuals located within 5 m on each side of the trail. To better represent the richness, individuals were also randomly collected for more than ten years, but the butterflies collected in this way were not included in the statistical analysis. Photographs were taken of all the species in order to provide an identification guide. For the cryptic species, drawings and dissections of the genitalia were made. For the community indexes we used Microsoft Excel and the Shannon index with base two logarithm. For the summary of the monthly data analysis were done according to dry and wet season. For a comparison of richness and abundance we did a g-test to evaluate if there are differences between seasons; however, with the use of the R package vegan a hierarchical cluster analysis was done using the Jaccard index with Wards minimum variance agglomerative method. With R package pvclust the uncertainty of the clusters based on a bootstrap with 10 000 iterations. 423 individuals of 49 species were included in the statistical analysis, from a total of 435 individuals of 58 species. A tendency to greater richness and abundance of skippers was found during the dry season. Through the cluster analysis, it was possible to determine that in relation to the diversity of skippers, both wet seasons are grouped significantly (P = 0.05). The dry seasons are also grouped significantly (P = 0.05). The reserve has connectivity with other green areas via a stream. During the wet season, plant growth increases connectivity, which could lead to the entry of new individuals of different species that are not permanent residents of RELO and establish small populations, increasing the richness and abundance of species. This added to the variation in the occurrence of some species of butterflies in response to seasonal variations and differences in the availability of resources in different seasons explains the grouping of species between seasons.

TI  - Grasshopper response to reductions in habitat area as mediated by subfamily classification and life history traits
PY  - 2011
AB  - Although the loss of species is often attributed to reductions in habitat area, heterogeneity and connectivity, species specific traits and taxonomic relatedness can be important in explaining which species groups may be most impacted by the fragmentation process. In this study, using urban grassland fragments within the Front Range of northern Colorado, USA, we quantified the degree to which grasshopper species numbers declined with reductions in habitat area. We then examined the degree to which subfamily grouping (Gomphocerinae, Melanoplinae, Oedipodinae) and variation in life history characteristics (body size, dispersal ability, feeding preference and juvenile emergence time) explained which grasshopper species groups might be most impacted by reductions in habitat size. Our results showed a strong species-area relationship for grasshoppers across the urban fragments. Grasshoppers in different subfamily groupings were found to respond differentially, with the Melanoplinae being least affected by reductions in habitat area, while the other subfamilies responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. Species with different feeding strategies were also found to respond differentially, with forbivorous species being least affected by the reductions in habitat area, while the graminivorous and herbivorous (mixed-feeders) responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. As Melanoplinae tend to be forb feeders, this may partially explain why the subfamily was not as affected by the fragmentation process as the Gomphocerinae and Oedipodinae (who tend to be grass and mixed-feeders, respectively). Species that differed in body size and dispersal ability did not display differential responses to reductions in habitat area.

TI  - The effects of urbanization on biodiversity and water quality in the Rio das Velhas basin, Brazil
PY  - 2005
AB  - In Brazil, most urban sewage is discharged without treatment into rivers. This is the situation for the Rio das Velhas, which receives in its upper course the sewage of the state capital of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, with more than 2.4 million inhabitants. Our study focuses on the effects of basin urbanization on aquatic biodiversity and water quality in the Rio das Velhas. We use the assemblage structure and taxonomic composition of fishes and benthic macro invertebrates as biological indicators of water quality. Effects of Belo Horizonte's discharge included changes in water quality and declines in fish and benthos richness and diversity. However, the absence of dams in the Rio das Velhas main course, associated with connectivity with the Rio Sao Francisco system and tributaries in excellent condition, increase its rehabilitation potential.

TI  - Exploiting three dimensional vegetation structure to map wildland extent
PY  - 2012
AB  - Wildland and wilderness refer to areas of land which have been subject to little or no modification by human activity. These areas are important due to their role as wildlife habitats, the contributions they make to air and water quality and for human recreation. However, the intermingling of wildland and homes also increases the risk to life and property through wildfires. Management of this risk requires current and detailed knowledge of the spatial extent of wildland. What constitutes wildland vegetation is often difficult to define and may be influenced by both the horizontal continuity and vertical structure. We present a method to map wildland vegetation based on a combination of a vertically stratified cover threshold and spatial morphology.. To test its practical application, the method was applied to airborne lidar data collected prior to a major wildfire that occurred in Australia in 2009. Distance between the lidar defined wildland extent and homes impacted by the fire was assessed and compared to previously published data using manual delineation of wildland extent. Results showed that the proportion of homes destroyed at the wildland boundary was greater than reported in previous fires and that there was an exponential decline in the proportion of homes destroyed as a function of distances to wildland. Although the method is objective the extent of wildland depends on the parameters which define thresholds of cover and lateral extent and connectivity. This highlights the need for a clear definition of wildland that can be used to determine extent using objective methods such as those described, whether this is in the context of quantifying wildfire vulnerability or other related applications such as ecological assessment and monitoring.

TI  - Combating Urban Heat Island Effect-A Review of Reflective Pavements and Tree Shading Strategies
PY  - 2021
AB  - Pavements occupy about 40% of urban land cover, with 75-80% black top roads, playing a critical role in urban connectivity and mobility. Solar energy is absorbed and stored in pavements leading to an increase in surface temperatures. Decreasing green cover is further contributing to rise in regional temperatures. Due to this activity, the city experiences urban heat island (UHI). This study presents a critical review of the literature on mitigation measures to combat UHI using reflective pavements with an emphasis on durability properties and impacts of tree canopy. The strategies with a focus on application of chip seals, white toppings, and coatings were discussed. Role of surface reflectance, including those from asphalt and concrete pavements, albedo improvements, and technological trends, application of waste materials, and industrial by-products are presented. Also, urban tree shading systems' contribution to pavement temperature and microclimate systems is presented. The review shows that the development of mitigation measures using tree shading systems can reduce the pavement temperature during daytime and increase human thermal comfort. The outcomes of this review provide a scope for future studies to develop sustainable and state-of-the-art engineering solutions in the field of reflective coatings and urban forest systems.

TI  - Transient persistence of bobcat (Lynx rufus) occurrence throughout a human-dominated landscape
PY  - 2022
AB  - Human developments have detrimental effects on wildlife populations globally with carnivores being particularly sensitive. The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is often considered an adaptable mesocarnivore that occurs throughout varied landcover types within its wide distribution and may be less susceptible to the negative effects of development. Our objectives were to investigate the landscape occupancy dynamics of bobcats in a highly developed and densely populated region of the northeastern United States to evaluate the sensitivity of bobcat occurrence to natural and anthropogenic landscape features. We established a large-scale camera trapping survey throughout Rhode Island, USA, sampling from 2018 to 2020. Using dynamic occupancy models, we found initial site occupancy was positively influenced by the amount of forested wetland habitat, while increasing road density and shrub cover negatively influenced the probability of site colonization. Surprisingly, we found no hypothesized variables to influence site-level extirpation probability, or any seasonal effects on dynamic parameters. Lastly, we found that forest cover and road density negatively influenced the probability of detection. The probability of occupancy was high, >0.8, throughout much of the study area (49%), but we also found relatively high site transients, with the probability a site would change occurrence status from season to season at approximate to 0.27 in the majority of the study area (70%). Our results show that although bobcats can persist in human-dominated landscapes, they require contiguous natural areas to do so. Future expansion of road infrastructure may reduce habitat connectivity and increase road mortalities, thus jeopardizing the population.

TI  - Picking up the pieces: a biosphere reserve framework for a fragmented landscape - The Coastal Lowlands of the Western Cape, South Africa
PY  - 1999
AB  - The coastal lowlands of the Western Cape (CLWC) form part of the fynbos biome, an area renowned for its high levels of plant diversity and endemism. The vegetation of the CLWC has been severely reduced and fragmented, and is currently impacted on by agricultural, pastoral, coastal resort and urban development, as well as alien plant spread. Furthermore, most of the vegetation communities are under-represented within existing protected areas. In response to this urgent need for increased conservation efforts, an initiative to establish a UNESCO-MAB biosphere reserve in the area has been launched. The aim of this project was to use biological criteria to identify areas that could potentially contain the core areas and buffer zones of a biosphere reserve. A reserve selection algorithm was chosen which provides a flexible tool for selecting representative areas for protection. The algorithm is a step-wise heuristic, which has rules for including mandatory polygons, forcing adjacency, including desirable (e.g. Red Data Book plant species) and excluding undesirable features (e.g. bisection by major roads). Farm boundaries (cadastral units) were used as selection units, resulting in a total of 1717 parcels. The selection process was conducted three times with target areas set at 10%, 25% and 50% of the original extent of each vegetation type within the study area. Areas of 62 834 ha, 121 199 ha and 242 397 ha, respectively, or 36% 49% and 76% of the available land in the study area being selected. It is recommended that the area identified as the 50% target area be considered the future site of core areas and buffer zones for the proposed biosphere reserve. The algorithm successfully maintained a high degree of connectivity between selected areas. This is important considering the high levels of plant beta diversity associated with edaphic gradients. Rather than presenting a definitive reserve system, this study provides a tool allowing biological criteria to be included explicitly within the negotiation process. As the biosphere reserve is assembled, priorities can be re-assessed.

TI  - Engaging in social interaction: relationships between the accessibility of path structure and intensity of passive social interaction in urban parks
PY  - 2022
AB  - Purpose - Functioning as space connectors, path structures in urban parks may rarely present social interaction opportunities, although centralized activity spaces are available. This paper investigated the interrelationships between the visual and physical accessibility attributes of path structure and their impacts on passive social interaction intensity across urban parks in Kuala Lumpur. Design/methodology/approach - The concept of social interaction has been studied elsewhere in social cohesion, social affiliation and sense of communication. Still, it has not been studied in the context of urban park design. This study employed mixed methods using an adaptive and unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data collections to analyze urban parks with a bit of visual vegetation barrier. The experiential landscape method was applied to determine visual accessibility by interpreting experiential landscape maps. The space syntax method based on quantitative analysis is considered to measure physical accessibilities and vigorous activities along the designated paths by conducting integration analysis and gate observation. The data were crossed-analyzed using a Geographic Information System (GIS) classification technique, correlation analysis and Microsoft combo-charts to generate the relationship between patterns of activities and their accessibilities. Findings - The results suggested that designated paths with higher accessibility attributes, impressively more elevated than other tracks, could influence the intensity of passive social interactions. The findings supported the understanding that activity nodes and active areas adjoining designated routes could make accessibility attribute areas more critical. These findings verify that visually enriching the spaces along the path structure toward activities is a pivotal contributor to urban planners and designers to enhance the paths' local integration (LI) and visual accessibility to predict more passive eye contact among park visitors. Research limitations/implications - The proposed interrelationship among variables in this study has limitations because of not considering other qualitative methods and techniques like cognitive maps and interview simultaneously. These techniques could discover why some paths generate more passive eye contact among park users (Mohammadi Tahroodi, 2018). Practical implications - Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 emphasizes Kuala Lumpur's unique image as a tropical garden city via preserving and developing the iconic historical urban parks in the city center (CHKL, 2004, pp. 3-3). The latest Draft Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2040 has outlined the strategy to achieve a conducive, good-quality neighborhood that encourages social interaction. The findings could assist urban planners and designers better public parks by considering accessibility and permeability aspects of design. This research endorses the appropriateness of interrelationship between accessibility attributes of path structure and social interaction in urban design research, which local urban designers have not fully considered until now. Evaluating the visual convenience of designated paths and assessing LI of the axial lines constructing each designated route of urban parks during the primary stage could enable urban designers to estimate to what extent the paths are accessible and respond to passive social interaction. Then they could enrich with salient landmarks, views and activity nodes to make them attractive. The considerable number of designated paths connections, specifically while they shape the sides of activity nodes, could increase the connectivity and integration of spaces within the parks. These patterns of positioning the activity nodes make the designated routes more legible and provide ease of movement. As a result, it will give urban park users more information about the activities. Allowing people to use the paths will increase people's presence and, subsequently, passive social interaction. One way is to locate accessible lands that provide social activities at direct visual access paths within urban parks for legibility. Social implications - The socially responsive urban design enhances the quality of life and provides life satisfaction, happiness and society's overall health. Being in urban social parks in any passive and active situations has psychological benefits. It facilitates relief and rests from a stressful modern lifestyle that significantly impacts their mental health and well-being. The framework applied in this research integrates the social, spatial and physical aspects of parks design. With this regard, principles and indicators facilitate physically and socially attractive urban parks for Kuala Lumpur city center and applicable to similar contexts elsewhere. Originality/value - The concept of social interaction has been studied elsewhere in social cohesion, social affiliation and sense of communication. Still, it has not been studied in the context of urban park design. This study employed mixed methods using an adaptive and unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data collections to analyze urban parks with a bit of visual vegetation barrier.

TI  - Identifying Streetscape Features Using VHR Imagery and Deep Learning Applications
PY  - 2021
AB  - Deep Learning (DL) based identification and detection of elements in urban spaces through Earth Observation (EO) datasets have been widely researched and discussed. Such studies have developed state-of-the-art methods to map urban features like building footprint or roads in detail. This study delves deeper into combining multiple such studies to identify fine-grained urban features which define streetscapes. Specifically, the research focuses on employing object detection and semantic segmentation models and other computer vision methods to identify ten streetscape features such as movement corridors, roadways, sidewalks, bike paths, on-street parking, vehicles, trees, vegetation, road markings, and buildings. The training data for identifying and classifying all the elements except road markings are collected from open sources and finetuned to fit the study's context. The training dataset is manually created and employed to delineate road markings. Apart from the model-specific evaluation on the test-set of the data, the study creates its own test dataset from the study area to analyze these models' performance. The outputs from these models are further integrated to develop a geospatial dataset, which is additionally utilized to generate 3D views and street cross-sections for the city. The trained models and data sources are discussed in the research and are made available for urban researchers to exploit.

TI  - Linking ecosystem services, urban form and green space configuration using multivariate landscape metric analysis
PY  - 2018
AB  - Landscape metrics represent powerful tools for quantifying landscape structure, but uncertainties persist around their interpretation. Urban settings add unique considerations, containing habitat structures driven by the surrounding built-up environment. Understanding urban ecosystems, however, should focus on the habitats rather than the matrix. We coupled a multivariate approach with landscape metric analysis to overcome existing shortcomings in interpretation. We then explored relationships between landscape characteristics and modelled ecosystem service provision. We used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to isolate the most effective measures of landscape variability and then grouped habitat patches according to their attributes, independent of the surrounding urban form. We compared results to the modelled provision of three ecosystem services. Seven classes resulting from cluster analysis were separated primarily on patch area, and secondarily by measures of shape complexity and inter-patch distance. When compared to modelled ecosystem services, larger patches up to 10 ha in size consistently stored more carbon per area and supported more pollinators, while exhibiting a greater risk of soil erosion. Smaller, isolated patches showed the opposite, and patches larger than 10 ha exhibited no additional areal benefit. Multivariate landscape metric analysis offers greater confidence and consistency than analysing landscape metrics individually. Independent classification avoids the influence of the urban matrix surrounding habitats of interest, and allows patches to be grouped according to their own attributes. Such a grouping is useful as it may correlate more strongly with the characteristics of landscape structure that directly affect ecosystem function.

TI  - Assessing the stability of annual temperatures for different urban functional zones
PY  - 2013
AB  - The urban functional zone (UFZ) is the basic unit of urban planning, which is defined as an area of similar social and economic functions. Despite the importance of UFZs, the stability of their annual temperature between winter and summer has seldom been investigated. With an understanding of the thermal impacts that planning decisions can have, it is essential to know how UFZs can be designed to regulate temperatures in the urban environment. 690 UFZs were identified using ALOS images in 2009 in Beijing. Land surface temperature (LST) was extracted from daytime Landsat TM (2002) and ASTER (2009) images. The regional LST variation of 31 district-sized sub-regions was correlated to the types of UFZs in the region and structural features of the region such as area, size, diversity, complexity and connectivity. Results showed that: (1) UFZ types, in order from highest to lowest LST variation, were commercial, campus, high density residential, water, recreational, low density residential, road, preservation, and agricultural zones; (2) the regional LST variation was positively correlated with the area of campus, commercial, high density residential, water, and road zones, but negatively correlated with the area of agricultural and low density residential zones; (3) increased connectivity and complexity decreased regional LST variations. The results indicated that the stability of annual temperatures was determined not only by the UFZ type and size but also by the connectivity and complexity. These results are clearly useful and essential pieces of information that can be applied in urban planning to improve climate adaptability. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Detailed assessment of microhabitat suitability for Aedes aegypti (Diptera : Culicidae) in Buenos Aires, Argentina
PY  - 2005
AB  - Little information is available on the ecology of Aedes aegypti Linnaeus at the southern extreme of its distribution (Buenos Aires, Argentina), particularly on microhabitat suitability. The aim of our study was to identify at a detailed scale, microhabitat factors that correlate with the presence of preimaginal stages of the mosquito. In March 2001, we performed a spatial census of all containers located in a 1 ha patch within a cemetery in Buenos Aires City. On a reference map (1:700) we plotted the position of graves and surrounding corridors, the location of containers, the shade projected by each plant between 10:00 and 16:00 h and vegetation cover. We classified vegetation by height, substrate by composition and shadow by level of exposure to sunlight. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with nine constructed independent variables, some of them at scales of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 10 m. Of 850 receptacles examined, 101 contained preimaginal stages of Ae. aegypti. Level of exposure to sunlight, type of substratum, vegetation height and distance of containers to vegetation were significantly associated with the presence of breeding sites at the studied scales. Final multivariate models were significant at scales of 2 m (chi(2)((3)) 25.693, p<0.001), and 3m (chi(2)((3)) = 26.440, p < 0.001), and 65.9 and 66.8% of our data were correctly classified, respectively, for each scale. Our results suggest that sites less exposed to sunlight, with taller and closer vegetation, and in shaded and vegetated neighbourhoods were the most favourable microhabitats for Ae. aegypti breeding.

TI  - Floristic Inventory of the James River Park System, Richmond, Virginia
PY  - 2020
AB  - We completed a floristic inventory of the James River Park System (JRPS), a ca. 223-hectare (550-acre) multi-unit park along the James River in Richmond, Virginia. The JRPS includes land within the riparian zone along a 13-kilometer (8-mile) stretch of the river that bisects the city, providing two million annual visitors with recreational access to the rapids along the \"Falls of the James.\" Although the vegetation within the park system is an important attraction for park-goers, information on the flora of the JRPS and this section of the James River corridor is limited. This study updates partial records of the JRPS flora from ca. 50 years ago with collections that were made over the span of three growing seasons from 2016-2018. A total of 566 species and sub-specific taxa were documented from 336 genera and 115 families, including 63 new botanical records for the locality. Native species comprise 60.4% of the overall species richness, with dominant families including Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Cyperaceae. Non-native invasive species are prevalent throughout the park: 51 species are listed on the Virginia Invasive Plant Species List, 21 of which carry a \"high\" invasiveness rank. Four state listed rare species were documented within the park, and seven other state-rare \"watchlist\" species were found. The information presented here is being used to help guide management efforts of the JRPS Invasive Plant Task Force, an organization dedicated to the removal of non-native invasive species, restoration of natural habitats, and preservation of natural communities within the park system.

TI  - Global priorities for national carnivore conservation under land use change
PY  - 2016
AB  - Mammalian carnivores have suffered the biggest range contraction among all biodiversity and are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Therefore, we identified priority areas for the conservation of mammalian carnivores, while accounting for species-specific requirements for connectivity and expected agricultural and urban expansion. While prioritizing for carnivores only, we were also able to test their effectiveness as surrogates for 23,110 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles and 867 terrestrial ecoregions. We then assessed the risks to carnivore conservation within each country that makes a contribution to global carnivore conservation. We found that land use change will potentially lead to important range losses, particularly amongst already threatened carnivore species. In addition, the 17% of land targeted for protection under the Aichi Target 11 was found to be inadequate to conserve carnivores under expected land use change. Our results also highlight that land use change will decrease the effectiveness of carnivores to protect other threatened species, especially threatened amphibians. In addition, the risk of human-carnivore conflict is potentially high in countries where we identified spatial priorities for their conservation. As meeting the global biodiversity target will be inadequate for carnivore protection, innovative interventions are needed to conserve carnivores outside protected areas to compliment any proposed expansion of the protected area network.

TI  - Regional variation in habitat matrix determines movement metrics in Baudin's cockatoos in southwest Western Australia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Context. The Baudin's cockatoo is one of three black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia and is listed as Endangered by state and federal governments. Although there is a Recovery Plan in place for this species, conservation efforts are hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding the species movement ecology. Aims. To identify key foraging and roosting habitat for Baudin's cockatoos and to determine differences in flock movements, including the spatial extent of movement, in Urban, Peri-urban and Forest regions using telemetry data. Methods. Wild Baudin's cockatoos that had been injured and undergone rehabilitation were equipped with satellite PTT (platform transmitter terminal) and GPS tags and released back into wild flocks. The study birds, and the flocks into which they integrated, were tracked in the field to collect telemetry and observational data. Satellite data were used to define the types of movement behaviour (resident, ranging, migratory), and GPS data were analysed to determine key foraging and roosting habitat, and to calculate home range area estimates. Key results. There was a significant difference in flock movement between the Urban/Peri-urban regions and the Forest region in terms of daily distances moved and distances between roosts, with these parameters being far greater for the Forest region. Additionally, flock sizes were larger in the Forest region compared with the Urban and Peri-urban regions. In Urban and Peri-urban regions, key habitat comprised remnant vegetation in urban green space (nature reserves, parks and private property), and roadside and riparian vegetation, which served as movement corridors in the landscape. Conclusions. The research shows that it is important to maintain vegetation connectivity in the landscape. This enables Baudin's cockatoos to utilise key patches of remnant vegetation in their non-breeding wintering grounds in Urban and Peri-urban regions of the Perth Peel Coastal Plain. Further research on the movement ecology of Baudin's cockatoos should focus on habitat suitability modelling, which, in combination with the identified key habitat sites, will benefit the decision-making process in relation to conservation management of this endangered black cockatoo species. Implications. This research has benefited the conservation management of Baudin's cockatoos by providing information on key habitat through satellite tracking and outlining the importance of the connective features of remnant vegetation. We advocate for further telemetry studies combined with habitat suitability modelling to preserve the necessary habitat for the persistence of this species in the Western Australian landscape.

TI  - Habitat rehabilitation for juvenile fish in urban waterways: A case study from Berlin, Germany
PY  - 2017
AB  - This study examines the improvement of juvenile fish recruitment by technical rehabilitation measures implemented in two urban waterways in Berlin, Germany: the River Spree and the Teltow Canal. Rehabilitation sites provide new littoral habitats protected from navigation-induced flow and wake wash and are intended to improve habitat quality for juvenile fish and to support urban fish diversity. Both sites and four control sites with common embankments have been sampled monthly by point electric fishing (875 dips in total) from May to September 2009. In total, 6,243 fish were caught representing 12 species. Two of the species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), dominated the fish community, comprising 81.5% and 16.1% of the total catch. Nine species were rare, with relative abundances <1%, which hampered more detailed species-specific analyses. Of the dips 33% contained no fish, causing zero-inflation of the dataset. A hurdle regression model confirmed positive effects of reduced hydraulic disturbances and resulting vegetation cover on juvenile fish occurrence. However, it also showed low oxygen concentrations limiting habitat quality, as observed at the older, densely vegetated rehabilitation site in the River Spree. The general improvement of the juvenile fish assemblage by the rehabilitation measure appeared rather low, as partially vegetated, rectangle trapeze and trapeze profile banks had even higher fish abundance. The study also revealed a need for adaptive maintenance to improve the long-term performance of this type of rehabilitation structure. With the recovery of aquatic vegetation, the technical bank protection should be adaptively removed to retain the connectivity with the main channel for a sufficient oxygen supply for the long-term functionality as a fish habitat.

TI  - Conservation of migratory fishes in the Amazon basin
PY  - 2021
AB  - 1. The Amazon basin hosts the Earth's highest diversity of freshwater fish. Fish species have adapted to the basin's size and seasonal dynamics by displaying a broad range of migratory behaviour, but they are under increasing threats; however, no study to date has assessed threats and conservation of Amazonian migratory fishes. 2. Here, the available knowledge on the diversity of migratory behaviour in Amazonian fishes is synthesized, including the geographical scales at which they occur, their drivers and timing, and life stage at which they are performed. 3. Migratory fishes are integral components of Amazonian society. They contribute about 93% (range 77-99%) of the fisheries landings in the basin, amounting to -US$436 million annually. 4. These valuable fish populations are mainly threatened by growing trends of overexploitation, deforestation, climate change, and hydroelectric dam development. Most Amazonian migratory fish have key ecological roles as apex predators, ecological engineers, or seed-dispersal species. Reducing their population sizes could induce cascading effects with implications for ecosystem stability and associated services. 5. Conserving Amazonian migratory fishes requires a broad portfolio of research, management, and conservation actions, within an ecosystem-based management framework at the basin scale. This would require trans-frontier coordination and recognition of the crucial importance of freshwater ecosystems and their connectivity. 6. Existing areas where fishing is allowed could be coupled with a chain of freshwater protected areas. Management of commercial and subsistence species also needs fisheries activities to be monitored in the Amazonian cities and in the floodplain communities to allow assessments of the status of target species, and the identification of management units or stocks. Ensuring that existing and future fisheries management rules are effective implies the voluntary participation of fishers, which can be achieved by increasing the effectiveness and coverage of adaptive community-based management schemes.

TI  - Managers' perceptions of threats to the protected areas of Kenya: prioritization for effective management
PY  - 2007
AB  - In Kenya knowledge of the relative severity of threats to protected areas and the vulnerability of these areas to any threats is lacking. Such information is required, however, for assessment of the effectiveness of management of the country's protected areas, and to help identify critical management and policy weaknesses and priorities for improving management and allocating resources. We therefore studied the relative severity of threats to Kenya's 50 protected areas and their relative vulnerability to such threats based on the perceptions of protected area managers. Ten threats were identified by these managers, of which the most severe were illegal bushmeat hunting, poaching of large mammals, human-wildlife conflicts, human encroachment, and loss of migration corridors and dispersal areas. Thirty-two (64%) protected areas were vulnerable to over half of the threats, 54% vulnerable to over six of the threats and 32% vulnerable to over seven of the threats. Protected areas in marine, forested/montane and inland wetland ecosystems were regarded as highly vulnerable to the perceived threats. Protected areas adjacent to urban/industrial and agricultural areas were vulnerable to most of the threats. Our findings demonstrate that protected areas in Kenya are increasingly threatened, that major threats needs to be mitigated, and that prioritization of protected areas for strategic actions is required for effective management.

TI  - Conservation of aquatic invertebrates: concerns, challenges and conundrums
PY  - 2016
AB  - 1. Invertebrates inhabiting marine and freshwater ecosystems make important contributions to global biodiversity and provide significant services that have cascading effects across ecosystems. However, this group is grossly under-represented in assessments of conservation status and often neglected in targeted aquatic conservation efforts. 2. In global assessments of 7857 freshwater invertebrates and 2864 marine invertebrates, 30-34% were considered Data Deficient highlighting the paucity of information for making such assessments. Of the invertebrate groups that could be assessed, those with poor dispersal abilities and high local endemism, such as many gastropods, crayfish and mussels, are the most threatened. 3. Springs and subterranean hydrological systems support the highest proportions of threatened freshwater species, while in marine environments coral reefs, lagoons and anchialine systems are particularly vulnerable. 4. Key agents of biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems are water pollution, overexploitation and harvesting, habitat degradation and destruction, alien invasive species, and climate change. Effects of dams and water management along with pollution from urban, agricultural and forestry sources are the main threats in freshwater ecosystems, whereas a broad range of factors have impacts on marine invertebrates, including biological resource use. 5. Significant impediments facing conservation of aquatic invertebrates are limited knowledge of their diversity, the need for broadscale actions to account for connectivity within and across ecosystems, lack of political will and investment, and the prospect that conditions may get worse before they improve, possibly not in time to save some already highly imperilled invertebrate species from extinction.

TI  - Influence of Urban Agglomeration Expansion on Fragmentation of Green Space: A Case Study of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration
PY  - 2022
AB  - Loss of green space habitats and landscape fragmentation are important reasons for the decline in environmental quality, degradation of ecosystem functions, and decline in biodiversity. Quantifying the spatio-temporal characteristics of landscape fragmentation of green space and its relationship with urban expansion mode is an important basis for improving urban development mode and enhancing urban ecological functions. For this paper, we took the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration as the research object, a typical rapidly urbanizing area. Through multi-scale landscape pattern analysis and statistical analysis, the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of green space fragmentation in the BTH urban agglomeration from 2000 to 2020 and the influence of urban expansion were analyzed, and the land-use situation in 2030 was predicted by the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. The main conclusions are as follows: The BTH urban agglomeration has developed rapidly in the last 20 years, showing the characteristics of diffusion and corridor development. The intensity and pattern of urban expansion have significantly affected the pattern of green space, leading to the intensification of domestic green space fragmentation. Among them, urban expansion exerts most severe effects on the fragmentation of farmland, followed by grassland and water. The influence of urban expansion on the scale and fragmentation of forestland is limited. The forecast results in 2030 show that built-up areas may continue to occupy green space. The rate of occupation of farmland will slow down while that of grassland will intensify.

TI  - Very small relict populations suggest high extinction debt of gingers in primary forest fragments of a tropical city
PY  - 2017
AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Tropical plant communities in fragmented forests are likely to experience an extinction debt, i.e., the habitat cannot support as many species as are present due to reduced habitat size and connectivity. There are few estimates of the number of species that represent extinction debt, and the number of extinctions over time has rarely been recorded. We recorded population sizes to assess threats and extinctions in gingers (sensu Zingiberales) in fragmented rainforest in Singapore, ca. 200 yr after fragmentation began. METHODS: We surveyed extant diversity and population sizes of gingers and used the results to estimate species survival. We critically assessed historic specimens to estimate initial extinctions and extinctions realized in present habitats. KEY RESULTS: We recorded 23 species, including five species previously presumed nationally extinct and four species omitted from the national checklist. The revised extinction rate is much lower than previously reported (12 vs. 37%). Most gingers have very small populations or miniscule ranges, implying that extinction debt has not been paid off. CONCLUSIONS: Ginger diversity remains high, but the number of species at immediate risk of extinction outnumber recorded extinctions. Although tropical forest fragments remain arks of plant diversity for a long time, extinction debt may be prevalent in all plant groups in Singapore. Slow relaxation of extinction debt should be explicitly identified as a conservation challenge and opportunity. For conserving plant diversity in tropical fragments, relaxation must be reversed through restoration of degraded landscapes and, where feasible, targeted ex situ conservation and planting.

TI  - Simulating Free-Roaming Cat Population Management Options in Open Demographic Environments

AB  - Large populations of free-roaming cats (FRCs) generate ongoing concerns for welfare of both individual animals and populations, for human public health, for viability of native wildlife populations, and for local ecological damage. Managing FRC populations is a complex task, without universal agreement on best practices. Previous analyses that use simulation modeling tools to evaluate alternative management methods have focused on relative efficacy of removal (or trap-return, TR), typically involving euthanasia, and sterilization (or trap-neuter-return, TNR) in demographically isolated populations. We used a stochastic demographic simulation approach to evaluate removal, permanent sterilization, and two postulated methods of temporary contraception for FRC population management. Our models include demographic connectivity to neighboring untreated cat populations through natural dispersal in a metapopulation context across urban and rural landscapes, and also feature abandonment of owned animals. Within population type, a given implementation rate of the TR strategy results in the most rapid rate of population decline and (when populations are isolated) the highest probability of population elimination, followed in order of decreasing efficacy by equivalent rates of implementation of TNR and temporary contraception. Even low levels of demographic connectivity significantly reduce the effectiveness of any management intervention, and continued abandonment is similarly problematic. This is the first demographic simulation analysis to consider the use of temporary contraception and account for the realities of FRC dispersal and owned cat abandonment.

TI  - The potential for large-scale wildlife corridors between protected areas in Brazil using the jaguar as a model species
PY  - 2014
AB  - Most large reserves in Brazil do not hold viable populations of jaguars to guarantee the species' long-term survival. Corridors linking populations have been identified as a potential tool to avoid negative effects of isolation, increasing population viability. Here, we performed a Brazil-wide evaluation of potential large scale corridors connecting protected jaguar populations. Six variables (human population size, dam reservoir size, number of dams, roads, railways and cities) expected to negatively impact jaguar movement were analyzed across 180 potential corridors connecting 298 protected jaguar areas. We established overall disturbance scores for the corridors using a principal components analysis and compared them among the Brazilian biomes. We further investigated which variables separated biomes using a canonical variates analysis. The Atlantic Forest and the semi-arid Caatinga have the most impacted potential corridors, whereas the Amazon and Pantanal still have the best potential corridors. Corridor quality in the Cerrado grasslands was intermediate. All variables but human population size and corridor length contributed significantly to differences in corridor variables among biomes. Our conclusions suggest that we need to plan the implementation of large scale corridors in the Amazon, Pantanal and particularly the Cerrado soon, while potential corridors might still be economically viable. In the much more impacted Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, the need for conservation actions is strongest, but logistical difficulties and costs may turn implementation of corridors unfeasible.

TI  - Examining the occurrence of mammal species in natural areas within a rapidly urbanizing region of Texas, USA
PY  - 2017
AB  - In much of the United States and elsewhere, urbanization continues to transform landscapes. In central Texas, anthropogenic conversion of land is due in part to a rapidly growing population in the Austin and San Antonio metro areas and the subsequent infrastructure and resources needed to support that growth. Protected natural areas adjacent to urbanized landscapes are often intended to mitigate the impact of land development by serving as wildlife habitat. To maximize the potential of this habitat, we must assess how urbanization influences the occurrence of species in these natural areas (e.g., parks, greenspaces, preserves). We used motion -activated cameras to survey 72 sites (points) across six different regions throughout the urban corridor from San Antonio to Austin. Using occupancy modeling, we examined the influence of ten different urbanization factors (model covariates) on the occurrence of a variety of medium-sized mammal species. Generalist species, such as raccoons and opossums, had an increased probability of occurrence at sites with greater urban influence and were most likely to occur in smaller more urbanized study areas. Ringtails and grey foxes appeared to be unaffected by urbanization and were equally likely to occur across all sites. None of the other examined species were found to have a conclusively positive or negative response to urbanization. Knowledge of the effect of urbanization on wildlife will be important in evaluating current preserves as well as planning future preserves. Our study suggests that natural areas within urbanizing landscapes can be effective in providing habitat for some wildlife species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling scale-dependent landscape pattern, dispersal, and connectivity from the perspective of the organism
PY  - 2007
AB  - Understanding the impacts of habitat fragmentation on dispersal is an important issue in landscape and conservation ecology. Here I examine the effects of fine- to broad-scale patterns in landscape structure on dispersal success of organisms with differing life-history traits. An individual-based model was used to simulate dispersal of amphibian-like species whose movements were driven by land cover and moisture conditions. To systematically control spatial pattern, a landscape model was created by merging simulated land cover maps with synthetic topographic surfaces. Landscapes varied in topographic roughness and spatial contagion in agriculture and urban land cover. Simulations included three different species types that varied in their maximum potential dispersal distances by 1-, 2-, or 4-fold. Two sets of simulations addressed effects of varying aspects of landscape structure on dispersal success. In the first set of simulations, which incorporated variable distances between breeding patches, dispersal success was lowest for all species types when anthropogenic cover was patchily distributed. In the second set, with interpatch distances held constant as landscape composition varied, dispersal success decreased as anthropogenic cover became spatially contagious. Both sets revealed strong main effects of species characteristics, interpatch distances and landscape composition on dispersal success; furthermore, scale-dependent patterns in land cover and moisture gradients had a stronger effect on longer- than shorter-ranging species types. Taken together, these simulations suggest that heuristic conservation strategies could potentially be developed based on important but limited life history information.

TI  - Seasonal shedding of coronavirus by straw-colored fruit bats at urban roosts in Africa
PY  - 2022
AB  - The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup \"weaning\" period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa.

TI  - Land use surrounding wetlands influences urban populations of a freshwater turtle
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization is one of the most influential land use changes globally and continues to affect wetland ecosystems and their biota. Freshwater turtles, which rely on both terrestrial and aquatic habitats to complete their life cycles, are one of the most endangered vertebrate groups, with approximately 60% of species threatened. Although habitat alteration caused by urbanization is recognized as one of the main threats to freshwater turtles, there is a paucity of studies quantifying the effects of terrestrial habitat change on turtle populations. The aim of this study was to determine how terrestrial land use change, associated with urbanization, influences the viability of freshwater turtle populations. Thirty-three wetlands were sampled for the southwestern snake-necked turtle (Chelodina colliei Gray, 1856) (Chelidae) between October 2016 and February 2017 within a region of continuing urban intensification. Land use and habitat types were classified at the aquatic-terrestrial interface and within a 300-m band around each wetland. Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify the land use variables that best explained the relative abundance of C. colliei. Turtle abundance and population structure varied widely among wetlands. The percentage of residential land use, and the presence and accessibility of fringing native vegetation, was positively associated with the relative abundance of C. colliei. The association with residential land use may be an artefact of historical land use, whereas the association with native vegetation is probably because adjacent vegetation provides connectivity with suitable nesting sites, and thus facilitates increased recruitment. This study shows how the modification of terrestrial habitat around wetlands may directly influence the population viability of freshwater turtles. Protection and restoration of native vegetation fringing urban wetlands is crucial to support the viability of remnant freshwater turtle populations.

TI  - Happily ever after? Fates of translocated nuisance woodchucks in the Chicago metropolitan area
PY  - 2016
AB  - Human-wildlife conflict is increasing as urbanization expands and wildlife species adjust to living near people. Translocation is often used to manage human-wildlife conflict because it is considered to be humane, yet fates of translocated animals are largely unknown. As an urban adapter, woodchucks (Marmota monax) are a common source of human-wildlife conflict due to their burrowing, foraging, and scent-marking behavior. We examined survival and movements of 27 nuisance woodchucks captured by a nuisance wildlife operator in the Chicago metropolitan area, radiomarked with internal transmitters, and translocated to exurban release sites mimicking typical practices. We also captured and radiomarked 16 resident woodchucks from the release landscape for comparison. Translocated woodchucks moved farther than residents immediately post release with no evidence of homing and most left the release site. Annual survival did not differ between translocated and resident woodchucks. However, survival was extremely low (0.18) compared to previous estimates for woodchucks, primarily due to high predation by coyotes (Canis latrans). Translocation should be used only when other nonlethal methods are ineffective (e.g., exclusion, removing food sources, selecting unpalatable plants for gardens). When necessary, the practice of translocation could be improved by reducing predation risk for translocated animals, either by selecting release sites with low predation risk, or by using soft-release methods, such as acclimation enclosures or artificial burrows.

TI  - Designing Wetlands as an Essential Infrastructural Element for Urban Development in the era of Climate Change
PY  - 2019
AB  - The increasing development of urban infrastructure has led to the significant loss of natural wetlands and their ecosystem services. Many novel urban development projects currently attempt to incorporate environmental sustainability, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and community engagement into the intricate challenges we all face in an era of climate change. This paper aims to communicate several key findings on design elements that can be adopted or incorporated in the design of created wetlands as infrastructural elements. Three major design elementsmicrotopography, hydrologic connectivity, and planting diversityare presented, and their relations to restoring ecosystem services of urban wetlands, in particular water and habitat quality, are discussed. These design elements can be easily adopted or incorporated in the planning, designing, and construction stages of urban development. The success of urban infrastructure projects may require both better communication among stakeholders and a great deal of community engagement. The Rain Project, a floating wetland project on an urban college campus, demonstrates the role of interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement as a model for sustainable stormwater management, a critical part of today's urban development. Further efforts should be made to advance the science of designing urban wetlands and its communication to transform cultural attitudes toward sustainable urban development.

TI  - Landscape genetics of the nonnative red fox of California
PY  - 2016
AB  - Invasive mammalian carnivores contribute disproportionately to declines in global biodiversity. In California, nonnative red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have significantly impacted endangered ground-nesting birds and native canids. These foxes derive primarily from captive-reared animals associated with the fur-farming industry. Over the past five decades, the cumulative area occupied by nonnative red fox increased to cover much of central and southern California. We used a landscape-genetic approach involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 13 microsatellites of 402 nonnative red foxes removed in predator control programs to investigate source populations, contemporary connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics. Both markers indicated high population structuring consistent with origins from multiple introductions and low subsequent gene flow. Landscape-genetic modeling indicated that population connectivity was especially low among coastal sampling sites surrounded by mountainous wildlands but somewhat higher through topographically flat, urban and agricultural landscapes. The genetic composition of populations tended to be stable for multiple generations, indicating a degree of demographic resilience to predator removal programs. However, in two sites where intensive predator control reduced fox abundance, we observed increases in immigration, suggesting potential for recolonization to counter eradication attempts. These findings, along with continued genetic monitoring, can help guide localized management of foxes by identifying points of introductions and routes of spread and evaluating the relative importance of reproduction and immigration in maintaining populations. More generally, the study illustrates the utility of a landscape-genetic approach for understanding invasion dynamics and metapopulation structure of one of the world's most destructive invasive mammals, the red fox.

TI  - European map of alien plant invasions based on the quantitative assessment across habitats
PY  - 2009
AB  - Recent studies using vegetation plots have demonstrated that habitat type is a good predictor of the level of plant invasion, expressed as the proportion of alien to all species. At local scale, habitat types explain the level of invasion much better than alien propagule pressure. Moreover, it has been shown that patterns of habitat invasion are consistent among European regions with contrasting climates, biogeography, history and socioeconomic background. Here we use these findings as a basis for mapping the level of plant invasion in Europe. European Union and some adjacent countries. We used 52,480 vegetation plots from Catalonia (NE Spain), Czech Republic and Great Britain to quantify the levels of invasion by neophytes (alien plant species introduced after ad 1500) in 33 habitat types. Then we estimated the proportion of each of these habitat types in CORINE land-cover classes and calculated the level of invasion for each class. We projected the levels of invasion on the CORINE land-cover map of Europe, extrapolating Catalonian data to the Mediterranean bioregion, Czech data to the Continental bioregion, British data to the British Isles and combined Czech-British data to the Atlantic and Boreal bioregions. The highest levels of invasion were predicted for agricultural, urban and industrial land-cover classes, low levels for natural and semi-natural grasslands and most woodlands, and the lowest levels for sclerophyllous vegetation, heathlands and peatlands. The resulting map of the level of invasion reflected the distribution of these land-cover classes across Europe. High level of invasion is predicted in lowland areas of the temperate zone of western and central Europe and low level in the boreal zone and mountain regions across the continent. Low level of invasion is also predicted in the Mediterranean region except its coastline, river corridors and areas with irrigated agricultural land.

TI  - Chicago Wilderness: A new force in urban conservation
PY  - 2002
AB  - In 1996, a coalition of diverse and determined organizations launched a new initiative in the Chicago region. Our vision? Chicago Wilderness: a thriving mosaic of natural areas, connected by greenways and wildlife corridors, embedded in the nation's third largest metropolis. In this vision, the region's human communities reclaim a cultural tradition of protecting and restoring these globally significant natural communities that enrich our lives. Today, more than 100 organizations join forces to transform this vision into reality. A regional Biodiversity Recovery Plan-the result of three Years OF assessment and planning by scientists, land managers, educators, and policy strategies-sets priorities and determines the lines of action for the coalition. This regional agenda stems from our vision and recovery goals for each ecological community; it encourages targeted research initiatives that focus on characterizing our native biological diversity and on analyzing elements critical to its recovery. Ultimately though the long-term survival of our natural wealth rests on the support from the public. While the challenges to conservation educators and communicators are many, Chicago Wilderness allows us to work together in understanding our. audiences, channeling our resources, and creating novel approaches to engage the wiliest public in our conservation efforts.

PY  - 2020
AB  - We examined the influence of point and nonpoint source contamination on microplastic (MP) levels in water, macroinvertebrates, and trout in a small, cold-water stream in western Wisconsin, U.S.A. We collected samples along an urbanization gradient centered around a 6-mile corridor that receives numerous MP inputs from stormwater outfalls and a wastewater plant. We digested samples using a wet peroxide oxidation method. Particles filtered from digestates were stained with Nile Red dye, then viewed using fluorescence microscopy. We quantified fluorescing MPs using ImageJ software. MP concentrations in water increased significantly from upstream to downstream reaches and appeared to influence organism MP levels. Macroinvertebrates and trout collected upstream of the city had significantly lower MP levels than macroinvertebrates and trout collected within the city, and for trout, downstream of the city. MP particle lengths were significantly longer in macroinvertebrates compared to water and trout, perhaps indicating preferential accumulation of longer particles from the water column.

TI  - Assessing suitability for conservation action: Prioritizing interpond linkages for the California tiger salamander
PY  - 2005
AB  - Conservation organizations and public agencies are interested in identifying and prioritizing areas for conservation action, often acquisition or easements. Typically, this requires the use of uncertain data and vaguely defined decision criteria. I developed a decision support system to address these uncertainty issues and assist in evaluating conservation opportunities for the endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) in Santa Barbara, California. Functionally defined planning units were used to aggregate data on land suitability, land cover change, salamander presence, and movement risk along potential linkages between breeding ponds. I used a fuzzy-logic-based inference engine to evaluate the planning units and rank the relative suitability of interpond linkages for conservation action. The sensitivity of the rankings was considered with respect to uncertainty in salamander occurrence data and the relationship between land-cover-change threats and site suitability. All linkages were substantially degraded, but five areas were consistently identified with high relative suitability for conservation action despite differences in assumptions and uncertainty in biological data. The combination of functionally defined planning units and a fuzzy-logic-based decision support system provides a general framework for considering the suitability of sites for conservation action.

TI  - Climate change impacts and adaptation in South Africa
PY  - 2014
AB  - In this paper we review current approaches and recent advances in research on climate impacts and adaptation in South Africa. South Africa has a well-developed earth system science research program that underpins the climate change scenarios developed for the southern African region. Established research on the biophysical impacts of climate change on key sectors (water, agriculture, and biodiversity) integrates the climate change scenarios but further research is needed in a number of areas, such as the climate impacts on cities and the built environment. National government has developed a National Climate Change Response White Paper, but this has yet to translate into policy that mainstreams adaptation in everyday practice and longer-term planning in all spheres and levels of government. A national process to scope long-term adaptation scenarios is underway, focusing on cross-sectoral linkages in adaptation responses at a national level. Adaptation responses are emerging in certain sectors. Some notable city-scale and project-based adaptation responses have been implemented, but institutional challenges persist. In addition, a number of knowledge gaps remain in relation to the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change. A particular need is to develop South Africa's capacity to undertake integrated assessments of climate change that can support climate-resilient development planning. (C) 2014 The Authors.

TI  - The importance of past and present landscape for Japanese hares Lepus brachyurus along a rural-urban gradient
PY  - 2009
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of landscape on the distribution of Japanese hares Lepus brachyurus Temminck, 1845 hares along a rural-urban gradient. We surveyed the presence of hares in 62 forest patches in the Tama Hills, which spreads from forested mountains to the urban core, and found signs of hares in 23 patches. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch size, connectivity, and land cover of the surrounding area (forest, residential and few agricultural area) by logistic regression. To select the most appropriate spatial scale and time period, we conducted a variable selection for all combinations of buffer size (250-, 500-, 1000- and 2000-m radius), and year (1974, 1984 and 1994). We calculated Akaike weight for the best model to measure the importance of each variable. The model for the best combination of buffer size and year was 500 m in 1994. We conclude that recent landscape determines the occurrence of hares. Forest patch size and percentage of forest cover were important variables in the best model. To protect the wild hare population in suburban areas, it is important to conserve areas of forest that have at least 500 m radius. These areas must be continuously maintained, as hares respond rapidly-to changes in landscape.

TI  - Master planning urban stream restoration - Upper Turkey Creek, Kansas City, Kansas
PY  - 2004
AB  - The Turkey Creek watershed in Johnson and Wyandotte Counties in the Kansas City, Kansas area has long been plagued with recurring flooding. Major flood control projects on this waterway include an early 1900's diversion of the creek at its confluence with the Kansas River through the construction of a tunnel. Providing a relatively flat corridor in an area of rolling hills, the Turkey Creek floodplain in the southwest region of Kansas City has been a target of transportation related development since the 1800's. The stream corridor includes a rail, highway and interstate system. Many changes have occurred to the stream system over time that have resulted in environmental degradation. These changes include floodplain filling, channel straightening, concrete lining, channel enclosures, filling in of on-stream lakes, and disruptions due to numerous road and utility crossings. Based on a U.S. House of Representatives resolution adopted February 2000, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Reconnaissance Study was authorized to evaluate the federal interest in solutions to recurring flood damages, environmental degradation and related water and land resource needs and opportunities. An expedited Reconnaissance Study was completed in July 2001. It recommended a number of different strategies to restore this urban stream and reduce flood damages. The environmental strategies included methods to stop stream downcutting, removing blockages to fish passage, retrofitting basins and swales for water quality benefits, acquiring remaining areas of open space, removing channel linings, reconnecting the floodplain and channel, emphasizing stormwater storage and infiltration systems over stormwater and floodwater conveyance systems, and implementing public information/awareness campaigns. The environmental strategies were complimented by flood damage reduction strategies that emphasized detention, relocations, flood proofing, and flood warning systems, in addition to structural flood protection. A Project Management Plan was prepared and the sponsors signed an agreement to proceed in June 2002. Local agencies are focused on developing a basin-wide multi-jurisdictional approach in this approximately 90% urbanized watershed. Baseline information is currently being prepared for an expected summer 2003 Feasibility Scoping Meeting. The Feasibility Study will identify a multi-purpose plan for flood damage reduction and environmental enhancement in the Turkey Creek watershed considering both existing and future conditions. The project integrates biological and water quality data prepared for a use attainability analysis with engineering principles and hydrologic and hydraulic models to develop an urban stream restoration plan to return wildlife to and increase public appreciation of the Turkey Creek corridor.

TI  - SCENARIOS TO REDUCE FOREST FRAGMENTATION AND IMPROVE LANDSCAPE MULTIFUNCTIONALITY: A STUDY FROM NORTHERN ITALY
PY  - 2011
AB  - Fragmentation has negative effects on ecosystems and can cause loss of habitats, increase of edges and isolation. Forests in northern Italy have strongly declined, because of the development of urban land, infrastructures and crops. In suburban areas forest patches often perform a variety of functions. This study used scenarios integrating both ecological and social principles to improve landscape multifunctionality in a suburban area of Northern Italy, with a special focus on the role of woody patches. We evaluated how improving some functions of woody patches (suitability for forest species, mitigation for road impact and recreation) can help creating a multifunctional landscape. We combined the scenario visualisation through GIS, the maximization of functions based on ecological principles, and the use of fuzzy logic. The scenarios obtained show that improving existing woods can help to maximize multiple functions. The scenario improving recreation is the most suitable to increase biodiversity, and it can also help to mitigate road impact. The scenario approach can help decision-makers during the planning process, because it is user-friendly. Comparing multiple scenarios can allow assessing if managing the landscape for one function may also accomplish other function(s).

TI  - A genetic discontinuity in moose (Alces alces) in Alaska corresponds with fenced transportation infrastructure
PY  - 2015
AB  - The strength and arrangement of movement barriers can impact the connectivity among habitat patches. Anthropogenic barriers (e.g. roads) are a source of habitat fragmentation that can disrupt these resource networks and can have an influence on the spatial genetic structure of populations. Using microsatellite data, we evaluated whether observed genetic structure of moose (Alces alces) populations were associated with human activities (e.g. roads) in the urban habitat of Anchorage and rural habitat on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. We found evidence of a recent genetic subdivision among moose in Anchorage that corresponds to a major highway and associated infrastructure. This subdivision is most likely due to restrictions in gene flow due to alterations to the highway (e.g. moose-resistant fencing with one-way gates) and a significant increase in traffic volume over the past 30 years; genetic subdivision was not detected on the Kenai Peninsula in an area not bisected by a major highway. This study illustrates that anthropogenic barriers can substructure wildlife populations within a few generations and highlights the value of genetic assessments to determine the effects on connectivity among habitat patches in conjunction with behavioral and ecological data.

TI  - The effects of artificial lighting on adult aquatic and terrestrial insects
PY  - 2014
AB  - 1. There is a growing concern that artificial light might affect local insect populations and disrupt their dispersal across the landscape. In this study, we investigated experimentally the effect of artificial light on flying insects in the field, with an emphasis on aquatic insects. We asked whether lights prevented the ability of insects to disperse across the landscape, a process that is crucial in colonising restored habitats. 2. We set up six, c. 3.5m high downward facing high-pressure sodium streetlights along a permanently connected oxbow in the Spree River of eastern Germany. We collected insects using 12 flight intercept traps, each with trays at three different heights (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5m), placed at distances 0, 3, 40 and 75m from the lights and 5, 8 and 80m from water. The number of emerging aquatic insects in the study area was measured with six emergence traps. We emptied the traps 22 times between June and September 2010; the lights were on for 11 of these nights and off for the other 11. 3. In total, we caught almost 27 times as many insects at traps 0m from the lights when the lights were on than when they were off. Most insects caught when the lights were on were aquatic, with Diptera being the most common order. Furthermore, the proportion of aquatic insects caught at traps 0, 3 and 40m from the lights when they were on was significantly higher than when they were off. On lit nights, more aquatic insects were captured per hour and m(2) (area in which flying insects were intercepted) at traps 0m from the lights than emerged from per square metre per hour from the Spree River. 4. Our results suggest that adult aquatic insects can be negatively affected by artificial light and that city planners should take this into account when designing lighting systems along rivers.

TI  - Paradise lost - transformation of the gully landscape in South-East Norway
PY  - 2021
AB  - In the last 50-60 years, agricultural intensification and later urban development have threatened the rare and valuable gully landscape formed on marine clay. We studied landscape changes in eastern Akershus county in south-east Norway, which has one of the world's largest concentrations of marine gullies. Interpretation of aerial photos showed that about 25% of the gully area has been lost. Only 39.5% of the remaining area is original gullies, and 60.5% of the area has been affected by landscape change. The largest loss of gully area was between 1955 and 1991, mainly through land levelling and transformation to intensively managed agricultural landscape. The most densely populated areas also lost gullies to residential areas and industry. Gullies support high plant and animal diversity, and future management should be based on landscape ecological principles. Gully fragments should also be preserved to maintain connectivity between the many different habitats belonging to the gullies.

TI  - Environmental and social adjustment of the cattle farming sector in Colombia
PY  - 1999
AB  - This article explores the relationships between cattle ranching, landuse, deforestation, rural employment and biodiversity. If outlines a series of principles to initiate the transformation of the present system of cattle ranching into something more sustainable, less incompatible with biological diversity and more appropriate for human welfare. Although the analyses and the numbers are based on the Colombian case, they are typical of the situation in the Latin American tropics. The case of Colombia is perhaps extreme in all aspects and therefore particularly instructive. The enormous biological diversity, at risk from production systems, which are blamed for causing a concentration of landownership, inequalities, migration from the countryside to the cities, rural poverty and environmental degradation, demands imaginative and viable technological answers at all levels of production. But, in addition, in a country devastated by violence, the strategy for the environmental rehabilitation of cattle ranching must coincide with social reform. The article demonstrates, with examples, the application of each one of the principles for the transformation of the current cattle ranching system: abundant biomass and energy, diversity of plant species, intercropping, hedges, living fences and biological corridors, efficient use of manure, diversity of habitats, reduction in the use of pesticides and other toxic compounds and appropriate prairie management. These principles, and the examples outlined in the article, are applicable on any scale and in any environmental, social and cultural context, as long as the methodology is identified to incorporate the biological variables and economic parameters in an appropriate technological model.

TI  - Population ecology of Red-necked SpurfowlPternistis aferin the coastal towns of the Eastern Cape province, South Africa
PY  - 2021
AB  - Conserved remnants of indigenous vegetation patches and corridors are regarded as important components of the built environment for the survival of birds. Field research was conducted at Boknes and Cannon Rocks in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa to study habitat use, movement, and dispersal of two Red-necked SpurfowlPternistis afersubpopulations during 2004-2007. Surveys included trapping, marking, releasing, and censusing spurfowl by traversing the study area on a regular basis, as well as fixed point observations. The density of Red-necked Spurfowl varied from 0.66-1 spurfowl ha(-1). The sex ratio for female to male was 1:1.28. The average home range for adult males was 6.3 ha. The results suggest that supplementary feeding does not change the population structure or dispersion, nor does it improve productivity or density. The most determining factor influencing spurfowl populations was the presence of indigenous vegetation patches and continuous corridors of coastal vegetation allowing populational interchange and outright dispersal. Conservation measures are suggested to promote the survival of Red-necked Spurfowl in coastal town biotopes. This includes the removal of free ranging chickensGallus gallus domesticus, which could harbour contagious disease, reduced use of hazardous substances, such as insecticides and herbicides in gardens, and the conservation of well-positioned green patches and corridors.

TI  - Homeward bound: canopy cover and species identity influence non-breeding season homing success and speed in forest birds
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background Efficient and safe movement is fundamental for wild birds to thrive in their environments. For arboreal forest animals, especially birds, canopy cover has a large impact on birds' daily movements and is a crucial component of conservation strategies seeking to retain avian population in disturbed or urban habitats. Methods We translocated woodland bird species utilizing different forest strata during two non-breeding seasons in Gainesville, FL, USA. We used linear model and generalized linear model to examine the effects of canopy cover and species identity on homing success and speed. Results Among our study species of Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis), and Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), we found that Carolina Chickadees and Tufted Titmice were more likely to return than Northern Cardinals. Among birds that successfully returned, homing speed is significantly affected by forest canopy cover and species identity (titmice had higher homing speed than cardinals). Birds return much faster in landscape with higher canopy cover. Conclusions This study presented evidence of species identity's effect on homing success and speed in common feeder bird species in Southeast US and provided further evidence that bird movements in the suburban land cover are constrained by low canopy cover.

TI  - Determining the ecological value of landscapes beyond protected areas
PY  - 2012
AB  - Whilst there are a number of mapping methods available for determining important areas for conservation within protected areas, there are few tools available for assessing the ecological value of landscapes that are 'beyond the reserves'. A systematic tool for determining the ecological value of landscapes outside of protected areas could be relevant to any development that results in a parcel of land being transformed from its 'natural' state to an alternative state (e.g., industrial, agricultural). Specifically what is needed is a method to determine which landscapes beyond protected areas are important for the ecological processes that they support and the threatened and vulnerable species that they contain. This paper presents the results of a project to develop a method for mapping ecologically important landscapes beyond protected areas; a Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT). The method uses existing globally available web-based databases and models to provide an ecological score based on :five key ecological features (biodiversity, vulnerability, fragmentation, connectivity and resilience) for every 300 m parcel within a given region. The end product is a map indicating ecological value across the landscape. We demonstrate the potential of this method through its application to three study regions in Canada, Algeria and the Russian Federation. The primary audience of this tool are those practitioners involved in planning the location of any landscape scale industrial/business or urban (e.g., new town) facility outside of protected areas. It provides a pre-planning tool, for use before undertaking a more costly field-based environmental impact assessment, and quickly highlights areas of high ecological value to avoid in the location of facilities.

TI  - Changes in capture rates and body size among vertebrate species occupying an insular urban habitat reserve
PY  - 2020
AB  - Long-term ecological monitoring provides valuable and objective scientific information to inform management and decision-making. In this article, we analyze 22 years of herpetofauna monitoring data from the Point Loma Ecological Conservation Area (PLECA), an insular urban reserve near San Diego, CA. Our analysis showed that counts of individuals for one of the four most common terrestrial vertebrates declined, whereas counts for other common species increased or remained stable. Two species exhibited declines in adult body length, whereas biomass pooled over the five most common species increased over time and was associated with higher wet season precipitation. Although the habitat and vegetation at PLECA have remained protected and intact, we suspect that changes in arthropod communities may be driving changes in the abundance, growth, and development of insectivorous lizards. This study underscores the value of long-term monitoring for establishing quantitative baselines to assess biological changes that would otherwise go undetected.

TI  - Sensitivity of insectivorous bats to urbanization: Implications for suburban conservation planning
PY  - 2012
AB  - Effective conservation planning requires an understanding of species-habitat relationships across a diverse array of taxa, yet many studies typically focus on conspicuous fauna. Using systematic acoustic surveys, we examine the response of insectivorous bat species to urbanization and quantify species-habitat relationships to classify species in terms of their tolerance or sensitivity. Surveys were conducted in Sydney. Australia, during spring-summer of 2008 in 29 defined 25 km(2) landscapes, across various land uses. We quantified bat-habitat relationships using local and landscape scale variables. We recorded 17 taxa across the urban gradient, with substantial variation in the tolerance and sensitivity of each species. The density of houses, landscape geology, the amount of bushland (ha) exclusively on fertile geologies and moth biomass were the most frequent predictors of individual activity, explaining more than 60% of variation in activity for some species. Importantly, the area of bushland on poorer soils was not a good predictor, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results of large scale studies which do not account for variations in habitat productivity. Species-specific differences existed, although the majority of the assemblage was considered to be urban-sensitive. Many of these sensitive species were most active in fertile suburban habitats, with an average of 12-28% bushland cover within 5 km. Our study demonstrates the necessity to elucidate species-specific habitat relationships, and suggests bats would benefit from the conservation of productive suburban bushland remnants and riparian habitats, while improving connectivity to these areas via the maintenance of tree cover across the matrix.

TI  - The great capricorn beetle Cerambyx cerdo L. in south-western Poland - the current state and perspectives of conservation in one of the recent distribution centres in Central Europe
PY  - 2017
AB  - Presence-only models can aid conservation and management of threatened, elusive species. A MaxEnt model has been developed for the great capricorn beetle (Cerambyx cerdo L., 1758) in south-western Poland and the variables identified best explaining the species' occurrence on a large scale. Once successfully validated, the model was used to (a) illustrate the expected location of the species' habitats in the region and in existing Natura 2000 sites (SACs) in S-W Poland and (b) assess the efficacy of the regional network of national protected areas (NPAs) versus Natura 2000 (SACs). Overall, information was gathered on 1025 localities of C. cerdo L., 1758 in Lower Silesia. All the records came from the pedunculate oak Quercus robur L., 1753. The occurrence of the great capricorn beetle in the study region is limited mainly to its eastern part, with a marked concentration in the valleys of the rivers Odra, Barycz and Bystrzyca. The kernel density estimation analysis also showed the high concentration of occupied trees in the north-western part of the region, clearly isolated from the above-mentioned main populations. Although a considerable part of the localities in the study region (74.2%) occurred within protected areas (PAs), their contribution to the species' conservation varied between the PAs groups. Natura 2000 SACs are the most important PAs, covering more than 30% of the predicted area of suitable habitats in the region and more than 45% of optimal habitats. In total, 384 localities of C. cerdo L., 1758 were found within the cities, most of them (n = 356) in the city of Wroclaw. Forty three percent (43%) of the urban localities of the species (n = 165) in the study region are protected within the regional network of protected areas (OPAs), while those unprotected are mainly concentrated in the city of Wroclaw (n = 207). Wroclaw also includes 17.1% of the area of suitable habitats and 29% optimal habitats of the species in the region outside the protected area network. To preserve C. cerdo L., 1758, forest corridors should be created or restored to bridge the otherwise impermeable gaps revealed by the authors' model and grant protection to the still largely unprotected area of the Lower Silesian territory. The species conservation programme in the region requires the cooperation of various authorities, not only those dealing with nature conservation, but also local governments, state forest management and flood protection authorities.

TI  - Reptile bycatch in a pest-exclusion fence established for wildlife reintroductions
PY  - 2014
AB  - Conservation fences have been used as a tool to stop threatening processes from acting against endangered wildlife, yet little is known of the impacts of fences on non-target native species. In this study, we intensively monitored a pest-exclusion fence for 16 months to assess impacts on a reptile community in south-eastern Australia. We registered 1052 reptile records of six species along the fence. Encounters and mortality were greatest for eastern long-necked turtles (Chelodina longicollis), whereas impacts on lizards (Tiliqua rugosa, Tiliqua scincoides, Pogona barbata, Egernia cunninghami) and snakes (Pseudonaja textilis) were more moderate. We recorded several Chelodina longicollis recaptures at the fence and many of these were later found dead at the fence, indicating persistent attempts to navigate past the fence. We conservatively estimate that the fence resulted in the death of 3.3% and disrupted movements of 20.9% of the turtle population within the enclosure. Movement disruption and high mortality were also observed for turtles attempting to enter the nature reserve, effectively isolating the reserve population from others in the wider landscape. Of 98 turtle mortalities, the most common cause of death was overheating, followed by predation, vehicular collision, and entanglement. Turtle interactions were clustered in areas with more wetlands and less urban development, and temporally correlated with high rainfall and solar radiation, and low temperature. Thus, managers could focus at times and locations to mitigate impacts on turtles. We believe the impact of fences on non-target species is a widespread and unrecognized threat, and suggest that future and on-going conservation fencing projects consider risks to non-target native species, and where possible, apply mitigation strategies that maintain natural movement corridors and minimize mortality risk.

TI  - Benthic invertebrate assemblages and species diversity patterns of the upper Paraguay River
PY  - 2005
AB  - This paper presents the first study of the benthic invertebrate assemblages of the upper section of the Paraguay River, a major tributary to the Pantanal wetland in Brazil. Thirty-eight sites were sampled along a 200 km section below the city of Caceres in November 2000. Sixty-nine species and morphospecies were identified, which were dominated by Oligochaeta and Chironomidae. Mean density of benthic invertebrates varied between 72 and 10 354 m(-2) in the meandering sector of the river, 3611-49629 m(-2) in the straight-transitional sectors, 682-5962 m(-2) in the floodplain lakes, and 1704-2208 m(-2) in floodplain channels. Highest densities were attained in sand-gravel sediments dominated by the psammophilous oligochaete Narapa bonettoi. The Shannon diversity index ranged from 0.75 to 2.08 and was highest in floodplain lakes. Statistical analysis (UPGMA and CCA) revealed that benthic assemblages in the floodplain habitats were clearly distinct from the riverine habitats. In the river channel, the habitats were distinguished by grain size while the floodplain habitats were mostly determined by current and silt-clay concentration (floodplain channels) or by organic matter concentration (floodplain lakes). Conservation efforts in the Upper Paraguay area should aim to maintain the flood pulse as a permanent source of spatial and temporal habitat heterogeneity. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Contemporary genetic structure reflects historical drainage isolation in an Australian snapping turtle, Elseya albagula
PY  - 2013
AB  - Effective spatial classification of freshwater biodiversity remains a worldwide conservation challenge. The isolating nature of catchment boundaries over evolutionary timescales makes them potentially important in defining natural units for biodiversity management. We sought to clarify biogeographical relationships amongst drainages within Australia's biodiverse mid-eastern coastal region (Fitzroy, Burnett, and Mary Catchments) where freshwater communities face considerable urban pressure, using a locally endemic riverine specialist, the white-throated snapping turtle, Elseya albagula. Mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite data sets were employed to investigate past and present influences on population connectivity and to identify units for management. Populations within catchments were largely well connected genetically. However, the Fitzroy Catchment contained a distinct genetic lineage, deeply divergent from a second lineage present across the Burnett and Mary Catchments. The two lineages can be considered evolutionarily significant units that reflect historical isolation of the Fitzroy and recent coalescence of the Burnett-Mary Catchments during lowered Pleistocene sea levels. Congruence with geological evidence and patterns reported for fish and macroinvertebrates supports a shared biogeographical history of a diverse regional biota. This work highlights the need for better spatial classification of freshwater biodiversity at local as well as regional scales, including recognition of potentially cryptic diversity amongst individual river drainages.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London

TI  - Alien and endemic flora at reference and non-reference sites in Mediterranean-type streams in Portugal
PY  - 2007
AB  - 1. A comparison was made between a variety of alien and endemic plant species from 272 aquatic and riparian habitats in Portuguese Mediterranean-type streams in reference condition - i.e. near-natural river corridors - and non-reference condition. The objective was to detect differences in relative proportion and cover between these species groups. The differences in endemic and alien flora from siliceous and calcareous river types were also analysed. Environmental and human disturbance factors were related with the richness and cover of both species groups. 2. A total of 568 species were found, of which 44 were alien and 28 were endemic. Alien species were present at 91 % of the surveyed locations, and were consistently more widespread at non-reference sites than at reference ones for both river types, with calcareous sites having a higher invasibility. Endemic species occurred at 45% of the sampling sites and displayed a significantly lower richness and cover than their alien counterparts. 3. Alien richness and cover were positively related to direct human disturbance within the river systems, and with floodplain uses such as urban occupation, intensive agriculture, and nutrient inputs. Endemic species also respond to anthropogenic variables, rather than to climatic and geographical ones, with richness and cover increasing as human impacts on fluvial systems and related floodplains decrease. 4. Comprehensive control of alien invasive species and the protection of endemic plant populations will require attempts at monitoring ecological river integrity, and the achievement of 'good ecological status' - one of the goals of the European Union's Water Framework Directive. Portuguese riparian areas must be managed in such a way as to protect the relatively few preserved riparian habitats by lowering the direct and indirect pressures in fluvial corridors and thus preventing future alien plant invasions.

TI  - Day-to-Day Population Movement and the Management of Dengue Epidemics
PY  - 2016
AB  - Dengue is a growing public health problem in tropical and subtropical cities. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People's day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector-host ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector-host ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector-host ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector-host ratio and people's day-to-day movement patterns.

TI  - FLUVIAL GEOMETRIES IN THE DEFINITION OF THE LANDSCAPE OF THE COLONIA VALENTINA SUR (NEUQUEN) AND BALSA THE PEARLS (RIO NEGRO)
PY  - 2010
AB  - The text analyzes the landscape relations defined over an approach to the study area in the urban perimeter axis situated between Colonia Valentina Sur and Balsa Las Perlas. The space was approached in detail because of its characteristics and the dynamic in the transformation of the agriculture production system and the natural coastal ecosystem to urban uses. Satellite images CBERS - 2B were analyzed and processed with ENVI and restitutions of the ex Enterprise HIDRONOR SE. A non supervised classification ISODATA was made, adopting the MUC classes and field data. Four metrics of landscape were stated in different scales as measure of the relation of different components that form complexity. The results allow us to establish that special processes of different scales merge in a synchronic way and favour the invasion conditions of exotic species that heighten the structural heterogeneity of the ecosystem. The abandon of productive lands and windbreaker curtains, the control of flows incurred by the presses up Limay and the refunction of the lands for Real Estate speculation configure the space conditions of the formation of new vegetation patches and functional types of the coastal and urban perimeter neo ecosystem. The distribution of ruderal and arvense vegetation, the invasions that domain the most of the shrub stratum and the coastal woods and secondary in abandon farms, express a measure of the connectivity established by the nets of water fluxes. The geometry of fluvial geoforms and the irrigation system favoured the invasions directed by Populus nigra and Salix alba. The indexes of complexity of landscape explain the diversity and dominant covertures. The patches distributions that increase the global diversity of the system correspond to abrupt gradients of wood pastureland, depending on how surface and irregular geometries are distributed.

TI  - Analysing the potential to restore the multi-functionality of floodplain systems by considering ecosystem service quality, quantity and trade-offs
PY  - 2021
AB  - River floodplains are hotspots of productivity and biodiversity and recognized to fulfil vital ecosystem functions and services. Restoration measures of the decoupled Danube floodplains east of Vienna aim to re-establish multi-functionality, that is, ensure navigation, preserve and restore unique fluvial and riparian habitats and re-establish natural processes and service provisioning. Side-channels are proposed for reconnection combined with the removal of embankments and groins. We evaluated how a programme of measures influences the diversity and quantity of specific ecosystem services (ES) and therefore, the overall multi-functionality of the floodplain compared to the current situation. Therefore, regulating ecosystem services (RES), such as nutrient retention and habitat provisioning, were modelled and predicted using multivariate regression models. Also, the potential of cultural ecosystem services (CES) was assessed based on mapping of recreational activities. The impact of proposed measures on ES quantity, that is, quantitative spatial representation, and quality, that is, biodiversity and nature experience, as well as potential synergies and trade-offs were analysed. Our results show clear synergies especially for RES (habitat for the rheotopic community and nutrient retention) and the CES of nature experience. Those services have a weak and local trade-off with the quantitative availability of opportunities for recreation. This pattern could only be detected by considering both, quantitative as well as qualitative aspects of ES. Overall, our results show that the restoration measures have a high potential to increase the multi-functionality of the floodplain system by supporting the provisioning of RES including habitat for endangered species and selected CES.

PY  - 2016
AB  - The migrations of murine rodents and their capacity for overcoming various obstacles in urbanized environments have been analyzed. Animals marked with tetracycline were captured at different distances from the marking plot. The maximum distance of movement along a straight line was 2030 m for the pygmy wood mouse (Sylvaemus uralensis Pall.) and 430 m for the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus Schr.). It was revealed that the pygmy wood mouse can successfully cross various types of landscape discontinuities which can act as movement barriers.

TI  - Anthropogenic factors affecting wildlife species status outcomes: why the fixation on pesticides?
PY  - 
AB  - Most Americans are at least three generations removed from the farm, thereby at least three generations removed from the reality of where their food comes from. Not surprisingly, there are many misconceptions about modern food production, including the potential collateral environmental damage attributed to agriculture, particularly the application of pesticides. However, the implication of conventional agriculture in the broader narrative of wildlife species status outcomes (SSOs) lacks context and relativity. Since the dawn of civilization, humans have had a profound impact on their environment. Originating as hunter-gatherer societies, our ancient ancestors initially exploited anything that could be consumed or brought to bear. With the advent of the \"first proto-farmers,\" humans began manipulating their environments to maximize available resources. Urban centers propagated and flourished proximal to agricultural origins, where modern societies have been built primarily on an abundance of food. As societies \"developed,\" and continue to develop, an inevitable economic transition occurs from agriculture to industry/service predominance, culminating in a corresponding shift in land use. Developed countries have typically experienced maximal expansion of the agricultural frontier, where farmland is now steadily eroding by a proverbial flood of urban development. In contrast, in developing countries, this shift in economic development has not yet fully manifested and the agricultural footprint continues to expand at the expense of native habitats. Thus, the relative influence of \"agriculture\" on SSOs, in terms of land use, is primarily dependent on economic developmental status, which can be, at least in part, ameliorated via technology by increasing yield from existing land. Moreover, in addition to the land use challenge, there are multiple other factors affecting wildlife SSOs, including a figurative plague of invasive species, a literal plague of disease, a barrage of buildings, bumpers, grilles, and windshields to collide with, light pollution to confuse cues with, poachers to contend with, and even more complicated factors such as climate change. Being an easy target does not mean pesticides are the right target, and this fixation can potentially detract from public awareness regarding the primary drivers affecting SSOs as well as the opportunity to proactively address them. So, relatively speaking, how do these other factors compare to \"pesticides\" in terms of driving SSOs? Moreover, why is the popular media so fixated on the pesticide narrative? Based on the available evidence, this manuscript attempts to address these questions from a holistic and relative perspective within the context of land use change, economic development, population growth, and associated implications of global connectivity and commerce.

TI  - Assessing land-use effects on water quality, in-stream habitat, riparian ecosystems and biodiversity in Patagonian northwest streams
PY  - 2011
AB  - Changes in land-use practices have affected the integrity and quality of water resources worldwide. In Patagonia there is a strong concern about the ecological status of surface waters because these changes are rapidly occurring in the region. To test the hypothesis that greater intensity of land-use will have negative effects on water quality, stream habitat and biodiversity we assessed benthic macroinvertebrates, riparian/littoral invertebrates, fish and birds from the riparian corridor and environmental variables of 15 rivers (Patagonia) subjected to a gradient of land-use practices (non-managed native forest, managed native forest, pine plantations, pasture, urbanization). A total of 158 macroinvertebrate taxa, 105 riparian/littoral invertebrate taxa, 5 fish species, 34 bird species, and 15 aquatic plant species, were recorded considering all sites. Urban land-use produced the most significant changes in streams including physical features, conductivity, nutrients, habitat condition, riparian quality and invertebrate metrics. Pasture and managed native forest sites appeared in an intermediate situation. The highest values of fish and bird abundance and diversity were observed at disturbed sites; this might be explained by the opportunistic behavior displayed by these communities which let them take advantage of increased trophic resources in these environments. As expected, non-managed native forest sites showed the highest integrity of ecological conditions and also great biodiversity of benthic communities. Macroinvertebrate metrics that reflected good water quality were positively related to forest land cover and negatively related to urban and pasture land cover. However, by offering stream edge areas, pasture sites still supported rich communities of riparian/littoral invertebrates, increasing overall biodiversity. Macroinvertebrates were good indicators of land-use impact and water quality conditions and resulted useful tools to early alert of disturbances in streams. Fish and birds having a greater ability of dispersion and capacity to move quickly from disturbances would reflect changes at a higher scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Configuration and Location of Small Urban Gardens Affect Colonization by Monarch Butterflies
PY  - 2019
AB  - Ecological theory predicts that specialist insect herbivores are more likely to locate and colonize host plants growing in relatively sparse or pure stands compared to host plants growing amongst diverse non-host vegetation. We tested the hypothesis that increasing the apparency and accessibility of milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants in small polyculture gardens would boost their colonization by the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), an iconic native species of conservation concern. We established replicated gardens containing the identical mix of milkweeds, flowering nectar sources, and non-host ornamental grasses but arranged in three different spatial configurations that were monitored for monarch colonization over two successive growing seasons. Monarch eggs and larvae were 2.5-4 times more abundant in gardens having milkweeds evenly spaced in a 1m corridor around the perimeter, surrounding the nectar plants and grasses, than in gardens in which milkweeds were surrounded by or intermixed with the other plants. Predator populations were similar in all garden designs. In a corollary open-field experiment, female monarchs laid significantly more eggs on milkweed plants that were fully accessible than on milkweeds surrounded by non-host grasses of equal height. In addition, we monitored monarch usage of 22 citizen-planted gardens containing milkweed and nectar plants in relation to their botanical composition, layout, and surrounding hardscape. Multivariate analysis explained 71% of the variation, with significantly more eggs and larvae found in gardens having milkweeds spatially isolated as opposed to closely intermixed with non-host plants, and in gardens having 100m north/south access unimpeded by structures. Numerous programs encourage citizens to establish gardens with milkweed and nectar plants to help offset habitat loss across the monarch's breeding range. Our findings suggest guidelines for garden design that can help make the urban sector's contributions to monarch habitat restoration more rewarding for participants, and of greater potential value to monarch recovery.

TI  - Whence the next pandemic? The intersecting global geography of the animal-human interface, poor health systems and air transit centrality reveals conduits for high-impact spillover
PY  - 2020
AB  - The health and economic impacts of infectious disease pandemics are catastrophic as most recently manifested by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emerging infections that lead to substantive epidemics or pandemics are typically zoonoses that cross species boundaries at vulnerable points of animal-human interface. The sharing of space between wildlife and humans, and their domesticated animals, has dramatically increased in recent decades and is a key driver of pathogen spillover. Increasing animal-human interface has also occurred in concert with both increasing globalisation and failing health systems, resulting in a trifecta with dire implications for human and animal health. Nevertheless, to date we lack a geographical description of this trifecta that can be applied strategically to pandemic prevention. This investigation provides the first geographical quantification of the intersection of animal-human interfaces, poor human health system performance and global connectivity via the network of air travel. In so doing, this work provides a systematic, data-driven approach to classifying spillover hazard based on the distribution of animal-human interfaces while simultaneously identifying globally connected cities that are adjacent to these interfaces and which may facilitate global pathogen dissemination. We present this geography of high-impact spillover as a tool for developing targeted surveillance systems and improved health infrastructure in vulnerable areas that may present conduits for future pandemics.

TI  - Alterations in use of space, air quality, temperature and humidity by the presence of vertical greenery system in a building corridor
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban greenery is valued not only for its aesthetic value but also for environmental services and the overall health benefits that follows. A large portion of the world population now resides in built environments, and there is growing need to provide a conducive and healthy environment for the dwellers. Vertical greenery systems (VGS) provide greenery opportunities in cities even when there is limited land space especially as recent technology enables people to grow plants outdoors as well as indoors. Indoor vertical greenery (iVGS) was installed to monitor any alteration in the temperature, humidity, particulate matter and use of space. The present study used an actual environment, included paralled corridors in the same building. The movement in both corridors were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated and post green wall establishment data showed the relationship changed significantly (r(2) = 0.8748, P < 0.0001, RMSE = 23.4521) with relatively more people using the corridor after the iVGS installed. Significant difference was seen in the humidity levels but not in the temperature after the installation. Particulate matter levels dropped 48.5%, 82.6%, 5.5% (PM2.5, PM10, > PM10 respectively) in the corridor with iVGS by the end of the data collection. These findings suggest larger green coverage would have a greater positive impact on the environmental conditions of an indoor environment.

TI  - The Landscape Approach: Designing New Reserves for Protection of Biological and Cultural Diversity in Latin America
PY  - 2008
AB  - One of the greatest challenges for Latin America and the Caribbean, the most biologically and culturally diverse region in the world, is to halt the loss of species caused by habitat destruction and land degradation. Up to now, setting aside protected natural areas is considered the most effective alternative to conserve biodiversity. Protected areas. however, are under increasing assault by agricultural. silvicultural, and industrial development that surround and isolate them, reducing their habitat quality at the landscape scale. Among the different types of protected areas that have been proposed, biosphere reserves stand out for their attempt to compatibilize social development and conservation. Their management is the most amenable to integration of natural and human disturbance, inclusion of traditional management techniques, and participation by social and economic sectors in the administration. Biosphere reserves have proliferated all over the world, and today there are 53 1 of them located in 105 countries. where they protect vast ecological and Cultural diversity. Even though the design of biosphere reserves is based on the landscape concept. it has vet to take into account ecosystem scales, possible long-term effects of disturbances, and better integrate and give higher consideration to the knowledge and experience of numerous ethnic groups that live within them. However, doing so requires a transformation of the function of the core, buffer. and transition areas. The Current design of biosphere reserves is centripetal because the main function of the buffer zone is to protect biodiversity in the core. We propose a centrifugal model. where biodiversity of the core spreads freely toward the area of greater human influence with the buffer zone functioning as a connector. This connectivity can promote land-use practices that are in alignment with both ecosystems functioning and biodiversity conservation in natural. semi-natural. urban and industrial landscapes.

TI  - The Complexity of Space Utilization and Environmental Pollution Control in the Main Corridor of Makassar City, South Sulawesi, Indonesia
PY  - 2020
AB  - Population mobility, increasing demand for transportation, and the complexity of land use have an impact on environmental quality degradation and air quality pollution. This study aims to analyze (1) the effect of population mobility, increased traffic volume, and land use change on air quality pollution, (2) direct and indirect effects of urban activities, transportation systems, and movement patterns on environmental quality degradation and air pollution index, and (3) air pollution strategy and sustainable urban environmental management. The research method used is a sequential explanation design. Data were obtained through observation, surveys, in-depth interviews, and documentation. The results of the study illustrate that the business center and Daya terminal with a value of 0.18 mu gram/m(3) is polluted, the power plant and Sermani industrial area with a value of 0.16 mu gram/m(3) is polluted, the Makassar industrial area with a value of 0.23 is heavily polluted, and the Hasanuddin International Airport area with a value of 0.04 mu gram/m(3) is not polluted. Population mobility, traffic volume, and land use changes have a significant effect on environmental quality degradation, with a determination coefficient of 94.1%. The direct effect of decreasing environmental quality on the air pollution index is 66.09%. This study recommends transportation management on the main road corridor of Makassar City, which is environmentally friendly with regard to sustainable environmental management.

TI  - Analysis and conceptual geospatial modelling of the intermediary role of wetlands in drylands in post-fire material flux dynamics, Silvermine River catchment, Cape Town
PY  - 2022
AB  - Although it is generally accepted that wetlands in drylands are subject to higher fire frequencies than wetlands in humid regions, little is known about how wetlands in varied hydrogeomorphic settings mediate runoff and material fluxes in the post-fire catchment landscape. This paper evaluates the intermediary role of wetlands in water and sediment dispersal through a wet season that followed the March 2015 wildfire in the Silvermine River catchment, Cape Town. Field and laboratory analyses of the development and dynamics of soil water repellency were conducted across terrestrial hillslope, river riparian zone and hillslope seepage wetland sites. The latter two sites had significantly lower soil water repellency than the terrestrial site immediately preceding the first large rainfall event, and soil moisture emerged as a significant predictor of soil water repellency, consistent with previous research. Remote sensing analysis of post-fire vegetation recovery revealed that the first emergence of new vegetation occurred within wetlands and other moisture-rich areas across the catchment, likely associated with intact rhizome networks of the predominant sprouting vegetation in these areas. This post-fire green flush could have served to enhance post-fire infiltration due to macropore flow along rhizome networks, and to reduce early wet season runoff and erosion due to the rapid establishment of rainfall-intercepting leaf and stem structures. Longitudinal investigations of post-fire river channel and bed sediment characteristics detected a transition in bed composition from gravel to sand through hillslope-channel coupling and channel bank erosion, and effective conveyance of sand through the catchment to a constructed wetland at the catchment outlet. Suspended sediment sampling upstream, within and downstream of this wetland suggested a relative sediment trap efficiency of similar to 87 to 99%, supporting previous observations of post construction aggradation at the head of the wetland, with serious implications for long term wetland maintenance and management. Insights from field and remote sensing studies were used to develop a conceptual geospatial model of the role of wetlands in varied hydrogeomorphic settings in post-fire catchment sediment (dis)connectivity. Hillslope seepage wetlands located across the burned region of the catchment were shown to play an important role in hillslope surface sediment trapping and erosion control, contrary to common assumptions, and sediment connectivity modelling is recommended as a tool for further research aimed at understanding the intermediary role of wetlands in drylands in material fluxes in post-fire landscapes.

TI  - Corridor Analysis of a Raw Water Transmission Pipeline
PY  - 2017
AB  - The City of Enid (City) is located in Northwest Oklahoma and services a population of over 50,000 residents. The City of Enid water supply infrastructure relies completely on an existing groundwater supply. Like many municipalities, aging public works infrastructure and increasing customer demands require continuous infrastructure maintenance, improvement, and expansion. The City of Enid proactively initiated a surface water supply program to supplement the existing ground water supply in order to meet increasing demands and diversity its water portfolio. In 2015, the City of Enid authorized Garver, LLC and Freese and Nichols, Inc. to perform a raw water transmission study and hydraulic analysis to deliver raw water from Kaw Lake to Enid's proposed water treatment plant, approximately sixty-eight (68) miles away. This paper will focus on the major analysis methods and lessons learned during the corridor study of the raw water transmission pipeline. The study includes data gathering from several public and private agencies. Preliminary corridor alternatives were produced on the basis of minimizing known potential environmental and archeological impacts, potential impact to landowners, constructability concerns, topographic characteristics that negatively impact hydraulic profile, and maximizing permanent easement access. The preliminary corridors were broken up by length into geographical classifications that represent specific construction challenges. A corridor evaluation matrix was developed utilizing geographical, environmental, maintenance, and installation characteristics to classify sections of the corridor as a means of comparing the alternatives. Hydraulic models of the recommended corridor were developed based on Kaw Lake water level data, contour data obtained, and previously developed flow requirements. These models were used to determine pumping alternatives, and potential pipeline sizing. A pipeline optimization analysis was performed to compare the capital cost of various pipeline sizes to the annual pumping (power) costs over a twenty-five (25) year span. Cost estimating was included in the study based on corridor characteristics linked with data obtained on recent market trends.

TI  - Study of the relationship between roads, relief, land use, and natural vegetation in the Ibiuna Plateau - SP, focusing on landscape ecology
PY  - 2009
AB  - Roads facilitate access by deforestation agents, being relevant in studies approaching conservationist matters in rainforests. It is important to understand the relationship between road distribution, relief, land use, and forest coverage in order to evaluate where forests are more vulnerable. This study aimed at: 1) understanding the relationship between relief and density and road connectivity in three moments in time; and 2) evaluating the relationship between distance from roads and forest coverage, farmlands and rural and urban facilities in a fragmented Atlantic Forest landscape in three moments in time. Maps of roads, altitude, and land use and coverage were used. Chi-square tests showed that: 1) density and road connectivity did not present significant relationship with the relief; and 2) forest areas occupy areas distant from the roads, while farmlands and rural and urban facilities occupy areas nearer the roads. Roads and land use, regardless of relief, influence forest coverage distribution. Thus, we suggest that roads are taken into account in conservationist strategies and environmental planning.

TI  - How multi-lane, one-way street design shapes neighbourhood life: collisions, crime and community
PY  - 2017
AB  - Global recognition of the need for more liveable and \"complete\" streets has allowed for increased funding to bicycle and pedestrian projects. That said, many streets in urban neighbourhoods remain unsafe. This study hypothesises that some of these issues related to safety issues are tied to multi-lane, one-way streets, which exist primarily in urban business districts and historic neighbourhoods, often occupied by poor and minority residents. There has been little research in this area to test how one-way street configurations relate to collisions, crime and community. To examine this, we use three principal strategies: (1) a cross-sectional citywide evaluation using descriptive and inferential statistics on all collisions occurring within a five-year period in a midsized city; (2) a focused assessment of traffic collision data, crime data, counts of trees, housing valuation data, foreclosure and vacant and abandoned structures on a 13-block street segment with both one-and two-way streets and (3) a qualitative broken windows assessment, using photography to evaluate signs of visual distress on one-way versus twoway segments. Our results show a higher incidence of collisions and injuries on multi-lane streets than on their two-way counterparts - for motorists, bikes and pedestrians. Our photographic assessment suggests that these street typologies contribute to degradation and erosion of community. Our results show that neighbourhoods with one-way multi-lane streets experience greater abandonment, lower housing values and slower increases in property values. This research supports expanded thinking about one-to two-way street conversion as a method to improve safety, connectivity, community and sustainability.

TI  - Riverine Landscape Patches Influence Trophic Dynamics of Riparian Ants
PY  - 2016
AB  - Food webs in riparian corridors are increasingly viewed as embedded in complex riverine landscapes characterized by an amalgam of aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats. However, the influence of riverine landscape pattern on trophic dynamics of riparian consumers remains largely unknown. We used naturally abundant stable isotope ratios (N-15) to compare trophic structure of ants (Formica subsericea) among riparian patch types (crop, grass/herbaceous, gravel bar, lawn, mudflat, shrub, swamp, and woody vegetation) at 12 riverine landscapes distributed along an urban-rural landscape gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. We expected that the diet of F. subsericea, a common generalist consumer, would reflect local prey availability and thus differences in trophic dynamics among patch types. Mean ant N-15 was higher in crop patches than in any other patch type, and was lowest in grass/herbaceous, lawn, shrub, and woody vegetation patches, suggesting that patch type was associated with trophic position of F. subsericea. We also found that the range of N-15, and thus trophic breadth, was significantly different by patch type, with woody vegetation exhibiting the greatest spread. Variability in canopy, tree and shrub cover, and the degree of urban development was positively correlated with N-15 range (R-2=0.78), pointing to the role of habitat structure in mediating trophic breadth of riparian ants. These findings provide evidence that riverine landscape pattern can strongly influence trophic dynamics of riparian arthropods. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Motor vehicles as vectors of plant species from road verges in a suburban environment
PY  - 2006
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the potential contribution of car-borne flora to species dispersal in a suburban area in Flanders (Belgium). Therefore, motor vehicle-borne flora was evaluated monthly for a random sample of 20 cars between October 1988 and September 1989. At the end of the experiment 33 car-borne plant species, with a total of 690 seedlings were identified from mud, attached to these vehicles. There was considerable temporal variation in the mud mass attached to the vehicles and therefore also the size and composition of the vehicle-borne flora varied during the year. Because mud retention on cars is a crucial factor in seed dispersal., the number of emerging seedlings is negatively correlated with precipitation in the week preceding the sampling. The flora dispersed by vehicles consists mostly of species with small, light seeds and a persistent seed bank. Usually, they are pioneer species of nitrogen-rich habitats. The nature of the vehicle dispersed flora was compared with the local flora of road verges and differed significantly from this in, e.g., seed length, seed weight, ecological groups, Ellenberg indicator values for nitrogen supply, potential. dispersal strategies and rarity. A larger resemblance with the flora of the zone immediately adjacent to the carriageway was found. We only found a low similarity to other motor vehicle-borne floras.

TI  - Twenty years of land cover change in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon: implications for biodiversity conservation
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Amazonian ecosystems of Madre de Dios (MDD) region, considered Peru's \"capital of biodiversity\" due to its impressive species richness, are threatened by the rapid expansion of infrastructure. The paving of the Interoceanic Highway in 2010 has brought rapid population growth and environmental degradation, threatening large-scale conservation efforts such as the Vilcabamba-Amboro Conservation Corridor (VACC). To quantify the impacts of development processes and to identify critical areas where further conservation efforts should be focused, we analyzed 20 years of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics, drivers, and fragmentation patterns in MDD. We mapped LULC in 1993, 2003, and 2013 using Landsat imagery and modeled the proximate drivers of change related to deforestation, forest regrowth, gold mining, agriculture, and urban expansion in two time periods (1993-2003 and 2003-2013). We characterized habitat fragmentation patterns in four regional target areas. Our results show accelerated deforestation triggered by the road network spreading, mining and agriculture expansion, and population growth. LULC changes produced two contrasting spatial landscape patterns: numerous small forest fragments in the north due to agricultural expansion along the Interoceanic Highway and large continuous forest losses caused by gold mining expansion in the south. Current unplanned development in this region is threatening its outstanding biodiversity. We suggest that further conservation efforts should focus on strengthening the legal framework of the VACC, implementing a sustainable management plan for MDD, promoting agroforestry strategies along the Interoceanic Highway, and preserving smaller corridors for animal movement.

TI  - Air quality assessment in a highly industrialized area of Mexico: Concentrations and sources of volatile organic compounds
PY  - 2011
AB  - Parallel to the economical benefits brought by the oil industry in Mexico, there have been some negative environmental effects due to emission of pollutants to the atmosphere. Salamanca, a city located inside one of the most important industrial corridors of the country, has been frequently affected by elevated concentrations of sulfur dioxide and particle matter. However, little is known about volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which in this study are analyzed along with criteria pollutants and meteorological parameters during February-March 2003 at urban, suburban and rural sites. Although sulfur dioxide average levels were similar to 0.017 ppm, a high concentration event (similar to 0.600 ppm), attributable to emissions from the oil refinery and the thermoelectric power plant, was observed at the urban site at night time. The VOCs concentration varied from 170 +/- 50 ppbC (rural) to 699 +/- 212 (urban) and were constituted by 40% alkanes, 13% aromatics, 11% olefins and 11% of halogenated. The most abundant species were propane (167 +/- 40 ppbC), n-butane (91 +/- 23 ppbC), toluene (51 +/- 10 ppbC) and i-pentane (44 +/- 7 ppbC), that are related to combustion processes. Freon-114, methyl bromide and 1,2-dichloroethane which are likely emitted by application of pesticides, soil fumigation and fabrication of chemicals, showed high concentrations (48 +/- 10, 50 +/- 10 and 32 +/- 6 ppbC respectively) in the rural sites, highlighting the importance of control measurements implementation for these species, as they represent a potential hazard for public health. Moreover, these halocarbons showed similar ratios regardless the monitoring site, suggesting same source. Modeling results indicated that meteorological conditions generally transport air masses to the northeast rural areas where the highest concentrations of ozone were calculated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Connectivity of bacterial assemblages along the Loa River in the Atacama Desert, Chile
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Loa River is the only perennial artery that crosses the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It plays an important role in the ecological and economic development of the most water-stressed region, revealing the impact of the mining industry, which exacerbate regional water shortages for many organisms and ecological processes. Despite this, the river system has remained understudied. To our knowledge, this study provides the first effort to attempt to compare the microbial communities at spatial scale along the Loa River, as well as investigate the physicochemical factors that could modulate this important biological component that still remains largely unexplored. The analysis of the spatial bacterial distribution and their interconnections in the water column and sediment samples from eight sites located in three sections along the river catchment (upper, middle and lower) was conducted using 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Among a total of 543 ASVs identified at the family level, over 40.5% were cosmopolitan in the river and distributed within a preference pattern by the sediment substrate with 162 unique ASVs, while only 87 were specific to the column water. Bacterial diversity gradually decreased from the headwaters, where the upper section had the largest number of unique families. Distinct groupings of bacterial communities often associated with anthropogenic disturbance, including Burkholderiaceae and Flavobacteriaceae families were predominant in the less-impacted upstream section. Members of the Arcobacteraceae and Marinomonadaceae were prominent in the agriculturally and mining-impacted middle sector while Rhodobacteraceae and Coxiellaceae were most abundant families in downstream sites. Such shifts in the community structure were also related to the influence of salinity, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen and redox potential. Network analyses corroborated the strong connectivity and modular structure of bacterial communities across this desert river, shedding light on taxonomic relatedness of co-occurring species and highlighting the need for planning the integral conservation of this basin.

TI  - How effective is river restoration in re-establishing groundwater-surface water interactions? - A case study
PY  - 2015
AB  - In this study, we investigated whether river restoration was successful in re-establishing groundwater-surface water interactions in a degraded urban stream. Restoration measures included morphological changes to the river bed, such as the installation of gravel islands and spur dykes, as well as the planting of site-specific riparian vegetation. Standard distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and novel active and passive DTS approaches were employed to study groundwater-surface water interactions in two reference streams and an experimental reach of an urban stream before and after its restoration. Radon-222 analyses were utilized to validate the losing stream conditions of the urban stream in the experimental reach. Our results indicated that river restoration at the study site was indeed successful in increasing groundwater-surface water interactions. Increased surface water downwelling occurred locally at the tip of a gravel island created during river restoration. Hence, the installation of in-stream structures increased the vertical connectivity and thus groundwater-surface water interactions. With the methods presented in this publication, it would be possible to routinely investigate the success of river restorations in re-establishing vertical connectivity, thereby gaining insight into the effectiveness of specific restoration measures. This, in turn, would enable the optimization of future river restoration projects, rendering them more cost-effective and successful.

TI  - Top 10 Principles for Designing Healthy Coastal Ecosystems Like the Salish Sea
PY  - 2008
AB  - Like other coastal zones around the world, the inland sea ecosystem of Washington (USA) and British Columbia (Canada), an area known as the Salish Sea, is changing under pressure from a growing human population, conversion of native forest and shoreline habitat to urban development, toxic contamination of sediments and species, and overharvest of resources. While billions of dollars have been spent trying to restore other coastal ecosystems around the world, there still is no successful model for restoring estuarine or marine ecosystems like the Salish Sea. Despite the lack of a guiding model, major ecological principles do exist that should be applied as people work to design the Salish Sea and other large marine ecosystems for the future. We suggest that the following 10 ecological principles serve as a foundation for educating the public and for designing a healthy Salish Sea and other coastal ecosystems for future generations: (1) Think ecosystem: political boundaries are arbitrary; (2) Account for ecosystem connectivity; (3) Understand the food web; (4) Avoid fragmentation; (5) Respect ecosystem integrity; (6) Support nature's resilience; (7) Value nature: it's money in your pocket; (8) Watch wildlife health; (9) Plan for extremes; and (10) Share the knowledge.

TI  - Eye-Level Street Greenery and Walking Behaviors of Older Adults
PY  - 2020
AB  - Evidence suggests that built environment characteristics affect older adults' travel activity behaviors, e.g., walking and cycling, which have well-established health benefits. However, the relationship between urban greenery and walking behaviors remains unclear, partly due to methodological limitation. Previous studies often measured urban greenery from a bird's eye perspective, which may mismatch with the pedestrian's perception from the street. In this study, we measured greenery view index from eye-level streetscape photos retrieved from Baidu Street View, an online mapping service provider. Walking behaviors of 180 older adults in six neighborhoods were collected from questionnaires. We also measured land use diversity, pedestrian-oriented design (street connectivity), and population density-the three Ds of the built environment. Results show that street greenery view index contributes to walking time of older adults, suggesting street greenery should be taken into design consideration to promote walking behaviors of older adults.

TI  - Effects, Monitoring and Management of Forest Roads Using Remote Sensing and GIS in Angolan Miombo Woodlands
PY  - 2022
AB  - Angola's forests are abundant and highly productive with enormous potential to support local needs and exportation. The forests are well distributed across the country, but the existing road network is generally poor and, in some cases, inappropriate. Based on our previous work examining deforestation patterns and the modeling of primary tree attributes of vegetation types, we proposed forest management zones (MZ) for future planning in Huambo province in Angola. Herein, that same framework is applied for the detection of the existing road network in Huambo and the proposal of alternative routes inside the MZ. We used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information systems (GIS) to optimize connectivity among the existing forest plantations and their distance to the closest major cities within the province. We developed road suitability maps based on AHP and GIS to ensure safer driving conditions and contribute to the forest planner's access to the current plantations. According to the suitability map created, 59.51% of the total area is suitable for road development and is counted in classes 4 and 5 in automatic classification. Parameters such as geology, slope, distance from roads to the railway, soil types, elevation, flow accumulation, and aspect were used. We provide a completed assessment of the state of existing roads and evaluate the safety of the observed road sections based on the AHP method. The calculated weights of the factors were all consistent with the model used (consistency ratio was 0.09 < 0.1). Finally, we proposed the best alternative routes to the existing cities, MZ in miombo woodlands, and forest plantations inside the province. Our findings indicated that flow accumulation, soil type, and geology were the most significant factors impacting road construction. Overall, our framework is an important starting point for further research activities towards developing a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for planning road networks in Angola.

TI  - Habitat associations and survey effort for shrubland birds in an urban pine barrens preserve
PY  - 2011
AB  - Inland pine barrens offer the rarest type of shrubland habitat in the northeastern United States and may contribute disproportionately to the regional diversity and conservation of shrubland birds. Testing local habitat specialization and estimating survey effort is needed to inform management of pine barrens for this rapidly declining avian group. We evaluated shrubland bird habitat associations in a heavily urbanized pine barrens of the northeastern United States, and used occupancy-detection sampling and analysis to estimate the number of sample points and surveys for point-based monitoring of shrubland birds in pine barrens. Although forest area was significantly greater than shrubland area, 8 of 11 reliably modeled species showed evidence of association for shrubland, and are thus potentially useful as indicators of pine barrens shrubland quality and management to avert succession. From the analysis of survey effort. we suggest two design options for point-based monitoring of shrubland birds in pine barrens: (1) include enough points to cover at least similar to 3% of the study area and survey each point >= 5 times preferably during 05:00-08:00 hr. or (2) reduce the point sample, to no less than about 2% of study area, and increase the survey replication to >= 10 surveys. Three surveys, as suggested by shrubland bird experts for anthropogenic early-successional habitats (e.g., utility corridors) and by others as a general rule, may require too many sample points to feasibly monitor shrubland birds in pine barrens.

TI  - Assessment of River Habitat Quality in the Hai River Basin, Northern China
PY  - 2015
AB  - We applied a river habitat quality (RHQ) assessment method to the Hai River Basin (HRB); an important economic centre in China; to obtain baseline information for water quality improvement; river rehabilitation; and watershed management. The results of the assessment showed that the river habitat in the HRB is seriously degraded. Specifically; 42.41% of the sites; accounting for a river length of 3.31 x 10(4) km; were designated poor and bad. Habitat in the plain areas is seriously deteriorated; and nearly 50% of the sites; accounting for a river length of 1.65 x 10(4) km; had either poor or bad habitats. River habitat degradation was attributable to the limited width of the riparian zone (5 m); lower coverage of riparian vegetation (40%); artificial land use patterns (public and industrial land); frequent occurrence of farming on the river banks and high volumes of solid waste (nearly 10 m(3)); single flow channels; and rare aquatic plants (1 category). At the regional scale; intensive artificial land use types caused by urbanization had a significant impact on the RHQ in the HRB. RHQ was significantly and negatively correlated with farmland (r = 1.000; p < 0.01) and urban land (r = 0.998; p < 0.05); and was significantly and positively correlated with grassland and woodland (r = 1.000; p < 0.01). Intensive artificial land use; created through urbanization processes; has led to a loss of the riparian zone and its native vegetation; and has disrupted the lateral connectivity of the rivers. The degradation of the already essentially black rivers is exacerbated by poor longitudinal connectivity (index of connectivity is 2.08-16.56); caused by reservoirs and sluices. For river habitat rehabilitation to be successful; land use patterns need to be changed and reservoirs and sluices will have to be regulated.

TI  - An Operational Landscape Unit approach for identifying key landscape connections in wetland restoration
PY  - 2008
AB  - 1. Nature conservation and restoration traditionally focus on protecting individual sites. In parts of the world where the natural landscape has been severely altered for agricultural or urban use, individual patches are too small and isolated to ensure effective nature protection. Spatial processes, such as metapopulation dynamics, are disrupted and natural linkages in the landscape, such as water flows, are severed by modifications in the landscape and hydrology. 2. We propose the identification of Operational Landscape Units (OLUs), which are defined as combinations of landscape patches with their hydrogeological and biotic connections, as a tool to facilitate wetland restoration in catchments with a high degree of fragmentation and strongly altered hydrology. The combined consideration of biotic (i.e. dispersal, transports of organisms) and hydrological connections (flooding events, groundwater flowpaths) is a new approach. 3. We developed criteria for the delineation of OLUs in regional wetland restoration initiatives. The key elements for delineation are definition of the restoration objectives, identification of spatial landscape mechanisms and information on historic and present land uses and hydrologic management. 4. As a case study, we delineated an OLU by applying these criteria in a restoration initiative for a large agricultural area that used to be a floodplain until the early 1950s in N.E. Twente, The Netherlands. The OLU encompassed not only the floodplain area to be restored but also a relatively remote nature reserve upstream as well as the stream connecting both areas. By restoring the historic water regime, flooding events would become a regular feature in the two areas and organisms including seeds would flow from the nature reserve to the restored floodplain. 5. Synthesis and applications. Discussions of the proposed Operational Landscape Units with stakeholders (water authorities, nature conservation agencies, farmers) resulted in shared insights which will lead to modifications of the original management plan for the area. We believe the OLU approach will make natural resource managers aware of the importance of spatial processes and connectivity in landscapes and.. if properly applied, will lead to more natural and more successful restoration projects.

TI  - The role of spatial structure in the collapse of regional metapopulations
PY  - 2018
AB  - Many wildlife populations are either naturally, or as a result of human land use, patchily distributed in space. The degree of fragmentation-specifically the remaining patch sizes and habitat configuration-is an important part of population dynamics. Demographic stochasticity is also likely to play an important role in patchy habitats that host small local populations. We develop a simulation model to evaluate the significance of demographic stochasticity and the role fragmentation plays in the determination of population dynamics and the risk of extinction of populations on habitat patches. Our model is formulated as a Markov-chain stochastic process on a finite, spatially explicit array of patches in which probability of successful dispersal is a function of interpatch distance. Unlike past work, we explicitly model local population dynamics and examine how these scale up to the entire population. As a test case, we apply the model to the American pika (Ochotona princeps) population living on the ore dumps in the ghost mining town of Bodie, California. This population has been studied nearly continuously for over four decades and has been of conservation concern as the southern half of the population declined precipitously beginning in 1989. Our model suggests that both the specific configuration of habitat and landscape heterogeneity are necessary and sufficient predictors of the eventual extinction of the southern constellation of patches. This example has important implications, as it suggests that fragmentation alone can lead to regional extinctions within metapopulations.

TI  - Beyond ecological modelling: ground-truthing connectivity conservation networks through a design charrette in Western Australia
PY  - 2019
AB  - Globally, connectivity conservation projects exist across all inhabited continents. Typically created through Geographical Information Systems and modelling processes at regional and even continental scales, these projects are seldom evaluated or 'ground-truthed' for their potential application at the local level where land use is fully allocated and replete with human occupation. This article reviews the accuracy of one such continental-scale connectivity conservation network, the National Green Network, through assessment and redesign by a design charrette at the local scale in York, Western Australia. Breaking with traditional process, this research considered the National Green Network model not as a final plan, but as point of departure for an iterative adjustment and redesign process through the charrette and an additional detailed design stage. Commonplace in architecture and urban planning disciplines, the application of charrettes to connectivity conservation design offers the benefits of improving design accuracy and enhancing their potential for implementation through providing valuable feedback and iterative design adjustment. The fine-tuning conducted by this research enabled the design to factor in human land-uses and influences across complex landscapes, while considering in a critical manner cultural factors that could also influence the system's design and its success. The framing of the network as green infrastructure rather than as connectivity conservation in addition to further illustration by the landscape architect provided a spectrum of both ecological and cultural outcomes across the case study landscape, demonstrating potential impacts and opportunities offered through a series of spatially accurate and ground-truthed plans.

TI  - The Spatial Variations of Urban Land Surface Temperatures: Pertinent Factors, Zoning Effect, and Seasonal Variability
PY  - 2008
AB  - Remote sensing of urban land surface temperatures (LST) has been conducted based largely on pixel-by-pixel correlation with land use and land cover (LULC) types. Few studies have examined the spatial variations of LST within land use zoning polygons, in spite of its significance on the knowledge of environmental implications or planning practices. This study aimed to analyze the spatial patterns of LSTs and to explore factors contributing to the LST variations in the city of Indianapolis. Four Terra's ASTER images, representing distinct seasons, were used in conjunction with other types of spatial data for the analysis. The potential factors were grouped into the categories of LULC composition, biophysical conditions, intensity of human activities, and landscape pattern. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the relative importance of each group of the variables. Moreover, the spatia variations of LST were examined at both the residential and general zoning levels, so that the environmental effect of urban planning on LST may be assessed. By analyzing the mean and standard deviation values of normalized LSTs, the seasonal dynamics of LST were finally studied. Results show that the biophysical variables were most significant in explaining the spatial variations of LST. At both zoning levels, LST possessed a weaker relationship with the LULC compositions than with the biophysical variables. Principal component analysis further indicates that the cumulative variance was always larger in residential zoning, implying that the factors contributing to the LST variations in general zoning might be more complex than those for the residential zoning. An interesting finding of this study was in the relationship between LST and the landscape metrics of zoning polygons. It suggests that smaller residential zoning polygons were associated with larger temperature variations, and that the more complex in shape a residential zoning category was, the more intrapolygon variation of LST tended to be. These correlations, however, did not exist in the nonresidential zoning categories. The spatial pattern of LST in Indianapolis may be characterized as concentric in the central part of the city, a hot ring along the Highway 465, and several hot corridors along the radial highways outward to the countryside. The seasonal fluctuation of LST was weak in the central part, but increased towards the countryside. Due to the amount of anthropogenic heat, land use zones with less human activities were found to have a strong seasonal variability, whereas the zones with intensive human activities fluctuated less in LST.

TI  - Patterns of an invasion by Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) in a riparian corridor and its effects on ant diversity
PY  - 1998
AB  - This study documents the distribution of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), a well known invader of urban and agricultural ecosystems, in a riparian corridor near San Luis Obispo, California. Sampling of the ant community was done using pitfall traps placed along transects that crossed three vegetation types found at the study site: (1) riparian woodland dominated by coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and willow (Salix: spp.) (2) Hard chaparral dominated by scrub oak (Q. dumosa) and silk-tassel bush (Garrya sl.) (3) Coastal scrub dominated by black sage (Salvia mellifera), California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), and Yucca (Yucca whipplei). Linepithema humile has become well established throughout the lower reaches of the study site except in the chaparral vegetation. Ten species of native ants were found in the study area, but there was little to no correlation or cooccurrence between L. humile and native ant species. Total species diversity in areas where L. humile occurred was significantly less than in areas where L. humile was absent. These results suggest that invasion by L. humile is restricted by habitat type, and has significant negative impacts on native ant diversity.

TI  - Neighborhood Effects on Heat Deaths: Social and Environmental Predictors of Vulnerability in Maricopa County, Arizona
PY  - 2013
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most heat-related deaths occur in cities, and future trends in global climate change and urbanization may amplify this trend. Understanding how neighborhoods affect heat mortality fills an important gap between studies of individual susceptibility to heat and broadly comparative studies of temperature-mortality relationships in cities. OBJECTIVES: We estimated neighborhood effects of population characteristics and built and natural environments on deaths due to heat exposure in Maricopa County, Arizona (2000-2008). METHODS: We used 2000 U.S. Census data and remotely sensed vegetation and land surface temperature to construct indicators of neighborhood vulnerability and a geographic information system to map vulnerability and residential addresses of persons who died from heat exposure in 2,081 census block groups. Binary logistic regression and spatial analysis were used to associate deaths with neighborhoods. RESULTS: Neighborhood scores on three factors-socioeconomic vulnerability, elderly/isolation, and unvegetated area-varied widely throughout the study area. The preferred model (based on fit and parsimony) for predicting the odds of one or more deaths from heat exposure within a census block group included the first two factors and surface temperature in residential neighborhoods, holding population size constant. Spatial analysis identified clusters of neighborhoods with the highest heat vulnerability scores. A large proportion of deaths occurred among people, including homeless persons, who lived in the inner cores of the largest cities and along an industrial corridor. CONCLUSIONS: Place-based indicators of vulnerability complement analyses of person-level heat risk factors. Surface temperature might be used in Maricopa County to identify the most heat-vulnerable neighborhoods, but more attention to the socioecological complexities of climate adaptation is needed.

TI  - Diversity in fragments of artificial and natural marine habitats
PY  - 2009
AB  - In fragmented landscapes the matrix, i.e. the surrounding but different habitat, can have a strong influence on the biodiversity in fragments. The amount of natural habitat converted for urban use is increasing on every continent, so fragments of natural habitat are becoming more likely to be embedded in a matrix of human-made habitat, rather than other natural habitats. This is particularly prevalent on urbanised coastlines. Yet there has been little research to help us understand the dynamics and consequences of fragmented coastal landscapes. In Sydney, Australia, most of the natural intertidal landscape of Sydney Harbour (a mosaic of rocky shore, mudflats and sandflats) has been replaced by artificial habitat (such as seawalls). I tested the hypothesis that biota on rocky shores in Sydney Harbour would differ depending on whether shores were embedded in a matrix of artificial habitat (here called 'complete fragments'), natural habitat (here called 'natural patches'), or a mixture of the 2 types of matrix (called mixed fragments). Assemblages at mid-shore levels were significantly different among these types of fragments. At mid- and low-shore levels, assemblages were more variable in mixed fragments than in complete fragments and natural patches. The kinds of mobile and sessile taxa that contributed most to differences among fragments differed, depending on which types of fragments were compared. Many taxa were found in greater abundance in natural patches than in mixed or complete fragments, although not all comparisons were statistically significant. Artificial habitat seems to interrupt natural connectivity among local populations of intertidal marine organisms in this urbanised estuary.

TI  - Non-linearity impacts of landscape pattern on ecosystem services and their trade-offs: A case study in the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningxia, China
PY  - 2022
AB  - Exploring the impacts of landscape pattern on ecosystem services (ESs) and their trade-offs could provide a new way to improve ESs without largely altering land use types. Using the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningixa (CBYN) as a case study, we quantified five critical ESs (one provision service of crop production, three regulating services of carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and sand fixation, and one cultural service of recreational opportunity) in 1989-2019 through CASA model, InVEST model and empirical equations. Then we calculated landscape pattern metrics at landscape and class level through Fragstats 4.3 across multiple scales and quantified their impacts on each ES and ES trade-offs through random forest analysis, self-organizing mapping analysis and multivariable regression tree. The results suggested that 3 km is more suitable for analyzing the impacts of landscape pattern on ESs in the CBYN. The nonlinear relations between landscape pattern metrics and each ES were fitted with adjusted R2 ranging from 0.26 to 0.51, indicating the significant but limited impacts of landscape pattern on ESs. Specially, landscape-level metrics of CONTAG, SHDI and FRACMN have higher impacts on ESs than class-level ones. Significant synergies existed among agricultural production, carbon sequestration and nutrient retention, except in mountain region with higher or lower fragmentation. Sand fixation has synergy relations with the former three ESs, which would be altered in situations with higher or lower diversity. Our results provide a new direction for land use management to achieve high-quality development without largely altering existing land use situation.

TI  - Landscape-mediated edge effect in temperate deciduous forest: implications for oak regeneration
PY  - 2019
AB  - ContextAlthough the edge effect is known to be an important factor influencing the recruitment of trees in temperate forests, little is known of its synergistic relationships with landscape and fragment attributes.ObjectivesWe investigated how the edge effect on regeneration of oaks (Quercus spp.) varies with respect to fragment geometry, connectivity and landscape composition.MethodsWe recorded oak sapling density along edge-interior gradients in 29 forest fragments at the periphery of Mexico City and examined the data with Generalized Additive Models.ResultsA nonlinear and landscape-mediated edge effect was supported by data, including the interactions of the edge distance with patch connectivity, shape and size. Saplings were more abundant at a distance of ca. 50m from the edge of small, large and connected patches, but large patches also exhibited reduced recruitment towards the interior of the patch. Conversely, sapling density in simple-shaped or connected patches was lower at the edge, exhibiting linear and concave-down increase trends towards the interior of patches, respectively.ConclusionsBoundary conditions could be interacting with interior forest conditions, making regeneration more frequent at 50m from the edge. Shady and cooler sites in large patches may be inhibiting oak regeneration. The activity of acorn-dispersing animals and oak predators may increase in unconnected patches, thus increasing the likelihood of edge effects. These results provide insights into the restoration of temperate forest patches in heterogeneous fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Density dependent habitat selection of corridors in a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2001
AB  - This paper assesses the occurrence of density-dependent habitat selection in an urban fragmented landscape, composed of forest fragments (urban parks) connected by corridors (wooded streets], to test the hypothesis that as population density increased in the parks their suitability decreased and individuals entered alternative habitats, such as wooded streets. Density variation of six species was studied during two consecutive breeding seasons. Vegetation structure in wooded streets was significantly less complex than in urban parks, supporting the view that wooded streets were less suitable for breeding birds. Five species (Coal Tit Parus ater, Spotless Starling Sturnus unicolor, Serin Serinus serinus, Black-billed Magpie Pica pica and Woodpigeon Columba palumbus) showed density-dependent habitat occupation of wooded streets, while the Common Blackbird Turdus merula did not. As park suitability decreased with rising densities, wooded streets became a profitable alternative in terms of foraging, breeding, or for moving between parks. However, the relationships varied both between and within species in different years. Such differences could have been caused by variable rates of human disturbance, renewal of resources and predation risks in wooded streets. More detailed studies are required to determine how birds perceive and regulate their population dynamics in fragments and associated corridors, particularly for species targeted for management.

TI  - Climate matching and anthropogenic factors contribute to the colonization and extinction of local populations during avian invasions
PY  - 2022
AB  - Aim Concern about the impacts of biological invasions has generated a great deal of interest in understanding factors that determine invasion success. Most of our current knowledge comes from static approaches that use spatial patterns as a proxy of temporal processes. These approaches assume that species are present in areas where environmental conditions are the most favourable. However, this assumption is problematic when applied to dynamic processes such as species expansions when equilibrium has not been reached. Location Iberian Peninsula. Taxon Birds. Methods In our work, we analyse the roles played by human activities, climatic matching and spatial connectivity on the two main underlying processes shaping the spread of invasive species (i.e. colonization and extinction) using a dynamic modelling approach. We use a large data set that has recorded the occurrence of two invasive bird species-the ring-necked (Psittacula krameri) and the monk (Myiopsitta monachus) parakeets-in the Iberian Peninsula from 1991 to 2016. Results Human activities and climate matching play a role on species range dynamics. Human influence and urbanization were the most relevant factors explaining colonization. Additionally, an effect of climate matching was found. Persistence (the inverse of extinction) was mainly affected by human influence for the monk parakeet and by the extent of urban environments for the ring-necked parakeet. Main conclusions Human activities play a major role not only on colonization of new locations, but also on persistence during range expansion. Additionally, natural processes-notably climate matching-also affect new colonizations. These findings add to our understanding of the mechanisms that might allow alien species to expand their geographic range at new locations and might help to improve our capacity to assess invasion risks and impacts accurately.

TI  - Multihop Wireless Access Networks for Flood Mitigation Crowd-Sourcing Systems
PY  - 2018
AB  - Natural disasters can be mitigated or even anticipated if we have appropriate means, in terms of communications and data sharing models, to collect relevant data in advance or during disaster occurrences, which can be used for supporting disaster prevention and recovery processes. This work proposes a framework that encourages people to collect and share data about disaster, especially flood in Ho Chi Minh City, via on-site established multihop wireless access networks configured by the sharing of internet connectivity in users' mobile devices. For connectivity sharing, on-the-fly establishment of multihop wireless access network (OEMAN) scheme is thoroughly analyzed and improved to resolve its inherent issue on traffic load imbalance due to its tree-based structure. More specifically, we propose a linear program for overload-aware routing optimization considering wireless interference. Evaluations implemented in Matlab show that the overload-aware routing improves load balancing among available virtual access points in OEMAN. By avoiding nodes with heavy load in the network, our solution improves network throughput compared to overload-unaware routing protocols.

TI  - ARIES RIVER VALLEY AS MIGRATION CORRIDOR FOR ALIEN PLANT SPECIES AND CONTAMINATION SOURCE FOR THE SURROUNDING GRASSLANDS AND AGRICULTURAL FIELDS
PY  - 2015
AB  - In the Transylvanian region, the Aries Valley stretches along the course of the Aries River, ending as tributary of Mure River. As well as these areas of great biodiversity value, the Aries Valley (drainage area of 2,540 km(2)) also crosses the region where local people set their villages and towns and use the surrounding areas as grasslands for grazing, mowing and fields for agriculture. The grassland types are present in patches, those used for hay production are scattered among agricultural fields and human settlements. Evidence from statistical analysis of the vegetation cover of a riparian area of Aries River Valley indicates that in the inventorying plots with low species diversity, there is a dominance of one or two species with individuals unequally distributed within and between plots. The layer 1-5 m is dominated by alien invasive species: Fallopia japonica, Helianthus tuberosus, Impatiens glanduligera, the studied area of Aries River Valley becoming a source for these alien species to invade the surrounding grasslands and agricultural fields. Especially Fallopia japonica individuals form compact patches invading the pastures and agricultural fields and the local farmers cannot use the land any more for fulfilling their own needs. The invasive species replace the native species from the grasslands and make the agricultural field inappropriate for crops cultivation. The river acts as a migration corridor for the alien species helping them to spread by seeds or fragments and invade new places, especially during spring and/or autumn floods, and a contamination source for the surrounding grasslands and agricultural fields.

TI  - Urbanization and the loss of prime farmland: a case study in the Calgary-Edmonton corridor of Alberta
PY  - 2015
AB  - Rapid urban expansion is a major contributor to environmental change in many parts of the world. This study investigated land cover changes that occurred between 1988 and 2010 in the Calgary-Edmonton corridor in Alberta, a region that has undergone considerable recent urban expansion. We used satellite imagery to develop land cover maps for four different snapshots in time between 1988 and 2010 and used these maps to investigate two principal questions related to urban expansion: (1) How did urban expansion affect other land cover types? and (2) How did urban expansion affect the availability of high-quality agricultural land in the region? Our results show that 60 % of new urban and peri-urban growth between 1988 and 2010 occurred on agricultural land. Nevertheless, total agricultural land increased in the region because of the greater clearing of natural vegetation for agriculture away from the urban core. Urban expansion predominantly occurred on soils that were highly suitable for farming, while new agricultural expansion occurred on soils of poorer quality. As a result, the average soil quality of land used for agriculture has declined in the Calgary-Edmonton corridor, confirming other studies of the food security implications of urbanization.

TI  - Anthropogenic disturbance and habitat loss for the red-listed Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus): Using ecological niche modeling and nighttime light satellite imagery
PY  - 2015
AB  - Habitat loss is a critical factor driving extinction of biodiversity worldwide, with models of future land use anticipating increases in rates of destruction of native habitats worldwide. The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is a red-listed species with a broad geographic range that has been fragmented dramatically by land use change. Remaining populations of U. thibetanus occupy diverse habitats, ranging from highlands to coastal regions. We integrated ecological niche models (ENMs) with nighttime satellite imagery to identify areas suitable for U. thibetanus after anthropogenic alteration. We found that at least 10% of the potential distributional area for the species is not suitable owing to urban or suburban encroachment. U. thibetanus seems to persist in highland areas, characterized by low temperature and high precipitation, whereas humans concentrate in lowlands and less-extreme climatic conditions. ENMs based solely on climate frequently overestimate suitable areas available for species; nighttime light imagery offers a robust alternative to refining estimates of species' ranges, designing protected areas and corridors, prioritizing threatened species, and determining areas of human-wildlife conflict across broad areas. Our approach is transferable to other taxa and contexts, and should be considered in conservation planning and policy implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Verification of the analysis method for extracting the spatial continuity of the vegetation distribution on a regional scale
PY  - 2011
AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in not only improving urban environments, but also conserving ecosystems. The spatial continuity of vegetation distributions can be expected to make green corridors for landscape management, wind paths against heat island phenomena. In this paper, we develop a spatial analysis met hod of vegetation distributions using remotely sensed data on a regional scale. The method consists of a spatial autocorrelation analysis, an overlay analysis, and a hydrological analysis with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) adopted as the proxy of vegetation abundance. Application of the met hod leads to the extraction of the lines between the core areas and sparse areas of vegetation. The purpose of this study is to verify our method through applying a vegetation map digitized from aerial photographs. The map contained three vegetation types of land cover: grasslands, agricultural fields, and tree-covered areas. We use remotely sensed data collected at four different time periods at the regional scale, along with information on the seasonal fluctuations of the vegetation. As a result, the exclusion of seasonal land-cover changes, as in the reaping of agricultural fields, in the process of applying the proposed method produces an effect. The analysis reveals steady areas unaffected by the seasonal fluctuation of vegetation along the lines extracted by applying the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Agricultural landscapes and the Loire River influence the genetic structure of the marbled newt in Western France
PY  - 2018
AB  - Amphibians are particularly sensitive to landscape fragmentation. Potential barriers between breeding sites can negatively influence the dispersal of individuals and increase genetic structure between populations. In this study, we genotyped 10 microsatellites for 334 marbled newts (Triturus marmoratus) at 11 different locations in Western France. Samples were collected in different regions with contrasting agricultural landscapes (low and high proportion of arable land in the north and south, respectively). We found a strong genetic structure between the northern and southern sampling sites. Isolation by distance was recorded after 62 km, but within the northern region, little or no genetic structure was detected over large distances (up to 114 km). Genetic structure at shorter distance (43 km) was found between sites situated in landscapes with larger amounts of arable lands. A significant positive relationship was found between the pairwise genetic distance (F-st) between sites and the amount of arable land together with the distance between sites. Our results suggest that the Loire River might act as a corridor for the marbled newt, while arable land might act as a barrier. Finally, although a large city is located between sampling sites, no effect was detected on population structure.

TI  - Denitrification along the Stream-Riparian Continuum in Restored and Unrestored Agricultural Streams
PY  - 2017
AB  - Although floodplain restoration may improve stream-riparian connectivity and increase channel stability through cross-vane installation, stream bank regrading, and buffer revegetation, the impact of these geomorphic alterations on denitrification across the aquatic-terrestrial interface is poorly understood. Seasonal denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was compared in stream-riparian ecotones of four streams with varying hydrologic connection, riparian vegetation composition, and agricultural influence. Riparian and stream DEA was generally higher in sites adjacent to agricultural fields due to proximity to nitrate source. Mean DEA was higher in the dormant season (riparian: 928 +/- 116 ng N g(-1) dry mass [DM] h(-1), stream: 108 +/- 149 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1)) than in the growing season (riparian: 355 +/- 55 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1), stream: 45 +/- 40 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1)) and was influenced by antecedent precipitation, soil texture, and landscape characteristics (land use, vegetation type, topography) in multivariate models. Hot spots of denitrification occurred at the confluence of fine soil textures with high organic matter and moisture, often at low-lying areas of the landscape. At the restored site, we observed enhanced denitrification in the reconnected floodplain but decreased stream denitrification capacity in pools. Across all sites, streams had lower DEA than riparian zones, stressing the importance of restoration approaches designed to conserve riparian areas and maintain hydrologic connectivity. Easily obtainable data including precipitation, adjacent land use, vegetation, and stream and floodplain geomorphology reasonably predicted denitrification potential compared with more complex models, showing potential for application in water resources and nitrogen management.

AB  - A population survey during the general flowering (GF) of the critically endangered ornamental tree species locally known as Philippine teak (Tectona philippinensis Benth. & Hook. f., Lamiaceae) was conducted in four adjoining municipalities and across 14 barangays of Lobo in southern Batangas, Philippines in 2008. During the mass flowering episode of Philippine teak, 4,479 trees were counted based on plotless-ocular canopy density count. Natural population was pictured along coastal forests, littoral cliffs and inland exposed limestone ridges (5-200 m above sea level) in the municipality of Lobo (2,963) and adjoining Batangas City (946), Taysan (98) and San Juan (464). At least 62% (170 of 275 individuals) in the sampled habitats belonged to large diameter at breast height (DBH) class-size that exhibits GF. Flowering in at least >30 cm DBH class was observed during the arrival of the northeast monsoon in June until mid-July while masting started in August and drupes matured in September. Vegetative phenology (major leaf flushing) was observed from September to January until the population became leafless snags in summer.

TI  - Urban Stream Assessment Procedure: A Framework for Assessing Stream Health in the Urban Environment
PY  - 2020
AB  - Various multi-scale hierarchical river health approaches and assessments have been developed and implemented with a variety of scientific and management purposes. Although many existing biological and geomorphological assessments offer insights into stream function, none were developed for or exclusively capture the functions of streams in the urban environment. Quantitative aspects of existing screening tools are limited in urban streams due to the unique combination of hydrogeomorphic and anthropogenic factors in the urban environment. Analyzing the physical, biological, and social drivers within the concept of the urban stream syndrome coupled with recent advances in stream assessments connects the health of urban streams with past, present, and future impacts. The urban stream assessment procedure (USAP) provides an innovative framework and conceptual model to comprehensively assess stream functions in the urban environment and quantify their health at multiple scales. The specific aim is to identify the highest function and lowest maintenance \"version\" of an urban stream that is achievable given the context-varying hydrologic regimes, geomorphic conditions, ecological diversity, social contexts, and community goals. It is designed to classify urban stream reaches and corridors according to their hydrological, geomorphological, vegetation characteristics and to support identification of reaches that might be candidates for rehabilitation. Employing a multi-scale framework yields greater success in assessing stream function, diagnosing watershed-wide drivers, and implementing strategies to enhance streams in the urban environment. Furthermore, the USAP framework can assist water resources managers in assessing and managing health specific to urban streams through applicable spatial and relevant parameters and metrics.

TI  - WEIGHTED LINEAR COMBINATIONOF A GIS ENVIRONMENT IN THE DEFINITION OF PRIORITY AREAS FOR CONNECTIVITY AMONG FOREST FRAGMENTS
PY  - 2012
AB  - Forest fragmentation of anthropogenic origin is one of the results promoted by the disorderly process of the land use and land cover, especially in intensively cultivated landscapes. In this context, this study aimed to define priority areas to facilitate connectivity among forest fragments, seeking forest recovery actions in the Pardo River Basin, SP, using the multicriteria approach (Weighted Linear Combination). The Participator Technique was used to define the criteria and the weights of the factors. The factors considered important to the objective of this study were the following: proximity between the fragments with greater nuclear areas, proximity to forest cover, proximity of the river system, distance to urban centers, slope, erodibility of soil. Whereas the variables that influence the selection of priority areas for forest restoration in the Pardo River Basin, SP contribute with different weights in the final decision process, a hierarchy according to the importance of each factor to the fitness area was established. The major factor was proximity among fragments of the largest nuclear area (0.3713), followed by proximity to forest cover (0.1911), proximity to the river system (0.1516), distance to urban centers (.1168), slope (0.0840) and erodibility (0.0854). The result was a map of priority areas, with five classes of priority. The priority areas occurred in order to promote the first union of forest patches with greater nuclear area, and from this union, the successive expansion of these regions of very high priority tending to very low. The methodology was adequate to the mapping of priority areas for restoration in watersheds. Fragments with bigger nuclear areas, connected with small fragments where they are predominant in the landscape, promoting the formation of larger fragments from the formation of forest corridors and recompositon of vegetation.

TI  - A Visual Assessment of Roadside Poplar Plantings in Turkey
PY  - 2018
AB  - Roadside plantings along urban and rural road corridors are designed to create visual effects as well as to provide functional benefits such as shading, screening or routing. Considering their potential for daily public use, roads and road corridors, as significant visual impact centers, can attract people's attention and affect their points of view. Poplar species, which grow rapidly and easily along road corridors and can adapt to different ecological conditions swiftly, are used widely in both urban and rural landscapes in Turkey. The main objective of this study was to determine the visual structures dependent on the mad-plant relationships of the poplar compositions that play an important role in shaping the roadside landscapes. For this purpose, compositions of poplar trees in selected urban and rural road corridors throughout Turkey were photographed and visual analysis techniques (VATS) were applied to determine visual preferences. Participants (n= 35) were shown 30 photographs, selected from the nearly 1000 taken, of road corridor poplar plantings and their evaluations were recorded in a questionnaire. In this survey, the people were requested to evaluate their appreciation levels towards the plantings as well as to express their other visual preferences and to assess visual quality. In addition, the association of all these evaluations with the demographic characteristics of the participants were determined. A correlation analysis was then performed to identify the relationships among all the visual assessments and a cluster analysis was conducted according to the visual status of the photographs in order to determine their groups. In the results of the study, the poplar trees, either individually or in the form of compositions, were reported to have a significant visual diversity. Moreover, the cluster analysis found the resulting three groups to be associated with leaf density, seasonal conditions and the trees as individuals or in groups. The seasonal variation factor in particular was shown to be visually effective in the poplar compositions. It was determined that visual perception of the poplar plantations differed in accordance with the demographic differences. This work established that poplar plantations as single trees or in groups and their proximity to the road altered visual preferences, and consequently, some suggestions were made concerning the use of poplars in roadside landscape planning.

TI  - Landscape planning for a rural ecosystem: case study of a resettlement area for residents from land submerged by the Three Gorges Reservoir, China
PY  - 2003
AB  - The goals of landscape planning are multiple for rural ecosystems of the resettlement area in the Hubei Province of China. They relate to the types, diversity and patterns of the ecosystems, and to the conservation of ecosystem functions and biodiversity. We were interested in the improvement of socio-economic conditions, and the promotion of the development of farmland ecosystems and natural forest ecosystems. The landscape planning took into account the conservation and the restoration of forestlands, and the reconstructions of farmlands, towns and villages. The areas of towns and villages were assigned by trade-off analysis balancing ecological, economic and social benefits. The spatial pattern of used lands was designed by a multi-criteria optimal spatial planning, resulting in the strengthening of some primary ecosystem functions. In the resettlement area forests will expand to a matrix, and cropland patches together with tree fences will form patch-corridor systems. Significant ecological, economic and social benefits can be derived from this landscape pattern.

TI  - Genetic connectivity of the grey partridge in central northern France in a highly man dominated landscape
PY  - 2014
AB  - The loss and fragmentation of the landscape are the main causes of the decline and the extinction of many wildlife species. In this study we test the impact of landscape features on the genetic connectivity of a sedentary bird. Populations of our case study, the grey partridge (Perdix perdix armoricana), occur in central northern France. This is considered as the last bastion of high grey partridge densities in Europe and thus represents a relevant zone for the conservation of P. p. armoricana. Despite a highly man dominated landscape, results from the analysis of 12 microsatellite genotypes suggest the beginning of a genetic structure. This emerging genetic structure can result from the last historical event having occurred in the study area: a massive urbanization since the nineteenth century following the increase of the human density and town surface. Another hypothesis suggests that the weak genetic structure can result from a massive restocking with captive-bred individuals at a more or less recent point in time.

TI  - Influences of watershed, riparian-corridor, and reach-scale characteristics on aquatic biota in agricultural watersheds
PY  - 2001
AB  - Multivariate analyses and correlations revealed strong relations between watershed and riparian-corridor land cover, and reach-scale habitat versus fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages in 38 warmwater streams in eastern Wisconsin. Watersheds were dominated by agricultural use, and ranged in size from 9 to 71 km(2). Watershed land cover was summarized from satellite-derived data for the area outside a 30-m buffer. Riparian land cover was interpreted from digital orthophotos within 10-, 10- to 20-, and 20- to 30-m buffers. Reach-scale habitat, fish, and macroinvertebrates were collected in 1998 and biotic indices calculated. Correlations between land cover, habitat, and stream-quality indicators revealed significant relations at the watershed, riparian-corridor, and reach scales. At the watershed scale, fish diversity, intolerant fish and EPT species increased, and Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI) decreased as percent forest increased. At the riparian-corridor scale, EPT species decreased and HBI increased as riparian vegetation became more fragmented. For the reach, EPT species decreased with embeddedness. Multivariate analyses further indicated that riparian (percent agriculture, grassland, urban and forest, and fragmentation of vegetation), watershed (percent forest) and reach-scale characteristics (embeddedness) were the most important variables influencing fish (IBI, density, diversity, number, and percent tolerant and insectivorous species) and macroinvertebrate (HBI and EPT) communities.

TI  - Urban primate ranging patterns: GPS- collar deployments for Macaca fascicularis and M. sylvanus
PY  - 2017
AB  - The global increase in urbanization is leading to heavier interface between humans and wildlife. Within these anthropogenic landscapes, little is known about ranging patterns, particularly with regard to urban primates. Here we present the results of the first long-term deployment of multiple GPS collars on two species of macaques to investigate the impacts of urbanization on urban primate ranging patterns in Singapore and Gibraltar. Collars data acquisition were excellent with respect to the amount, quality, and accuracy of data collected; however, remote connectivity and drop-off functionality was poor across all deployments. Analyses highlighted high variability in ranging patterns between individuals within each species that aligned with access to human food resources and patterns of tourism. Individuals from troops with less access to human food had much larger home, core, and day ranges relative to those with regular provisioning or raiding opportunities. Almost no temporal range overlap was observed between any focal individuals at either site and spatial overlap was low for all but two troops at each site. We found no relationship between anthropogenic schedules and changes in ranging patterns. Significant seasonal variation existed for daily path length and day range size for both the Singapore long-tailed and the Gibraltar Barbary macaques, with long-tailed macaques increasing their range during the equatorial monsoon season and Barbary macaques increasing their range during drier, summer months. This study highlights how the behavioral plasticity found within the genus Macaca is reflected in ranging pattern variability within urban environments.

TI  - Physical habitat assessment in urban rivers under future flow scenarios
PY  - 2003
AB  - River corridors in urban environments provide areas of biodiversity which are important for both aesthetic and economic reasons. A physical habitat model, which was used to assess urban rivers in Birmingham, UK, was applied to pairs of selected reaches to represent differing levels of habitat diversity on three rivers. The results for different life-stages of dace, roach and chub suggest that the worst physical habitat occurs in highly modified channels and at the highest flows. Four scenarios, which were designed to represent alterations in flow regime caused by changes in management practices, were calculated using the hydrological model. Changes in physical habitat created by changes to the flow regime were assessed using a consistent, replicable method. It was shown that an increase in runoff would have detrimental effects in all cases, and that less engineered sites would benefit more from flow reductions. The lack of a suitable habitat for fry is shown to be a limiting factor for fish at all sites.

TI  - Seed rain in and between vegetation patches in arid Patagonia, Argentina
PY  - 2007
AB  - Seed rain has ecological consequences on plant community structure. This study was conducted in the Monte Austral Neuquino nearby the town of Picun Leufu, Province of Neuquen. Argentina, within an area of 15 km x 15 km (39 degrees 20 32'S; 69 degrees 19 30' W). Studies were conducted at two sites, distant 1.5 km from one another. Vegetation is distributed on the soil surface us vegetation patches. Four superficial locations may be found in the soil of these patches: location 1, small dune accumulated under the lee; location 2, found at the edge of the small dune, and below the major grass canopies and tallest shrubs; location 3, located at the edge of the vegetation patch, and location 4 which includes the uncovered corridors among vegetation patches. Seed rain was measured by collecting seeds from traps located in the four study locations. Our working hypotheses were that (1) seeds of the study species arrive to all locations of the vegetation patches and the nude corridors among patches, and (2) the magnitude of the seed rain depends on time of the year. Larrea divaricata showed the greatest values in the corridors among vegetation patches and in the periphery of such patches. A similar pattern was found for S. neaei although this species dispersed seeds further from the mother plant. Atriplex lampa distributed seeds homogeneously in all four locations. Elymus erianthus only contributed 1 seed to the seed rain. Larrea, divaricata showed a greater, proportion of its total seed rain between December and March in all locations. Seed rain in A. lampa was almost permanent throughout the year while in S. neaei was concentrated in December and January, although it showed some seed rain until April.

TI  - West Nile virus in California
PY  - 2004
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) was first isolated in California during July 2003 from a pool of Culex tarsalis collected near El Centro, Imperial County. WNV transmission then increased and spread in Imperial and Coachella Valleys, where it was tracked by isolation from pools of Cx. tarsalis, seroconversions in sentinel chickens, and seroprevalence in free-ranging birds. WNV then dispersed to the city of Riverside, Riverside County, and to the Whittier Dam area of Los Angeles County, where it was detected in dead birds and pools of Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus. By October, WNV was detected in dead birds collected from riparian corridors in Los Angeles, west to Long Beach, and through inland valleys south from Riverside to San Diego County. WNV was reported concurrently from Arizona in mid-August, and from Baja, Mexico, in mid-November. Possible mechanisms for virus introduction, amplification, and dispersal are discussed.

TI  - Modelling the third dimension: Incorporating topography into the movement rules of an individual-based spatially explicit population model
PY  - 2007
AB  - wide variety of topographical and environmental elements have been shown or proposed to influence the movement decisions of dispersing animals. Most real landscapes have topographical elements such as hills, valleys and urban developments, which can all act to modify a species' perceptual range and directly influence movement behaviour. If a visual-based perceptual ability enables a dispersing individual to locate suitable habitat patches at a distance, then it is to be expected that topographical features would act to modify the overall success of this strategy. However, the majority of individual-based Spatially Explicit Population Models (SEPM) employ only two-dimensional landscapes. To investigate the effects of topographical elevation on dispersal patterns, a three-dimensional visual-based perceptual range algorithm was added to the dispersal rules of an individual-based SEPM. To explore the possible influences of a behavioural-based response to topography, an algorithm modelling valley-seeking behaviour was also developed. The performance of both algorithms was compared with that of a two-dimensional visual-based perceptual range algorithm. The overall consequences of dispersal under each algorithm were measured by recording population sizes in a target wood in the centre of a modelled, real landscape. The size of the population in the target wood, modelled using both of the three-dimensional algorithms, exhibited sensitivity to the direction of dispersal in interaction with perceptual range, which differed from that predicted by the two-dimensional approach. Population size was dependant on the spatial configuration of habitat patches and on the topography of the landscape, both of which could guide dispersers either towards or away from the target patch depending on the particular combinations of dispersal directions and perceptual ranges selected. Topography was found to have a greater effect on dispersal at shorter perceptual ranges, and thresholds in the results for all three algorithms suggested the existence of species and landscape dependant optimal perceptual ranges. It is recommended that both topography and topographical-based dispersal-altering algorithms, commensurate with the studied species' behaviour, be incorporated into the movement rule-base of dispersal simulation models. The modelling of topography and its effects on movement in patchy landscapes are seen as essential ingredients in future landscape planning. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The evolution of Greenways in China
PY  - 2006
AB  - This paper focuses on the evolution of Greenway planning and implementation in China, and provides a historical context to the Greenway concept. It was found that: (1) Although the concept of Greenway was an adaptation from the Western World, the Chinese have a history of more than 2000 years of Greenway planning and implementation. Chinese Greenways have been called various names and were planned for various reasons. (2) The long history of Greenway planning and implementation in China was mainly a \"top-down\" approach, which, while very effective under a centralized administrative system, often lacked a scientific basis and significant public participation. (3) The functions of the Greenways were mainly protection and productive, with little concern for human uses such recreational uses of cycling and hiking. Greenways in China are discussed chronologically and in three categories: (1) Riparian Greenways run along rivers, streams and water channels. The history of these Greenways dates more than 2000 years, since a time when trees were grown along canals and city moats. They have in modern times evolved into a network of drainage channels. (2) Greenways along transportation corridors. These Greenways run parallel to state and provincial highways, railroads, country roads and urban streets and evolved from tree plantings along highways. Used exclusively by emperors, the green corridor networks have been systematically planned and constructed at a national scale and directly organized by the central government. (3) Greenways along farmland for wind protection. These plantings evolved from individual segments of windbreak rows to a network of protective windbreaks and the large, regional scale \"Green Great Wall\" project running along the northern edge of China. As Greenways have evolved in China, they reflect changes in ideology, utilization and scale; from protection of production or beautification to ecological and multiple uses, and from small-scale fragments to a systematic regional and national network. The occurrence of disasters, the involvement of state leaders and the influence of science played an important role in the evolution of Greenways in China. The paper also argues that: the traditional top-down approach in Greenway planning and implement should be integrated with scientifically based methods; recreational uses should be considered and integrated into existing and planned Greenways; the recently invoked \"city beautiful\", or cosmetic approach to Greenway planning and implementation should be stopped; and Greenways should be planned as an critical strategic element of ecological infrastructure at both the regional and urban scale during current rapid and extensive urbanization occurring in China.

TI  - An innovative approach to identify environmental variables with conservation priorities in habitat patches
PY  - 2021
AB  - Conservation of habitat patches and the related environment benefits both the focal species and human wellbeing. Many indices use the dispersal range to identify habitat patches with conservation priorities. However, there lacks approaches to identify environmental variables with conservation priorities (noted as target variables) in those identified patches. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach to identify environmental variables with conservation priorities in habitat patches using perception range and introduces the related assumption. It is assumed the agents select habitats based on their prior preference and perceived information in their perception ranges, which avoids the omniscient assumption of agents. Based on such assumptions, the proposed approach identifies the target variables by approximating how animals identify their habitats. It highlights the use of perception range and identifies target variables using the maximum information gain. The variables that contribute the largest reduction of uncertainty are regarded as the target variables in the habitat patches. Taking the Common Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) living in Tianjin, China as the case, different scenarios with 100 m, 250 m and 500 m perception ranges are designed to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The proposed approach identifies the normalized vegetation index, rather than the distance to water surface, is the target variable in 42.3%, 58.9% and 72.1% habitat patches with given perception ranges. Adjustments are made on areas within the given perception range of each patch. More grid cells that has increased suitability index can be found in scenarios given 250 m perception range, which indicates the conservation area is not always the large the better. Optimizations are expected on both a better approximation method and a more thorough hypothesis of using perception range.

TI  - Restricted human activities shift the foraging strategies of feral pigeons (Columba livia) and three other commensal bird species
PY  - 2021
AB  - Invasive species are a growing concern with increasing global connectivity. Feral pigeons (Columba livia) are widespread and invasive, thus their effective control is of keen international interest. The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the impact of a nation-wide Circuit Breaker (restricted human activities) in Singapore on first, the abundance of the feral pigeons and three urban commensals-the Javan myna (Acridotheres javanicus), common myna (A. tristis), and house crow (Corvus splendens) in different food source types; and second, the activity budgets of feral pigeons. A significant and progressive decline in feral pigeon abundance was observed in open food centres and feeding hotspots after the Circuit Breaker was implemented. While the house crow and common myna were less affected, the Javan myna abundance increased moderately at refuse collection centres during the Circuit Breaker and decreased significantly in green spaces after the Circuit Breaker. Changes in food abundance could also predict changes in feral pigeon abundance and its effect was greatest in feeding hotspots. A greater proportion of feral pigeons was observed foraging and moving with a smaller proportion seen resting with probable consequences on their reproductive capacity. Our study also cautions against drawing inferences on biological responses due to similar social restrictions without careful consideration of other ecological factors, like average flock size and time of the day, which also affected the proportion of pigeons foraging on natural versus anthropogenic food. In summary, our results advocate a food limitation approach to control the feral pigeon populations.

TI  - Gap crossing decisions by forest songbirds during the post-fledging period
PY  - 1997
AB  - Gaps in forest cover, created by agriculture, forestry, and other anthropogenic activities, are assumed to impede the movements of many forest songbirds. Little is known, however, about the reluctance of different species of birds to cross habitat gaps. We studied this by inducing birds in the post-fledging period to cross gaps of varying widths and to choose between routes through woodland or across open areas by attracting them to a recording of mobbing calls by Chickadees (Parus atricapillus). In 278 experiments conducted in boreal forest and agricultural landscapes near Quebec city, 157 birds or flocks of birds of five species were attracted. Overall, birds were twice as likely to travel through 50 m of woodland than through 50 m in the open to reach the recording. When given a choice of traveling through woodland or across a gap, the majority of respondents preferred woodland routes, even when they were three times longer than shortcuts in the open. However, species differed greatly in their response to gaps. Our results show that woodland links significantly facilitate movements of birds across fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Walkability and pedestrian perceptions in Malang City emerging business corridor
PY  - 2013
AB  - Sukarno-Hatta street corridor is forecasted to be one of Malang City business corridors. However, the condition of its pedestrian facilities is not suitable for pedestrian. The rapid activities along the Sukarno-Hatta street corridor are not in accordance with the services of its pedestrian facilities; so, it is necessary to plan a walkable street corridor that accommodates pedestrian perceptions. Several descriptive and quantitative analysis methods used in this research are support activity analysis, the pattern of pedestrian movement, importance performance analysis and walkability tool index by U.S. Department and Human Services. Based on walkability analysis, the level of walkability of Sukarno-Hatta street corridor is 52.49%, which means the walkability level is medium. The improvements of pedestrian way based on pedestrian perception are: improvement and addition of pedestrian ways that are not continuous, planting plants that can reduce air pollution, availability of crossings, the addition of shade trees, traffic management to reduce vehicle congestion and parking designs.

TI  - An ecological analysis of environmental correlates of active commuting in urban US
PY  - 2014
AB  - We conduct a cross-sectional ecological analysis to examine environmental correlates of active commuting in 39,660 urban tracts using data from the 2010 Census, 2007-2011 American Community Survey, and other sources. The five-year average (2007-2011) prevalence is 3.05% for walking, 0.63% for biking, and 7.28% for public transportation to work, with higher prevalence for all modes in lower-income tracts. Environmental factors account for more variances in public transportation to work but economic and demographic factors account for more variances in walking and biking to work. Population density, median housing age, street connectivity, tree canopy, distance to parks, an quality, and county sprawl index are associated with active commuting, but the association can vary in size and direction for different transportation mode and for higher-income and lower-income tracts.

TI  - Social and Cultural Role of Greenery in Development of Cittaslow Towns
PY  - 2019
AB  - The beginnings of the Cittaslow movement date back to 1998 Italian towns became a model for other European towns, and subsequently for others, around the world. This is how an international movement came into being, founded on the idea of improvement of the quality of life of residents, savouring \"slow\", healthy lifestyle, drawing on the tradition and history and respecting the natural and cultural environment of small towns. Green areas play a huge role in creating the image of Cittaslow towns. They constitute the so-called \"green urban corridors\" or \" green spots\" and have cultural, educational and social significance, including recreation and spa functions. They are not only a complement to architecture, but can play a superior role in the structure of cities. The aim of the work is to analyze the state of parks, squares and green areas management in the Cittaslow towns in region of Warmia and Mazury (Poland). There are 20 environmentally, spatially, economically and demographically diverse towns in the region of Warmia and Mazury that acceded to the association. The international network includes towns with a population under 50 thousand. An analysis of the source materials involved gathering and interpretation of information obtained from monographic and cartographic documentation, both current and archival, from websites of Cittaslow towns and mentions in the media. Apart from a monographic study, the authors carried out a landscape and spatial analysis, pre-project studies and made original designs for selected urban parks and greens in Cittaslow towns. All the Cittaslow towns in the Province of Warmia and Mazury under analysis have high potential in terms of using greenery areas with the social and cultural function. Parks and squares are perfect places for integration of communities and for conducting educational and cultural activities. However, diversity regarding land development and programme offer is observed (utility programme). In some towns, greenery areas cover only space with planned (not always in accordance with the art of gardening) plant compositions. However, parks and squares should be planned not only with their visual aspect in mind, but emphasis should be placed on their utility side (active use). Therefore, the article points to the directions of development of new places, as well the possibility of adding socio-cultural functions to existing greenery areas.

TI  - A channel evolution model to guide sustainable urban stream restoration
PY  - 2015
AB  - Channel evolution models (CEMs) are used to structure the interpretation of observed channel morphology to support long-term restoration of these systems. However, channels reflect the variety of their watersheds' climatological, ecological and physiographic contexts, and so no single CEM can be truly global'. Unrecognised differences between the assumptions and the reality of evolutionary trajectories of particular streams can subsequently lead to restoration actions that neither fully achieve their intended objectives nor successfully self-maintain even limited improvements. Despite the daunting variety of biophysical settings, however, urbanisation imposes distinctive, homogenising influences on virtually all watercourses, suggesting that even a relatively small set of evolutionary pathways can embrace much of the diversity of critical watershed drivers on urban channels. CEMs describing single-thread channel response to incision are most common in the published literature, but not every urban disturbance yields this classic sequence, initiated by excess transport capacity followed by incision, bank erosion, widening and ultimately a lowered re-equilibrated channel. A comprehensive urban CEM must also include responses under less common (but locally ubiquitous) conditions, such as excess sediment relative to transport capacity (the inverse' of the classic CEM), imposed constraints on vertical and/or lateral adjustment, and multi-thread channels or those influenced by instream or riparian vegetation. An urban CEM also requires a hierarchical framework that acknowledges fundamental differences in the process drivers within any given watershed, because a single observation of channel form can rarely pinpoint the context or evolutionary trajectory of every stream. We present a geomorphic framework for diagnosing and predicting the evolution of urban streams, potentially guiding the selection of restoration targets that are achievable within an urban context and sustainable without ongoing maintenance.

TI  - Analysing Process and Probability of Built-Up Expansion Using Machine Learning and Fuzzy Logic in English Bazar, West Bengal
PY  - 2022
AB  - The study sought to investigate the process of built-up expansion and the probability of built-up expansion in the English Bazar Block of West Bengal, India, using multitemporal Landsat satellite images and an integrated machine learning algorithm and fuzzy logic model. The land use and land cover (LULC) classification were prepared using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for 2001, 2011, and 2021. The landscape fragmentation technique using the landscape fragmentation tool (extension for ArcGIS software) and frequency approach were proposed to model the process of built-up expansion. To create the built-up expansion probability model, the dominance, diversity, and connectivity index of the built-up areas for each year were created and then integrated with fuzzy logic. The results showed that, during 2001-2021, the built-up areas increased by 21.67%, while vegetation and water bodies decreased by 9.28 and 4.63%, respectively. The accuracy of the LULC maps for 2001, 2011, and 2021 was 90.05, 93.67, and 96.24%, respectively. According to the built-up expansion model, 9.62% of the new built-up areas was created in recent decades. The built-up expansion probability model predicted that 21.46% of regions would be converted into built-up areas. This study will assist decision-makers in proposing management strategies for systematic urban growth that do not damage the environment.

TI  - Roads reduce amphibian abundance in ponds across a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2021
AB  - Roads threaten animal species through habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and direct mortality. It is crucial to understand how species respond to linear infrastructure for effective conservation of animal communities in fragmented landscapes. We assessed relationships between amphibian abundance and roads/ railways and habitat fragmentation. We examined whether the combined effects of habitat loss and roads or railways (accessible habitat) was a better predictor of amphibian abundance than (1) the total amount of habitat surrounding ponds, (2) distance to a highway or railway, or (3) surrounding road cover. Aquatic surveys for amphibian larvae were conducted at 30 freshwater ponds over the breeding season in a mixed peri-urban/ agricultural landscape in Hungary. Landscape variables were quantified within a 1000-m radius surrounding ponds and habitat variables were measured at the local (pond) scale. The larvae of seven amphibian species were detected. There were strong relationships between the abundance of amphibian larvae and the distance to a highway and the proportion of road cover within 1000 m of ponds. Relationships with accessible habitat and total habitat amount were uncertain, while there were no clear relationships with a major railway. Larval abundance increased with pond size, but there were mixed relationships with the presence of fish. Our results suggest that road effects were having a stronger impact on amphibian abundance than the combined effects of roads and habitat amount in the study area. Highways appeared to be negatively impacting amphibian communities within a wide road-effect zone up to 1 km from ponds. However, our results were obtained from a single-season snap-shot study and multi-season surveys are likely required to reduce uncertainty in the model predictions. Our analysis suggests that road mitigation projects for amphibians should create large ponds in areas with no highways and low road density, and with connectivity to surrounding habitats.

TI  - First inventory and faunistic particularities of the chironomid population from a 6(th) order section of the sandy River Loire (France)
PY  - 2000
AB  - The chironomid populations of a 40km section of the middle Loire (Tours region) were studied for the first time. Six collections (distributed over the years 1994 to 1996) of pupal exuviae and benthic pupae were made from April to November, in the main river bed, at 4 sites of this potamal zone. A total of 12,073 specimens were sorted and 117 species or taxa identified. Thirty one are new for continental France, in particular Polypedilum acifer TOWNEs and Saetheria reissi JACKSON, two dominant species. Among these, three genera are new: Hayesomyia, Robackia and Saetheria. A new pupal exuvia which has only been noted in the Loire has been recorded: Chironomus Pe23 (LANGTON 1995). A comparison of the middle Loire chironomid fauna with that of the potamal zones of five large European rivers - Rhone and Garonne (France)- Meuse (Belgium) - Po (Italy) - Rhine (Germany) - confirms the diversity and faunistic originality of the middle Loire using several descriptors such as diversity indexes, rarefaction curves, equitability index, distribution of species abundance, number of \"endemic\" species and distribution of dominant species. Causes of the high specific richness observed, as well as rare species abundance or scarcity, are discussed taking into account functional characteristics of the River Loire's potamic parts such as the connectivity pattern. The relationship between high biodiversity and large, sandy rivers is also discussed using similar results obtained on two other large sandy rivers: the Po and the Elbe (Germany) rivers.

TI  - Ecophysiology of riparian cottonwood and willow before, during, and after two years of soil water removal
PY  - 2010
AB  - Riparian cottonwood/willow forest assemblages are highly valued in the southwestern United States for their wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and watershed protection. Yet these forests are under considerable threat from climate change impacts on water resources and land-use activities to support human enterprise. Stream diversions, groundwater pumping, and extended drought have resulted in the decline of cottonwood/willow forests along many riparian corridors in the Southwest and, in many cases, the replacement of these forests with less desirable invasive shrubs and trees. Nevertheless, ecophysiological responses of cottonwood and willow, along with associated ecohydrological feedbacks of soil water depletion, arc not well understood. Ecophysiological processes of mature Fremont cottonwood and coyote willow stands were examined over four consecutive growing seasons (2004-2007) near Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The tree stands occurred near the inlet of a reservoir that was drained in the spring of 2005 and remained empty until mid-summer of 2006, effectively removing the primary water source for most of two growing seasons. Stem sap flux density (J(s)) in cottonwood was highly correlated with volumetric soil moisture (theta) in the upper 60 cm and decreased sevenfold as soil moisture dropped from 12% to 7% after the reservoir was drained. Conversely. J(s) in willow was marginally correlated with theta and decreased by only 25% during the same period. Opposite patterns emerged during the following growing season: willow had a lower whole-plant conductance (k(t)) in June and higher leaf carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) than cottonwood in August, whereas k(t) and delta(13)C were otherwise similar between species. Water relations in both species recovered quickly from soil water depletion, with the exception that sapwood area to stem area (A(s):A(st)) was significantly lower in both species after the 2007 growing season compared to 2004. Results suggest that cottonwood has a greater sensitivity to interannual reductions in water availability, while willow is more sensitive to longer periods of soil water depletion. These data shed light on the linkage between soil water deficits and ecophysiological processes of threatened riparian forests given potential land-use and long-term drought impacts on freshwater resources.

TI  - Traffic noise alters individual social connectivity, but not space-use, of Red-backed Fairywrens
PY  - 2020
AB  - The prevalence of human-generated noise is posing novel challenges to birds, by changing how they communicate or causing them to disperse away from the source of noise. We sought to understand how noise affected space-use and social connectivity in a small passerine bird, the Red-backed Fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus). As the displaced birds would likely be forced to occupy a smaller area that may already have resident individuals, we predicted that noise-affected birds would show increased social connectivity that may include new individuals. To test this, we introduced an experimental point-source of traffic noise to groups of fairywrens in an otherwise quiet habitat and compared the change in social connectivity of birds in groups exposed to noise to the changes in social connectivity in neighbouring groups unaffected by noise. Contrary to our prediction, noise-affected birds had reduced social connectivity during experimental noise treatments, as measured by weighted-degree, which was driven by a reduction of interactions with birds of neighbouring groups outside the noise zone. Additionally, we did not discern a change in space-use in response to our noise treatment. Therefore, we suggest that noise reduces the efficacy of signal transmission and detection in this species, resulting in the reduction of social connectivity between groups of this otherwise highly social songbird.

TI  - An annotated checklist of the birds of Singapore
PY  - 2007
AB  - This annotated checklist is the third major compilation for Singapore. It lists the current status of all bird species ever recorded in the wild in Singapore. A total of 404 species have been recorded, including 44 species which are now extinct or have not been recorded for the last 50 years. Some of the latter species have been recorded again as non-breeding visitors. There are now 342 species that occur naturally in Singapore and another 22 species that were introduced by man. Fifty-eight families of birds are represented. There are 121 resident species with proven breeding records and 21 other presumed residents. One hundred and fifty-four species are winter visitors and/or passage migrants, with another 25 species listed as non-breeding visitors and 21 others that occur in Singapore as vagrants. Census data since 1991 shows that the total number of birds in Singapore has declined by 40 % and the number of species has declined by nearly 17 %. The most abundant bird species Is a migrant, the Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis fulva). The most important site in terms of bird population is Sungei Mandai, an unprotected mudflat and mangrove ecosystem while Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Pulau Ubin are important in having the highest diversities of birds. The loss of mudflats through reclamation, damming of estuaries, and canalisation of rivers has resulted in a decline in waterbird density and diversity as shown in the Annual Waterfowl Census. The current total shorebird population in Singapore is only 4,000 - 5,000 birds, a vast decrease from the large wintering population of 10,000 birds at a single site, the Serangoon Estuary, in 1985. Forty-one of the 44 extinct species were resident forest birds, of which, 34 (82.9 %) went extinct between 1900 and 1950. This equates to 3.4 species lost every five years, an alarming rate of extinction for a small island like Singapore. The most susceptible families are the Trogonidae and Eurylaimidae, with 100 % species loss, and Picidae, with 56.3 % species loss. The susceptible bird families are predominantly those of the forest, whereas the resistant families exist largely in open country and scrub. In fact, only three extinct species were not largely dependent on tropical rainforests for their existence. Forest species such as the Green Broadbill (Calyptomena viridis) became extinct from the forests as recently as 1941. This emphasises the role that habitat destruction has played in shaping Singapore's avifauna. Fifty-four species of birds are at risk of extinction, of which 34 species (63 %) live in the forest. The remaining patches of forest in Singapore are mostly protected in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve that should provide a safe haven for the forest birds. However, the forests are too fragmented, small and constantly disturbed by thousands of visitors. By connecting the smaller Bukit Timah Nature Reserve to the much larger Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the forest patch size can be increased and might allow more movement of animals and plants between the two patches. Many forest birds are secretive or weak fliers and are reluctant to cross open spaces. A green corridor might encourage them to do so. Another 16 species (29.6 %) of threatened birds are specialists of mangroves and wetlands. Preservation of these most-threatened of ecosystems in Singapore is of utmost importance to the survival of the birds found in these special habitats. With improvement in the quality of habitats, we could perhaps slow down the rate of local extinction of the avifauna of Singapore. Our remaining habitats need to be protected and laws protecting wildlife must be strictly enforced, so that the birds may have a chance to coexist with us.

TI  - Introduction and Establishment of Raccoon Rabies on Islands: Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA as a Case Study
PY  - 2018
AB  - The introduction of rabies virus (RABV) to barrier islands, which are often popular tourist destinations with resource-rich habitats and connectivity and proximity to the mainland, is especially concerning because it can easily become endemic due to factors like dense rabies-vector populations (e.g., raccoons [Procyon lotor]), high inter-and intraspecies contact rates, and anthropogenic activities such as supplemental feeding of feral cats (Felis catus). In January 2013, a neurologic raccoon found on the Jekyll Island (JI), Georgia, US causeway tested positive for rabies. Mortality investigations of 29 raccoons have been conducted between December 2012-May 2017. The two most common diagnoses were RABV (n = 11) and canine distemper virus (CDV; n = 8). Parvoviral enteritis was diagnosed in four raccoons but no coinfections were diagnosed. There was no apparent seasonality for rabies cases, but all CDV cases occurred in spring-fall. Most (64%) rabies submissions came from residential or recreational use areas located near feral cat feeding stations. Jekyll Island is a popular destination where tourists engage in numerous outdoor activities which facilitate human-wildlife interactions. Concerns regarding public and animal health highlight the importance of rabies surveillance, prevention, and control on islands. This is the first report of rabies on JI and emphasizes the importance of disease investigations because the assumption that neurologic raccoons have CDV, an endemic pathogen, can miss the establishment of novel pathogens such as RABV.

TI  - Habitat associations of gopher tortoise burrows on industrial timberlands
PY  - 2004
AB  - The western population of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1987 due to extensive population declines. Declines have been linked to site conversion of native pine (Pinus spp.) forests for urban development, agriculture, and commercial forest management. We conducted surveys to detect tortoise burrows on corporate timberlands in southern Mississippi and southwestern Alabama during summer 1994. We surveyed 2,759 0.5-ha strip transects on soil types of 9 different suitability categories for gopher tortoises. We found 460 active and 264 abandoned burrows on the 1,380 ha surveyed. Edaphic and vegetative conditions, such as sandy soils and total and midstory canopy coverage, influenced gopher tortoise occurrence. Logistic regression analyses revealed that active burrow occurrence was related positively to deep, sandy soils and related negatively to total canopy closure and fine loam soils with limited sand content. Abandoned burrow occurrence was related positively to increasing midstory canopy closure and selected soil types. Sandy soils and open overstory canopy that created favorable burrowing, nesting, and foraging conditions were important influences in active burrow occurrence. Vegetation management techniques, such as prescribed fire, midstory control, and intermediate forest stand thinning, are recommended on gopher tortoise conservation areas and connective corridor habitats on commercial timberlands. We theorize that restoration of longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests on sandy ridges can produce desirable core habitats and dispersal corridors for gopher tortoises in landscapes dominated by intensively managed pine plantations.

TI  - Introduced leaf beetles of the maritime provinces, 6: The common Asparagus beetle, Crioceris asparagi (Linnaeus), and the twelve-spotted Asparagus beetle, Crioceris duodecimpunctata (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae)
PY  - 2008
AB  - The common asparagus beetle, Crioceris asparagi (Linnaeus) and the twelve-spotted asparagus beetle, Crioceris duodecimpunctata (Linnaeus) are introduced Palearctic leaf beetles that feed exclusively on asparagus. The introduction history of these species in North America is reviewed and their dispersal to and distribution in the Maritime Provinces of Canada are described. Both species were first reported in Canada in 1899 in asparagus production areas in Queenston, Ontario, and other parts of the Niagara Peninsula where they caused serious crop damage. However, we discovered that both species were already found around Quebec City 22 years earlier. Populations now established in the Maritime Provinces of Canada probably originated from southwestern Ontario where most commercial asparagus production in Canada began and now occurs. Crioceris asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata spread steadily throughout eastern Canada by adult flight dispersal abetted by wind, by the dissemination of seeds by birds, and by commercial movement of root crowns and spears of asparagus. Asparagus escaped from cultivation, growing along transportation corridors (such as railway tracks, power utility right-of-ways and roads) and in vacant lands, which facilitated the spread and establishment of C. asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata throughout North America. Now, both these adventive pest species occur wherever asparagus is grown. Both C. asparagi and C duodecimpunctata are confirmed to occur in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, but not Newfoundland and Labrador. However, C duodecimpunctata is newly recorded from Prince Edward Island. These introduced beetles are not regulated by Canada or by the U.S.A., and they are readily controlled at economically acceptable damage thresholds.

TI  - A late-Holocene pollen record from the western Qilian Mountains and its implications for climate change and human activity along the Silk Road, Northwestern China
PY  - 2018
AB  - The sparsity of long-term reliable climatic records hampers our understanding of human-environment interactions in the semi-arid Hexi Corridor, NW China. Here, we present a late-Holocene pollen record from a small alpine lake, Tian'E, in the western Qilian Mountains. The chronology is provided by nine accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dates from terrestrial plant remains. The ratios of Artemisia and Amaranthaceae (A/C) are used to reconstruct the history of regional humidity: An unstable climate occurred during 1530-1270 BC; there were three relatively wet periods, at 1270 BC-AD 400, AD 1200-1350, and AD 1600-present; and there were two dry periods, from AD 400 to 1200 and from AD 1350 to 1600. Comparison with tree-ring data indicates that continuous droughts were responsible for the abandonment of several archaeological sites and ancient cities in the region, including the major city of Dunhuang, which was abandoned in AD 1372 and AD 1524 for nearly 200 years.

TI  - Greenways for recreation and maintenance of landscape quality: five case studies in Portugal
PY  - 2006
AB  - The use of the concept of greenway can be identified in Portugal throughout the 20th century as a planning and design tool. Several examples, such as the 'Improvement Plans for Lisbon' by Ressano Garcia (1901), the continuum naturale concept [Cabral, F.C., 1980. O Continuum Naturale e a Conservacao da Natureza. Conservacao da Natureza. Servico de Estudos do Ambiente, Lisbon; Andresen, T., 2001. Francisco Caldeira Cabral. Landscape Design Trust, Surrey, UK, 213 pp.], the Green Plan for Lisbon [Telles, G.R., et al., 1997. Plano Verde de Lisboa. Ed. Colibri, Lisboa, 197 pp.], deal with the subjects of implementing vegetation corridors, pedestrian networks and landscape quality. These examples establish Portuguese planning and design tradition within the international greenway movement first identified by Fabos [Fabos, J.Gy., 1991. From Park to Greenways into the 21st Century. In: Proceedings from Selected Educational Sessions, ASLA Annual Meeting, Kansas City, Missouri]. Though several projects have been developed at the planning level, there is a need to analyze the applicability of such a concept at the regional, municipal and local level. We must consider the characteristics of Portugal's cultural landscape, recognition by other professions dealing with planning and involvement by politicians. By analyzing five case studies, this paper shows the significance of the greenway as a planning and design strategy, which coincides, with the current objectives of political and planning authorities at the municipal level. It also proves that it is possible to reconcile political objectives and urban development while safeguarding landscape quality and providing new opportunities for public recreation and education. Greenway planning and design is now undoubtedly a subject of growing significance in Portugal. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates assemblages related to diverse land uses in the Apatlaco and Chalma-Tembembe rivers (Balsas basin), Mexico
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background. Rivers are considered as integrators systems reflecting physicochemical and biological processes that take place in its catchment area and have a constant flow of matter and energy. This is due to its connectivity and interactions with its watershed and the atmosphere. The Apatlaco and Chalma-Tembembe rivers (Balsas River basin) have different levels of disturbance, caused by changes in land use (US) in its watershed. Goals. To analyze the relationships of the physico-chemical characteristics of water and aquatic macroinvertebrates (AI) assemblages with different US adjacent to Apatlaco and Chalma-Tembembe rivers. Methods. In both rivers, water samples (20 sites studied) and AI were taken for four seasons, and the percentage of US corresponding to their area of impact was determined. Ordination analysis, similarity and Pearson correlation (p < 0.05), with the physicochemical parameters, biological and US were performed. Results. The river Apatlaco presented the higher alterations due to the combination of US, with a high percentage of urban use; Chalma-Tembembe showed more homogeneous physicochemical and biological characteristics. Conclusions. Some assemblage of macroinvertebrates families were correlated with healthy ecosystems (Belostomatidae, Cordulegastridae, Corixidae, Corydalidae, Dryopidae, Elmidae, Hebridae, Helicopsychidae, Heptageniidae, Hydrobiosidae, Lepidostomatidae, Libellulidae, Perlidae, Philopotamidae, Polycentropodidae, Scirtidae, Staphilinidae and Tabanidae); while others with highly disturbed environments (Ancylidae, Asellidae, Chironomidae, Hyalellidae, Psychodidae and Class Hirudinea); and sites impacted by agricultural activities were correlated with moderate abundances and low diversity of AI.

TI  - Distribution of bird diversity in a vulnerable neotropical landscape
PY  - 2004
AB  - Recent withdrawal of the US. military from the Republic of Panama has exposed 64,000 ha of lowland forest in the former Canal Zone to possible development. The forests form a 16-km-wide strip reaching 65 km from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean and function as the water supply for the canal and as home to one of the world's richest terrestrial biotas. We present an overview of the distribution of bird diversity in the forests of the canal area based on 10 years of inventories. A total of 498 terrestrial species has been recorded, of which 177 occur only in lowland forests. More species reside in Caribbean- than in Pacific-slope forests and in the largest forest tracts. The Panamanian government, recognizing the importance of the forests for protection of biodiversity and for proper functioning of the canal, has created two national parks and a national monument in the canal area. One large park, Soberania National Park, currently contains 92% of the region's forest-dwelling species. Two large tracts on the Caribbean coast, the Achiote Road forest and the Fort Sherman forest, are not designated as national parks but are recognized as important forest areas. Those two forests harbor species found nowhere else in the canal corridor Extensive fragmentation, disconnection of forested corridors between foothills and lowlands, and anthropogenic degradation of forests near towns have altered regional bird-community dynamics. Some dynamics occur on large spatial scales, such as the poorly understood movements of elevational and transisthmian migrants. Long-term maintenance of bird species diversity in the canal area will require preservation of the large forest tracts and reestablishment of a forested connection from the canal corridor lowlands to the Chagres lowlands and foothills in the east. Such conservation activities will be challenging to execute given the region's growing human population and desires for a stronger national economy. We recommend protection of remaining forests and active enforcement of protection laws to reduce hunting and further intrusions.

TI  - CHEMICAL STATUS OF SOILS IN 4 URBAN RIPARIAN PLANT-COMMUNITIES
PY  - 1994
AB  - Soil characteristics of four distinct urban riparian plant communities were studied along a drainage ditch in Tempe, AZ. Our objective was to test if plant communities occurred in similar soil chemical conditions in an urban riparian area. We quantified reduction oxidation (redox) potential, pH, electrical conductivity, phosphorus, reduced iron and soil texture. Our results indicate that the four communities sampled occur in differing chemical conditions. Redox potentials in cattail and bulrush dominated communities ranged from -240 to -303 mV while levels of ferrous iron ranged from 17.0 to 38.5 mg kg-1. This indicates that soils of a highly anaerobic nature occur in these two communities. Redox potentials in knotgrass and Johnson grass communities were significantly (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) higher, ranging from +194 to +244 mV. Reduced iron was not found in these communities, indicating the more aerobic nature of these stands. Both cattail and bulrush communities were found in significantly finer soil textures than the knotgrass and Johnson grass communities. In addition to occupying the stream margins, the more aerobic conditions in knotgrass and Johnson grass communities may result from increased water interflow through the soils of these communities. Data of this type are important so that managers can set realistic goals for re-establishment of vegetation in riparian areas that have been impacted by urban and suburban development.

TI  - Change in Sahelian Rivers hydrograph: The case of recent red floods of the Niger River in the Niamey region
PY  - 2012
AB  - Changes in the hydrological regime of Sahelian Rivers are considered based upon the example of the Middle Niger River and its exceptional flood in 2010 near the city of Niamey. It is shown that rainfall in 2010 was only average with respect to the long term record, with neither the monthly rainfall distribution in terms of the amount of rainfall nor the distribution of rainy events changing significantly in the last few decades. Particularly, no increase in the number of extreme rainfall events is observed. In spite of this, the Niger River's right bank tributaries have shown a sharp increase in runoff since the 1970s, which is still ongoing, and has resulted in a modification of the Niger River's regime from a single hydrograph to a two flood hydrograph, the local flood, occurring during the rainy season being the more pronounced one. This modification is likely due to an increase of bare soils and crusted soil areas as a consequence of human pressure, resulting mostly from the spatial extension of crop areas and the shortening of fallow periods. Changes in connectivity of the river networks on both banks of the Niger such as endorheism bursting events also caused an increase in the contributing basin area. Policy makers should be alerted to the effects of intensive cropping, land clearing and overgrazing in some areas, on the hydrological regimes of Sahelian Rivers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Experimental displacement of longnose dace, Rhinichthys cataractae (Actinopterygii, Cyprinidae), reveals rapid fish avoidance of a stormwater drain in an urban watershed
PY  - 2016
AB  - Land-use change associated with human development can alter aquatic habitat and imperil aquatic species. Fish are challenged when urban streams are altered, for example for stormwater conveyance, but little is known about how such activities influence the space use of individual fish. Electronic tagging and experimental displacement of fish can be used to explore site fidelity and homing behaviour of fish and can therefore be useful for testing hypotheses about space use and habitat selection. In this study, we used experimental displacement to determine how longnose dace (LND, Rhinichthys cataractae) utilize reaches within a watershed that have varying degrees of degradation. LND were tagged using passive integrated transponders (PIT tags), transported upstream, and released either into the natural stream reach, impaired stormwater drain reach, or at their confluence. Fixed PIT antennas were used to monitor movement of the PIT-tagged fish among the three reaches for a period of 3 weeks. LND exhibited dramatic and rapid selection against the stormwater drain. No LND moved into the drain and 97% of fish transported to the drain left within 24 h. LND were actively avoiding the stormwater drain, emphasizing the need for enhancement work to improve the biological connectivity of the system.

TI  - Bionomics and Vector Potential of Culex thriambus (Diptera: Culicidae) Mosquitoes in Lake County, California
PY  - 2016
AB  - California statewide West Nile virus (WNV) minimum infection rates in Culex thriambus Dyar mosquitoes are high; however, few specimens are submitted and tested each year, as their distribution seems limited to larval habitats along riparian systems. To evaluate the role of Cx. thriambus in the amplification, maintenance, and overwintering of WNV in Lake County, CA, the bionomics and vector potential of the species was investigated during 2014 and 2015. Culex thriambus was the most abundant mosquito species, with 1,153 adults and 7,624 immatures collected by vacuum aspiration and dip sampling, respectively, at the primary study site. Detection of WNV in four mosquito pools during September through November coincided with peak seasonality. Females entered and maintained a reproductive diapause during winter under field and seminatural conditions. Diapause was initiated in the majority of Cx. thriambus females by October and was terminated by 30 March. Some parous females (7.1%) and those in host-seeking arrest (7.1%) were collected throughout the winter period. An accrual of 679.51 degree-days (degrees D) was necessary for diapause termination under seminatural conditions. Culex thriambus females fed on 16 different avian species during spring and summer, and no mammalian feeds were detected. West Nile viral RNA was detected in four of 42 Cx. thriambus pools tested during June through November and infection rates ranged from 3.53-28.15/1,000 tested. In summary, WNV transmission may be increased along riparian corridors throughout California where Cx. thriambus mosquitoes remain relatively abundant.

TI  - Coastal Transformation and Marine Habitat Loss
PY  - 2015
AB  - Coastal areas are undergoing continuous transformation to sustain the increasing residential, commercial, and tourist activities. However, the proliferation of artificial infrastructures (i.e. marinas and breakwaters) may contribute to destroy and fragment marine natural habitats, to alter the connectivity among populations and, as a consequence, the natural seascape. In particular, the upper sub tidal rocky fringe, where the coastal transformations are more conspicuous, represents the natural habitat of dominant engineering algae, such as Cystoseira and Sargassum; some of them, because of their sensitivity to environmental variability, are considered biological elements of water quality. The recent attempt to measure historical changes in macro algal diversity in the Gulf of Naples has highlighted a dramatic decrease of Cystoseira species in the upper sub littoral zones and at the same time the lack of information on their up to date extension. To verify the influence of coastal development on the decline of Cystoseira species in the Gulf, the percentage of natural/artificial coastal length has been estimated with Google Earth orto-photos. The results testified a correspondence: the higher was the Cystoseira spp. loss, the greater was the development of artificial urban infrastructures. To follow the temporal dynamics of these shallow systems, a complete remonitoring of the fucoid distribution along the Neapolitan coast has been planned. Up to now, the occurrence of these species has been mapped and digitalized in a qGIS database (scale 1:2,500) for the shallowest fringe of the island of Ischia. An ongoing homogenization of diversity at a medium scale has been recorded: Cystoseira compressa (the less sensitive species) is the widespread species; fragmented stands of Cystoseira amentacea (the most sensitive) still exist. Their distribution is limited to natural habitats slope more gently while the highest diversity has been reached in rocky pools. Occasional settlements were recorded on artificial structures when natural marine habitat was preserved in the surrounding area and the distance among the algal patches could not be a limiting factor in the spreading of the species. These preliminary data seem to suggest that a stronger collaboration between engineers and ecologists could favour a better coastal management in order to mitigate the impacts of artificial infrastructures on natural marine ecosystems and avoid the loss of biodiversity.

TI  - Assessing a riverfront rehabilitation project using the comprehensive index of public accessibility
PY  - 2012
AB  - Good urban riverfronts have both ecological and social benefits in urban planning and development. With rapid increase of urban stream rehabilitation projects in developing countries, the concept of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (PAR) has become a highlight in evaluating river ecosystem improvement. In this study the Comprehensive Index of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (CIPAR) that consists of 4 sub-indexes and 12 indicators is designed for assessing the conditions of PAR. The index system is novel for its combined consideration of riverfront accessibilities and benefits. These four sub-indexes measure (1) spatial accessibility reflecting riverfront openness and main transportation convenience, (2) visual accessibility reflecting visual field openness, (3) corridor continuity reflecting riverfront vegetation condition, water-oriented settings, and spatial continuity, and (4) amenity reflecting comfortable experience of riverfront environment and diversity of riverfront activities. Based on the questionnaire and field data collected during March 1-15, 2011, 24 reaches of the Suzhou Creek and its distributaries were assessed with CIPAR, and the urban riverfront after rehabilitation was quantified. The result showed that most of the reaches of Suzhou Creek still suffered a poor-fair PAR condition, and that among the four sub-indexes, visual accessibility got the lowest score with an average score of 0.7. The unsatisfactory PAR condition along the Suzhou Creek mainly resulted from the failure in synchronizing the planning and management of riverfront land uses and river channels in previous phase of the rehabilitation project. This case study supports the use of CIPAR to assess the effectiveness of riverfront rehabilitation project. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cats, cars, and crossings: The consequences of road networks for the conservation of an endangered felid
PY  - 2021
AB  - Encroaching urban development is a leading cause of habitat loss, replacing natural areas with anthropogenic infrastructure and road networks. Roadways can influence the spatial ecology and survival of mammalian carnivores, particularly felids, thereby threatening longterm persistence and conservation of sensitive populations. Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) are a federally endangered felid in the United States with breeding populations restricted to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, an area of extensive anthropogenic expansion. We evaluated the influence of road networks on ocelot survival using a long-term telemetry dataset (1982-2001, n = 59) and draw comparisons with a spatially referenced historical dataset of ocelot-vehicle collisions in the same area (1982-2020, n = 54). Vehicle collisions accounted for 40% of radio-collared ocelot fatalities. Annual survival rates were 0.90 (95% CI = 0.84-0.95) for resident ocelots and 0.66 (95% CI = 0.45-0.97) for transient ocelots. We evaluated biological and road-related factors that may influence ocelot survival using Cox proportional hazards regression. The top model included density of unpaved, low-volume, and high-volume roads within home ranges and resident-transient status. Mortality risk increased 16% with every 0.07 km/km(2) increase of high-volume roads within annual home range, decreased 45% with every 1.12 km/km(2) increase of unpaved roads, and decreased 276% for residents compared to transients. Further, probability of mortality specifically from vehicle collision increased with greater density of low-volume roads within ocelot home ranges. Within the historical dataset of ocelot-vehicle collisions, 46% occurred on low -volume roads while 39% occurred on high-volume roads. Our results highlight the necessity for mitigation strategies on low-volume roads which cause the most ocelot-vehicle collisions. In addition, continued attention towards high-volume roads is necessary to ocelot conservation. Understanding how road attributes affect the survival of species sensitive to urbanization and habitat fragmentation can aid in their conservation. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The distribution and environmental state of vegetated islands within human-impacted European rivers
PY  - 2012
AB  - 1. Vegetated islands within river corridors are pivotal landscape features and are among the first to disappear as a consequence of flow regulation and channelisation. However, how vegetated islands vary along human-impacted rivers is poorly understood. 2. We carried out a detailed analysis of the contemporary distribution, diversity and environmental state of vegetated islands within 12 human-impacted European rivers, using 75 Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images (19992002), historical maps, DEM data and landscape metrics. We tested whether channel fragmentation, catchment land use and the environmental state of fringing floodplains determine the spatial patterns of the islands. We also analysed the historical change of islands within selected sections of the Upper Danube, Upper Rhine and Olt rivers. 3. We identified 2771 islands in the contemporary landscape, varying from 0.06 to 9828 ha. Islands covered up to 21% of the active channel area and contributed up to 32% of the total riparian ecotone length. Island density ranged from 0.06 islands per river-km (River Sava) to 1.6 islands per river-km (River Tagliamento). River regulation has led to a marked loss of island density: 94% in the Upper Danube, 93% in the Upper Rhine, and 69% in the Olt. The environmental state of the islands was significantly less altered by human activity than of their fringing floodplains; 93.4% of the vegetated islands exhibited a near-natural state, while 86% of the fringing floodplains were expansively converted to agricultural and urban land uses. 4. Our results highlight the ubiquitous presence of vegetated islands, their sensitivity to river regulation and their pivotal role for the future restoration and management of river corridors.

TI  - Multi-region assessment of chemical mixture exposures and predicted cumulative effects in USA wadeable urban/agriculture-gradient streams
PY  - 2021
AB  - Chemical-contaminant mixtures are widely reported in large stream reaches in urban/agriculture-developed watersheds, but mixture compositions and aggregate biological effects are less well understood in corresponding smaller headwaters, which comprise most of stream length, riparian connectivity, and spatial biodiversity. During 20142017, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) measured 389 unique organic analytes (pharmaceutical, pesticide, organic wastewater indicators) in 305 headwater streams within four contiguous United States (US) regions. Potential aquatic biological effects were evaluated for estimated maximum and median exposure conditions using multiple lines of evidence, including occurrence/concentrations of designed-bioactive pesticides and pharmaceuticals and cumulative risk screening based on vertebrate-centric ToxCast (TM) exposure-response data and on invertebrate and nonvascular plant aquatic life benchmarks. Mixed-contaminant exposures were ubiquitous and varied, with 78% (304) of analytes detected at least once and cumulative maximum concentrations up to more than 156,000 ng/L. Designed bioactives represented 83% of detected analytes. Contaminant summary metrics correlated strong-positive (rho (rho): 0.5690.719) to multiple watershed-development metrics, only weak-positive to point-source discharges (rho: 0.225353), and moderate- to strong-negative with multiple instream invertebrate metrics (rho: -0.373 to -0.652). Risk screening indicated common exposures with high probability of vertebrate-centric molecular effects and of acute toxicity to invertebrates, respectively. The results confirm exposures to broad and diverse contaminant mixtures and provide convincing multiple lines of evidence that chemical contaminants contribute substantially to adverse multi-stressor effects in headwater-stream communities.

TI  - Use of a wildlife corridor by desert mule deer
PY  - 2001
AB  - We examined the efficacy of a mitigation project in Avra Valley Arizona, established to provide wildlife access across the barrier created by a canal, the Central Arizona Project (CAP). We monitored movements of 17 radio-collared desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) to determine if deer were using the corridor for access across the canal and the 26-km wide valley We also determined frequency of corridor use by desert mule deer relative to surrounding lands. Four deer crossed the canal but stayed within 500 m of the crossing site. One deer traversed the valley via the corridor. Two of these deer used crossing areas not in the designated corridor. Overall, 22.4% of deer locations were in the corridor. The corridor currently serves as a link with other undeveloped lands to provide movement for animals seeking to cross Avra Valley, but some lands outside the corridor are scheduled for development for agriculture. With increasing pressures from an urban population, the corridor may prove to be of greater value in the future.

TI  - Differences between biota in anthropogenically fragmented habitats and in naturally patchy habitats
PY  - 2007
AB  - The extent to which the 'fragmented' properties of a landscape have actually been caused by anthropogenic fragmentation is often unknown. We can, however, understand links between spatial patterns of habitat in the current landscape and the biota. Built seawalls in Sydney Harbour, Australia, appear to fragment the natural, intertidal habitat. Rocky shores naturally occur, however, in a landscape of 'fragments', i.e. as patches of natural habitat separated by other natural habitats. To examine the extent to which fragmentation, i.e. due to human disturbance, has affected biota, we compared assemblages in these naturally patchy habitats to those in 'fragmented' habitats. Rocky shores were smaller and further apart from one another when surrounded by artificial habitat (called 'complete fragments') than when surrounded by other natural habitats (called 'natural patches'). This pattern matches the physical properties of 'fragmented landscapes'. We therefore tested whether patterns of diversity of biota in complete fragments, in mixed fragments (with one side adjacent to natural habitat and the other to artificial habitat) and in natural patches can be predicted from current models about the effects of the process of fragmentation. The number of taxa, number of unique taxa and variability in the number of taxa were all greater in natural patches than in mixed and complete fragments, although not all analyses were statistically significant. The current study supports notions that the composition and configuration of 'seascapes' is more important to the ecology of many marine organisms than previously thought.

TI  - Catchment Rehabilitation and Hydro-geomorphic Characteristics of Mountain Streams in the Western Rift Valley Escarpment of Northern Ethiopia
PY  - 2016
AB  - The catchments in the western Rift Valley escarpment of northern Ethiopia are highly responsive in terms of hydro-geomorphic changes. With deforestation, dense gully and scar networks had developed by the 1980s on the escarpment between the towns of Alamata and Korem, transporting huge amounts of runoff and sediment down to the fertile and densely populated Raya Valley. To reverse this problem, catchment-scale rehabilitation activities were initiated in the mid-1980s. In this study, we examine the major hydro-geomorphic response of streams after catchment rehabilitation. Scar networks in 20 adjacent catchments were mapped on Google Earth imagery of 2005, and their density was explained in terms of its corresponding Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and slope gradient. Soil and water conservation measures and vegetation recovery have reduced discharge and sediment flow which in turn resulted in various hydro-geomorphic changes. In a multiple regression analysis, scar density was negatively related with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and positively with average gradient of very steep slopes (r(2)=053, p<001, n=20). The size and amount of sediment supply to streams decreased, and various channel adjustments occurred. Notably, previously braided streams have changed to single thread streams, lateral bars have been stabilized and stream channels are narrowing and incising. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Movement and habitat selection by Argia vivida (Hagen) (Odonata, Coenagrionidae) in fuel-modified forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - Fuel management for wildfire protection is becoming increasingly common in the wildland-urban interface and may have conservation implications for species with restricted distributions and limited dispersal abilities. To evaluate the impact of forest fuel management on the damselfly Argia vivida at the northern margin of its range, we examined terrestrial movements and habitat associations using Capture-Mark-Recapture and point count techniques. We found that habitats away from the springs were particularly important for A. vivida females. Most damselflies travelled at least 50 m between capture and recapture and patches of cleared forest up to this size did not pose a barrier to movement. Although A. vivida typically roosts in trees at night, cleared fuel treatment areas were preferred over unmodified or thinned forest as daytime basking and foraging sites. Preferred sites were also characterized by heterogeneous canopy closure, i.e., a clearing adjacent to unmodified forest with a closed canopy. We speculate that this behaviour derives from the species' thermoregulation requirements; the use of sunspots for thermal basking during the day and the use of forest cover at night to slow the radiant loss of heat. Our findings demonstrate the scale of movements that define available habitat and the importance of both daytime and night time habitat requirements in considering terrestrial foraging and movement corridors. Consequently, conservation efforts for this species in fuel management areas should focus on maintaining unmodified stands of dense trees in association with cleared patches of appropriate dimension, rather than a uniformly thinned forest.

TI  - Assessment of metal contamination in soil and vegetation along the Arbutus Greenway in Vancouver, British Columbia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aims The Arbutus Greenway is a former railway corridor and current greenspace spanning 9 km in Metro Vancouver, BC. The objective of this study was to quantify variability in metal concentrations along the greenway and assess barrier effectiveness on reducing atmospheric deposition of metals from nearby roads. Methods At 5 sites along the greenway, soils and vegetation were sampled; metal concentrations were determined by ICP-OES. Results We found high variability in naturally occurring soil metal concentrations. We were able to associate the values with site history as a railway transportation corridor. In addition, we found higher concentrations of total soil metals in areas without a barrier separating the greenway from the heavily trafficked roads, indicating that atmospheric deposition of metals from roadways is occurring. The use of barriers seemed to be effective in reducing atmospheric deposition of metals in our study. Conclusions These findings support our conclusion that a thorough and comprehensive assessment of potential greenspaces prior to the planning phase, and continued monitoring during use, will be important to maintain public health.

TI  - Tiger presence in a hitherto unsurveyed jungle of India-the Sathyamangalam forests
PY  - 2012
AB  - Tiger, being a solitary and territorial animal, often tends to move out of protected areas into the surrounding forests. This is especially true in the case of sub-adult animals leading to escalating conflicts and deaths in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Unless adequately protected against various human activities, such corridors and surrounding forests will soon disappear, trapping the animals within protected areas with resultant local extinctions. In this paper we ascertain tiger presence, occupancy and numbers in one such partially protected area, the Sathyamangalam forest, located close to better known tiger reserves in India, through non-invasive faecal DNA analysis. Here we highlight the potential of Sathyamangalam as a tiger habitat. Tiger positive faecal samples were considered as evidence to establish occupancy in two different parts of Sathyamangalam, reserve forest and wildlife sanctuary. We collected 103 faecal samples out of which 69 were tiger positive. Species occupancy (psi), was 0.672 (+/- 0.197) with a detection probability of 0.2 (+/- 0.06) in the wildlife sanctuary area; while psi was 0.72 (+/- 0.2) with detection probability of 0.212 (+/- 0.6) in the reserve forest. Further, number of males and females, as determined in our study, was close to the ideal sex ratio in a healthy forest with good prey abundance. This study also highlights the presence of more females in the reserve forest (n = 10) than the wildlife sanctuary (n = 3) possibly indicating lesser disturbance and more prey availability. We recommend that the reserve forest to the north of Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary be declared as a tiger reserve. The wildlife sanctuary could serve as a buffer zone between this reserve and Sathyamangalam town which lies to the south of the forest. Proper protection of Sathyamangalam will go a long way in saving the entire landscape and tigers of the Western Ghats of India.

TI  - Integrated management of waterbirds: Beyond the conventional
PY  - 2002
AB  - Integrated waterbird management over the past few decade has implicitly referred to methods for managing wetlands that usually attempt to enhance habitat for taxonomic groups such as shorebirds and wading birds, in addition to waterfowl, the traditional focus group. Here I describe five elements of integration in management: taxonomic, spatial, temporal, population and habitat, and multiple-use management objectives. Spatial integration Simply expands the Scale of management concern. Rather than emphasizing management on a very limited number of impoundments or wetlands in small refuges or wildlife management areas, the vision is beginning to shift to connectivity within larger landscapes on the order of many square kilometers as telemetry data on daily and seasonal movements for many species become available. Temporal integration refers to the potential for either simultaneous management for waterbirds and commercial \"crops\" (e.g., crawfish and rice) or for temporally-staggered management such as row crop production in spring-summer growing seasons and waterbird management on fallow fields in the non-growing (winter) season. Integrating population dynamics with habitats has become a major research focus over the past decade. Identifying which wetlands are \"sources\" or \"sinks\" for specific populations provides managers with critical information about effective management. Further, the applications of spatially explicit population models place heavy demands on researchers to identify use patterns for breeding and dispersing individuals by age, sex, and reproductive class. Population viability analysis models require much the same information. Finally, multiple-use management integration refers to trying to optimize the uses of wetlands, when only one (perhaps secondary) use may include waterbird management. Depending upon the ownership and primary land use of a particular parcel of land containing wetlands and,, or water bodies, managing for waterbirds may be an \"easy sell\" (e.g., public natural resource lands) or a very contentious one, where wetlands are created for industrial, aquaculture or urban uses. In the latter case, careful planning and implementation require broad stakeholder participation and education.

TI  - Resilience: insights from the US LongTerm Ecological Research Network
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ecosystems are changing in complex and unpredictable ways, and analysis of these changes is facilitated by coordinated, long-term research. Meeting diverse societal needs requires an understanding of what populations and communities will be dominant in 20, 50, and 100 yr. This paper is a product of a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the LTER core research area of populations and communities. This analysis revealed that each LTER site had at least one compelling story about what their site would look like in 50 or 100 yr. As the stories were prepared, themes emerged, and the stories were grouped into papers along five themes for this special issue: state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the resilience theme and includes stories from the Baltimore (urban), Hubbard Brook (northern hardwood forest), Andrews (temperate rain forest), Moorea (coral reef), Cedar Creek (grassland), and North Temperate Lakes (lakes) sites. The concept of resilience (the capacity of a system to maintain structure and processes in the face of disturbance) is an old topic that has seen a resurgence of interest as the nature and extent of global environmental change have intensified. The stories we present here show the power of long-term manipulation experiments (Cedar Creek), the value of long-term monitoring of forests in both natural (Andrews, Hubbard Brook) and urban settings (Baltimore), and insights that can be gained from modeling and/or experimental approaches paired with long-term observations (North Temperate Lakes, Moorea). Three main conclusions emerge from the analysis: (1) Resilience research has matured over the past 40 yr of the LTER program; (2) there are many examples of high resilience among the ecosystems in the LTER network; (3) there are also many warning signs of declining resilience of the ecosystems we study. These stories highlight the need for long-term studies to address this complex topic and show how the diversity of sites within the LTER network facilitates the emergence of overarching concepts about this important driver of ecosystem structure, function, services, and futures.

TI  - Causes and consequences of crayfish extinction: Stream connectivity, habitat changes, alien species and ecosystem services
PY  - 2019
AB  - Given the ongoing decline of many species, it is important to perform multifactorial analyses of conservation status and to assess the effects of species extinction on ecosystem services. In this study, we used long-term surveys to assess the influence of habitat change, landscape alteration and invasive species on extinction risk of the native crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes. We reviewed the existing literature to assess which ecosystem services are threatened by local extinction of A. pallipes and replacement with alien crayfish. We sampled 196 streams and wetlands in northern Italy. Of these, 117 received multiple surveys over a 13-year period (2004-2017), thus allowing accurate measurement of extinction rate. Thirty-four percent of A. pallipes populations underwent extinction between 2004 and 2017. The occurrence of alien crayfish in the catchment basin and urban growth in the landscape surrounding streams were associated with A. pallipes extinction. The probability of persistence was significantly higher in populations close to stream springs and with physical barriers (especially waterfalls) separating them from basins with alien crayfish. Extinction of native crayfish alters community structure and impairs regulating services such as detrital breakdown and pest regulation. Replacement by alien crayfish (Procambarus clarkii and Faxonius limosus) also threatens supporting and regulating services by altering nutrient cycling, food webs, sediments and erosion. The implementation of management practices that control river connectivity using selective barriers is needed to prevent further local extinction of native species. Integrating information on extinction with knowledge of impacts on ecosystem services is essential in developing more effective conservation policies.

TI  - An integrative conservation planning framework for aquatic landscapes fragmented by road-stream crossings
PY  - 2020
AB  - Road-stream crossings represent a significant source of habitat fragmentation for global aquatic ecosystems, yet integrative conservation planning frameworks are lacking for most regions. We describe a connectivity conservation planning framework that draws on recent advances in the fields of surveying, modelling, and optimizing removal of crossings that block aquatic organism passage. We demonstrate this framework with a case study involving 1200 crossings surveyed in Florida, USA in which barrier severity was quantified on a continuous scale from 0 (complete barrier) to 1 (no barrier). Using field surveys, we built a boosted regression tree (BRT) model that linked barrier severity to 44 landscape variables representing natural (e.g., stream size) and anthropogenic (e.g., land use) stream conditions. We used a recently developed optimization routine to conduct two scenarios, including (1) surveyed crossings only and (2) surveyed crossings plus crossings modelled at 5545 unsurveyed locations. The BRT model explained 54% of variation in barrier severity scores and showed that the most severe barriers occurred on small, high-elevation streams draining urban and agricultural catchments. Estimates of connectivity gains following remediation were 5.3-times lower when unsurveyed locations were included in the optimization, suggesting inclusion of unsurveyed sites is critical for conservation planning. Results from this framework can be used over short (e.g., planning immediate barrier mitigation) and long (e.g., planning future field surveys) time horizons to benefit aquatic connectivity conservation. The survey protocol and modelling methods used here, combined with global datasets on stream conditions, can be applied to benefit connectivity planning in other regions.

TI  - Start at zero: succession of benthic invertebrate assemblages in restored former sewage channels
PY  - 2016
AB  - We analysed the development of benthic invertebrate assemblages in restored urban streams in Germany. Prior to restoration these streams were open sewers and not inhabited by benthic invertebrates except Oligochaeta. Therefore, almost all taxa recolonised the streams after restoration. Restoration included the improvement of the water quality and the hydro-morphology. Following stream restoration, benthic invertebrate assemblages are supposed to undergo a distinct succession, as new habitats have been generated. These processes are poorly understood in streams. Our study revealed succession patterns and processes of benthic invertebrate assemblages in restored streams formerly transporting sewage, with pioneer taxa being dominant in the first years and a gradual assemblage maturation. We sampled 13 sites in seven restored streams in the springs of 2012 and 2013. Seven of these sites are connected to near-natural sections, whereas six sites lack this connection. The 13 sites differ in time since restoration and were sampled between one and 20 years after restoration. Additionally, we sampled 21 near-natural sites within the catchment and 11 near-natural sites in neighbouring catchments as potential recolonisation sources. Within 1 year, the restored sites underwent succession, which led to a higher resemblance of their assemblages to those of source sites. Derived from change values and non-metric multidimensional scaling, assemblages of young restored sites changed more than assemblages of old ones. In the first years after restoration we found assemblages with high abundances of pioneer taxa, while 5 years after restoration assemblages were increasingly similar to those of the source sites and mature assemblages were observed a decade after restoration. The succession towards near-natural assemblages is influenced by the instream habitats, catchment conditions and the recolonisation sources in the surroundings. Our findings reveal that monitoring results obtained fewer than 10 years after restoration will still be influenced by ongoing succession.

TI  - The Configuration of Forest Cover in Ribeirao Preto: A Diagnosis of Brazil's Forest Code Implementation
PY  - 2020
AB  - The fragmentation of forests is a consequence of human activities that intensively change the natural landscapes. In Brazil, there is a long-standing legal framework for native vegetation protection, called Forest Code. The last update is from 2012. The revisions incorporated in this restructured code (Law No. 12,651/12) encompassed new rules, rights and obligations for adequate land use management of productive systems and for environmental conservation and protection. An example of a protective measure was the creation of a Legal Reserve inside the rural properties and Areas of Permanent Protection around the watercourses. This study explored the effects of implementing the new code on the spatial and temporal evolution of forest cover fragmentation since the legal changes were set up. In that context, the area, perimeter and shape (circularity index) of forest fragments, as well as the buffer strips along watercourses, were assessed from 2010 to 2016 within the municipality of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The assessment resorted to remote sensing techniques and visual inspection of orbital images. It was clear from the results that forest patches became more abundant but smaller, more dispersed and elongated, and that this route to fragmentation was hinged on a chaotic expansion of urban and agricultural areas. Important edge effects were anticipated from these results. The area numbers revealed that Ribeirao Preto was 7.95% covered with forest fragments in 2010, while this percentage rose to 8.03% in 2013 and reached 8.35% in 2016. Most of this increase occurred within a 30-meter wide buffer along the watercourses. This was a positive outcome. However, the numbers also revealed that forested areas smaller than 51 hectares increased from 71% in 2010 to 73% in 2016. The conclusions were that implementation of Law No. 12,651/12 is leading to an increase of forestland, but not yet promoting sustainability, namely through improved connectivity among fragments for reduction of edge effects and provision ecosystem services.

TI  - Effects and prediction of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of aquatic food webs
PY  - 2021
AB  - Nonpoint source pollution entering rivers will pollute water quality, degrading the health of aquatic ecosystems. However, owing to the lack of quantitative research on the effects of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of aquatic food webs, there is a lack of quantitative basis for river management. Nonpoint source pollution is not only difficult to control effectively, but also the success rate of water ecological restoration projects is low. With the increasing proportion of nonpoint source pollution in water environmental problems, it is urgent to quantitatively assess and predict the impact of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of food webs. Therefore, this thesis presents a method for quantitatively assessing and predicting the impact of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of food webs through using fuzzy clustering to screen the typical points of the impact of nonpoint source pollution, then using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial least squares regression analysis to comprehensively filtrate the driving factors affect food web that results in nonpoint source pollution, and then determining the impact of each driving factor on the structure of food webs. Finally, the change trend of food web structure is predicted. The results show that (1) the driving factors that the nonpoint source pollution that affects the food web structure is NH3-N and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The increase in NH3-N and COD promotes the growth of phytoplankton, causing the change of the primary productivity of the ecosystem, and ultimately changes the entire food web structure; (2) NH3-N and COD affect the stability, maturity, connectivity and complexity of the aquatic food web structure. The increase of NH3-N increases the connectivity and maturity of the food web structure but reduces complexity and stability; the increase of COD increases the connection of the food web structure, while reducing the other three indicators; (3) in some areas with good water quality, aquatic species diversity is high, the relationship of interspecies dietary is complex, food web structure level index is high and the structure of food web is stable. The food web structure in the rainy season will be better than that in the dry season. In some areas with severe water pollution and poor food web structure, the ability of the food web to resist external interference is weak. The food web structure in the rainy season will be worse than that in the dry season owing to rainfall into the river. The methods and conclusions in this treatise can provide a reliable and quantitative scientific basis for river ecosystem management and ecosystem restoration and can improve the success rate of ecological restoration projects.

TI  - Habitat Use and Basking Behavior of a Freshwater Turtle Community Along an Urban Gradient
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urbanization of riparian corridors may alter or eliminate suitable freshwater turtle basking habitat due to fragmentation of shoreline vegetation, reduction of basking sites, or frequent human disturbance. We used 3 indices of shoreline urbanization at 2 spatial scales to assess the relationship between shoreline urbanization and basking turtle behavior. Indices included local-scale Shoreline Modification and Disturbance Frequency and broad-scale Building Density. The community of basking turtles included the Texas river cooter, Pseudemys texana (Baur); red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta elegans (Wied); Mississippi map turtle, Graptemys pseudogeographica kohnii (Baur); midland smooth softshell, Apalone mutica mutica (LeSueur); pallid spiny softshell, Apalone spinifera pallida (Webb); and a turtle from the family Kinosternidae that could not be identified to species during basking surveys. At the local scale, abundances of basking turtles were greatest in areas of high Shoreline Modification, characterized by a substantial reduction in woody shoreline vegetation. Disturbance Frequency of human intrusion limited turtle basking in areas with daily disturbance. At the broad scale, most turtles basked adjacent to shorelines with nearby buildings. All species of the turtle community basked in urban environments, but their tolerance of urbanization varied.

TI  - Rubiaceae in Brazilian Atlantic Forest remnants: floristic similarity and implications for conservation
PY  - 2016
AB  - Brazil holds most of the Atlantic Forest Domain and is also one of the Rubiaceae diversity centers in the Neotropics. Despite the urban expansion in the state of Rio de Janeiro, large areas of continuous vegetation with high connectivity degree can still be found. Recently, new Rubiaceae species have been described in the Rio de Janeiro flora, which present small populations and very particular distribution. The current paper analyzed the similarity in the floristic composition of the Rubiaceae in eight Atlantic Forest remnants of Rio de Janeiro state protected by Conservation Units. We also surveyed and set guidelines for conservation of microendemic species. The similarity analysis were based on previously published studies in Area de Protecao Ambiental de Grumari, Area de Protecao Ambiental Palmares, Parque Estadual da Serra da Tiririca, Parque Nacional do Itatiaia, Parque Nacional de Jurubatiba, Reserva Biologica de Poco das Antas, Reserva Biologica do Tingua and Reserva Ecologica de Macae de Cima - using the PAST software (\"Paleontological Statistics\") with Sorensen coefficient. The floristic similarity analysis revealed two groups with distinct physiographic characteristics and different vegetation types. Group A consisted in two Restinga areas, Area de Protecao Ambiental de Grumari and Parque Nacional de Jurubatiba, which showed strong bootstrap support (98 %). Group B included forest remnants with distinct phytophisiognomies or altitudes, but with moderate bootstrap support. Low similarity levels among the eight areas were found due to the habitats' heterogeneity. The current study pointed out 19 microendemic species from the Atlantic Forest, they present a single-site distribution or a distribution restricted to Mountain and Metropolitan regions of Rio de Janeiro state. Concerning the conservation status of microendemic species, discrepancies between the Catalogue of Flora of Rio de Janeiro and the Red Book of Brazilian Flora (two of the main reference catalogs of Brazilian flora) have been identified. We have also highlighted the need for recollecting microendemic species from the Atlantic Forest, and for properly assessing the degree of threat faced by these taxons early.

TI  - Elephant movements in different human land-uses in Chobe District, Botswana
PY  - 2020
AB  - We have a limited understanding of the effects that an increasing human population and urban and agricultural development are having on elephant movements in Botswana. Elephant movements are complex because they are influenced by a wide range of location-specific variables. This study aimed to investigate how elephants move through different human-dominated landscapes in the Chobe District, Botswana. The movements of four female elephants from the Chobe District were studied over a period of 13 months using GPS collars to follow them. Annual home ranges of the elephants were calculated using both the 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP) and 95% fixed kernel (FK) methods. Additionally, general estimating equation models were used to investigate which factors influenced the elephants' distance moved, both hourly and daily. We found the elephants' movement behaviour was dependent on the time of day and type of land use: whether agricultural areas, protected areas or wildlife management areas, trophy hunting blocks, and multi-use zones (e.g. game management areas). Overall, all of the elephants had smaller annual home ranges (similar to 450-1,750 km(2)) than seen in other studies within southern Africa, and there was a difference in seasonal movements, between individuals. Additionally, contrary to previously published studies, the elephants made larger diurnal movements than nocturnal movements. Movements were significantly different between different land-use areas, suggesting that elephants could be developing different strategies to move through differing levels of human disturbance. It is vital for any wildlife management plan that the spatial movements of key conservation species are thoroughly understood, in order to formulate informed management decisions and create an integrated land-use management plan that enables both development and elephant coexistence.

TI  - WETLAND AND AQUATIC HABITATS
PY  - 1992
AB  - Riparian wetland areas often represent critical corridors for animal and plant dispersion in wildland watersheds and downstream river systems. It is essential that integrated management of riparian wetland areas bc developed to reverse the loss of biological diversity. Agricultural and urban uses, and related water developments, have led to a marked decline of stream-side wetland habitats. Six major ways are discussed in which conventional agriculture alters wetlands and aquatic habitats: wetland drainage, water diversions, stream channelization, bank stabilization, grazing, and the release of agricultural pollutants. This article discusses these practices and suggests ways biological diversity can be protected, or even enhanced. In addition, aquaculture is discussed as a new force which affects the diversity of aquatic organisms. Aquaculture methods range in intensity of management from low to high. The higher the intensity the potentially more disruptive practices can be to surrounding aquatic systems. Management for biological diversity as well as for food production should be encouraged.

TI  - Predictors of puma occupancy indicate prey vulnerability is more important than prey availability in a highly fragmented landscape
PY  - 2020
AB  - Habitat fragmentation represents the single greatest conservation challenge of the 21st century. This problem is particularly acute for large, obligate carnivores like pumas Puma concolor which have persisted in North and South America in the face of habitat fragmentation and other anthropogenic disturbances. Shrinking habitat and reduced connectivity mean that mapping habitat is increasingly important for species conservation in multiple-use landscapes. Previous work suggests that pumas occupy habitats where sufficient stalking cover and preferred prey are present, yet the intersection of these factors has rarely been assessed. Here we used data from 68 299 camera trap nights collected from 181 sites throughout the San Francisco Bay Area over a four-year period to identify key predictors of habitat occupancy for pumas and their primary prey (mule deer Odocoileus hemionus). Our goal was to determine whether pumas occupy habitats based on relative measures of prey availability (detection frequency), or ease of predation (density of stalking cover) and whether these predictors changed between seasons. Our results indicated that pumas primarily occupied forested habitats and did not choose habitats with abundant deer. Instead, pumas preferentially occupy habitats that facilitate their stalk and ambush hunting strategy, rather than higher prey densities, per se. The best occupancy models for mule deer indicated the importance of roads and shrub cover. However, even the best deer models performed poorly compared to the puma models, likely due to the ubiquity of mule deer in the region. Although prey density is a widely accepted correlate of habitat quality for many carnivores, our results suggest that structural elements of habitat may be a more important variable in predicting habitat use by large stalk and ambush predators like pumas, which has important implications for conservation success.

TI  - Grassification and Fast-Evolving Fire Connectivity and Risk in the Sonoran Desert, United States
PY  - 2021
AB  - In the southwestern United States, non-native grass invasions have increased wildfire occurrence in deserts and the likelihood of fire spread to and from other biomes with disparate fire regimes. The elevational transition between desertscrub and montane grasslands, woodlands, and forests generally occurs at similar to 1,200 masl and has experienced fast suburbanization and an expanding wildland-urban interface (WUI). In summer 2020, the Bighorn Fire in the Santa Catalina Mountains burned 486 km(2) and prompted alerts and evacuations along a 40-km stretch of WUI below 1,200 masl on the outskirts of Tucson, Arizona, a metropolitan area of >1M people. To better understand the changing nature of the WUI here and elsewhere in the region, we took a multidimensional and timely approach to assess fire dynamics along the Desertscrub-Semi-desert Grassland ecotone in the Catalina foothills, which is in various stages of non-native grass invasion. The Bighorn Fire was principally a forest fire driven by a long-history of fire suppression, accumulation of fine fuels following a wet winter and spring, and two decades of hotter droughts, culminating in the hottest and second driest summer in the 125-yr Tucson weather record. Saguaro (Carnegia gigantea), a giant columnar cactus, experienced high mortality. Resprouting by several desert shrub species may confer some post-fire resiliency in desertscrub. Buffelgrass and other non-native species played a minor role in carrying the fire due to the patchiness of infestation at the upper edge of the Desertscrub biome. Coupled state-and-transition fire-spread simulation models suggest a marked increase in both burned area and fire frequency if buffelgrass patches continue to expand and coalesce at the Desertscrub/Semi-desert Grassland interface. A survey of area residents six months after the fire showed awareness of buffelgrass was significantly higher among residents that were evacuated or lost recreation access, with higher awareness of fire risk, saguaro loss and declining property values, in that order. Sustained and timely efforts to document and assess fast-evolving fire connectivity due to grass invasions, and social awareness and perceptions, are needed to understand and motivate mitigation of an increasingly fire-prone future in the region.

TI  - Fish assemblage structure in a Neotropical urbanised prairie stream exposed to multiple natural and anthropic factors
PY  - 2022
AB  - A myriad of factors affect stream fish assemblages, and most of them are intimately regulated by surrounding land uses. One of the most pernicious impacts on streams is the release of urban effluents. Accordingly, understanding the fish assemblage patterns as well as the environmental drivers that modulate them in the context of urban streams which also are exposed to other land uses is mandatory. We evaluated the longitudinal patterns of fish assemblages in an urbanised Neotropical prairie stream exposed to downstream patches of different surrounding land uses. Several variables of water quality, in-stream habitat and riparian corridors were measured, and their relationships with fish metrics were explored. A fish metric selection protocol was implemented, and several multivariate analyses were used. Three main patterns of fish response were observed. Assemblage-level attributes as diversity, richness, biomass, number of families and trophic guilds and proportion of Characiformes and intolerant species were responsive to the natural gradient in habitat (pools) and riparian (riparian width) conditions expected in non-impacted lotic ecosystems. Conversely, a downstream continuum of recovery in water quality (dissolved oxygen, conductivity, NO3:NH4 and bacteriological loads) and habitat structure (sediment depth) would influence the distribution of fish species regarding their environmental tolerance and habitat preferences. Finally, local habitat aspects (nitrites, submerged macrophytes, bare soil cover and bank incisions by livestock) seemed relevant for the trophic structure (omnivorous species) of fish assemblages. A complex natural and anthropic longitudinal scenario together with local disruptions imposed by surrounding land uses were directive for fish.

TI  - Current status and future prospects of reptiles and frogs in Sydney's urban-impacted bushiand reserves
PY  - 2004
AB  - Five large (greater than 35 ha) urban bushland reserves in Greater Sydney were selected where herpetofaunal assemblages could be deduced and there were recent herpetofauna surveys. Four reserves (Rockdale Wetlands Corridor, Wolli Creek Valley, Burnt Bridge Creek Corridor and Middle Harbour Bushland Reserves) had been surrounded by residential development for more than 50 years. The fifth (University of Western Sydney, Richmond campus) was surrounded by agricultural and peri-urban development. Records from the scientific literature, local natural history groups, amateur herpetologists and council archives were used to gather historic information on the frogs and reptiles. Interviews were also conducted with researchers and neighbours of the reserves. Eight extant species were common to all reserves while another, predicted to be in all reserves, was universally absent. Despite the relatively large size of these bushland remnants, in all reserves the number of reptile and frog species had declined since urbanisation. The largest losses occurred in the four urban reserves. Seven species predicted to have occurred historically were now only present in the peri-urban site. Some herpetofaunal groups were more vulnerable than others. Goannas were locally extinct in urban reserves. Tree frogs and geckos were depleted while ground frogs and skinks were reduced to approximately half their original species numbers. This is in contrast to the peri-urban site where there had been no loss of tree frogs or goannas and generally more than half of the species in each group were extant. Urban impacts that appeared to relate to herpetofauna decline were direct human intervention that resulted in death or removal of individuals (e.g. goannas, large snakes), interference with habitat such as bush rock removal (e.g. smaller snakes, geckoes, skinks), fire (e.g. non-burrowing small residents), interference with the water cycle including infilling and pollution (e.g. frogs) and exotic predators (e.g. dragons, turtles, skinks). In general, herpetofauna with the least future prospects were those most susceptible to decline.These included the large, conspicuous fauna that required a substantial home range, attracted the attention of humans because of 'pet appeal' or due to their perceived danger; were vulnerable at some stage of the lifecycle to predation by feral species; and had specific habitat requirements for reproduction such as quality water or open sandy banks for egg incubation. Those that are small, generalist and unappealing to humans are most likely to survive. There is, therefore, little doubt that diversity in reserves will continue to dwindle unless strategies are devised to overcome the present trend. Current conservation strategies that generally target single species need to be expanded to ecosystem level to monitor threats and management implemented for their removal.

TI  - Interactions between groundwater and surface water at river banks and the confluence of rivers
PY  - 2004
AB  - Riparian vegetation depends on hydrological resources and has to adapt to changes in water levels and soil moisture conditions. The origin and mixing of water in the streamside corridor were studied in detail. The development of riparian woodland often reflects the evolution of hydrological events. River water levels and topography are certainly the main causes of the exchange between groundwater and river water through the riverbank. Stable isotopes, such as 180, are useful tools that allow water movement to be traced. Two main water sources are typically present: (i) river water, depleted of heavy isotopes, originating upstream, and (ii) groundwater, which comes mainly from the local rainfall. On the Garonne River bank field site downstream of Toulouse, the mixing of these two waters is variable, and depends mainly on the river level and the geographical position. The output of the groundwater into the river water is not diffuse on a large scale, but localised at few places. At the confluence of two rivers, the water-mixing area is more complex because of the presence of a third source of water. In this situation, groundwater supports the hydrologic pressure of both rivers until they merge, this pressure could influence its outflow. Two cases will be presented. The first is the confluence of the Garonne and the Ariege Rivers in the south-west of France, both rivers coming from the slopes of the Pyrenees mountains. Localised groundwater outputs have been detected about 200 m before the confluence. The second case presented is the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna Rivers in the north of India, downstream of the city of Allahabad. These rivers are the two main tributaries of the Ganges, and both originate in the Himalayas. A strong stream of groundwater output was measured at the point of confluence. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Protected territories in the cross-border corridor between Amapa and French Guiana
PY  - 2020
AB  - The state of Amapa is a federative unit of Brazil, it has a large part of its territory governed by rules for the protection of natural resources, in such a way that it directly interferes in public policies in the cross-border region with French Guiana, French Department in South America. In this way, the study addresses the issue of land situation and the condition on the border between Amapa and French Guiana. The objective of the study was to analyze the characteristics of territorial management at the border, the environmental protection rules, the dynamics and confrontations of strategic actions. The methodological actions were based on data collection, biographical and documentary research techniques with a qualitative research approach. The results obtained identified the complex diversity of interests that affect the territory with the administrative overlap of the territorial management of the federal entity that holds the largest area in hectares of Amapa land, configured as protected areas. Territorial management is conflicting, caused by the inconsistency between the purposes of creating protected areas and the potential inherent in the cross-border corridor, and the third aspect, are the challenges of confrontation in the territorial organization of Amapa that are directly related to the process os strengthening governance, as competent institutions such as communities living in the vicinity of protected areas, do not participate much in improving the indicators of sustainability and social inclusion, and can provide the development inducing the conservation of natural and cultural resources of conservation units for full use in the state of Amapa. The conclusion of the article is that the territorial area where the biodiversity corridor is inserted is the same area where the Amapa cities that integrate the cross-border corridor are inserted, but the plans are not integrated, thus generating fragmented institutional actions.

TI  - Active Transport Network Design Based on Transit-Oriented Development and Complete Street Approach: Finding the Potential in Qazvin
PY  - 2022
AB  - Today, automobile dependency constantly causes traffic congestion, delays, reduced access, increased fuel and energy consumption, and environmental emissions. Automobile dependency has caused many direct and indirect transportation problems that may influence our life. Urban planners and transportation engineers seek to improve transport networks considering social issues. One of the most successful solutions for advocating sustainable transport is transit-oriented development (TOD). Another solution that planners encourage to use is designing the roadways based on a complete street approach, which is a system that provides safe, convenient, and comfortable travel and increases accessibility for users of all ages regardless of their transport modes. The present study employed the saturated roads that have heavy traffic most of the time and public transport e-ticket data to investigate the potential complete streets in Qazvin. An online questionnaire was developed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method based on the TOD and the complete street framework to investigate the essential criteria for redesigning the network based on the active transport approach. Thus, after analyzing the six criteria (density, diversity, distance, accessibility, demand management, and design) and eight sub-criteria (pedestrian flow, pedestrian density, connectivity, safety, bike route, bus route, road width, and urban tree canopy index), the proposed active transport network emerged and results show that five high priority streets were identified to be considered as a solution.

TI  - The fish community as an indicator of biotic integrity of the streams in the Sinos River basin, Brazil
PY  - 2010
AB  - The basin of the Sinos River, located in the northeastern part of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, has been highly impacted by industrial and urban activities. Water quality is low because of domestic and industrial sewage discharges. Most of the tributaries have suffered drastic structural interventions like canalisations and the removal of riparian vegetation. The aims of this study were to: 1) assess the diversity of fish at 34 sampling sites in twenty-four tributaries of the Sinos River basin; 2) quantify impact level by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and an adapted Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI); and 3) check the interference of environmental impacts, formerly quantified in a Stream Corridor Assessment Survey (SCAS), on the fish assembly and 4) compare the relationship between the IBI with stream order. Fish sampling was performed by electric fishing in the period from April 2004 to August 2006. A total of 4,869 individuals were sampled, representing 61 species, 14 families and six orders. Significant relationships of the Shannon-Wiener index and IBI with SCAS scores and stream orders were found. Of all impacts that make up the SCAS score, only channel modifications were significantly correlated with IBI. These results indicate that the adaptation of the IBI was effective and performed better than the Shannon-Wiener diversity index when related directly to specific impact categories. The application of the IBI with the SCAS and the other variables was efficient in the tributaries of the Sinos River basin because it showed the biotic degradation in accordance with changes in physical habitat.

TI  - Best-practice fisheries management associated with reduced stocks and changes in life histories
PY  - 2022
AB  - Current best-practice policy recommendations for managing fish stocks are achieved by a mixture of maintaining modest fishing mortality (restricting effort, times and gear), marine reserve networks and not subsidizing unprofitable fisheries. A seldom evaluated question is how effective these proposed approaches are for maintaining all fish stocks and biodiversity elements in marine seascapes? Both recommended and unrecommended fishing practices fragment habitats and reduce metapopulation connectivity with potentially unexpected seascape-level consequences. To better understand these outcomes, we pooled and evaluated fish community data into two seascape groupings for comparisons of biomass and life-history characteristics. These were remote baseline reefs (>9 hr from regional cities and >4 hr from human habitation, n = 584 locations) and those emulating best-practice seascapes (BPS, n = 140). BPS were a mix of high-compliance marine reserves (fishable biomass = 892 +/- 696 (+/- SD) kg/ha, n = 95; >5 km(2) and >15 years of closure) and fished seascapes (478 +/- 395 kg/ha, n = 45) that had biomass near the maximum sustained yield (MSY) estimates for coral reefs. The fish communities in the BPS locations differed considerably from the remote baseline by having 49% of the median and 32% of the mean biomass, smaller community-weighted body sizes, and faster growth and mortality rates. Most of the declines were associated with high biomass taxa that included carnivorous jacks (Carangidae), snappers (Lutjanidae), groupers (Serranidae) and triggerfish (Balistidae), which were reduced to between 11% and 28% of the mean baseline. Surgeonfish (Acanthuridae) and parrotfish (Scarinae) were an exception in being reduced to only 48 and 53% of the baseline's mean biomass, respectively. As expected, community-level body sizes and age values were larger and trophic level higher, while growth and mortality were lower in baselines than BPS seascapes. After evaluating the different environmental responses between seascapes and accounting for the largest geographic factor, longitude, we evaluated the community responses to 4 possible BPS planning scenarios. Biomass responses to age and trophic level and length at maturity were similar and predictable for the two seascapes. In contrast, growth and generation time responses differed between seascapes. Baselines had peak biomass patterns at intermediate values, whereas BPS displayed a declining influence of growth and a saturating response for generation time. Consequently, deviations between BPS and baselines indicate that current BPS proposals do not fully emulate the ecology of remote or wilderness locations. Therefore, wilderness will be a required management designation if the global fish communities are to be fully conserved.

TI  - Vegetative and thermal aspects of roost-site selection in urban Yellow-billed Magpies
PY  - 2006
AB  - We examined vegetative and thermal aspects of roost-site selection in urban Yellow-billed Magpies (Pica nuttalli) in Sacramento, California, from winter 2003 to spring 2004. Vegetation used for roosting included cultivated species such as glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum), English ivy (Hedera helix), and white mulberry (Morus alba), and native species such as interior live oak (Quercus wislizeni), valley oak (Q. lobata), and California laurel (Umbellularia californica). Percent canopy cover was consistently high (mean = 94% +/- 1.9 SD). Mean roost height was 9.7 m +/- 3.5 SD and the mean height at which magpies roosted was 6.6 m +/- 2.0 SD. Communal roosts were generally located within or near riparian corridors. Magpies roosted in relatively warm microhabitats, but they did not appear to obtain a thermal advantage by roosting communally. The timing of roost occupancy was restricted primarily to times when the roost was thermally advantageous.

TI  - Phytoplankton responses to adaptive management interventions in eutrophic urban estuaries
PY  - 2019
AB  - Upstream anthropogenic perturbations can dramatically affect estuarine water quality, especially in small systems where water retention times are high. Management of these modified ecosystems often requires direct interventions to prevent detrimental long-term effects. The heavily urbanized and temporarily dosed Zandvlei Estuary in South Africa has a long history of anthropogenic manipulation, and therefore acts as an ideal case-study to gauge reactive management practices. Continued deterioration of estuarine water quality and ecological functioning prompted the adoption of an adaptive management approach. Subsequent management interventions to increase salinity variability and nutrient removal included the (1) adoption of a mouth management plan, (2) regular harvesting of submerged vegetation, and (3) removal of flow obstructions. Physico-chemical and nutrient monitoring data (2010-2018) were assessed to document the response of phytoplankton to these interventions. Time-series analysis indicated an upward trend in salinity throughout the estuary. This corresponded with a temporal decline in phytoplankton biomass levels and was supported by model results that highlighted a strongly inverse relationship with salinity. The frequency of high-biomass events (>80 mu g Chl-a l(-1)) also declined in each of the designated estuarine zones. In April 2012, an extensive harmful algal bloom (HAB) of Prymnesium parvum (Prymnesiophyceae) was recorded (similar to 530 mu g Chl-a l(-1)) in the estuary, culminating in hypoxic conditions (O-2 < 2 mg l(-1)) and fish kills. However, the subsequent mechanical breaching of the mouth has prevented reoccurrences of P. parvum. Similarly, more saline conditions arising from increased marine connectivity reduced the abundance of the previously dominant Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae classes. The overall improvement in water quality validates the efficacy of management interventions aimed at restoring and conserving ecosystem functionality. Yet, these efforts are a deviation from natural estuarine functioning and thus a 'catchment to coast' approach that incorporates upstream nutrient mitigation measures is needed to achieve sustainable long-term management objectives.

TI  - Landscape features and forest maturity promote the occurrence of macroinvertebrates specialized for seepage springs in urban forests in Washington, DC
PY  - 2022
AB  - The hypotelminorheic is a groundwater-fed shallow subterranean habitat, occurring a few metres below the surface and emerging at a seepage spring. Little is known about the habitat requirements for the amphipods and isopods that live there, and forest quality and other surface parameters have been largely unexplored. Urban parks, encompassing protected lands from ballfields to forests, are not necessarily secure sites, because of non-compatible uses and changing park boundaries. Almost all records for this fauna in the study area are in parks. Using data from sampling in parklands of south-east Washington, DC, exploratory analyses were conducted at two spatial scales - the seeps and pervious land patches surrounded by impervious surfaces (which range from 0.59 to 231 ha). Habitat quality, fragmentation and geological variables were calculated, and exploratory logistic regression models were fitted to predict occupancy. Hypotelminorheic macroinvertebrates were found at 66 of 207 seeps and 15 of 27 patches. Five species were collected, three of which were uncommon. Only patches containing three or more seeps and >7.6 ha were inhabited. Occurrence of one or more species in seeps was associated with distance inside the forest, taller tree canopy, elevation and geological formation. There is a threshold amount of habitat below which a population can no longer exist. Few patches of forest remain that are sufficiently large for habitation, and conservation actions should prioritize forested patches with three or more seeps. In addition, the development of forested corridors to enhance connectivity among populations, education of the public about the value of the hypotelminorheic, and development of field methods to detect habitats is recommended. Urban parklands can be important reservoirs for species of conservation concern.

TI  - Urban impacts on tropical island streams: Some key aspects influencing ecosystem response
PY  - 2012
AB  - Improving our understanding of the impacts of urbanization on tropical island streams is critical as urbanization becomes a dominant feature in tropical areas. Although the \"urban stream syndrome\" has been successful in summarizing urban impacts on streams, the response of some island streams is different to that expected. Here we review available information on urban impacts to tropical island streams and describe unique responses to urbanization. We identified three key aspects that play particularly important or unique roles in determining tropical-island stream integrity: biotic response to water pollution, movement barriers along the stream network, and altered geomorphology that results in habitat loss. As expected, water pollution negatively impacts stream ecosystems in tropical islands and in some regions impacts can be severe, as untreated wastewaters are directly discharged into streams. While aquatic insects show the expected responses to pollution, other native fauna (e.g., shrimps and fishes) appear to be less impacted by moderate levels of pollution. Movement barriers along the stream network are especially important as much of the tropical island fauna have diadromous (either amphidromous or catadromous) life histories. Most native freshwater mollusks, shrimps, and fishes inhabiting tropical islands are diadromous and depend on unimpeded connections between freshwater and marine environments to complete their life cycles. The presence of these species in urban streams is best explained by longitudinal connectivity rather than by the degree of urban impact. Finally, in streams that remain connected to marine environments, the presence of native shrimps and fishes is strongly related to the physical habitat. Fish assemblages in channelized and severely altered stream reaches are almost completely devoid of native fauna and tend to be dominated by non-native species. In contrast, relatively diverse shrimp and fish assemblages can be found in reaches that retain their physical habitat complexity, even when they are impacted by urbanization. Our understanding of urban impacts on tropical island streams remains limited. However, the identification of key aspects can help us better understand urban impacts on streams in tropical islands, and best focus our management and research efforts to protect these unique ecosystems.

TI  - Spatial and temporal characterization of nutrient net uptake in a vegetated urban stream: Stream bank features leading to net uptake hotspots
PY  - 2017
AB  - Urban stream features can be used to promote nutrient retention; however, their interactions with different hydrological regimes impact nutrient cycling, decrease their retention capacity, and inhibit stream ecosystem functioning. This study analysed the temporal and spatial dynamics of the uptake of three nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, and phosphorus) in an urban drainage stream during high flows. In particular, we studied variations in net uptake along the right margin (with native vegetation and a roots mat) comparatively to the left margin (a non-rooted grassy bank). Applying the spiralling approach within each subreach on either side, we determined nutrient subreach (sr) retention metrics: uptake rate coefficients K-net(sr), mass transfer rates (vf(net)(sr)), and areal uptake rates (U-net(sr)). Our results showed nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4) net uptakes on the right side were higher and more frequent along subreaches where the root mat was more abundant (U-net(sr) [mu g m(-2) s(-1)] = 22.80 +/- 1.13 for NO3 and 10.50 +/- 0.81 for NH4), whereas on the left side both nutrients showed patchy and inconsistent net uptake patterns despite the homogeneous grass distribution. Net uptake for filtered reactive phosphorus (FRP) was not observed on either side at any flow rate. The impact of hydrological factors such as discharge, travel time, water depth, and concentration, on uptake metrics was studied. Despite increases in travel time as the flow decreased, there was a reduction in net uptake rates, vf(net)(sr) and U-net(sr), on either side. This was attributed to a reduction in water level with declining flows, which decreased hydrologic connectivity with the stream banks, combined with a decrease in water velocity and a reduction in nutrient concentrations. We concluded the rooted bank acted as an effective retention area by systematically promoting net uptake resulting in a twofold increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) retention relative to the non-rooted side where net uptake was spatially localized and highly dynamic. Overall, this work emphasized the importance of strategically sampling close to biologically active surfaces to more accurately determine areas where gross uptake surpasses release process.

TI  - Reconciliation of Spatiotemporal Influences on Two-Dimensional Distribution and Fate of Emerging Contaminants in a Subtropical River
PY  - 2021
AB  - This study involves elucidation of spatial and temporal influences on horizontal and vertical distribution and fate of contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs) in riverain systems. In total, 23 CECs encompassing antibiotics, nonantibiotic drugs, and bisphenol analogues were detected. The antibiotic concentrations were relatively higher in deep water than in surface water. Spatial connectivity and spatial autocorrelation suggested the occurrence and concentration of the majority of the CECs devoid of neighboring site influences, owing to shorter correlation lengths than the average distances between the sampling sites, hence indicating the localized distribution of CECs in surface water. The PCA biplot indicated that bisphenol A and methyl paraben were mainly responsible for the seasonal variations. Both negative and positive correlations existed between CECs and the environmental parameters to cause temporal variations in CEC contaminants. Spatial structure analysis by singular vector decomposition (SVD) analysis was used to measure the sitewise contribution of CECs. The results indicated relatively higher CEC contaminants and deteriorated water quality in the downstream sites rather than in the upstream sites. This study effectively demonstrated the use of different chemometric techniques for in-depth understanding of various spatial and temporal influences on the fate and horizontal and depth distribution of CECs in riverain systems.

TI  - Housing growth in and near United States protected areas limits their conservation value
PY  - 2010
AB  - Protected areas are crucial for biodiversity conservation because they provide safe havens for species threatened by land-use change and resulting habitat loss. However, protected areas are only effective when they stop habitat loss within their boundaries, and are connected via corridors to other wild areas. The effectiveness of protected areas is threatened by development; however, the extent of this threat is unknown. We compiled spatially-detailed housing growth data from 1940 to 2030, and quantified growth for each wilderness area, national park, and national forest in the conterminous United States. Our findings show that housing development in the United States may severely limit the ability of protected areas to function as a modern \"Noah's Ark.\" Between 1940 and 2000, 28 million housing units were built within 50 km of protected areas, and 940,000 were built within national forests. Housing growth rates during the 1990s within 1 km of protected areas (20% per decade) outpaced the national average (13%). If long-term trends continue, another 17 million housing units will be built within 50 km of protected areas by 2030 (1 million within 1 km), greatly diminishing their conservation value. US protected areas are increasingly isolated, housing development in their surroundings is decreasing their effective size, and national forests are even threatened by habitat loss within their administrative boundaries. Protected areas in the United States are thus threatened similarly to those in developing countries. However, housing growth poses the main threat to protected areas in the United States whereas deforestation is the main threat in developing countries.

TI  - Gap-crossing decisions by the red squirrel, a forest-dependent small mammal
PY  - 2004
AB  - Forest-associated species in fragmented landscapes must traverse potentially inhospitable gaps to move between habitat patches. Although conservation biologists advocate connecting patches with corridors or improving the matrix to make it suitable for movement, little is known about the factors influencing gap-crossing decisions for most species. We investigated gap crossing by the red squirrel (Tarniasciurus hudsonicus) in logged landscapes in southeastern Alaska, where the species avoids microhabitats associated with gaps created by clearcutting. We released individuals across clearcuts and determined the routes they took home with tracking spools and radio telemetry. Of 36 adult red squirrels translocated across six clearcuts, 14 crossed clearcuts to reach home. Squirrels were more likely to cross clearcuts if the detour efficiency (distance to home crossing gap divided by distance of forested detour) was low, indicating an ability to compare distances along alternate routes and travel costs or risks in different habitats. No other landscape metrics, such as gap size or crossing distance, predicted crossing behavior. Red squirrels of low body mass were more likely to cross clearcuts, where the probability of encountering conspecifics is low. Distance predicted route choice for squirrels detouring around clearcuts. Indirect evidence suggests that perceived predation risk, energetic costs, or both are higher in clearcuts. Detour efficiency reportedly influences the gap-crossing decisions of some forest-associated birds, but this is the first demonstration of its role in gap-crossing decisions by a mammal.

TI  - A late Pleistocene fossil from Northeastern China is the first record of the dire wolf (Carnivora: Canis dirus) in Eurasia
PY  - 2021
AB  - The dire wolf was one of the successful top predators in North America during the Pleistocene. It is best known from the southern part of North America, and it even immigrated to South America. Fossils of dire wolves are very rare north of 42- North latitude in North America. That distribution supported the belief that the low temperatures and ice sheets in the higher latitudes of North American formed an insurmountable barrier for the dispersal of dire wolves. Here we report the first record of the dire wolf fossil in Eurasia. The fossil is a partial mandibular fragment with a tooth recovered from a Late Pleistocene underwater sand mine site near the city of Harbin in Northeastern China. Other mammalian fossils from the same site suggest that this dire wolf coexisted with the typical Mammuthus-Coelodonta fauna of Eurasia. The newly discovered specimen has a huge m1; much larger than gray wolves and other large canids from the same region. The massive m1 trigonid accounts for a high percentage of its overall length. The m1 talonid is reduced, but retains a small entoconid. The m2-3 alveoli suggest that the two teeth were smaller than those of the gray wolf. The combination of these morphologies is present only in the dire wolf. When the body mass spectra of medium and large-bodied carnivores from Asia and North America were compared, the Asian dire wolf occupies a position nearly overlapping the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta ultima). During the Late Pleistocene, C. crocuta ultima was one of the most widely distributed and dominant carnivores in Asia. Competition from hyenas may have kept dire wolf Asian populations at very low levels leading to their rarity as fossils rare in Asia.

TI  - Ecological Impacts of Altered Stream Hydrogeomorphic Characteristics Extend Beyond the Channel Boundary: Evidence From Urban Streams of Columbus, OH, United States
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urbanization in stream catchments can have strong effects on stream channel hydrogeomorphic features including channel dimensions, channel-floodplain connectivity, and flood regime. However, the consequences of hydrogeomorphic alterations on aquatic-terrestrial subsidy dynamics are largely unexplored. We examined the associations among hydrogeomorphic characteristics, emergent aquatic insect assemblages, and the density and trophic dynamics of riparian spiders of the family Tetragnathidae at 23 small urban stream reaches in the Columbus, OH (United States) Metropolitan Area. Naturally abundant stable isotopes of C-13 and N-15 were used to quantify the relative contribution of aquatically derived energy (i.e., nutritional pathways deriving from algae) to tetragnathid spiders and their trophic position. Bankfull discharge was negatively related to both emergence rate and family richness. On average, tetragnathid spiders relied on aquatically derived energy for 36% of their nutrition, with the greatest reliance found for spiders next to channels with wider flood-prone widths and proportionally fewer emergent insects of the family Chironomidae. Mean emergent aquatic insect reliance on aquatically derived energy was 32% and explained 44% of the variation in tetragnathid aquatically derived energy. A positive relationship between delta C-13 of tetragnathid spiders and emergent insects provides additional evidence of tetragnathid reliance on emergent insects. Mean tetragnathid trophic position was 2.85 and was positively associated with channel sinuosity and negatively associated with aquatic insect emergence rate. Sinuosity was also positively related to aquatically derived energy of emergent aquatic insects; as well as emergent insect family richness; % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT); and aquatic insect emergence rate; implicating instream habitat-mediated shifts in emergent aquatic insect communities as an indirect mechanistic link between hydrogeomorphic processes and spiders. Our findings underscore that the impacts of stream hydrogeomorphic alterations can cascade into terrestrial food webs. These results suggest that monitoring and restoration of fluvial geomorphic form and function (e.g., sinuosity, slope, and hydrology) confer benefits to both aquatic and terrestrial riparian ecosystems in urban catchments.

TI  - Groundwater dependence of coastal lagoons: The case of La Pletera salt marshes (NE Catalonia)
PY  - 2017
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems of the world, playing an important role in coastal defense and wildlife conservation. These ecosystems, however, are usually affected by human activities, which may cause a loss and degradation of their ecological status, a decline of their biodiversity, an alteration of their ecological functioning, and a limitation of their ecosystem services. La Pletera salt marshes (NE Spain) are located in a region mainly dominated by agriculture and tourism activities. Part of these wetlands and lagoons has been affected by an incomplete construction of an urban development and in this moment is the focus of a Life(+) project, whose aim is to restore this protected area. Several studies have analyzed the role of hydrological regime in nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton in this area, however, the role of groundwater was never considered as a relevant factor in the lagoon dynamics, and its influence is still unknown. In this study, the hydrogeological dynamics in La Pletera salt marshes has been analyzed, as a basis to set sustainable management guidelines for this area. In order to determine their dependence on groundwater resources, monthly hydrochemical (with major ions and nutrients) and isotopic (delta O-18(H2O) and delta D) campaigns have been conducted, from November 2014 to October 2015. In particular, groundwater from six wells, surface water from two nearby streams and three permanent lagoons, and sea water was considered in these surveys. Taking into account the meteorological data and the water levels in the lagoons, the General Lake Model has been conducted to determine, not only evaporation and rainfall occurring in the lagoons, but also the total inflows and outflows. In addition, the Gonfiantini isotopic model, together with equilibrium chemical-speciation/mass transfer models, has been used to analyze the evaporation and the physicochemical processes affecting the lagoons. Results show that during the dry season groundwater inputs may account for 15-80% of the water in La Pletera lagoons. Besides, water salinity depends on two main processes: 1) mixing of fresh and sea water occurring within the lagoons or in the aquifer; and 2) evaporation. According to the obtained results, the goal of preserving La Pletera lagoons and their salinity conditions implies maintaining groundwater fluxes towards the ocean, and also the hydraulic connectivity of these lagoons with the aquifer.

TI  - FINDING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENT AND TREE PATTERNS IN THEME PARKS
PY  - 2016
AB  - Tree planting in design practice is considered simply as void fillers or view blockers. However, for a sustainable design, creating places using trees need to be reconsidered. Going beyond traditional tree plantings in urban environments, an application of computational methods in landscape architecture for the management of the complex system is needed. While computational methods have been extensively applied to buildings, less has been applied to trees. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the presence of trees affects human movement and find out if computational methods can be used for recommending tree planting patterns. We analysed the tree planting patterns in renowned theme parks as an initial research categorizing tree planting patterns, using an agent-based analysis for simulation, and comparing the results of the average agent counts in theme park plans without trees and those with trees. We noticed there was a clear distinction between tree planting pattern types and the change in agent counts supporting the qualitative theory in landscape architecture. The result of this research can guide theme park designers as well as urban park designers when deciding which tree planting patterns to implement for the purpose of controlling pedestrian movements.

TI  - Spatiotemporal railway use by grizzly bears in Canada's Rocky Mountains
PY  - 2019
AB  - Railway networks contribute to the direct mortality of wildlife through collisions with trains, which can threaten vulnerable wildlife populations even in protected areas, including grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Banff and Yoho National Parks, Canada. Mitigation to reduce bear-train collisions requires information about how grizzly bears use the railway spatially and temporally and how particular types of use might increase collision vulnerability. We used data from 27 grizzly bears fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars between 2000 and 2016 to relate railway use by bears via resource selection functions to variables that described land cover, human use, and topography. We used the same suite of explanatory variables to distinguish pairs of 4 types of steps, in which 3 successive GPS points (with 2-hr fix rates) included >= 1 within 30 m of the rail (hereafter on) and 2 others that defined locations where bears effectively entered the railway (first fix off rail, next 2 on), crossed it (only the middle fix on the rail), continued along the railway (all 3 fixes on), or exited the railway corridor (first 2 on, last off). We compared both sites of higher use and each of these 4 step types to the relative frequency of bear-train collisions, predicting a positive correlation for continue step types. Relative to available locations, bears were more likely to use the railway close to railroad sidings (sections of twinned track where trains sometimes stop), at intermediate distances from human-use features (e.g., town sites, highways, trails), in areas with lower values of the compound topographic index (a proxy for wetness; within 500 m), and within 90 m of rugged terrain. Seasonally, bears made greater use of the railway in spring and fall. Among 1,515 sequences of 3 steps, crossing locations comprised >50% and were most distinct from continue locations (about 20%), which occurred in areas with more rugged terrain (within 300 m), closer to railway sidings, in spring and fall, and with steps that were 60% shorter. Contrary to our prediction, past reports of bear-train collisions were negatively correlated with continue locations and unrelated to overall use or any other movement type. Our results suggest that railway use by bears increased where it provided increased forage or easier travel, particularly in spring and fall, but more work will be needed to determine the mechanistic basis of bear-train collisions. Meanwhile, mitigation efforts such as habitat alteration or warning systems might target locations where past strikes are concentrated for grizzly bears or other sensitive populations.

TI  - Do Adjacent Forests Affect the Regeneration of Oak-Hornbeam and Ancient Forest Plant Species in Manor Parks in Poland?
PY  - 2021
AB  - Manor parks are characteristic objects in the agricultural landscape of Poland. Lack of proper management after World War II, however, led to their devastation from a cultural point of view, but may allow the regeneration of rare and endangered species. The aim of our study was to determine if the presence of forests in the vicinity of manor parks will work as an accelerator of the regeneration process of oak-hornbeam and ancient forest species. Phytosociological analyses were conducted in manor parks adjacent to forests and not adjacent to the forest as well as natural forests. The total number of plant species, number and percentage share of ancient forest species, and plant species consistent with oak-hornbeam habitat were analyzed using a GLM model. Characteristic species were identified using detrended correspondence analysis. Parks adjacent to forests and natural forests showed higher numbers of total species, ancient forest species, and oak-hornbeam species compared with parks not adjacent to forests, but there were no differences in percentage shares of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam species. For all three types of studied objects, characteristic species could be identified. We conclude that adjacent forests allow greater regeneration of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam forest species in manor parks.

TI  - Identification of sources contributing to Mid-Atlantic regional aerosol
PY  - 2002
AB  - Source types or source regions contributing to the concentration of atmospheric fine particles measured at Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge, NJ, were identified using a factor analysis model called Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). Cluster analysis of backward air trajectories on days of high- and low-factor concentrations was used to link factors to potential source regions. Brigantine is a Class I visibility area with few local sources in the center of the eastern urban corridor and is therefore a good location to study Mid-Atlantic regional aerosol. Sulfate (expressed as ammonium sulfate) was the most abundant species, accounting for 49% of annual average fine mass. Organic compounds (22%; expressed as 1.4 x organic carbon) and ammonium nitrate (10%) were the next abundant species. Some evidence herein suggests that secondary organic aerosol formation is an important contributor to summertime regional aerosol.

TI  - Effects of Human Disturbance on Riparian Wetland Landscape Pattern in a Coastal Region
PY  - 2022
AB  - The wetland ecosystem along a river in a coastal region has great significance in purifying water bodies, regulating climate, and providing habitat for animals and plants. Studying the effects of human disturbances on the landscape patterns of wetlands is of great significance to the protection and management of an ecosystem. This study used Guannan County and Guanyun County, two counties in China that are located on both banks of the Xinyi River as the study area. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the landscape pattern evolution of wetlands and their relationship with human interference from 2009 to 2020 were analyzed by the landscape dynamic rate, landscape conversion matrix, landscape indices, human disturbance index, and the quadratic regression equation. The results showed that: (1) Except for the increase in the area of beach and paddy fields, the area of other landscape types decreased; (2) the changes in wetlands were heterogeneous and showed different trends in different regions; (3) the boundary shape's complexity and the landscape pattern's fragmentation showed a decreasing-increasing trend and the connectivity and the diversity of the landscape decreased; and (4) the human disturbance index increased from 2009 to 2014 and then decreased from 2014 to 2020, declining outward from the places where towns and construction land aggregated. Moreover, there was an inverted U-type relationship with the landscape pattern indices. The findings provide direct, specific, and explicit information and theoretical guidance for the protection of wetlands along the river in the coastal region as well as for the restoration of wetland ecosystem function and the improvement of wetland biodiversity in relevant regions.

TI  - Assessment of the historical environmental changes from a survey of local residents in an urban-rural catchment
PY  - 2013
AB  - When attempting to address the environmental problems of a catchment, it is important to consider changes in a long-term environmental context. However, the long-term data on the state of the environment that are required for such an examination are rarely documented. Such data collection typically requires several years of investigation and observation. In addition, as there may be a significant time lag between the occurrence of a phenomenon and its cause, subsequent environmental investigations of changing animal and plant states scaling up to 5 years may be inadequate. We conducted a long-term analysis of the environmental changes in five sub-catchments of the Nagara River, Japan, assessing a period of 30 years, using a questionnaire survey approach involving local communities. Four sub-catchments of the Yoshida River were also analyzed for comparison. In addition, we attempted to clarify the relationship between various environmental factors and the space-time response of animals and plants. The survey included eight topics: assumed information, hydrological characteristics, habitat conditions for living things, forest state, land cover conditions, river awareness, free-entry information, and respondent information. Our method also has academic significance in that it validates the environmental agent extraction technique using a questionnaire survey. Our results identify management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss due to climate change. Forest management and human activities should be undertaken with care, and the environmental context going forward into the next century should be considered for integrated catchment management. Elsewhere, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, and/or efforts to provide corridors to ease species movements may be necessary at the global level.

TI  - A riverscape transect approach to studying and restoring river systems: A case study from southern China
PY  - 2014
AB  - Rivers provide critically important ecosystem services to society, and play an essential role in maintaining the structure, function, and integrity of landscapes in which the rivers reside. Better understanding of the patterns and processes in river systems requires a broader landscape approach that goes beyond the traditional linear and longitudinal focus. Such a landscape approach is especially important for effectively restoring and managing already damaged or degraded rivers around the world. Toward this end, here we develop a riverscape transect approach by adapting landscape gradient analysis with pattern metrics so as to quantify the longitudinal variations in the spatial pattern of the river-land complex from headwater to mouth. Two rivers systems in southern China were used to develop and demonstrate the approach. For each river, we first constructed a riverscape transect, consisting of a spatial series of overlapping neighborhood landscapes, then computed a selected set of landscape metrics, and finally depicted the longitudinal profile of riverscape pattern with relative location-based plots. Our results have shown that this riverscape transect approach is conceptually consistent with the increasingly prominent riverine landscape perspective and technically feasible with the aid of remote sensing data and landscape pattern analysis methods. In particular, landscape metrics, such as percentages of urban and native vegetation, patch density, and Shannon diversity, can be used to reveal important variations in riverscape structure along the river. These longitudinal profiles of riverscape pattern, used as spatial indicators, can help identify key socioeconomic drivers and ecological impacts of land use and land cover change in the watershed. Our study demonstrates that this riverscape transect approach can be a new and effective way of facilitating the planning and evaluation of river restoration and management efforts.

TI  - Research on the landscape pattern of tidal flat reclamation area in Jiangsu coastal zone based on GF-1 satellite imagery
PY  - 2018
AB  - The tidal flat in the transitional belt between land and ocean is deeply disturbed by human reclamation activity. The reclamation and development of tidal flat is the specific land use pattern of coastal zone. Jiangsu province possesses abundant tideland resources and a large-scale tidal flat reclamation has taken place in Jiangsu during the past several decades. Analysis of the landscape pattern of reclamation is one of the important components to realize the sustainable development in the coastal zone. This paper takes Yancheng City of Jiangsu as a case to analysis the landscape pattern of reclamation area by using GF-1 satellite imagery. The panchromatic and multispectral data were resampled for geometric correction and fused to obtain the multispectral data of 2m resolution. Object-based classification method was taken to classify different landscape categories in study area. Wheat paddies, rape paddies, forest and grass, rive and lake, aquaculture ponds, facility aquaculture, facility planting, industrial land and traffic land were extracted separately from the GF-1 imagery through multi-resolution segmentation, training samples selection, classification features establishment. Landscape indices of area, shape and distribution characteristics were calculated by using Fragstats software for analyses. The results show that within the study area, high resolution GF-1 satellite imagery could identify landscape types in tidal flat reclamation area and offer reliable information for the landscape pattern analysis. The cultivated land (including wheat paddies, rape paddies) and aquaculture area (including facility aquaculture and aquaculture ponds) are the main landscape types in the study area and the shape of most of the landscape type is very regular, which reflected the characteristics of intensification. As the corridors of the study area, traffic land, river and lake played a better connecting function and the overall connectivity of the landscape is relatively high. The distribution of landscape types is uneven, but the overall concentration trend is obvious.

TI  - Influence of environmental variables on abundance and movement of bonefish (Albula vulpes) in the Caribbean Sea and a tropical estuary of Belize and Mexico
PY  - 2019
AB  - Bonefish (Albula vulpes) is a socioeconomically important species that supports a data-poor recreational fishery in developing countries. Understanding how environmental variables influence its abundance and movement is important for better decision-making. This study used mark-recapture to examine the association between abiotic (temperature, salinity, wind speed, tides moon phase, and sediment coarseness) and biotic (presence of predators and bottom vegetation) variables with bonefish movement and abundance in Corozal-Chetumal bay and the adjacent Caribbean coast of southern Mexico and northern Belize. We used seines to capture bonefish, marked 9657 using dart tags and recaptured 595 fish (6.2% recapture rate) during 16 sample periods between January 2016 and February 2018. Marked bonefish size ranged 19.5-56.4 cm and recaptured 23.9-49.4 cm. Total abundance for each seine sample and distance between mark and recapture locations were used in two separate multiple stepwise regression analyses. Movement was negatively associated with temperature and predator presence, while sediment coarseness and moon phase were positively associated. Temperature increases were associated with short-distance movements. Temperature decreases and high-illumination lunar phases were associated with longer-distance movement and likely related to spawning migrations. Presence of predators, like barracuda, was associated with low bonefish abundances and was likely an adaptive response to form multiple schools of low density by bonefish to avoid predation. These spatiotemporal movement and abundance patterns are recommended to be taken into account in fisheries and protected areas management and to inform the decision-making process in urban and tourism development in coastal habitats.

TI  - Landscape and population drivers of ungulate-vehicle collisions in Portugal
PY  - 2023
AB  - Ungulate-vehicle collisions (UVC) have been steadily increasing throughout Europe, posing a risk to human safety, representing an extra factor of animals death. Here, we used information of a 2-year roadkill (2019-2020) monitoring of wild ungulates (wild boar, red deer and roe deer) to assess the drivers that influence the likelihood of UVC in Portugal. Our results support the contention that the variables promoting the collisions varied markedly between species, including the importance of land use and cover (wild boar and red deer), water availability and movement corridors (wild boar), ungulate population density (wild boar) and road topology (wild boar, red deer and roe deer) in the likelihood of UVC. The significant and positive interaction between urbanized and forest areas shows that regions sharing characteristics of both urban and natural environments represent a high-risk for the occurrence of collisions. The application of mitigation actions in these regions are welcome and should focus on reducing its attractiveness and/or the abundance of ungulate populations. Awareness campaigns and species-specific signalling may also contribute to a general decrease of casualties. We advocate that continued efforts of data collection are pivotal to assess the local relevance of fine-scale predictors amenable to manage.

TI  - LAGRANGIAN SAMPLING FOR EMERGING CONTAMINANTS THROUGH AN URBAN STREAM CORRIDOR IN COLORADO
PY  - 2009
AB  - Recent national concerns regarding the environmental occurrence of emerging contaminants (ECs) have catalyzed a series of recent studies. Many ECs are released into the environment through discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and other sources. In 2005, the U. S. Geological Survey and the City of Longmont initiated an investigation of selected ECs in a 13.8-km reach of St. Vrain Creek, Colorado. Seven sites were sampled for ECs following a Lagrangian design; sites were located upstream, downstream, and in the outfall of the Longmont WWTP, and at the mouths of two tributaries, Left Hand Creek and Boulder Creek (which is influenced by multiple WWTP outfalls). Samples for 61 ECs in 16 chemical use categories were analyzed and 36 were detected in one or more samples. Of these, 16 have known or suspected endocrine-disruptin g potential. At and downstream from the WWTP outfall, detergent metabolites, fire retardants, and steroids were detected at the highest concentrations, which commonly exceeded 1 mu g/l in 2005 and 2 mu g/l in 2006. Most individual ECs were measured at concentrations less than 2 mu g/l. The results indicate that outfalls from WWTPs are the largest but may not be the sole source of ECs in St. Vrain Creek. In 2005, high discharge was associated with fewer EC detections, lower total EC concentrations, and smaller EC loads in St. Vrain Creek and its tributaries as compared with 2006. EC behavior differed by individual compound, and some differences between sites could be attributed to analytical variability or to other factors such as physical or chemical characteristics or distance from contributing sources. Loads of some ECs, such as diethoxynonylphenol, accumulated or attenuated depending on location, discharge, and distance downstream from the WWTP, whereas others, such as bisphenol A, were largely conservative. The extent to which ECs in St. Vrain Creek affect native fish species and macroinvertebrate communities is unknown, but recent studies have shown that fish respond to very low concentrations of ECs, and further study on the fate and transport of these contaminants in the aquatic environment is warranted.

TI  - Seismic Performance and Recovery Modeling of Natural Gas Networks at the Community Level Using Building Demand
PY  - 2019
AB  - Earthquakes can substantially disrupt the operation of critical lifelines in a community, particularly water, gas, and other below-ground infrastructure. The damage that occurs to lifelines in a community from an earthquake can, in turn, have a substantial impact, resulting in social and economic disruption. Furthermore, the duration of the loss in functionality of lifelines is a key factor in the economic disruption that results from an earthquake. In this study, a virtual community known as Centerville was subjected to earthquakes of varying intensity, each having the same assigned point source location, using a well-known attenuation model in order to examine the restoration of communities in the aftermath of an earthquake. The virtual community model being studied has the essential physical components that describe a community, but the focus of this paper is the natural gas network, which is composed of a processing plant, compressor stations, city gate stations, district regulating stations, and buried pipelines. Based on the level of damage that occurred to the network components and their connectivity (topology) throughout the community, the functionality of supplier nodes is assessed using Monte Carlo simulation, and functionality curves are presented for the community's natural gas network. Notably, the effect of the industrial makeup of a community on its natural gas recovery following an earthquake, as well as the influence of replacing conventional steel pipes with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) ductile pipelines, is examined. As expected, the ability of the HDPE pipe to reduce the network recovery time is substantial and is quantifiable at the community level using the approach presented herein.

TI  - Methodological proposal for the study of livestock trails from the landscape. Application to the Cordel de Gambogaz (Seville)
PY  - 2021
AB  - The relationship between walking, the contemplation of the landscape and the network of roads and livestock trails is argued by resorting to the origin of these roads, that is, trails designed to facilitate the movement of animals at the slow pace of herds and shepherds. Although the function of transhumance is currently residual, the livestock trails are being recovered and used by the competent administrations, with the aim of improving the articulation of the territory through which they pass, favoring biodiversity and landscape diversification in urban environments and, to a large extent, responding to the new citizen demands related to leisure, sports and recreational activities typical of today's society. This work makes a methodological proposal for these public itineraries from the intervention in the landscape, taking as a case study a livestock trail of the Metropolitan Green Corridor of Seville, the Cordel de Gambogaz, which runs between the capital of Seville and the town of Santiponce.

TI  - ASSESSING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RIVER MOBILITY AND HABITAT
PY  - 2016
AB  - Human interventions that limit channel mobility such as bank stabilization are frequent in riparian zones in urban or agricultural environments. This is potentially problematic because channel mobility is an important geomorphological and ecological agent that structures natural instream and riparian ecosystems. This study aims to (1) quantify the relationship between mobility and three types of habitat-related features, namely bars, oxbow lakes and log jams, for a 54-km-long reach of the Yamaska Sud-Est River (Quebec, Canada), which runs from the forested Appalachian Mountains to the agricultural St-Lawrence lowlands, and (2) evaluate the impact of human interventions and geomorphological characteristics on these three features. Channel mobility was measured from historical aerial photos for the period 1950-2009. A combination of high-resolution aerial photos, LiDAR digital elevation model, and field observations was used to measure and map sediment bars, oxbow lakes and log jams, as well as several geomorphological characteristics (channel width, slope, sinuosity and floodplain width). A strong link between the mobility and the presence of habitat features is revealed, but local geomorphological contexts result in different mobility patterns responsible for specific habitats. Floodplain to channel width ratio appears as the best geomorphological factor predicting habitat diversity. Human intervention, mostly through bank stabilization, also appears to be a key factor limiting mobility and its related habitats. These results highlight the importance of defining a protected mobility corridor along rivers where geomorphic processes such as bank erosion can freely occur, as it is an essential process that should be integrated in land use planning and river management.

TI  - Sewage mediated transfer of antibiotic resistance to River Yamuna in Delhi, India
PY  - 2020
AB  - Increase in antibiotic resistance (AR) in environment is a global health concern as the emergence of AR is limiting the treatment options. Inappropriate and indiscriminate uses of antibiotics are known causes for the spread of AR but lack of access to safe drinking water and poor sanitation aggravate the problem. The present study aims to estimate the abundance of coliforms, carbapenem and ESBL resistant bacteria and respective resistant genes in 20 sewer drains and 5 locations of the river Yamuna across New Delhi over two seasons. Significant positive correlations were observed between FC levels and carbapenem (R=0.90, p=0.002, n=40) and ESBL resistant bacteria (R=0.93, p=0.005, n=40) levels across all the samples, indicating possible association of resistant bacteria with faecal matter. However, higher abundances of coliforms, resistant bacteria and genes were observed in winter relative to summer season. Poor/lack of connectivity between drains and sewage treatment plants (STPs) and thus discharge of treated/untreated sewage at different locations of the river Yamuna is the major reason for increasing the pollution load of the river. Microbial culturing indicated presence of \"critical pathogen\" listed by WHO in urgent need of new antibiotics in the collected samples. Overall, release of untreated sewage into the river Yamuna carried by the sewer drains poses a high risk to the people residing in the city and highlights an urgent need to treat the entire sewage. Complete treatment of the entire sewage generated using treatment techniques such as advanced oxidation processes (80-90%) could reduce the introduction of these emerging pollutants in the environment.

TI  - Vegetation of the presettlement forests of northern New England and New York
PY  - 2000
AB  - The letting surveys from northern New England and New York provide a unique opportunity to derive quantitative documentary evidence on past forests. Due to the distinctive \"proprietory town\" land tenure system, northern New England has an extensive and virtually untapped archive of land division surveys done prior to settlement (1763-1820). I searched archives throughout Vermont, New Hampshire, and northern New York and located records from 179 towns documenting 48,260 individual trees across the region. Surveyors used 131 separate vernacular names representing at least 49 recognizable species. This collection of town-wide witness tree relative frequencies is a consistent and unbiased empirical estimate of the composition of the natural vegetation before confounding land use. Five ubiquitous taxa (beech, spruces, maples, hemlock, birches) comprised 79% of the witness trees. Beech (32%) consistently dominated the region with greater than 60% of the trees in some towns. Spruce (14%) was the second most abundant species and found throughout the region. Maples (12%) were consistently distributed with peak abundance in Vermont. Hemlock (12%) had a patchy distribution with pockets of abundance, including the eastern Adirondacks. Birches (9%) were a species group with higher abundance in the mountains or to the north. White pine was consistently uncommon with very low (<1%) abundance on the uplands. A dramatic \"oak-beech\" tension zone or ecotone separated the oak-pine Vegetation in the major southern valleys from the spruce-maple-beech composition northward. The central tendency was toward spruce-hardwoods with distinctive variants in the north, the Taconics, and the Champlain Valley. Major fires and blowdowns were equally rare and affected only 0.5% of the region. Fire was frequent only in the Hudson-Champlain corridor and windthrow was a low-level background disturbance. The most dramatic changes documented over the past 200 years have been the decline of beech and the profound effects of human land use.

TI  - Leaf Litter Depth has only a Small Influence on Ranunculus ficaria (Ranunculaceae) Biomass and Reproduction
PY  - 2015
AB  - Ranunculus ficaria is an invasive plant species in the northeastern United States, especially in urban riparian habitats. Changes in the frequency and intensity of flooding events in these urban riparian corridors create patches of heavy litter and patches of bare ground. Many plant species either cannot penetrate deep litter, or they are susceptible to freezing temperatures and drying conditions on bare ground. This can result in competitive advantages for invasive species that are adapted to these varying conditions. We conducted a field experiment to test the effects of leaf litter depth on R. ficaria biomass, bulbil production, flower production, and seed production under deep (20 cm) litter, intermediate (10 cm) litter, shallow (5 cm) litter, and bare ground along an urban stream in Louisville, Kentucky. Deep litter and lack of litter decreased plant biomass compared with shallow litter. Bulbil production was not significantly different across treatments. Flower and seed production were only reduced in deep litter. Ranunculus ficaria's ability to maintain production across a large range of litter depths may provide a competitive advantage over plant species not adapted to varying litter depths.

TI  - Lost Floodplain Wetland Environments and Efforts to Restore Connectivity, Habitat, and Water Quality Settings on the Great Barrier Reef
PY  - 2019
AB  - Managers are moving toward implementing large-scale coastal ecosystem restoration projects, however, many fail to achieve desired outcomes. Among the key reasons for this is the lack of integration with a whole-of-catchment approach, the scale of the project (temporal, spatial), the requirement for on-going costs for maintenance, the lack of clear objectives, a focus on threats rather than services/values, funding cycles, engagement or change in stakeholders, and prioritization of project sites. Here we critically assess the outcomes of activities in three coastal wetland complexes positioned along the catchments of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon, Australia, that have been subjected to restoration investment over a number of decades. Each floodplain has been modified by intensive agricultural production, heavy industry and mining infrastructure, urban/peri urban expansion, aquaculture development and infrastructure expansion. Most development has occurred in low-lying coastal floodplains, resulting in major hydrological modifications to the landscape. This has left the floodplain wetlands in a degraded and hydrologically modified state, with poor water quality (hypoxic, eutrophication, sedimentation, and persistent turbidity), loss of habitat, and disconnected because of flow hydraulic barriers, excessive aquatic plant growth, or establishment of invasive species. Successful GBR wetland ecosystem restoration and management first requires an understanding of what constitutes \"success\" and must be underpinned by an understanding of complex cause and effect pathways, with a focus on management of services and values. This approach should recognize that these wetlands are still assets in a modified landscape. Suitable, long term, scientific knowledge is necessary to provide government and private companies with the confidence and comfort that their investment delivers dividend (environmental) returns.

TI  - An Investigation of concept of Subdivision in new urban Extensions (A Case Study: Zanjan Province)
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urban land subdivision is one of the important stages in urban extensions. The meaning of urban land subdivision is not restricted to dividing residential lands to plots and demonstrating frontage of lots only. The aims of this paper are representation of the new concept of urban land subdivision and investigation of the relationship between urban space quality and land subdivision. The quality of urban spaces has decreased in new residential neighborhoods. The criteria of urban spaces quality are classified based on urban design and planning theories. It seems that one of the reasons of construction of undesirable urban spaces is the partial understanding of the concept and process of land subdivision, since it is not mono-factored. In general, every concept in urbanism is multi-factored. The research method in this paper is qualitative and is based on investigating global successful cases in urban extension. Global successful residential extensions will be investigated and represented based on land subdivision principles. Resident satisfaction in three land subdivision patterns, \"grid, cul de sac and grid-cul de sac\", will be investigated in three case studies. Karmandan (grid pattern), Olom paye (cul-de-sac pattern), Ansaria (grid-cul de sac pattern) are the case studies located in Zanjan Province. The questionnaire had 33 questions categorized in six groups of access, physical and spatial quality, safety, transportation, land use, recognition of neighborhood. Resident satisfaction in grid pattern was less than the two other patterns. Safety in grid pattern was less than the two other patterns, but access in grid pattern was more. In grid pattern, pedestrian access conflict with car is more than cul-de-sac pattern, so land subdivision patterns directly affect the quality of urban spaces in new urban extensions. Land subdivision pattern is influential in the qualitative criteria of urban spaces such as access, safety, hierarchical open space. Fundamental factors are physical, cultural, biological, economic, and political, therefore, the concept of land subdivision should not be restricted to the physical aspect only. Finally, suggestions will be given for increasing urban space quality based on urban land subdivision such as cohesive open spaces, mixed land use in edges, cul-de-sac access in residential land use, pedestrian access between blocks, shared semi public open spaces between residential blocks, variety in size, form and orientation of parcels, different gates for each neighborhoods for more visual readability in new urban extensions, use of hierarchical access networks rather than checkered networks for more pedestrian safety, use of small cohesive squares rather than large square, use of recreational facilities such as theatres, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, and libraries, hotels, and teenage meeting rooms, extending the usage of the square to night-time. Parking should be located in smaller areas closer to destinations, especially in higher density extensions and at local shops. They should preferably be located away from the street at the back of buildings. If parking lots are located at the front, a maximum of two rows of parking should be constructed. Parking structures should not dominate street frontages. Other suggestions include the effective separation of pedestrian and vehicular movement at a scale which encourages activity and pedestrian comfort. To maintain privacy, a minimal distance of 11 meters is needed, otherwise visual obstructing elements, such as trees, should be provided. Buildings should be constructed closer to the street so to increase pedestrian activity, reduce resident isolation, and foster pedestrian services such as retail outlets along streets connecting higher density extensions. Creating special public places would also help, as public spaces and public institutions are the focal point of community life. Public furniture should support the desired character of the space. Providing physical, visible and perceptual connectivity between cluster and linear open spaces, aligning the hard open space system and soft open space system with main public buildings, such as community centers or places of worship, and construction of public buildings in relation to formal public spaces and important movement routes are also beneficial. Hard open spaces should announce the buildings and accommodate informal activities that respond to these buildings. Locating symbolic and/or focal points in the middle of a cluster space or at the termination points of a linear space and continuation of special activities or functions that exist in the node and within the linkages towards the node are other suggestions

TI  - River regulation, decline of ecological resources, and potential for restoration in a semi-arid lands river in the western USA
PY  - 2004
AB  - Societal needs for power generation, water management/use, and land uses (e.g., urban and agricultural) have often resulted in a significant departure from the natural processes of hydrologic regimes and material transport and deposition throughout most of the rivers flowing through arid and semi-arid landscapes of the western USA. We examine the compromised ecosystem integrity of one such river, the upper Snake River in eastern Idaho, below a large irrigation and power dam that has altered hydrologic regimes and reduced channel sediment supply. We review the ecological structure and function of gravel-bed rivers as they vary across a hierarchy of landscape scales with different spatial and temporal dimensions. Major linkages within the large, alluvial river systems of the western USA include exchange of water and materials along longitudinal connections from streams to rivers, lateral connections between river and floodplain systems, and vertical surface and subsurface (hyporheic) water exchanges. Longitudinal linkages dominate confined ( canyon) river reaches while unconfined ( floodplain) reaches show strong affinities for lateral and vertical exchange. Hydrogeomorphic processes, driven by river power and cut and fill alluviation, produce a dynamic landscape in floodplain reaches, which we refer to as a Shifting Habitat Mosaic (SHM). The SHM fosters high physical and ecological diversity of habitats, biotic communities, and ecosystem complexity. In this case study, we examine the dynamics of a series of floodplains along a 90 km river landscape, employing an airborne spectrophotometer, producing georeferenced hyperspectral imagery, coupled with ground truth measures of river hydraulics, river depth, riparian vegetation and other surface characteristics. From these data we derived estimates of the hydraulics and hydrographic regimes necessary to mobilize channel and riparian sediments, thus reestablishing the dynamics of the river SHM. We also evaluated subsequent variation in aquatic and riparian habitat characteristics. Evaluation of these factors, which affect interactions between the river channel and the surrounding river - riparian corridor, permitted us to develop a restoration strategy focused on normative variation among the various physical and biotic processes contributing to ecosystem integrity.

TI  - Leaving more than footprints: Anthropogenic nutrient subsidies to a protected area
PY  - 2022
AB  - Mobile animals that traverse ecosystem boundaries can fundamentally reshape environments by providing critical nutrient and energy inputs to the ecosystems they inhabit. In particular, aggregations of seabirds often transform coastal and island ecosystems through large amounts of nutrient-rich guano deposition. Anthropogenically driven losses of these subsidies can occur through changes in abundance of mobile species, including seabirds, and have been shown to drive whole-scale ecosystem state change on islands. However, even though many species that forage on anthropogenic food sources are highly mobile and may thus play important roles in moving nutrients from urban systems to otherwise conserved ecosystems, the impacts of anthropogenic supplements on spatial subsidies have been largely ignored. Here we examine the effects of large nesting colonies of Western Gulls (Larus occidentalis), a generalist carnivore known to forage on human refuse, on the Channel Islands of California. Specifically, we explore how their foraging on human subsidies may change nutrient deposition patterns at their relatively remote and protected breeding islands. We equipped gulls with GPS loggers to assess the frequency of urban foraging, and we partnered this tracking data with bird density data to estimate the rate of wild and urban-derived guano deposition on two different islands. Consistent with research on other gull species, we found high (up to 40%) but island-specific rates of urban foraging, resulting between 66 and 93 kg ha(-1) of guano in these two sites during the breeding season, a level greater than half the amount of fertilizer applied annually in typical commercial agricultural settings and likely the primary source of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to this system. Specifically, we estimate that 27 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of nutrient-rich guano is shuttled to these otherwise isolated islands from anthropogenic sources. This research highlights the large shadow (i.e., footprint) that human activity can cast on even remote ecosystems by driving significant nutrient enrichment through impacts on animal behavior and connectivity.

TI  - Microhabitats of planted sea wall strips used by pollinators and Orthoptera
PY  - 2020
AB  - As part of an Urban Buzz scheme, strips of teasel (Dipsacus fullonum) and greater knapweed (Centaurea scabiosa) have been established along a sea wall flood defense in the UK to provide a corridor of flower-rich habitat for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The cutting of tall grassland and planting of dicotyledons also created a suitable short sward environment (c. 30 cm height) for Orthoptera nymphs in the establishment year (2018). I lowever, by 2019, the grassland in the pollinator strips was taller (c. 75 cm) and suboptimal for grasshoppers; in contrast to Roesel's bushcricket (Roeseliana roeselii), which inhabited the taller vegetation in greater abundance. The progression to established grassland with flowering D. fut.lonztm saw the pollinator strips attract significantly higher numbers of bees and butterflies than the floristically poor control strips. This small-scale study illustrates that pollinator strips can have multi-functional benefits for ecosystems beyond pollination, with Orthoptera of tall grassland (R. roeselii) likely to persist alongside planted wildflowers.

TI  - JUAREZ COMPLEX - EXTERNAL RELATIONS SECRETARIAT. CIUDAD DE MEXICO
PY  - 2010
AB  - The Juarez Complex is in the Historic Centre of Mexico City, facing the Alameda Central. Covering a total surface area of 27,500m2 the complex is adjacent to the Avenida Juarez to the north, to the south to the Calle Independencia, the east to the Calle Dolores and to the west with the Calle Luis Moya. The aim of the Juarez Complex is to regenerate an important area of the Historic Centre of the City which suffered serious damage in the 1985 earthquakes. The Complex is made up of open spaces, walkways and squares. The new headquarters of the Foreign Affairs Secretariat, \"Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores - Torre Tlatelolco\" and the High court Building \"Tribunal Superior de Justicia del D.F.\" as well as some mixed usage buildings and car parks are found there. Due to its position, the complex finds itself in a transitional area between the Paseo de la Reforma with its larger scaled buildings and the Historic Centre characterised by lower-level buildings and more pedestrian-friendly spaces. The architectural aim is to reflect this context in terms of position and age, which is why a 12.65 m Perla Huxquilucan stone plinth base was designed. This height is exactly that of the Corpus Christi Temple, the design, materials and scale of which are clearly linked to those of the Historic Centre. Coordinating with the Fideicomiso (trusts responsible for the order of certain types of buildings) del Centro Historico and the INAH, The Corpus Christi Temple was redesigned to give it a new use working as an attraction to the centre. The flat roofs the base describes are treated as terraces and gardens to be used as expansion areas for the taller buildings. The Plaza Juarez is the main one of these outside areas surrounding the Corpus Christi Temple. The Square is the focal point for the rest of the complex radiating to and from the main pedestrian access points to each. With the collaboration of the artist and sculptor Vicente Rojo a great fountain was built in the centre of the square complementing the vegetation to be found in the Parque Alameda with the element of water. It forms a 35 x 30 metre mirror with over a thousand red concrete pyramids which, with the movement of the water via a series of injectors in each pyramid, transforms it into a fountain of great movement. As well as Vicente Rojo's fountain, along the outside areas is the \"SPEED Mural\" el Mural VELOCIDAD - by David Alfaro Siqueiros as well as other works of are, placed there to try and rekindle the tradition of public/street art in our city. EXTERNAL AFFAIRS SECRETARIAT \"TORRE TLATELOLCO\" The building is part of the Juarez Complex - el Conjunto Juarez which is contained in the block bordered by the Juarez, Independencia, Dolores and Luis Moya Avenues. It is a 23-storey building adjacent to the Plaza Juarez to the north and to the south with the Plaza Independencia. On the ground floor is the lobby, the \"treaties vault\" - boveda de tratados, conference and press rooms and some public offices. In this level there is a pedestrian portico, which leads to all the different elements of the complex. On the first floor, there are reception and meeting rooms within the space forming a 12.65 m high base, the height corresponding exactly to the scale of the Corpus Christi Temple and which, therefore links the project to the Historic Centre and the other buildings in the complex. Executive dining-rooms are on the second floor and the 19 floors above contain the sub-secretariats distributed at present in different buildings. Finally on top is a floor for the building services, under which are the executive offices. The facade of the building on the two base floors is in the Huixquilucan quarry type stone. From the second level the facade is covered with a decorative cladding. For the specifications criteria for the staircases, corridors, toilets, car parking and other elements, standards are at the least those of the Federal district building rules when use by the user is required.

TI  - Ecological restoration of coastal sage scrub and its potential role in habitat conservation plans
PY  - 2000
AB  - Extensive acreage loss of coastal sage scrub (CSS), isolation of surviving stands, and the federal listing of several animal species with obligate relationships to this plant community, particularly the threatened California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica), have led to attempts to create CSS to mitigate habitat lost to urban development and other causes. Many of these creations lie within habitat conservation plan (HCP) sites, and they could play a more prominent role by being repositories for plants taken from a single site having site-specific genetics. Among others, one technique that increases initial resemblance to natural stands uses digitized, to-scale photography, which has been ground-truthed to verify vascular plant associations, which appear as mosaics on a landscape. A combination of placing patches of salvaged, mature canopy plants within larger matrices of imprinted or container plant plots appears to significantly enhance immediate use by CSS obligate bird species, accelerate \"spread\" or expansion of CSS, and can also introduce many epiphytic taxa that otherwise would be slow or unable to occupy developing CSS creations. Reptile, amphibian, butterfly, and rodent diversity in a salvaged canopy restoration case study at the University of California, Irvine, showed CSS species foraging and inhabiting transplanted canopy patches. Using restoration techniques to expand existing CSS stands has more promise than creating isolated patches, and the creation of canopies resembling CSS mid-fire cycle stands is now common. Gnatcatchers and other birds use restorations for foraging and occasional nesting, and in some cases created stands along \"biological corridors\" appear to be useful to bird movement. Patches of transplanted sage scrub shrubs along habitat edges appear to break up linear edge effects. There are no data on which long-term survival, succession, or postfire behavior can be predicted for CSS restoration sites, and postfire community changes are not part of either mitigation or restoration planning at present. Long-term planning including burning is needed so that a lire-adapted habitat will develop. Restoration is important in retaining genetic resources, for ameliorating edge effects, as habitat extenders in buffer zones around HCP sites, and by providing areas into which natural stands can expand.

TI  - Landscape dynamics around a hydropower plant in Parana state, Brazil
PY  - 2020
AB  - Deforestation and fragmentation are two of the main factors responsible for climate change. The construction of large enterprises such as hydropower plants can modify landscape dynamics, boosting the urban centers and other economic land uses. We evaluated the landscape around Governador Bento Munhoz da Rocha Netto Hydropower Plant, Parana, Brazil, aiming to identify the land use dynamics since its construction in 1980. Satellite images of the years 1976, 1984 and 2016 were obtained and landscape and patch metrics of composition, shape, core area, connectivity and isolation were calculated. The deforestation conversion profile was also evaluated. Our results showed a reduction of forest areas by 18.9%, with great replacement of forest stands. A large increase of small forest remnants was noted, indicating a high degree of landscape fragmentation and an expressive reduction of the core area. The deforestation profile revealed that the transformation rates were low, indicating gradual conversions. On the other hand, conversions of natural areas occurred in almost half the area in the initial years - which comprise the period after hydropower plant construction. Changes in the landscape may be related to the hydroelectric plant construction. However, the local economic cycle that happened naturally may have driven the forest fragmentation.

TI  - Pathogenic Leptospira in Commensal Small Mammals from the Extensively Urbanized Coastal Benin
PY  - 2019
AB  - Leptospirosis is caused by spirochete bacteria of the genus Leptospira that affect one million and kill 60,000 persons annually in the world, who get infected through environmental mammal-excreted (notably rodent) pathogens. Using qPCR and DNA sequencing approaches, we here examine Leptospira occurrence and diversity in 971 commensal small mammals in urban and peri-urban habitats from south Benin, where socio-environmental conditions are favorable for human contamination. Prevalence reached 12.9% on average, but showed very important variations in both space and time, thus pointing toward a role of local processes in the maintenance and circulation of rodent-borne leptospires in the area. Prevalence peaks may occur during or one month after moderate (100-200 mm) monthly rainfall, suggesting that rodent-borne leptospires may be more prevalent when standing waters are present, but not at their highest levels (i.e., floods). However, this pattern will have to be confirmed through proper diachronic analysis. Finally, an incomplete but significant host-specificity was observed, with L. kirschneri retrieved only in African shrews, and the invasive Rattus norvegicus and the native Mastomys natalensis preferentially infected by L. interrogans and L. borgpeterseni, respectively. Our study highlights the urgent need for investigations on human leptospirosis in the extensively urbanized Abidjan-Lagos corridor.

TI  - Foodways on the Han dynasty's western frontier: Archeobotanical and isotopic investigations at Shichengzi, Xinjiang, China
PY  - 2020
AB  - Recent archeobotanical work has shed light on prehistoric food globalization across the Eurasian landmass; however, much less research has focused on the foodways of the historical cities and settlements found throughout Central Asia on various portions of the 'Silk Road'. Here, we present archeobotanical and isotopic results from recent excavations at Shichengzi, a Han dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) military garrison. Our archeobotanical results recovered from 11 samples reveal that four types of cereals, naked barley, wheat, common millet, and foxtail millet, were the most common crops at the site. Naked barley, a drought and cold resistant crop, comprised 79% of the crop assemblage recovered from Shichengzi, and the rest of the assemblage is composed of wheat and millet. The reliance on drought resistant crops indicates that people at Shichengzi oriented their agricultural strategy toward mitigating environmental risks. In addition, our isotopic analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of charred cereal grains (n = 22), animal and human remains (n = 12) recovered from excavations at Shichengzi suggests that the delta N-15 values of cereals were enriched by human or livestock dung. Moreover, the delta C-13 data from Shichengzi suggest that farmers preferentially planted their crops in wide areas that would have received the highest amounts of water available on the northern piedmont of the Tianshan mountains. Our research contributes to the growing understanding of the diversity of agricultural strategies used along the Silk Road.

TI  - OVERVIEW OF THE RAILWAY LINE ZAGREB-RIJEKA AS PART OF THE SPATIAL-TRAFFIC STUDY OF THE PRIMORJE-GORSKI KOTAR COUNTY AND THE CITY OF RIJEKA
PY  - 2012
AB  - The Primorje Gorski Kotar County is situated between Dalmatia, Central Croatia and Slavonia. The Bay of Kvarner (Port of Rijeka) is well connected with the Pannonian valley with the traffic routes passing through the Kupa River valley. The Primorje Gorski Kotar County is especially important when considering inland traffic connections between the Pannonian and the Adriatic territories, as well as for the traffic connection of the Mediterranean with the Central European territories. The nodes of the main road and railway traffic routes (Branch of the corridorVb and the Adriatic Ionian motorway), road, railway, sea and air traffic terminals are all concentrated in the Rijeka agglomeration. This fact, along with the relief characteristics of the coastal area and its abundant biodiversity characterize the complexity of the problem with regard to the solution of the overall traffic node. The complexity and management of individual traffic infrastructure segments at different administrative levels along with the spatial development of the area require a certain level of coordination and solution to the conflicts within the overall traffic network of the area. The already existing, planed elements of individual traffic networks are linked into an agglomerate of defined and composite traffic networks (road, railway, sea, air traffic etc.), and along with all adjoining elements (zones used for traffic etc.) form and integral traffic node the Rijeka node, which includes public and individual traffic, i.e. passenger and cargo traffic. An integral network of passenger and cargo traffic in the Rijeka node had to be outlined, as an element of development according to the spatial planning principles as well as general goals of overall development of the Primorje Gorski Kotar County. The aim of the Study was a long term and integrated definition of development of the Rijeka traffic node.

TI  - GEOTECHNOLOGIES AND METRIC APPLIED TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE LANDSCAPE IN RIVER BASIN OF RIVER AGUAPEI/MT, BRAZIL
PY  - 2014
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the structural changes of the landscape in the River Basin of the Aguapei River/MT, in the years 1991 and 2011, through the use of geotechnologies and metrics. This study is based on a categorical approach, which classes discrete belonging to the vegetation cover and land use were identified and mapped by means of geotechnologies and characterized quantitatively by indices of Landscape Ecology, adopting the conceptual model of \"stain-corridor-matrix'. It was found that the landscape of the study area form a mosaic, showing an array consisting of savanna (Cerrado), with several spots of livestock, and an area of influence urban, being that the latter class did not exist in 1991, and the corridor formed by alluvial forest in River Basin of the Aguapei. The data showed a decrease in the area occupied by savanna vegetation and the growth of the agricultural activity in the period analyzed. In case of this pattern is maintained, indicates that in the next 20 years may be the matrix of the basin be constituted by agricultural activity resulting in simplification of ecosystems. Thus, there is a need for regional development policies of Mato Grosso prioritize environmental conservation, which will reflect in land use planning, to improve the permeability of the landscape.

TI  - Does Dredging Of Floodplain Lakes Affects The Structure Of The Macrophytes And Epiphytic Fauna Inhabiting Stratiotes Aloides?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Hydrotechnical activities on the Slupia river above the town of Slupsk (northern Poland) were performed against floods in the valley. The results based on the data on fauna and flora gathered before (in 2003, T+0) and after (in T+2, T+6 and T+11) the reclamation showed that the river canalization and oxbow lake dredging can significantly disturb the ecology of water bodies adjacent to the river. Observations of the oxbow lake (OLS5), showed the decrease in the number of macrophyte phytocenoses from 11 before the dredging to 6 very valuable Potametea phytocenoses, after wards. The development of common pleustonic phytocenoses of Lemnetea minoris and the massive development of green algae resulted from the bottom sediment removal. In the case of population, Stratiotes aloides was rebuilt after elimination during dredging already in T+2. Before hydrotechnical works, the oxbow lake was characterized by 12 invertebrate taxa inhabiting S. aloides, whereas only 9 were found first period after the dredging, 15 taxa in second period and 23 in a recent study. During both observation periods, dominated by Chironomidae larvae (T+0), Trichoptera larvae (T+2 and T+6) and again Chironomidae larvae (T+11). The hydrotechnical activities significantly altered in the first period the structure of fauna and flora inhabiting the water body. Such radical interference in natural values of oxbow lakes is un-suitable for the preservation of ecosystems due to the significant decrease in their biodiversity. Achieved on a similar or higher level of macrophytes diversity and epiphytic invertebrates was noticeable ten years after the dredging of a water body.

TI  - Late-Pleistocene to precolumbian behind-the-arc mafic volcanism in the eastern Mexican Volcanic Belt; implications for future hazards
PY  - 2002
AB  - An area of widespread alkaline-to-subalkaline volcanism lies at the northern end of the Cofre de Perote-Citlaltepetl (Pico de Orizaba) volcanic chain in the eastern Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB). Two principal areas were active. About a dozen latest-Pleistocene to precolumbian vents form the 11-km-wide, E-W-trending Cofre de Perote vent cluster (CPVC) at 2300-2800 in elevation on the flank of the largely Pleistocene Cofre de Perote shield volcano and produced an extensive lava field that covers > 100 km(2). More widely dispersed vents form the Naolinco volcanic field (NVF) in the Sierra de Chiconquiaco north of the city of Jalapa (Xalapa). Three generations of flows are delineated by cone and lava-flow morphology, degree of vegetation and cultivation, and radiocarbon dating. The flows lie in the behind-the-are portion of the northeastern part of the MVB and show major- and trace-element chemical patterns transitional between intraplate and subduction zone environments. Flows of the oldest group originated from La Joya cinder cone (radiocarbon ages similar to 42 000 yr BP) at the eastern end of the CPVC. This cone fed an olivine-basaltic flow field of similar to 20 km(2) that extends about 14 km southeast to underlie the heavily populated northern outskirts of Jalapa, the capital city of the state of Veracruz. The Central Cone Group (CCG), of intermediate age, consists of four morphologically youthful cinder cones and associated vents that were the source of a lava field > 27 km(2) of late-Pleistocene or Holocene age. The youngest group includes the westernmost flow, from Cerro Colorado, and a lava flow similar to 2980 BP from the Rincon de Chapultepec scoria cone of the NVF. The latest eruption, from the compound El Volcancillo scoria cone, occurred about 870 radiocarbon years ago and produced two chemically and rheologically diverse lava flows that are among the youngest precolumbian flows in Mexico and resemble paired aa-pahoehoe flows from Mauna Loa volcano. The El Volcancillo eruption initially produced the high effusion rate, short-duration Toxtlacuaya alkaline aa lava flow from the southeastern crater. This 12-km-long hawaiite (average 50.5% SiO2) flow Was followed by extrusion of the cale-alkaline Rio Naolinco lava flow from the northwestern crater. This large-volume (similar to 1.3 km(3)) tube-fed basaltic pahoehoe flow (average SiO2 49%) traveled 50 kin. Inferred effusion rates suggest emplacement over a decade-long period. Flows of all three age groups are transected by Highway 140 and the railway that form major transportation arteries between Jalapa and Puebla. This area has not previously been considered to be at volcanic risk, but volcanism here has continued into precolumbian time. Future eruptions of similar magnitude and location to those documented here could pose significant hazards to transportation corridors and to densely populated areas in and to the north of Jalapa. Slight variations in vent locations could produce future flows down one or more of more than a half dozen drainages with widely varying population densities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Assessing mesophotic coral ecosystems inside and outside a Caribbean marine protected area
PY  - 2018
AB  - Widespread shallow coral reef loss has led to calls for more holistic approaches to coral reef management, requiring inclusion of ecosystems interacting with shallow coral reefs in management plans. Yet, almost all current reef management is biased towards shallow reefs, and overlooks that coral reefs extend beyond shallow waters to mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; 30-150 m). We present the first detailed quantitative characterization of MCEs off Cozumel, Mexico, on the northern Mesoamerican Reef in the Mexican Caribbean, and provide insights into their general state. We documented MCE biodiversity, and assessed whether MCEs adjacent to a major town and port, where coastal development has caused shallow reef damage, have similar benthic and fish communities to MCEs within a National Park. Our results show that overall MCE communities are similar regardless of protection, though some taxa-specific differences exist in benthic communities between sites within the MPA and areas outside. Regardless of protection and location, and in contrast to shallow reefs, all observed Cozumel MCEs were continuous reefs with the main structural habitat complexity provided by calcareous macroalgae, sponges, gorgonians and black corals. Hard corals were present on MCEs, although at low abundance. We found that 42.5% of fish species recorded on Cozumel could be found on both shallow reefs and MCEs, including 39.6% of commercially valuable fish species. These results suggest that MCEs could play an important role in supporting fish populations. However, regardless of protection and depth, we found few large-body. fishes (greater than 500 mm), which were nearly absent at all studied sites. Cozumel MCEs contain diverse benthic and fish assemblages, including commercially valuable fisheries species and ecosystem engineers, such as black corals. Because of their inherent biodiversity and identified threats, MCEs should be incorporated into shallow-reef-focused Cozumel National Park management plan.

TI  - Movement patterns of wintering Lesser scaup in Grand Calumet River Indiana Harbor Canal, Indiana
PY  - 1996
AB  - Lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) winter in the Grand Calumet River-Indiana Harbor Canal (GCR-IHC) drainage into southern Lake Michigan, a polluted oasis in the highly urban and industrial corridor of northern Illinois and Indiana. The GCR-IHC is an important wintering area for lesser scaup in northwestern Indiana, especially after Lake Michigan freezes, because of the lack of other wildlife habitat in the area. We investigated the feeding and movement patterns of these wintering lesser scaup to better understand the ecological significance of this area to wintering waterfowl and to interpret contaminant levels in these lesser scaup. We implanted radio transmitters in 20 individuals in January 1994 and tracked them until early March 1994. Four lesser scaup disappeared and four died within the first 2 weeks after implantation; 12 lesser scaup remained in the GCR-IHC for the next 6-7 weeks. Individual radio-marked scaup (n = 12) were located in the GCR-IHC on an average of 62.2% (extreme values = 25-87%) of the searches. No radio-marked lesser scaup were located outside the GCR-IHC. Lesser scaup were feeding during 23% of the radio fixes.

TI  - In search of the genetic footprints of Sumerians: a survey of Y-chromosome and mtDNA variation in the Marsh Arabs of Iraq
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background: For millennia, the southern part of the Mesopotamia has been a wetland region generated by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers before flowing into the Gulf. This area has been occupied by human communities since ancient times and the present-day inhabitants, the Marsh Arabs, are considered the population with the strongest link to ancient Sumerians. Popular tradition, however, considers the Marsh Arabs as a foreign group, of unknown origin, which arrived in the marshlands when the rearing of water buffalo was introduced to the region. Results: To shed some light on the paternal and maternal origin of this population, Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation was surveyed in 143 Marsh Arabs and in a large sample of Iraqi controls. Analyses of the haplogroups and sub-haplogroups observed in the Marsh Arabs revealed a prevalent autochthonous Middle Eastern component for both male and female gene pools, with weak South-West Asian and African contributions, more evident in mtDNA. A higher male than female homogeneity is characteristic of the Marsh Arab gene pool, likely due to a strong male genetic drift determined by socio-cultural factors (patrilocality, polygamy, unequal male and female migration rates). Conclusions: Evidence of genetic stratification ascribable to the Sumerian development was provided by the Y-chromosome data where the J1-Page08 branch reveals a local expansion, almost contemporary with the Sumerian City State period that characterized Southern Mesopotamia. On the other hand, a more ancient background shared with Northern Mesopotamia is revealed by the less represented Y-chromosome lineage J1-M267*. Overall our results indicate that the introduction of water buffalo breeding and rice farming, most likely from the Indian subcontinent, only marginally affected the gene pool of autochthonous people of the region. Furthermore, a prevalent Middle Eastern ancestry of the modern population of the marshes of southern Iraq implies that if the Marsh Arabs are descendants of the ancient Sumerians, also the Sumerians were most likely autochthonous and not of Indian or South Asian ancestry.

TI  - Discovery and implementation of Magellanic woodpecker (Campephilus magellanicus) as an emblematic species: A biocultural approach for conservation in Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve
PY  - 2007
AB  - At the southernmost part of South America there is Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve where the Magellanic sub-Antarctic evergreen unfragmented the Nothofagus forests still persist. This zone has been considered as one of the world's most pristine regions and this area is currently subject to increasing development pressures from new connectivity, urban expansion and tourism development. Using a biocultural approach we found that the Magellanic Woodpecker (Campephilus magellanicus) is the favorite bird for the community of Puerto Williams, the world's southernmost town and the biggest human centre in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Although, significant differences (P < 0,05) exists between the preferences of the sociocultural groups toward birds, all groups agreed in their preferences toward the Magellanic woodpecker. This species of bird was the preferred for the people who have been longer in Cape Horn: the members of the Yahgan Indigenous Community and long time residents. The analysis of these results as well as the discovery of ten attributes that this species of picid presents which in addition is the largest of South America, have taken us to consider it like a charismatic or emblematic species with a high potential for the conservation of the austral forests of Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. For this previous reasons the Magellanic woodpecker could be transformed into a symbol or a charismatic species for the conservation of the pristine austral forest. Between the year 2005 and 2007 we developed the Magellanic Woodpecker Implementation Program with the objective to increase both its intrinsic value and habitat valuation and the knowledge from the local community. The discovery of this species potential as well as their later implementation may contribute to the conservation of the fragile, singular and beautiful austral forests and its singular biological and cultural diversity.

TI  - Spread of Plague Among Black-Tailed Prairie Dogs Is Associated With Colony Spatial Characteristics
PY  - 2011
AB  - Sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis) is an exotic pathogen that is highly virulent in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and causes widespread colony losses and individual mortality rates >95%. We investigated colony spatial characteristics that may influence inter-colony transmission of plague at 3 prairie dog colony complexes in the Great Plains. The 4 spatial characteristics we considered include: colony size, Euclidean distance to nearest neighboring colony, colony proximity index, and distance to nearest drainage (dispersal) corridor. We used multi-state mark-recapture models to determine the relationship between these colony characteristics and probability of plague transmission among prairie dog colonies. Annual mapping of colonies and mark-recapture analyses of disease dynamics in natural colonies led to 4 main results: 1) plague outbreaks exhibited high spatial and temporal variation, 2) the site of initiation of epizootic plague may have substantially influenced the subsequent inter-colony spread of plague, 3) the long-term effect of plague on individual colonies differed among sites because of how individuals and colonies were distributed, and 4) colony spatial characteristics were related to the probability of infection at all sites although the relative importance and direction of relationships varied among sites. Our findings suggest that conventional prairie dog conservation management strategies, including promoting large, highly connected colonies, may need to be altered in the presence of plague.

TI  - AMPHIBIAN OCCUPANCY IN FLOOD-CREATED AND EXISTING WETLANDS OF THE LOWER MISSOURI RIVER ALLUVIAL VALLEY
PY  - 2012
AB  - During the previous century, the wetland area in the lower Missouri River alluvial valley was reduced by 39% because of river channelization and bank stabilization projects. The Great Flood of 1993 reversed the trend of wetland loss by creating 466 new wetlands in the alluvial valley between Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri. We estimated amphibian occupancy, detection probability and number of species exhibiting evidence of reproduction in eight flood-created and 16 pre-flood existing wetlands from 1996 through 1998. We also evaluated whether hydroperiod (the number of days any water was present in a wetland from 20 February through 31 August) and distance to river predicted those values. Detection probabilities for adult amphibian species were relatively constant across years and ranged from 0.013 [Great Plains toad (Anaxyrus cognatus)] to 0.280 [Woodhouse's toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii woodhousii)]. Occupancy of adult amphibians differed across years and was not correlated with habitat features. Estimated occupancy probabilities for amphibian species ranged from 0.126 [Plains spadefoot (Spea bombifrons)] to 0.896 [boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata)]. Almost double the number of amphibian species showed evidence of reproduction in existing wetlands (wetlands created before the Great Flood of 1993) when compared with that in flood-created wetlands. Similarly, temporary wetlands had nearly double the number of amphibian species showing evidence of reproduction when compared with permanent wetlands. Finally, the highest number of species showed evidence of reproduction in wetlands with springsummer hydroperiods between 135 and 140?days. All these relationships suggest that the invasion and persistence of predators in wetlands negatively influence amphibian reproduction. If the Missouri River is allowed to reconnect with the alluvial valley, more predators may be introduced into wetlands, leading to reduced amphibian occupancy and reproduction. However, this connection will not likely occur over the entire alluvial valley and, therefore, should not adversely impact amphibians that find refuge in higher-elevation, non-connected regions of the alluvial valley.

TI  - Rapid Late Quaternary denudation of the Karacasu Graben in response to subsidence in the Buyuk Menderes Corridor: Insights from morphotectonics and archaeogeology
PY  - 2020
AB  - The timing and geomorphological consequences of high-angle normal faulting in the Buyuk Menderes Graben (W Anatolia) is an essential yet poorly studied issue that has been evaluated mostly regarding detachment faulting in the Central Menderes Core Complex. However, this subject has direct concerns related to ongoing debates regarding the level of seismic risk and the response of surface process to active tectonics in the most rapidly extending region in the world. To approach this problem, an integrated scheme was followed that involves the study of late Quaternary stratigraphy, terraces, and ancient and modern civic structures in the Karacasu Graben located on the southern uplifted block of the Buyuk Menderes Graben. Our stratigraphic observations coupled with the existing micro-mammalian fossils demonstrate the widespread occurrence of terrestrial coarse red clastics (Karacasu Formation) before the appearance of the narrow-faulted corridor. The onset of high-angle normal faulting started with gradual denudation through the axial Dandalas Creek and its confluences southward while alluvial sedimentation remained active in the more southern areas of the Karacasu Graben. Ages from surface dating techniques (mainly OSL and cosmogenic radionuclides) show that previous knickpoints determined by the incision/accumulation threshold reached the vicinity of the antique Greek city of Aphrodisias, 30 km from the Buyuk Menderes Valley with a headward erosion rate of 75mky(-1) by the end of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Incision rates derived from terraces and Roman aqueducts in the middle and upper reaches of the basin increased from 1 mmy(-1) (background average geological rate for the last 65 ka) to 3 mmy(-1) in the last 2.3 ka, presumably due to increased population pressure in and around the vicinity of the city of Aphrodisias at the centre of the graben. Modern civic structures such as aqueducts and bridges constructed after the 1970's demonstrate the second wave of incision increased to as much as 10 mmy-1, likely due to increasing human pressure and the mechanisation of farming. On the other hand, inverse extrapolation of the knickpoint progression rate yields a surprisingly younger age of 400 ka for the birth of the new narrow tectonic corridor. This morphotectonic transformation exposed large depositional areas such as Karacasu and Bozdogan grabens to erosion and should have resulted in a significant increase in the sediment supply to BuyukMenderes River. However, seismic investigations in the Aegean Sea have yet to identify the sedimentary record of this tectonic transformation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Towards the next generation of smart grids: Semantic and holonic multi-agent management of distributed energy resources
PY  - 2017
AB  - The energy landscape is experiencing accelerating change; centralized energy systems are being decarbonized, and transitioning towards distributed energy systems, facilitated by advances in power system management and information and communication technologies. This paper elaborates on these generations of energy systems by critically reviewing relevant authoritative literature. This includes a discussion of modern concepts such as 'smart grid', 'microgrid', 'virtual power plant' and 'multi-energy system', and the relationships between them, as well as the trends towards distributed intelligence and interoperability. Each of these emerging urban energy concepts holds merit when applied within a centralized grid paradigm, but very little research applies these approaches within the emerging energy landscape typified by a high penetration of distributed energy resources, prosumers (consumers and producers), interoperability, and big data. Given the ongoing boom in these fields, this will lead to new challenges and opportunities as the status-quo of energy systems changes dramatically. We argue that a new generation of holonic energy systems is required to orchestrate the interplay between these dense, diverse and distributed energy components. The paper therefore contributes a description of holonic energy systems and the implicit research required towards sustainability and resilience in the imminent energy landscape. This promotes the systemic features of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, and balances global and local system objectives, through adaptive control topologies and demand responsive energy management. Future research avenues are identified to support this transition regarding interoperability, secure distributed control and a system of systems approach.

TI  - Comparison of Function of Created Wetlands of Two Age Classes in Central Pennsylvania
PY  - 2009
AB  - Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) functional assessment models were used to assess whether function in created wetlands of two ages (1 year old and > 12 years old) was equivalent to that of natural (reference) mainstem floodplain wetlands. Reference wetlands scored higher than both created age classes for providing energy dissipation and short-term surface water storage. Reference wetlands scored higher in maintaining native plant community and structure than 1-year-old sites, and 12-year-old wetlands scored higher than reference sites for providing vertebrate habitat structure. Analysis of individual model variables showed that reference wetlands had greater vegetative biomass and higher soil organic matter content than both created wetland age classes. Created wetlands were farther from natural wetlands and had smaller mean forest patch sizes within a 1-km-radius circle around the site than did the reference sites, indicating less hydrologic connectivity. Created wetlands also had less microtopographic variation than reference wetlands. The 1-year-old created sites were placed in landscape settings with greater land use diversity and road density than reference sites. The 12-year-old sites had a higher gradient and a higher percentage of their surrounding area in urban land use. These results show that the created wetlands were significantly structurally different (if not functionally so) from reference wetlands even after 12 years. The most profound differences were in hydrology and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. More attention needs to be focused on placing created wetlands in appropriate settings to encourage proper hydrodynamics, eliminate habitat fragmentation, and minimize the effects of stressors to the site.

TI  - Physical Characteristics Influencing Nearshore Habitat Use by Juvenile Chinook Salmon in the Sacramento River, California
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban and agricultural development has resulted in drastically modified riverine corridors that are often considered to be detrimental to the recovery of anadromous salmonid populations. Although mitigation features (e.g., large wood and shallow-water areas) are frequently incorporated in flood control infrastructure to offset the impacts of streambank stabilization, little is known regarding their effectiveness and the habitat characteristics associated with enhanced nearshore rearing conditions in large rivers. We evaluated two measures of habitat use by emigrating juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha relative to different shoreline types (rock revetment [riprap], mitigated, and natural) and analyzed associations between environmental characteristics and habitat occupancy using a large number of presence/absence samples in the lower Sacramento River, California. We found both measures of habitat use to be significantly higher at natural shorelines and those including mitigation features than at shorelines consisting predominantly of rock revetment. A predictive logistic regression model suggested that the density of woody material and inundated terrestrial vegetation, depth, and substrate type significantly affected habitat occupancy. Despite a moderate predictive capability (62% of correctly classified records in a leave-one-out simulation), the model was useful in identifying habitat characteristics associated with significantly increased habitat use in this large, low-gradient river, most notably the presence of instream cover (wood or vegetation), gently sloping streambanks, fine substrate, and variable nearshore current velocity. Conversely, habitat occupancy by juvenile Chinook Salmon diminished with large, rocky substrate and increased depth, characteristics favored by introduced predatory Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu. This study illustrates the value of incorporating mitigation features and identifies characteristics that enhance habitat use by emigrating juvenile Chinook Salmon.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Ecological Effects Caused by Master Planning in Hilly Area: A Case Study of Kunming Expo Eco-town, China
PY  - 2012
AB  - The environmental conflict throughout land development varies for every landform. In hilly areas, the ecological effects, such as the properties of the land surface and the diversity of flora and fauna cannot be reflected through assessment indexes, which include the building density, green areas ratio, etc. This paper is to provide the impervious index and the corridor index as a complement to the master planners. The indexes is an approach that integrates ecological landscape principles and methods for analyzing the eco-rationality of the master planning using ecological indexes which provides a measure for adjusting development density. An application of the indexes to the residential development of Kunming Expo Eco-town in Yunnan Province, China is provided. The result shows that the indexes can be used to quantify the interrelationship between the development project and the environment and that the required regulatory measures for land development can be implemented via master plans.

TI  - Co-benefits of designing communities for active living: an exploration of literature
PY  - 2015
AB  - To reverse the global epidemic of physical inactivity that is responsible for more than 5 million deaths per year, many groups recommend creating \"activity-friendly environments.\"Such environments may have other benefits, beyond facilitating physical activity, but these potential co-benefits have not been well described. The purpose of the present paper is to explore a wide range of literature and conduct an initial summary of evidence on co-benefits of activity-friendly environments. An extensive but non- systematic review of scientific and \"gray\" literature was conducted. Five physical activity settings were defined: parks/open space/trails, urban design, transportation, schools, and workplaces/buildings. Several evidence-based activity-friendly features were identified for each setting. Six potential outcomes/co-benefits were searched: physical health, mental health, social benefits, safety/injury prevention, environmental sustainability, and economics. A total of 418 higher-quality findings were summarized. The overall summary indicated 22 of 30 setting by outcome combinations showed \"strong\" evidence of co-benefits. Each setting had strong evidence of at least three co-benefits, with only one occurrence of a net negative effect. All settings showed the potential to contribute to environmental sustainability and economic benefits. Specific environmental features with the strongest evidence of multiple co-benefits were park proximity, mixed land use, trees/greenery, accessibility and street connectivity, building design, and workplace physical activity policies/programs. The exploration revealed substantial evidence that designing community environments that make physical activity attractive and convenient is likely to produce additional important benefits. The extent of the evidence justifies systematic reviews and additional research to fill gaps.

TI  - Mineral industries, growth corridors and agricultural development in Africa
PY  - 2013
AB  - An extractive industries boom in Africa is driving unprecedented expansion of infrastructure into sparsely populated regions. Much of the investment is in high-volume minerals such as iron and coal that will require heavy infrastructure and large settled workthrces. New roads and railways are being built to support these industries. Mineral infrastructure is reinforcing the dynamic of designated \"growth corridors\", which are increasingly determining settlement patterns and rural land use in Africa. These corridors are penetrating into areas where agriculture has been constrained by lack of access to markets. They could unleash a major expansion of arable crops in the Guinea and Miombo savannahs, tropical tree crops in Congo Basin rainforests and irrigated agriculture on the floodplains of several African river systems. Rapidly growing African cities are largely dependent on imported food but growth corridors linking them Lo hinterland areas could favour shifts Lo African-sourced foods. Governance weaknesses may allow outside investors to make land grabs along growth corridors and further marginalise poor smallholders. New pressures on environmentally sensitive areas may emerge. Policy changes are needed to avoid negative impacts of this major new development trend and to exploft the potential for poverty alleviation and food-security benefits. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effect of Temperature on the Occurrence and Distribution of Colorado Potato Beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in China
PY  - 2014
AB  - Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is the most destructive pest of potato in many countries of the world. It first invaded China from Kazakhstan in 1990s and now is a major pest of potato in many areas of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature on the spread of Colorado potato beetle in China after its invasion. Cold temperature in winter (December) and high temperature in summer (July) were analyzed in accordance with the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang. The boundary between the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang nearly coincided with the -8 degrees C isotherm of monthly mean minimum temperature in winter. The stress of the low temperature in winter for Colorado potato beetle basically disappeared in the southeastern Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province of China, suggesting that the Hexi Corridor is the best channel to prevent any long-distance invasions of Colorado potato beetle into the Central Plains region. However, in Turpan City in northeastern Xinjiang, the extremely hot weather in the summer prevents the local colonization of Colorado potato beetle. Furthermore, according to our monitoring, high temperature in summer also limited Colorado potato beetle to diffuse eastward through Turpan. Results of this study suggest that it is essential to strengthen inspection and quarantine measures to prevent any artificial transmissions of Colorado potato beetle spreading eastward and thus to ensure the sustainable production of potato and other Solanaceae crops in northwest regions of China.

TI  - Facing Multiple Environmental Challenges through Maximizing the Co-Benefits of Nature-Based Solutions at a National Scale in Italy
PY  - 2022
AB  - The European Union is significantly investing in the Green Deal that introduces measures to guide Member States to face sustainability and health challenges, especially employing Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in urban contexts. National governments need to develop appropriate strategies to coordinate local projects, face multiple challenges, and maximize NBS effectiveness. This paper aims to introduce a replicable methodology to integrate NBS into a multi-scale planning process to maximize their cost-benefits. Using Italy as a case study, we mapped three environmental challenges nationwide related to climate change and air pollution, identifying spatial groups of their co-occurrences. These groups serve as functional areas where 24 NBS were ranked for their ecosystem services supply and land cover. The results show eight different spatial groups, with 6% of the national territory showing no challenge, with 42% showing multiple challenges combined simultaneously. Seven NBS were high-performing in all groups: five implementable in permeable land covers (urban forests, infiltration basins, green corridors, large parks, heritage gardens), and two in impervious ones (intensive, semi-intensive green roofs). This work provides a strategic vision at the national scale to quantify and orient budget allocation, while on a municipal scale, the NBS ranking acts as a guideline for specific planning activities based on local issues.

TI  - Habitat fragmentation and structure and composition of tree populations in a agroforestry landscape (southern Quebec, Canada)
PY  - 2018
AB  - A number of forests in agroforestry environments are at risk due to urban development or agricultural expansion. These forests often consist of patches of wooded areas scattered in the agricultural and urban grid, and often constitute green corridors that enable a flow between animal and plant species (migration corridors). This study evaluates the composition and structure of riparian forests in agroforestry areas that are subject to various natural and anthropogenic disturbances. This study aims to understand the dynamics of these riparian forest populations and evaluate the effects of the disturbances on the tree stands (e.g. floods, partial cutting), while taking into account their development over space and time based on a diachronic assessment from 1945 to 2010. Although these woodlands are subject to various disturbances, a fairly large diversity of tree species can be noted, and the regeneration of the saplings and small trees follows a normal growth curve (asymmetric) with a high contingency of young tree population comparable to a typical reverse-J distribution. However, lower densities are observed for riparian stands subject to frequent flooding, which could over time compromise recruitment and forest regeneration for some tree species (e.g. woody plants with weak adaptive strategies). The multivariate analyses (Redundancy Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis) conducted over all the soil, environmental and forest data reveal that some variables are more strongly related to the composition of the forest populations, including pH, ground litter and soil drainage. However, these variables must still be considered as being part of a set of interacting soil conditions. Lastly, the future of these woodlands may appear uncertain because there are no government policies or measures to ensure their protection and preservation.

TI  - Broad Gauge Rail Link Between Sivok in West Bengal and Rangpo in the State of Sikkim with Future Connectivity to Gangtok (Sikkim)-Shallow-Landslide Susceptibility Map
PY  - 2015
AB  - The Project aims at connecting Rangpo town (Sikkim State) with the existing Sivok Railway Station on N.F. Railway with a Broad Gauge Single Line in West Bengal State. This alignment will cross an area with steep hills, dense forests in the District of Darjeeling (West Bengal State) and East Sikkim (Sikkim State). Landslides are quite common in West Bengala and Sikkim causing relevant damages each year. The Special Publication no. 94 of the Geological Survey of India \"An Inventory of Major Landslides in Sikkim-Darjeeling Himalaya\" describes 164 major landslides: 32 rock slides, 33 debris slides and 99 complex slides. Landslides generally occur along one or more discrete surfaces and commonly involve earth and/or rock debris or bedrock, although sometimes both the bedrock and the shallow cover are involved. Local geological features and the high intensity of rainfall are the main causes of landslides occurrence. Yearly precipitation in the capital of Sikkim average similar to 3,539 mm, mainly occurring during the monsoon season. This work presents a landslide hazard map produced by combining a number of thematic raster datasets related to the triggering factors of shallow-landslides occurrence: Slope; Cover type; Vegetation; Prevailing mineralogical composition. Operational phases followed to produce the hazard map are the following: Data acquisition; Shallow landslide inventory map for the study area; Definition of unique condition units; Hazard assessment.

TI  - Fifty-year spatiotemporal analysis of landscape changes in the Mont Saint-Hilaire UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (Quebec, Canada)
PY  - 2017
AB  - Diachronic analysis with a GIS-based classification of land-use changes based on aerial photographs, orthophotos, topographic maps, geotechnical reports, urban plans, and using landscape metrics has permitted insight into the driving forces responsible for landscape fragmentation in the Mont Saint-Hilaire (MSH) Biosphere Reserve over the period 1958-2015. Although the occurrence of exogenous factors, such as extreme weather and fires, can have a significant influence on the fragmentation of the territory in time and space, the accelerated development of the built environment (+470%) is nevertheless found to be primarily responsible for landscape fragmentation and the loss of areas formerly occupied by orchards, agriculture, and woodlands. The landscape metrics used corroborate these results, with a simplification of the shape of polygons, and once again reveal the difficulties of harmonizing different land uses. MSH has become somewhat of a forest island in a sea of residential development and agriculture. To counter this isolation of fragmented habitat components, forest corridors have been proposed and developed for the Biosphere Reserve and particularly for the core area. Two corridors, to the north and south, are used to connect the protected area and other wooded areas at the regional scale, in order to promote genetic exchange between populations of various species. In that regard, the forest buffer zone around the hill continues to play a key role and has great ecological value for species and ecological preservation and conservation. However, appropriate management and landscape preservation actions should recognize and focus on landscape composition and the associated geographical configuration.

TI  - A multiple natural hazard analysis, SECMOL College region, near Leh, Ladakh, North India, with applications for community-based DRR
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose This paper places a college at the centreof a multi-hazard assessment (earthquake, flood and landslide). The college is within a less studied, rural area of Ladakh, North India. Research focusses on a case study (Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) College), close to Leh, Ladakh, and extends to incorporate/apply thinking from/to the wider Ladakh region. The approach adopted, centring on the hazard assessment of a single entity/local area, allows a rapid uptake of hazard recommendations within a college environment planning to continue its existence for decades ahead. A sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) documents the active involvement of college staff and students in the principles of geohazard assessment and the development of student-centric hazard assessments of the college and their home village. SECMOL is a self-sufficient, alternative, college, organised along strong environmentally sustainable principles. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This work has adopted different strategies for different hazards. Fieldwork involved the collection of quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. shape and size of valleys/river channels/valley sides, estimation of vegetation density, measurement of sediment clasts, angle of slopes, assessment of sediment character, stratigraphy of floodplains and identification of vulnerable elements). These data were combined with satellite image analysis to: define river catchment character and flood vulnerability (e.g. using the methodology of Collier and Fox, 2003), examine catchment connectivity, and examine landslip scars and generic terrain analysis. Literature studies and seismic database interrogation allowed the calculation of potential catchment floodwater volumes, and the collation of epicentre, magnitude, depth and date of seismic events, together with recent thinking on the return period of large Himalayan earthquakes. These data were used to develop geological-seismic and river catchment maps, the identification of vulnerable elements, and disaster scenario analyses. Findings This research concludes that SECMOL, and much of the Ladakh region, is exposed to significant seismic, flood and landslide hazard risk. High magnitude earthquakes have return periods of 100s to c. 1,000 years in the Himalayas and can produce intense levels of damage. It is prudent to maximise earthquake engineering wherever possible. The 2010 Leh floods demonstrated high levels of devastation: these floods could severely damage the SECMOL campus if storms were centred close by. This study reveals the connectivity of catchments at varying altitudes and the potential interactions of adjacent catchments. Evacuation plans need to be developed for the college. Northern ridges at SECMOL could bury parts of the campus if mobilised by earthquakes/rainfall. Slope angles can be lowered and large boulders moved to reduce risk. This work reinforces recommendations that relate to building quality and urban/rural planning, e.g. using spatial planning to keep people away from high-risk zones. Practical implications - The frequency of hazards is low, but potential impacts high to very high. Hazard mitigation actions include engineering options for hazardous slopes, buildings to be earthquake-proofed, and evacuation management for large floods. Originality/value Methodologies undertaken in this research are well-tested. Linkages between disciplines are ambitious and somewhat original. The application of this work to a specific college centre site with the capacity to rapidly take up recommendations is novel. The identification of catchment inter-connectivity in this part of Ladakh is novel. This work complements a sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) for community aspects of this study, adding to the novelty value.

TI  - Channel rehabilitation at the Brookside Enhancement project, Oregon
PY  - 1998
AB  - Portland's Brookside Wetland and Stream Enhancement project is intended to exemplify a multi-objective approach to urban stream corridor management by providing numerous environmental benefits on one site. These include improvements such as augmented flood storage (the overriding objective of the project), streambank erosion control, and improved habitat conditions for fish. This paper focuses on the rehabilitation efforts undertaken along the approximately 0.8 kilometers (1/2 mile) of Johnson Creek traversing the project site. Before rehabilitation, the meandering channel was entrenched into a generally level floodplain as much as 4.5 meters (15 feet) and had rapidly eroding banks in many places. The channel also provided relatively limited habitat opportunities for salmonid fishes (which survive in small numbers in the creek), for which most inchannel habitat rehabilitation work was targeted. An important aspect of the project was the regrading of oversteepened channel banks to a lower, stable angle. Established streamside trees were preserved wherever possible and many additional riparian trees and shrubs will be planted this year and in 1998. Since soils are highly erodible, regraded channel banks were lined with coir matting to protect them until herbaceous vegetation can take hold. Biotechnical bank stabilization along eroding outer bend banks relied on vegetated geogrid treatments. These were constructed over a hardened bank toe comprised of large boulders and interspersed root wads. A unique bank cover/log crib revetment was also installed along a constructed channel cutoff. This provides a long section of artificial undercut bank, an extremely valuable type of fish habitat. Other improvements to fish habitat included the placement of large woody debris and boulders in the low-flow channel. All treatments will enhance channel complexity, providing both winter and summer holding habitat for fish. Excavation, grading, and the construction of streambank stabilization and instream habitat structures occurred during the summer of 1997. The author's experience in providing construction oversight highlighted a number of issues pertaining to the on-the-ground implementation of the project. Some of these are discussed in this paper.

PY  - 2009
AB  - The entire region of Vojvodina (region in northern Serbia) is an agricultural - steppe - forest zone. The area of Vojvodina covers 2,150,000 ha of which arable land is 1,579,643 ha (73,45 %). Total forested area is about 130,000 ha or 6% of the total area. At present, all the ecosystems (agro and forest ecosystems), in this region are highly endangered. This is the consequence of local and global economic activities after 1945, which altered societies relationship with the natural environment (Bouma et al., 1998). The soils in Vojvodina are affected by aridification, acidification, eutrophication and pollution. As a region with highly productive agricultural soil, it is subject to and endangered by, different destructive processes, primarily wind erosion, that is climatic extremes, because of which its maximal productive potential cannot be utilised. Wind erosion, as a very destructive factor, causes the detachment and transport of the most fertile particles of the arable topsoil, permanently changing its fertility properties. In addition droughts might also reduce yield. This is multiplied by potential effects of climate changes. Environmental improvement is only possible by integral understanding of urban, non-urban and green spaces, rural landscapes, protective green areas, diversity in agro-ecological areas and protected areas. That is why afforestation is planned over almost 100,000 ha by the establishment of different types of forest plantations and other plantations, such as greenways, shelterbelts, bee-keeping plantations, buffer plantations, eco-corridors, etc. By the implementation of planned afforestation, it could be possible to increase the yield in agriculture, timber production, protection against wind, to improve the environmental conditions, production of honey, development of hunting, sports, recreation tourism and sustainable land use.

TI  - Significance of Perylene for Source Allocation of Terrigenous Organic Matter in Aquatic Sediments
PY  - 2019
AB  - Perylene is a frequently abundant, and sometimes the only polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in aquatic sediments, but its origin has been subject of a longstanding debate in geochemical research and pollutant forensics because its historical record differs markedly from typical anthropogenic PAHs. Here we investigate whether perylene serves as a source-specific molecular marker of fungal activity in forest soils. We use a well-characterized sedimentary record (1735-1999) from the anoxic-bottom waters of the Pettaquamscutt River basin, RI to examine mass accumulation rates and isotope records of perylene, and compare them with total organic carbon and the anthropogenic PAH fluoranthene. We support our arguments with radiocarbon (C-14) data of higher plant leaf-wax n-alkanoic acids. Isotope-mass balance-calculations of perylene and n-alkanoic acids indicate that similar to 40% of sedimentary organic matter is of terrestrial origin. Further, both terrestrial markers are pre-aged on millennial time-scales prior to burial in sediments and are insensitive to elevated C-14 concentrations following nuclear weapons testing in the mid-20th Century. Instead, changes coincide with enhanced erosional flux during urban sprawl. These findings suggest that perylene is definitely a product of soil-derived fungi, and a powerful chemical tracer to study the spatial and temporal connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic environments.

TI  - FISH PASSES - AN ECOLOGICAL MEASURE FOR THE RIVER AND HABITAT CONTINUITY PRESERVATION IN THE CRIS RIVER BASIN
PY  - 2011
AB  - River Restoration represents an important domain for water authorities in Europe, especially due to the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/CE which aims at improving the status of rivers ecosystems in a broad, integrated, ecological perspective and to the new Flood Directive. Development of infra-structure projects associated with power supply, abstractions, waste disposal and both rural and urban land-use can all have impacts on the river systems and they threat the bio-diversity and sustainability of flora and fauna including the fish populations. Barriers to fish migration have profound consequences for hydrology and habitats, revering fisheries and upstream and downstream migration of fish. Flood protection is one of the key driving forces causing river and habitat continuity interruption in the Romania country. In Romania there are a small number of fish's passes in four river basins. Most structures, including large barrages, flood-control dams, sluices, flood gates etc., have been built for floods control, water conservation during dry periods, for hydropower, irrigation, for safety or for water supply. This paper focuses on ecological solutions for the fish migration, representing a limited effort related to the achievement of a good ecological status for the heavy modified bodies. Connectivity is crucial in the context of restoration. From a list of 788 reservoirs, only 77 dams/weirs were analyzed, being characterized by surface area above 50 ha and height of the dams until 15 m. The study case has been identified taking into account several criteria such as: the historical fish zone, the present monitoring fish data and the ecological prioritization criteria recommended by the International Commission for the Danube River Protection. The paper presents the ecological solution for the Abramut Crestur reservoir, created in 1976 year, after the sluicing of the Fancica river (total length: 25 km, surface: 100 km(2)) from the Cris River basin. The reservoir is situated in an agriculture area, characterized by low flows and two species of migratory fishes: Barbus barbus and Chondrostoma nasus. Before the embankment the floodplain provided an important habitat and food source (marshland and wet zone covered with reed) for migratory birds and fishes. The proposed ecological solution is to restore natural hydrological functions of the Fancica River by creating a lateral \"natural bypass channel\" for the fish, on the left side of the reservoir, all along the reservoir. Taking into account the neighborhoods of the dams it is enough space for the construction of the fish passes in \"cascade\", being equipped with artificial or natural obstacles such as weirs, stone-blocks and alluvial material mimicking a natural watercourse. The slope of such fish facility will be very slow, and long enough for providing resting areas for the fish. This way the proposedfish way could be an important means of redressing the detrimental effects of obstructions.

TI  - Factors in the design of an urban microbat flyway
PY  - 2011
AB  - Bat surveys were conducted during 2006 and 2007 in the Willoughby Local Government Area (LGA) in the northern suburbs of Sydney to determine the occurrence and movement of microbats. Based on the frequency of bat detections and the direction of bat movements, two major and five minor bat flyways were identified in the study area. The two major flyways were north south movement corridors that occurred on the eastern and western margins of the LGA; each major flyway had minor flyways branching from them. The two major flyways were separated from each other by the Pacific Highway rise that runs north south through the centre of the study area. The rise acts as an effective flyway barrier as tree corridors are completely disrupted by an exposed, noisy, night-illuminated residential and commercial strip. Minor bat flyways approach the Pacific Highway rise from the east and west and are only separated by a relatively short distance. Extending these flyways to create an east west passage across the study area would greatly extend the foraging range of bats on either side of it. In order to link the major flyways, the eastern and western minor flyways need to be extended by the creation of a continuous tree canopy through residential areas to the Pacific Highway rise. Controlled street planting and supported private plantings of trees along strategic routes, together with modified street lighting could achieve this result. The crossing of the Pacific Highway would require the construction of a lightweight \"flyover bridge\" that commenced and ended in the extended tree canopies. This would provide a wind and light shielded crossing point for bats attempting to fly east west across the Willoughby LGA. The components of the \"flyover bridge\" are discussed along with other considerations in achieving an effective extended flyway through a densely populated residential area.

TI  - Holocene landscape dynamics at the tell Arslantepe, Malatya, Turkey - Soil erosion, buried soils and settlement layers, slope and river activity in a middle Euphrates catchment
PY  - 2014
AB  - Alluvial and colluvial sequences were studied around the prehistoric tell Arslantepe in 11 exposures and additional auger cores. The chronology is based on 11 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages, four radiocarbon ages, and the embedded artifacts. Sediments contained wood charcoals, providing information on former vegetation. Fluvial activity is documented during Late Glacial times (15.4 +/- 2.5, 12.8 +/- 3.1kyr) and frequently after Roman times. Slope and soil erosion occurred in the early (10.6 +/- 1.4, 8.2 +/- 0.7kyr) and mid-late Holocene (6.7 +/- 0.9, 5.4 +/- 0.7-4.7 +/- 0.7, 2.6 +/- 0.2-2.5 +/- 0.2, 1.9 +/- 0.2-1.8 +/- 0.2kyr, and during the last 1000 years). The early Holocene erosion phases pre-date the so far established onset of settlement at the tell. This either indicates an earlier onset of agricultural land use than assumed or climatic influence on erosion, such as the 10.3 and 8.2kyr climate events known from Western Europe. The erosion phases at around 5.0 and 2.6kyr could reflect geomorphic responses to societal collapse (Late Chalcolithic state, Neo-Hittite kingdom) at Arslantepe. Most intensive Holocene soil erosion and landscape degradation occurred after occupation of the region by the Roman Empire. This is paralleled by the onset of river activity. A part of the lower neo-Hittite town as well as an early Holocene Terra Rossa-like soil that had formed rapidly were found buried. So far, no indication for mid-late Holocene fluvial activity of the adjacent creeks until Roman times has been found. Our results illustrate the large potential of slope deposits for long term reconstructions of human induced landscape transformation in Anatolia.

TI  - Field Inspections According to prEN 16841-1:2015 in a Naturally Evolved Neighborhood of Industry and Living Areas. State-of-the-art-technology of a Comprehensive Data Collection, Interaction of Different Sources and Effects on the Perceiving Citizens
PY  - 2016
AB  - An increasing complaint situation on odour nuisance in the cities Mainz and Wiesbaden in the Rhine corridor brought the ministries of the two German counties Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate to the decision that comprehensive field measurements are necessary to determine the real impact situation. The Olfasense GmbH (formerly Odournet GmbH) conducted this huge field inspection on behalf of the ministries. The measurement area of around 7.500.000 m(2) was covered with a grid of 157 measurement points and 100 grid cells. Over half a year a panel of 21 assessors conducted field measurements and assigned the occurring odours to 15 defined odour characters. The article will describe the advantages of the used web technology in comparison to the former proceeding with paper registration of odours especially due to the quick access to the results during the whole investigation period. This has several benefits for the local authorities and plant operators. It will present the results of the measurements according to prEN16841-1 and the Guideline on Odour in Ambient Air (GIRL) as well for the complete odour situation as for single odour characters. In parts the results showed a clear exceedance of the German limit values (allowed frequency of odour perception) for living areas. We will provide a discussion on the influence of odours of different sources and different characters occurring in the same period of time (odour hour) and the attempt to relate this to the effects on the citizens.

TI  - Segmentation of Individual Trees From TLS and MLS Data
PY  - 2017
AB  - Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and mobile laser scanning (MLS) data can be used to obtain abundant and precise side information of trees. Therefore, it can enable extracting individual tree parameters, such as the tree height, crown size, crown base height, and diameter at breast height, and it can provide basic data for forest research and management. This study proposes a technical framework for segmenting individual trees from TLS and MLS data. This framework contains six steps: 1) data preprocessing, 2) octree construction, 3) spatial clustering, 4) stem detection, 5) initial segmentation, and 6) overlapped canopy segmentation. This framework makes two main contributions: 1) a top-down hierarchical segmentation approach, including connectivity-based spatial clustering (regional scale), stem-based initial segmentation (individual tree scale), and fine segmentation of overlapped canopy (canopy scale), is proposed to reduce technical difficulties and improve process efficiency; and 2) a modified node similarity calculation for normalized cut method aiming at segmenting overlapped canopy, which can effectively separate neighboring trees even if their canopies are overlapped, is proposed. The proposed framework was tested on a leaves-off terrestrial LiDAR dataset and a leaves-on mobile LiDAR dataset. For terrestrial LiDAR data, our framework achieved completeness of 92.4%, correctness of 95.4%, and F-score of 0.94. For mobile LiDAR data, the corresponding values were 94.0%, 93.7%, and 0.94.

TI  - Landscape features and caribou harvesting during three decades in Newfoundland
PY  - 2022
AB  - Landscapes can influence the distribution of harvesting by influencing animal distribution and hunter access. For species like caribou, Rangifer tarandus, decades-long shifts in abundance and distribution might alter such relationships, but few studies have been conducted at such scales. We examined relationships between landscape features and 21,380 harvest records of migratory caribou in Newfoundland during caribou population growth (1980s), cessation of growth (1990s), and decline (2000s). We focused on features hypothesized to influence the distributions of caribou and hunters: lichen landcover, roads, cutblocks, outfitter camps, power lines, and towns. We uncovered larger harvests by resident hunters of male and female caribou among lichen landcover, likely providing preferred caribou forage, and larger harvests by non-resident hunters of male caribou away from towns, reflecting the locations of outfitter camps. Only during later decades, resident harvests occurred nearer power lines and cutblocks, likely providing hunter access and reflecting risk-prone foraging by caribou. We surmise that the harvest was facilitated by open habitats, preferred by caribou, and anthropogenic features leading to hunter access, especially as the caribou population declined. Such knowledge at broad scales is increasingly important in an era of widespread disruption to landscapes.

TI  - Wildfire frequency varies with the size and shape of fuel types in southeastern France: Implications for environmental management
PY  - 2013
AB  - Characterizing time intervals between successive fires in the recent history is of main interest for fire hazard prevention and sustainable environmental management as it indicates what the typical fire return interval for each type of ecosystem is. We tested the extent to which fire return intervals (FRIs) depend on fuel type and age, and we compared FRI values between two fire-prone areas of south-eastern France (Provence). These areas had similar weather and roughly similar fuel types but fuels occurred in patches with different sizes and shapes in the landscape. We built a fire database (1960-2010) and we fitted Weibull distributions of FRI in order to compute the probability density function and the hazard of burning. Our results indicate maximal probability of burning again for shrublands (garrigues and maquis), and minimal values for mixed broadleaf-conifer forests and broadleaved forests. Most fuel types of Provence showed no effect of fuel age on the probability of burning again. Only the unmanaged maquis showed a linear increase of fire hazard in time due to a rapid postfire fuel build up. Rather long fire-free intervals and low age-dependency for most forest fuels of Provence suggest that reducing their biomass may not be sufficient to reduce fire risk. In contrast, the flammable shrublands have rather short fire return intervals and represent a high fire hazard for the whole study area. The two areas had statistically significant difference of fire return intervals for a same fuel type (e.g. 18-22 years for shrublands, 20-24 years for pine forests, and 24-27 years for oak forests). This suggested that size, shape and connectivity of fuels play a major role in the probability of burning again and should be taken into account for fire management. The present policy of fire prevention puts efforts into public information and prevention, and preferential management of fuels at risk in the vicinity of roads and wildland-urban interfaces where fires occur preferentially. However, fire suppression may also take advantage of favouring low-flammable fuels with low age-dependency on strategic places in the landscape. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - THE TOWN OF PAG - AN EXAMPLE OF A 15TH CENTURY \"REAL TOWN\"
PY  - 2012
AB  - The town of Pag, situated on the homonymous island in North Dalmatia is a unique example of a completely planned urban space whose construction started in 1443. In the course of the following thirty years, it mainly witnessed the execution of the final design stages which included the construction of town walls. They represent an original example of urban planning which has been well attested by archival documents. The creation of this new town, Citta Nouva, was said to have been prompted by the decision to relocate a smaller settlement called Old Pag which had been during the Trecento the centre of the insular community due to ancient salt plants built within the spacious bay in the centre of the uninhabited side of the island. The prehistoric and ancient Roman settlements with the capital Cissa were situated in a fertile valley further to the north, whereas Novalia contemporary Novalja, was a settlement which developed during late antiquity exclusively as a sea port. The ethno-political changes that occurred during the early Middle Ages led to the abandonment of these settlements since the development of commerce on the Adriatic coast and in its hinterland stimulated construction of salt plants which came to be in the end of the 14th century the biggest salt plants in the Croatian Littoral. Important natural resources were the reason the area was desired by Zadar, the town that in many respects presented competition to Venice. In order to defend themselves from constant military upsurges, the islanders of Pag voluntarily consented to the protection offered by Venice and in 1409 the island became part of Venice's Stato del Mar. This meant colonial dependence of the island of Pag on the imperial power of Serenissima, but also encouragement to the economic growth of the local community. Due to a misfortunate position of Old Pag, its community decided to move closer to the salt plants, which was also in the interest of Venice in that it eagerly wanted to keep its monopolistic position in salt trade. The establishment of New Pag was therefore approved by the Venice dodge and it took place on the site which was compared to that of Old Pag more appropriate for organized life of the community and maritime connection to the main centre of the Venetian Republic. According to written sources the foundations of St Mary's Church and of the main fort near the entrance to the town from the port were laid in 1443. Both buildings were built on the site which was soon after divided into four unequal quarters of the future town. The town was constructed gradually, but the planimetry of the site clearly shows that all components necessary for the town's functions were rationally planned from the very beginning. Particularities of the net-like system of streets attest primarily to the axial communication between the salt plants in the east and the port in the western part of the town, while the cardo of the transversally positioned Strada magna form the cross shaped plan with a square in the centre. Although geometrically completely irregular, the quadrangle space comprises the most important facilities for urban life: the Rectors' palace and the tower with a public clock positioned diagonally to the largest church and facing the communal loggia later on destroyed, situated on the opposite side of the parish church, and the Bishop's palace which never saw completion. Residential quarters were built in blocks composed of rows of axially attached private houses and perpendicularly positioned to the main road which was at places double-laned. In the northern section of the town the blocks were formed by two densely built rows of small houses, clearly intended for lower classes. In contrast, the rows in the southern section are double in size since they contained more spacious houses with back yards belonging to richer families. This social stratification was already established in the very cadastre which also confirms the morphological quality of the architecture although lagging behind the architectural achievements in other towns of the Venetian province of Dalmatia. The urban features of Novi Pag, congruent in typology to the town-colonies related to semi-industrial production, have been attested by the modest fortified walls which entirely surrounded the town. Their irregular pentagonal shape with each side adjusted to the terrain and defence strategy formed a ring around the town. The western side of the fortification retracted towards the town centre providing thus better protection of the port with the most strongly built corner forts. The south side faced the salt plants with warehouses and controlled the approaching space in front of them together with the western, shorter and functionally most neutral side. The longest, northern side protruding in a triangle-like formation contained a town gate facing the island fields. The walls of the fortification containing an interior corridor were easily and quickly accessible in case of enemy attacks. A more thorough analysis of town planning and design, which can be detected in the present urban core of Pag, reveals detailed rational approach to urban development guided by the politics of organized local administration and strategy of the powerful state authorities. If observed from within that context, a question might arise about the true origin of Pag which seems to be the centre of the enigma including arrivals of the most significant artists of the Croatian Quattrocento to Pag as well as interpretations of Pag as the precursor of the Renaissance ideal town. Attempting to dispel such misconceptions, this text draws attention to fragmentary records of terrain measurement performed by Venetian military engineers by which Citta Nuova was divided into quarters. Subsequently, in 1460, the galley commander Andrea Buon made the measurement of the wider are of the town. The fact that the Senate of the Venetian Republic for years allotted 300 ducats for the construction of Pag and even controlled land exchange supports the premise that the Venetian centralist state had a decided role in conceiving the initial urban project of Pag. The execution of the concept design must have been handed to the local authorities and aristocrats who commissioned builders from southern Adriatic towns. The most esteemed among them, Giorgio Mathei Dalmaticus, had until 1466 participated as a building contractor in the construction of the fortification, while other building work was done by his collaborators among who there was not a single foreigner. That is the reason the entire architectural heritage of Pag, with unsubstantial number of sculptural works conforms to the artistic character of the coastal Croatia. The paper further supports the view that New Pag should be valued as an exceptional example of \"real town\" adapted to the achievements of mature humanism in the Eastern Adriatic without insisting on stylistically defining it in terms of Renaissance which has been attempted, though questionably, in the history of urban theory and practice.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Parasites of Howler Monkeys (Alouatta palliata) Inhabiting the Fragmented Landscape of the Santa Marta Mountain Range, Veracruz, Mexico
PY  - 2010
AB  - In recent years populations of howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) in southeastern Mexico have decreased substantially due to the transformation and loss of natural habitats. This is especially evident in the Santa Marta mountain range, Veracruz, Mexico where several studies have evaluated the impact of fragmentation on howler monkey populations in order to propose management programs for their conservation. The conditions generated by fragmentation likely change the rates of parasitic infection and could decrease howler survival. In this study, gastrointestinal parasite species richness, prevalence, and egg density of infection were determined in howler groups inhabiting five forest fragments at the Santa Marta mountain range. Two hundred and seventy-eight fresh fecal samples were collected between October 2002 and April 2003. Three parasite species were found during the dry and the wet season in all forest fragments sampled: one unidentified species of Eimeriidae; Topanoxyuris minutus (Oxyuridae); and Controrchis biliophilus (Dicrocoeliidae). Both the prevalence of T. minutus and infection density for all parasites differed between seasons and fragments (the largest fragment consistently differed from other fragments). Host density, distance to the nearest town, fragment size, fragment shape, and total basal area of food trees explained parasite prevalence, but each species had a different pattern. Although parasite richness was lower, prevalence and density were higher than values reported for howlers in conserved forests. These results suggest that the establishment of biological corridors and animal translocation programs must take into account the parasite ecology of each fragment to avoid higher infection rates and preclude potential consequent mortality.

TI  - Applying network analysis to the conservation of habitat trees in urban environments: a case study from Brisbane, Australia
PY  - 2006
AB  - In Australia more than 300 vertebrates, including 43 insectivorous bat species, depend on hollows in habitat trees for shelter, with many species using a network of multiple trees as roosts, We used roost-switching data on white-striped freetail bats (Tadarida australis; Microchiroptera: Molossidae) to construct a network representation of day roosts in suburban Brisbane, Australia. Bats were caught from a communal roost tree with a roosting group of several hundred individuals and released with transmitters. Each roost used by the bats represented a node in the network, and the movements of bats between roosts formed the links between nodes. Despite differences in gender and reproductive stages, the bats exhibited the same behavior throughout three radiotelemetry periods and over 500 bat days of radio tracking: each roosted in separate roosts, switched roosts very infrequently, and associated with other bats only at the communal roost This network resembled a scale-free network in which the distribution of the number of links from each roost followed a power law. Despite being spread over a large geographic area (> 200 km(2)), each roost was connected to others by less than three links. One roost (the hub or communal roost) defined the architecture of the network because it had the most links. That the network showed scale-free properties has profound implications for the management of the habitat trees of this roosting group. Scale-free networks provide high tolerance against stochastic events such as random roost removals but are susceptible to the selective removal of hub nodes. Network analysis is a useful tool for understanding the structural organization of habitat tree usage and allows the informed judgment of the relative importance of individual trees and hence the derivation of appropriate management decisions, Conservation planners and managers should emphasize the differential importance of habitat trees and think of them as being analogous to vital service centers in human societies.

TI  - Impact of the Kunming-Bangkok Highway on Land Use Changes along the Route between Laos and Thailand
PY  - 2021
AB  - Road construction fragments the landscape, reduces connectivity, and drives land use changes. To our knowledge, little is known about the scope and intensity of the effects of cross-border roads on changes in land use. Here, with the land use data products provided by the US Agency for International Development's SERVIR Mekong project, using the GIS-based spatial analysis to quantitatively analyze and compare the effects of the cross-border road on land use changes within a 30 km buffer area along the Kunming-Bangkok Highway between Laos and Thailand. The results show the following: The greater the distance was from the highway, the smaller were the overall changes in land use within the buffer zone. A comparison of the situation before and after the road was opened in 2013 revealed significant differences in the most influential land use types of agricultural expansion, i.e., from 47.07% to 52.07% (the buffer zone was 1 km). In particular, 57.32% (1381.93 ha) and 40.08% (966.46 ha) of the land occupied by forests had been converted into land for plantation and agriculture, respectively, from 2013 to 2018. The scope of the impact of the operational route on the dynamics of land use was inconsistent. The largest impact before the road became operational was within 4 km of the buffer zone (0.26 to 0.24). Once the road had been opened, the range of its impact was beyond 10 km (0.63 to 0.57). The work here can provide a scientific basis for regional transportation planning and the sustainable use of land resources.

TI  - The use of bushland, corridors, and linear remnants by birds in southeastern Queensland, Australia
PY  - 1997
AB  - Within the southeastern region of Queensland, Australia, native forest cover (bushland) has been greatly reduced and fragmented, and clearing is still occurring. Many of the region's bird species are being increasingly restricted to isolated habitat remnants. However, little is known about the habitat value of these remnants and whether their value is influenced by their degree of connection. We investigated bird use of riparian corridors in pastoral and urban surroundings and riparian linear remnants within an urban context. We compared the avifauna of these remnants with dryland and riparian sites within continuous bushland. We also assessed their use by previously derived response-guilds of birds to bushland clearing. We counted 3567 individuals of 102 bird species. Riparian bushland supported more species and had greater bird abundances than dryland bushland. Corridors and linear remnants supported densities of many bushland-dependent species similar to those in bushland; this varied with species' patterns of large-scale migration and residency. Bushland-dependent winter migrants used both corridors and linear remnants extensively. Bushland-dependent residents were most abundant in continuous bushland and least abundant in linear remnants, possibly reflecting the constraints of central place foraging. Effects of isolation were only evident in resident bushland-dependent species. Local habitat variables were significantly associated with variation in abundance of some types of birds within corridors and linear remnants; however, the differences in bird abundances attributable to spatial characteristics were greater than those attributable to habitat characteristics. The effects of bushland fragmentation and isolation were mediated by the extent to which species are dependent upon bushland and their patterns of large-scale migration or residency. Local habitat, and possibly more importantly altitude, may influence site use by winter migrants and generalist species.

TI  - Fire Behavior, Fuel Consumption, and Turbulence and Energy Exchange during Prescribed Fires in Pitch Pine Forests
PY  - 2020
AB  - Prescribed fires are conducted extensively in pine-dominated forests throughout the Eastern USA to reduce the risk of wildfires and maintain fire-adapted ecosystems. We asked how fire behavior and fuel consumption during prescribed fires are associated with turbulence and energy fluxes, which affect the dispersion of smoke and transport of firebrands, potentially impacting local communities and transportation corridors. We estimated fuel consumption and measured above-canopy turbulence and energy fluxes using eddy covariance during eight prescribed fires ranging in behavior from low-intensity backing fires to high-intensity head fires in pine-dominated forests of the New Jersey Pinelands, USA. Consumption was greatest for fine litter, intermediate for understory vegetation, and least for 1 + 10 hour wood, and was significantly correlated with pre-burn loading for all fuel types. Crown torching and canopy fuel consumption occurred only during high-intensity fires. Above-canopy air temperature, vertical wind velocity, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in buoyant plumes above fires were enhanced up to 20.0, 3.9 and 4.1 times, respectively, compared to values measured simultaneously on control towers in unburned areas. When all prescribed fires were considered together, differences between above-canopy measurements in burn and control areas (Delta values) for maximum Delta air temperatures were significantly correlated with maximum Delta vertical wind velocities at all (10 Hz to 1 minute) integration times, and with Delta TKE. Maximum 10 minute averaged sensible heat fluxes measured above canopy were lower during low-intensity backing fires than for high-intensity head fires, averaging 1.8 MJ m(-2) vs. 10.6 MJ m(-2), respectively. Summed Delta sensible heat values averaged 70 +/- 17%, and 112 +/- 42% of convective heat flux estimated from fuel consumption for low-intensity and high-intensity fires, respectively. Surprisingly, there were only weak relationships between the consumption of surface and understory fuels and Delta air temperature, Delta wind velocities, or Delta TKE values in buoyant plumes. Overall, low-intensity fires were effective at reducing fuels on the forest floor, but less effective at consuming understory vegetation and ladder fuels, while high-intensity head fires resulted in greater consumption of ladder and canopy fuels but were also associated with large increases in turbulence and heat flux above the canopy. Our research quantifies some of the tradeoffs involved between fire behavior and turbulent transfer of smoke and firebrands during effective fuel reduction treatments and can assist wildland fire managers when planning and conducting prescribed fires.

TI  - Insights into identifying habitat hot spots and migratory corridors of green turtles in the South China region
PY  - 2018
AB  - 1. Sea turtles are globally endangered, and face daily anthropogenic threats, such as direct take, by-catch, and habitat degradation. Current research efforts on sea turtles in the South China region mainly focus on captivity and husbandry, haematology and blood chemistry, and nesting ecology. Published information on the marine habitat use of wild populations is limited. 2. This situation therefore creates a pressing need for scientific research on freeranging sea turtles as a foundation for habitat management and species protection in South China. In this study, habitat use and oceanic movement of nesting, and bycatch or stranded green turtles, were determined by satellite tracking combined with home-range analysis. 3. Coupled with previous findings, the foraging grounds of several sea turtle species (green turtle Chelonia mydas, hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata and loggerhead Caretta caretta) were mainly distributed along the coasts of Hainan Island Province and Guangdong Province, mainland China, as well as Taiwan and the Philippines, and the outlying islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. 4. Habitat hot spots and migratory corridors of green turtles, in particular nesting turtles in South China, were identified. Coastal waters near Wanning City of Hainan Island, the eastern Leizhou Peninsula, Iriomote-jima and Ishigaki-shima of the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, and Dao Bach Long Vi of Vietnam serve as foraging grounds for nesting green turtles from different origins in South China. Moreover, the Paracel (Xisha) and the Pratas (Dongsha) Islands in the South China Sea, Huidong Gangkou, and its vicinity in mainland China, and Liouciou Island and Penghu Island of Taiwan contain both nesting sites and foraging grounds for green turtles. 5. The sites that are associated with migratory corridors, in particular Hainan Island, eastern Leizhou Peninsula, and Liouciou Island, which currently lack conservation plans for sea turtles, should be given higher priority for habitat and species protection.

TI  - Between a rock and a hard place: rugged terrain features and human disturbance affect behaviour and habitat use of Sumatran elephants in Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Asian elephants are threatened throughout their range due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and conflict with humans. Limited data on spatial and temporal use of habitats in largely intact forests by elephants in Sumatra is a major hindrance for conservation and land use planning, and consequently human-elephant conflict mitigation. We analysed GPS data from collared elephants to investigate their use of habitat in relation to available land cover and human disturbance in Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia. We applied remote sensing techniques to extract environmental variables to use in state-space Hidden Markov Models and integrated Step Selection Function to analyse foraging strategies and land use selectivity, while using dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models and Minimum Convex Polygons to determine used and available habitat features within their home ranges. Our results show that Sumatran elephants in Aceh preferred areas with lower elevation (< 200 m) and slopes (0-10 degrees), with minimal terrain ruggedness, which also happen to be areas selected by humans. Elephants closely adhered to rivers and mountain valleys when utilizing homogenous dense natural forests, and expanded from the rivers in heterogenous forests toward open, resource-dense, land use types. Overall, slope, vegetation, and human disturbance had the largest impact on each of the clans' foraging strategies. Areas closer to human settlements were used more by night and less by day, indicating that human presence and activities influence elephant habitat use and avoidance. Our findings conclude future management decisions should focus on protecting the remaining lowland forests and preventing further urban encroachment in areas with lower elevation and slope, particularly in proximity to rivers which act as corridors between natural habitats, in order to mitigate human-elephant conflict and protect the species from extinction.

TI  - Record-breaking wildfires in the world's largest continuous tropical wetland: Integrative fire management is urgently needed for both biodiversity and humans
PY  - 2021
AB  - In the Brazilian Pantanal, wildfire occurrence has increased, reaching record highs of over 40,000 km2 in 2020. Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.

TI  - Variation in moth occurrence and implications for foraging habitat of Ozark big-eared bats
PY  - 2008
AB  - We investigated patterns of moth occurrence among habitats in two different landscapes surrounding roosts of the endangered Ozark big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) from May to August 2005, and compared these data with published results on the diet of this subspecies. Landscapes were situated in the Ozark Mountains, USA, and consisted of a fragmented, agricultural landscape and a contiguous national forest. We captured 8720 moths constituting >= 314 species and 22 families. Pastures demonstrated a lower abundance and richness of moths than other habitats in the fragmented landscape (p < 0.05). Neither abundance nor richness of moths varied by habitat in the forested landscape, but we did observe variation among roost locations (p < 0.05). Abundant families of moths (n >= 100 specimens captured) did vary in abundance among habitats in both landscapes (p < 0.05), with poletimber stands, riparian forest and upland forest selected, and pasture, forest edge, sawtimber and sapling stands avoided by at least one family of moths. Density and richness of woody plant species were correlated with the occurrence of moths at sampling sites. We recommend maintaining habitat heterogeneity around roosts of the Ozark big-eared bat to encourage an abundance and richness of moth prey, and suggest that forested riparian corridors are important habitat elements for Ozark big-eared bats foraging in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - A Novel Collaborative IoD-Assisted VANET Approach for Coverage Area Maximization
PY  - 2021
AB  - Internet of Drones (IoD) is an efficient technique that can be integrated with vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to provide terrestrial communications by acting as an aerial relay when terrestrial infrastructure is unreliable or unavailable. To fully exploit the drones' flexibility and superiority, we propose a novel dynamic IoD collaborative communication approach for urban VANETs. Unlike most of the existing approaches, the IoD nodes are dynamically deployed based on current locations of ground vehicles to effectively mitigate inevitable isolated cars in conventional VANETs. For efficiently coordinating IoD, we model IoD to optimize coverage based on the location of vehicles. The goal is to obtain an efficient IoD deployment to maximize the number of covered vehicles, i.e., minimize the number of isolated vehicles in the target area. More importantly, the proposed approach provides sufficient interconnections between IoD nodes. To do so, an improved version of succinct population-based meta-heuristic, namely Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) inspired by food searching behavior of birds or fishes flock, is implemented for IoD assisted VANET (IoDAV). Moreover, the coverage, received signal quality, and IoD connectivity are achieved by IPSO's objective function for optimal IoD deployment at the same time. We carry out an extensive experiment based on the received signal at floating vehicles to examine the proposed IoDAV performance. We compare the results with the baseline VANET with no IoD (NIoD) and Fixed IoD assisted (FIoD). The comparisons are based on the coverage percentage of the ground vehicles and the quality of the received signal. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IoDAV approach allows finding the optimal IoD positions throughout the time based on the vehicle's movements and achieves better coverage and better quality of the received signal by finding the most appropriate IoD position compared with NIoD and FIoD schemes.

TI  - Impacts of land use at the catchment scale constrain the habitat benefits of stream riparian buffers
PY  - 2013
AB  - Stream conservation and restoration strategies commonly focus on preserving extant riparian forest and restoring riparian habitat. Though these practices are beneficial to stream habitat, they may not suffice to restore stream condition in catchments heavily influenced by intensive land use. To evaluate this hypothesis, we measured invertebrate populations in 12 streams affected by different land-use types (cultivated, developed, forested and grassland). Within each stream, we compared reaches with and without riparian buffers of remnant mature forest. Within each reach, we calculated the relative abundance of individuals from the insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (%EPT) and assessed specific conductance, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature and substratum composition. Forested catchments had the highest %EPT (average 23.8) followed by grassland (16.1), cultivated (1.96) and developed (0.31). Reaches with forested buffers present were not associated with higher %EPT in forested, cultivated or developed catchments. In grassland catchments, however, %EPT was about eightfold higher in reaches with forested buffers than those without. High values of %EPT were associated with large stream substratum and low specific conductance and temperature, which were most common in forested catchments. Developed and cultivated catchments did not follow this pattern, %EPT being uniformly low, even where abiotic conditions were similar to forested catchments. These results confirm that intensive urban and cultivated land uses at the catchment scale degrade stream biological communities. They also indicate that patchy forested riparian corridors, as found in many restoration projects, are probably insufficient to mitigate severe, large-scale biological degradation.

TI  - Spatial analysis of anthropogenic disturbance regimes and roadside shrubs in a fragmented agricultural landscape
PY  - 2004
AB  - fragmented woodlands in agricultural regions of Australia, roadside environments (road verges) provide important refuges for threatened native fauna and isolated populations of plant species. However, as roads are transport corridors for humans and their vehicles; species survival is affected through destruction, fragmentation and modification of remaining habitat by human activity. Few studies have recognised the effects of anthropogenic disturbances, in the form of historical roadworks activities, on adjacent roadside plant populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soil disturbance from roadworks on the spatial patterns and structural dynamics of roadside Acacia populations in an agricultural area in southeastern Australia. Stem size and disturbance data were collected from 135 roadside populations of three species of Acacia shrubs in the Lockhart Shire area. Spatial pattern analysis using the Network K-function and Discriminant Function analyses showed that road verge width, road category, disturbance intensity and distance to nearest town were highly significant variables in relation to disturbance from roadworks and shrub structural dynamics. Colonising populations were more abundant along gravel roads where soil disturbance intensity was high, whereas stable populations were more abundant where soil disturbance intensity was low. Senescent populations were more abundant in narrow, little used road verge corridors 4-6 km from nearby towns. These results suggest that anthropogenic disturbance regimes may be critical to shrub recruitment and persistence in roadside environments, which has important consequences for conservation of threatened native flora and fauna in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Restoration of Wildcelery, Vallisneria americana Michx., in the lower Detroit River of the Lake Huron-Lake Erie corridor
PY  - 2007
AB  - American wildcelery (Vallisneria americana Michx.) is a valuable submersed aquatic plant that was negatively affected by pollution and urban runoff in the lower Detroit River for much of the 20th century. Following 25 years of water-pollution and urban- runoff abatement initiated in the early 1970s, we postulated that water clarity had increased and that this would allow restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, water clarity increased in the late 1980s due to waterfiltration and particulate removal by exotic dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis), which could contribute to potential wildcelery restoration. We sampled wildcelery in 1996-97 and compared these data to wildcelery data from 1950-51 and 1984-85. Over the 48-year period of comparison, areal density of wildcelery tubers decreased 72% (from 51.2 million to 14.4 million tubers) between 1950-51 and 1984-85 then increased 251% (from 14.4 million to 50.5 million tubers) between 1984-85 and 1996-97. As a result, overall areal abundance was about the same in 1950-51 as in fall 1996-97. However, tuber densities in spring 1996 were similar to historical low abundances in springs of 1984-85. Then between spring and fall 1996, tuber densities increased 333% and remained relatively abundant through October 1997 indicating the beginning of the restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, we believe further reductions of turbidity through continued pollution-abatement programs and water filtration by dreissenid mussels combined with habitat protection and active management of wildcelery will contribute even further to the restoration of wildcelery in the Detroit River in the 21st century.

TI  - The last 40 ka evolution of the Central Po Plain between the Adda and Serio rivers
PY  - 2012
AB  - We reconstructed the geological evolution and the history of the fluvial network in the central part of the Po Plain in Lombardy, northern Italy, since the Middle Wurm. We focused on evidences of dissection and incision of former rivers into the large outwash fans originating from piedmont glaciers of the southern Alps in the Last Glacial Maximum. The studied area is located between the Po River and the Alps north of the Adda/Serio river confluence, around the town of Crema. Morphometric analysis and stratigraphic investigation were carried out, supported by palaeobotany, sand petrography and radiometric dating. The obtained stratigraphic framework is presented by cross sections and by a geological map. During the Middle Wurm, an alluvial fan of the Adda River oriented NWN-SSE occupied the area, feeding south and west the Romanengo hill. A substantial reorganisation of the fluvial network occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum. Since 32-30 ka cal. BP, the area was fed by two outwash rivers, originated from the Adda and the Oglio piedmont glaciers, both characterised by a prevalent southward drainage, 160 degrees-170 degrees S in the LGM. After the LGM the fan-head was dissected by trunk channels and, at the downslope fan limit, the southward flow shifted to a southeastern direction. Thereafter, major dissection and downcutting occurred in the Lateglacial, confining the major rivers into large alluvial corridors, further shaped by lateral erosion during the Holocene. The Late Holocene history of the Serio River is marked by fluvial floods during the late Roman Age, and by a capture of the lower reach by the Adda River. The geomorphological evidence supports the historically inferred age assignment of the diversion to 12th-14th c. AD.

TI  - Landscape structure influences pollinator movements and directly affects plant reproductive success
PY  - 2012
AB  - Pollinators play a key role within most terrestrial communities in maintaining plant populations, as well as pollinating many agricultural crops for seed and fruit production. The mobility of pollinating animals is significant to their importance but we know little about how landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can influence the flight directions of bumblebees (Bombus spp. Hymenoptera, Apidae), one of Europe's most important groups of pollinators. A bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on plant reproductive success plants had increased pollinator activity, pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections. The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on bumblebees for pollination services.

TI  - Importance of early successional habitats to mammals in eastern forests
PY  - 2001
AB  - Populations of mammals that depend on early successional forests or shrub-dominated habitats are declining in portions of the eastern United States. Although much of this decline can be attributed to maturation of young forests that once dominated the East, fragmentation and suppression of natural disturbances also have been implicated. Responses by habitat specialists (e.g., New England cottontails [Sylvilagus transitionalis]) and carnivores with large area requirements that rely on prey associated with early successional habitats (e.g., bobcats [Lynx rufus]) have been most extreme. Populations of facultative or opportunistic users of early successional habitats (e.g., black bears [Ursus americanus] and little brown bats [Myotis lucifugus]) apparently have not been affected by fewer young stands. As eastern forests mature, biotic and abiotic forces will increase abundance of early successional habitats. However, maturation of these forests will take a century or more. In the meantime, using even-aged silviculture and applying controlled burns to native shrublands may be useful to alleviate current shortages. In landscapes modified substantially by suburban-urban developments and dense networks of roads, conventional management efforts likely will be insufficient. In these regions, increased populations of generalist predators are of exerting intense predation on mammalian herbivores that are restricted to small patches, and movement between patches by small mammals is limited. Mammals large area requirements also are hampered in these landscapes by frequent road crossings. These limitations may require implementing habitat management programs for mammals that differ from those developed for other disturbance-dependent taxa. Large (>10-ha), clustered patches of early successional habitat may be necessary to maintain viable populations. The effectiveness of these managed habitats will be further enhanced by positioning them close to existing land uses that are characterized by early successional habitats (e.g., powerline corridors). In agricultural landscapes, the representation of old-field habitats could be increased in set-aside programs.

TI  - Chemical loading into surface water along a hydrological, biogeochemical, and land use gradient: A holistic watershed approach
PY  - 2006
AB  - Identifying the sources and impacts of organic and inorganic contaminants at the watershed scale is a complex challenge because of the multitude of processes occurring in time and space. Investigation of geochemical transformations requires a systematic evaluation of hydrologic, landscape, and anthropogenic factors. The 1160 km(2) Boulder Creek Watershed in the Colorado Front Range encompasses a gradient of geology, ecotypes, climate, and urbanization. Streamflow originates primarily as snowmelt and shows substantial annual variation. Water samples were collected along a 70-km transect during spring-runoff and base-flow conditions, and analyzed for major elements, trace elements, bulk organics, organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs), and pesticides. Major-element and trace-element concentrations were low in the headwaters, increased through the urban corridor, and had a step increase downstream from the first major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Boron, gadolinium, and lithium were useful inorganic tracers of anthropogenic inputs. Effluent from the WWTP accounted for as much as 75% of the flow in Boulder Creek and was the largest chemical input. Under both hydrological conditions, OWCs and pesticides were detected in Boulder Creek downstream from the WWTP outfall as well as in the headwater region, and loads of anthropogenic-derived contaminants increased as basin population density increased. This report documents a suite of potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals in a reach of stream with native fish populations showing indication of endocrine disruption.

TI  - RECENT COLONIZATION OF NESTING CANADA GEESE (BRANTA CANADENSIS) IN GLEN AND GRAND CANYONS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Nesting Canada geese (Branta canadensis) appear to be colonizing portions of the Colorado River in Glen Canyon and Grand Canyon, Arizona. We report the first appearance of nesting geese in this area with one record in the 1950s, followed several decades later by single-pair nesting records in 2001, 2012, 2013, and 2016, increasing to two pairs in 2018, five or six pairs in 2019, and at least two pairs in 2020. Our recent field observations (2018-2020) document that nesting geese are currently successfully raising broods in two geographically distinct areas separated by over 300 km along the river corridor in Grand Canyon: a 4-km area from river kilometer 80 to river kilometer 84 in eastern Grand Canyon, and a 54-km area from river kilometer 392 to river kilometer 446 in western Grand Canyon. The eastern nesting area is dominated by riparian habitat that has proliferated in a relatively stabilized shoreline since Glen Canyon Dam began regulating the river in 1963. The western nesting area is within the fluctuating inflow of the river with Lake Mead, a geomorphologically distinct area where >20 years of drought-induced declining reservoir levels have exposed sediments deposited when Lake Mead was higher than at present (1950s-2001). Two factors likely contribute to the increased presence of nesting geese in Grand Canyon, including (1) expanding populations of nonmigratory, resident geese and the southward expansion of their historic breeding range and (2) the availability of nesting habitat along the Colorado River today that may not have existed historically.

TI  - Food Chain Restoration for Pollinators: Regional Habitat Recovery Strategies Involving Protected Areas of the Southwest
PY  - 2016
AB  - The steep declines over the last quarter century of wild pollinators in the Southwest among native bees, monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.), hummingbirds, and nectar-feeding bats have come during a time of accelerated climate change, and are likely due to a variety of stresses interacting with climatic shifts. Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that declining availability and altered timing of floral resources along \"nectar corridors\" accessible to pollinators involves climatic shifts as a serious stressor that had been previously underestimated. Longitudinal studies from both urban heat islands and rural habitats in Southwestern North America suggest peak flowering of many wildflowers serving as floral resources for pollinators is occurring three to five weeks earlier in spring than a century ago, leaving \"phenological gaps\" in nectar resource availability for certain pollinators. To avoid the threat of what A. Dobson (Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University) and others have termed \"food web collapse,\" a range of groups have initiated ecological restoration efforts in semi-arid zones that attempt to (a) assemble more resilient plant-pollinator food chains, and (b) hydrologically restore watercourses to ensure water scarcity will be less likely to disrupt re-assembled food chains in the face of droughts, catastrophic floods, and other correlates of global climate change. We recommend \"bottom-up food chain restoration\" strategies for restoring nectar corridors in protected areas on or near geopolitical and land management boundaries in all regions, but particularly in the Southwest or US-Mexico desert border states. We highlight binational and multicultural workshops facilitated to communicate about, and initiate restoration of, mutualistic relationships among plants, pollinators, and people to protected area managers on both sides of the border.

TI  - Spatial landslide hazard assessment along the Jelapang Corridor of the North-South Expressway in Malaysia using high resolution airborne LiDAR data
PY  - 2015
AB  - Mapping landslide-prone regions are crucial in natural hazard management and urban development activities in hilly and tropical regions. This research aimed to delineate a spatial prediction of landslide hazard areas along the Jelapang Corridor of the North-South Expressway in Malaysia by using two statistical models, namely, logistic regression (LR) and evidential belief function (EBF). Landslides result in high economic and social loses in Malaysia, particularly to highway concessionaries such as PLUS Expressways Berhad. LR and EBF determine the correlation between conditioning factors and landslide occurrence. EBF can also be applied in bivariate statistical analysis. Thus, EBF can be used to assess the effect of each class of conditioning factors on landslide occurrence. A landslide inventory map with 26 landslide sites was recorded using field measurements. Subsequently, the landslide inventory was randomly divided into two data sets. Approximately 70 % of the data were used for training the models, and 30 % were used for validating the results. Eight landslide conditioning factors were prepared for landslide susceptibility analysis: altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, terrain roughness index, and distance from river. The landslide probability index was derived from both methods and subsequently classified into five susceptible classes by using the quantile method. The resultant landslide susceptibility maps were evaluated using the area under the curve technique. Results revealed the proficiency of the LR method in landslide susceptibility mapping. The achieved success and prediction rates for LR were 90 and 88 %, respectively. However, EBF was not successful in providing reasonable accurate results. The acquired success and prediction rates for EBF were 53 and 50 %, respectively. Hence, the LR technique can be utilized in landslide hazard studies for land use management and planning.

TI  - Home range size, space use and resource selection of griffon vultures in an insular environment
PY  - 2021
AB  - The extent of home ranges of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) was studied on Crete (Greece) during 2005-2015 by monitoring 27 individuals with very high frequency radio-telemetry. Radio-tagged birds were followed for an average period of 13.1 months (n = 7-22), where a total of 1615 days of fieldwork produced 4420 radiolocations (x = 163.5 radiolocations per tagged bird, n = 142-328). Overall, the mean home range and mean core area of griffon vultures were estimated at 1560 +/- 140 km(2) (KDE 95%) and 373 +/- 36 km(2) (KDE 50%) respectively with significant age-related differences within seasons. Immature griffon vultures ranged on average about double the area ranged by adults in winter and occupied significantly larger core areas. The home range overlap in per cent and utilization distribution between adult and immature birds was also significantly less in winter than in summer. Foraging griffon vultures avoided northern slopes with unfavourable flight conditions and selected sites within rangelands with low diurnal temperature variations where overwintering livestock and suitable nesting cliffs occur. Foraging adults were restricted to the vicinity of the breeding colonies and favoured sites away from urban zones. In contrast, immature griffon vultures selected pastoral zones in marginal areas with mild winters and rugged terrain. The existence of predictable food sources in combination with suitable roosting sites and favourable flight conditions were the main factors differentiating the space-use pattern between the two age classes. We recommend that apart from the maintenance of traditional farming practices, sites, such as large communal roosts and flight corridors or entire 'hotspot' activity zones of immature birds, should be taken into account in conservation planning and sensitivity mapping for the species.

TI  - Using conditional inference forests to identify the factors affecting crash severity on arterial corridors
PY  - 2009
AB  - Introduction: The study aims at identifying traffic/highway design/driver-vehicle information significantly related with fatal/severe crashes on urban arterials for different crash types. Since the data used in this study are observational (i.e., collected outside the purview of a designed experiment), an information discovery approach is adopted for this study. Method: Random Forests, which are ensembles of individual trees grown by CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm, are applied in numerous applications for this purpose. Specifically, conditional inference forests have been implemented. In each tree of the conditional inference forest, splits are based oil how good the association is. Chi-square test statistics are used to measure the association. Apart from identifying the variables that improve classification accuracy, the methodology also clearly identifies the variables that are neutral to accuracy, and also those that decrease it. Results: The methodology is quite insightful in identifying the variables of interest in the database (e.g., alcohol/drug use and higher posted speed limits contribute to severe crashes). Failure to use safety equipment by all passengers and presence of driver/passenger in the vulnerable age group (more than 55 years or less than 3 years) increased the severity of injuries given a crash had Occurred. A new variable, 'element' has been used in this study, which assigns crashes to segments, intersections, or access points based on the information from site location, traffic control, and presence of signals. Impact: The authors were able to identify roadway locations where severe crashes tend to occur. For example, segments and access points were found to be riskier for single vehicle crashes. Higher skid resistance and k-factor also contributed toward increased severity of injuries in crashes. (C) 2009 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd, All rights reserved.

TI  - Anthropogenic and biogenic sources of Ethylene and the potential for human exposure: A literature review
PY  - 2015
AB  - This review examines available published information on ethylene emission sources, emission magnitudes, and inhalation exposures in order to assess those factors and circumstances that can affect human contact with this omnipresent gas. The results reveal that airborne ethylene concentrations at the ppb levels are commonplace and can arise in the vicinity of traffic corridors, forest fires, indoor kitchens, horticultural areas, oil fields, house fires, and petrochemical sites. The primary biogenic sources of ethylene derive from microbial activity in most soil and marine environments as well as its biological formation in wide variety of plant species. Sizable amounts of ethylene can also result from the burning of fossil fuels, forest and savanna fires, and crop residue combustion. Motor vehicle exhaust is the largest contributor to urban ethylene levels under most circumstances, but industrial flare releases and fugitive emissions may also be of relevance. Occupational exposures generally range up to about 50-100 ppm and have been documented for those working in the horticultural, petrochemical, and fire and rescue industries. Continuous personal monitoring at the community level has documented exposures of 3-4 ppb. These levels are more closely associated with the ethylene concentrations found indoors rather than outdoors indicating the importance of exposure sources found within the home. Indoor air sources of ethylene are associated with environmental tobacco smoke, wood or propane fuel use, fruit and vegetable storage, and cooking. Ethylene is not found in any consumer or commercial products and does not off-gas from building products to any appreciable extent. The review indicates that outdoor sources located some distance from the home do not make an appreciable contribution to personal exposures given the strength and variety of sources found in the immediate living environment.

TI  - The jaguar Panthera onca (Carnivora: Felidae) in \"El Cielo\" Biosphere Reserve, Tamaulipas, Mexico
PY  - 2016
AB  - Information on the ecology of jaguars (Panthera onca) in \"El Cielo\" Biosphere Reserve in Tamaulipas, Mexico is scant and limited to anecdotic records in a handful of publications. The objectives of our study were to: a) determine population density and structure of jaguars, b) compare their activity patterns with that of pumas (Puma concolor), c) ascertain potential prey relative abundance, and d) evaluate local resident's perception on loss of domestic animals due to jaguar predation. Between April 2013 and April 2014 we conducted camera trapping in Gomez Farias Township with a total sampling effort of 8 580 camera trap days. Besides, we completed 136 semi-structured interviews among local residents of Gomez Farias and Llera Townships to gather information on domestic animal losses attributed to jaguars and other carnivores. We identified eight different jaguar individuals during a complete year of camera-trapping, composed of four adult females, one juvenile female, two adult males and one juvenile male. We estimated a jaguar density of 5.9 +/- 1.3 jaguars/100 km(2). Activity patterns for jaguars and pumas were similar as both were nocturnal and crepuscular in nature. The most abundant potential prey species for jaguars in the study site were Crax rubra, Cunicztlus paca, Mazama temama, Odocoileus virginianzts and Didelphis virginiana; while the rarest were Mephitis macroura and Procyon lotor. Interview results suggested that chickens, dogs, and house cats were the most consumed domestic animals from all reported losses by local residents (n= 107). This study represents the first attempt to describe jaguar ecology in \"El Cielo\" Biosphere Reserve; however, there is a need of additional monitoring efforts to determine the current status of jaguars in a larger area in order to establish conservation strategies. Finally, this jaguar population may have an important role in maintaining the species in the Sierra Madre Oriental biological corridor connecting populations in Nuevo Leon and San Luis states in Northeastern Mexico.

TI  - SOIL POLLUTION WITH HEAVY METALS IN THE AREA OF COPSA MICA TOWN - GEOGRAPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper explores an issue of maximum importance for the environment, namely the heavy metal pollution in the area of Copsa Mica town, a settlement known worldwide for the high pollution caused by the non-ferrous and chemical plants of its industrial site. Of great significance for this study are also the geographical location of the industrial site and the distribution of landforms along the wide valley corridor of the Tarnava Mare, which channels the air masses and encourages the deposition of solid and gaseous pollutants. The pollution triggered by SC Sometra SA has negatively impacted the human health (increasing morbidity) and the terrestrial and aquatic fauna, leading to the diminution or disappearance of certain living populations, as well as to the occurrence of pathological alterations. The assessment of soil quality tit the region highlights significant impairment on large areas with specific pollutants The study has revealed the existence of three polluted areas, as follows the most polluted area, the middle polluted area and the least polluted area.
