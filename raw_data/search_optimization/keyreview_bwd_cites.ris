TI  - Animal behavior, cost-based corridor models, and real corridors
PY  - 2013
AB  - Corridors are popular conservation tools because they are thought to allow animals to safely move between habitat fragments, thereby maintaining landscape connectivity. Nonetheless, few studies show that mammals actually use corridors as predicted. Further, the assumptions underlying corridor models are rarely validated with field data. We categorized corridor use as a behavior, to identify animal-defined corridors, using movement data from fishers (Martes pennanti) tracked near Albany, New York, USA. We then used least-cost path analysis and circuit theory to predict fisher corridors and validated the performance of all three corridor models with data from camera traps. Six of eight fishers tracked used corridors to connect the forest patches that constitute their home ranges, however the locations of these corridors were not well predicted by the two cost-based models, which together identified only 5 of the 23 used corridors. Further, camera trap data suggest the cost-based corridor models performed poorly, often detecting fewer fishers and mammals than nearby habitat cores, whereas camera traps within animal-defined corridors recorded more passes made by fishers, carnivores, and all other non-target mammal groups. Our results suggest that (1) fishers use corridors to connect disjunct habitat fragments, (2) animal movement data can be used to identify corridors at local scales, (3) camera traps are useful tools for testing corridor model predictions, and (4) that corridor models can be improved by incorporating animal behavior data. Given the conservation importance and monetary costs of corridors, improving and validating corridor model predictions is vital.

TI  - Habitat persistence, habitat availability and the evolution of dispersal
PY  - 1999
AB  - Many organisms live in ephemeral habitats, making dispersal a vital element of life history. Here, we investigate how dispersal rate evolves in response to habitat persistence, mean habitat availability and landscape pattern. We show that dispersal rate is generally lowered by reduced habitat availability and by longer habitat persistence. However, for habitats that persist for an average of ten times the length of a generation, we show a clear non–monotonic relationship between habitat availability and dispersal rate. Some patterns of available habitat result in populations with dispersal polymorphisms. We explain these observations as a metapopulation effect, with the rate of evolution a function of both within–population and between–population selection pressures. Individuals in corridors evolve much lower dispersal rates than those in the mainland populations, especially within long, narrow corridors. We consider the implications of the results for conservation.

TI  - Landscape pattern in topographically complex landscapes: issues and techniques for analysis
PY  - 2002
AB  - Ecological research provides ample evidence that topography can exert a significant influence on the processes shaping broad-scale landscape vegetation patterns. Studies that ignore this influence run the risk of misinterpreting observations and making inappropriate recommendations to the management community. Unfortunately, the standard methods for landscape pattern analysis are not designed to include topography as a pattern-shaping factor. In this paper, we present a set of techniques designed to incorporate the topographic mosaic into analyses of landscape pattern and dynamics. This toolbox includes adjustments to ‘classic’ landscape indices that account for non-uniform landscape topography, indices that capture associations and directionality in vegetation pattern due to topographic structure, and the application of statistical models to describe relationships between topographic characteristics and vegetation pattern. To illustrate these methods, we draw on examples from our own analysis of landscape pattern dynamics in logged and unlogged forest landscapes in southwestern British Columbia. These examples also serve to illustrate the importance of considering topography in both research and management applications.

TI  - Evaluating Spatial Priority of Urban Green Infrastructure for Urban Sustainability in Areas of Rapid Urbanization: A Case Study of Pukou in China
PY  - 2018
AB  - Rapid urbanization in recent decades highlights the limitations on the sustainable development of cities due to the fragmentation of restricted urban green land. The aim of this paper is to formulate a workable framework for planning and managing urban green infrastructure (UGI) for urban sustainability. This study provides a new method for modeling and analyzing UGI based on a case study of the Pukou District in Nanjing, which is a typical developing area in China. We adopt the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method and combine it with the landscape connectivity index to identify the UGI hubs and links. In addition, the least-cost path model is employed to construct the potential UGI network in this case. We further integrate the spatial syntax model into landscape ecological principles to evaluate the spatial priority of the UGI network. The results showed that the framework proposed in this study is suitable for the green infrastructure network construction by combining the MSPA, landscape connectivity, and the space syntax methods. This framework can be used to better understand the spatial distribution and priority of the green infrastructure network for achieving urban sustainability in China.

TI  - Integrating Humans into Ecology: Opportunities and Challenges for Studying Urban Ecosystems
PY  - 2003
AB  - Our central paradigm for urban ecology is that cities are emergent phenomena of local-scale, dynamic interactions among socioeconomic and biophysical forces. These complex interactions give rise to a distinctive ecology and to distinctive ecological forcing functions. Separately, both the natural and the social sciences have adopted complex system theory to study emergent phenomena, but attempts to integrate the natural and social sciences to understand human-dominated systems remain reductionist—these disciplines generally study humans and ecological processes as separate phenomena. Here we argue that if the natural and social sciences remain within their separate domains, they cannot explain how human-dominated ecosystems emerge from interactions between humans and ecological processes. We propose an integrated framework to test formal hypotheses about how human-dominated ecosystems evolve from those interactions.

TI  - Dispersal patterns of lynx in the Northwest Territories
PY  - 1997
AB  - Knowledge of dispersal patterns in lynx (Lynx lynx) is fragmentary but warrants investigation because of its importance to population and harvest dynamics. From 1989 to 1995 I examined dispersal patterns of 60 radiocollared and 31 eartagged lynx from an untrapped population in southwestern Northwest Territories at peak to low densities of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). Thirty-seven collared and 6 tagged lynx were identified as dispersers. Dispersal rates were greatest in the 12-month period after the rapid decline in hare density. Annual dispersal rates did not differ between sexes (P > 0.20). Dispersal direction was not different from uniform for female lynx (P > 0.5), and favored south and west for males (P 0.22). Survival rates of dispersers and non-dispersers did not differ for any of the intervals in the hare cycle examined (P > 0.40), and were lowest during the first full year after the decline in hare density. Natural causes accounted for nearly 3 times as many deaths as human-caused. Eight lynx established new home ranges at the end of dispersal. The extent of dispersal and the degree of natural mortality after the decline in hare density suggest that although the mobility and vulnerability of lynx populations are both high, some restricted harvesting could be implemented during this period.

TI  - Wide outcrossing provides functional connectivity for new and old Banksia populations within a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2019
AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects landscape connectivity, the extent of which is influenced by the movement capacity of the vectors of seed and pollen dispersal for plants. Negative impacts of reduced connectivity can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br. (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations had greater allelic diversity (Ar = 8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations (Ar range = 6.49–7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between restored and adjacent remnants (FST = 0.03 and 0.10) than all other pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean FST = 0.01 ± 0.01; n = 16 P = 0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity (rp = 0.06–0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances (< 1.7 km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape. Due to long-distance pollination events, the physical size of these sites underestimates their effective population size. Thus, they are functionally equivalent to large populations, integrated into a larger landscape matrix.

TI  - Urban landscape genetics: canopy cover predicts gene flow between white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations in New York City.
PY  - 2012
AB  - In this study, I examine the influence of urban canopy cover on gene flow between 15 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations in New York City parklands. Parks in the urban core are often highly fragmented, leading to rapid genetic differentiation of relatively nonvagile species. However, a diverse array of 'green' spaces may provide dispersal corridors through 'grey' urban infrastructure. I identify urban landscape features that promote genetic connectivity in an urban environment and compare the success of two different landscape connectivity approaches at explaining gene flow. Gene flow was associated with 'effective distances' between populations that were calculated based on per cent tree canopy cover using two different approaches: (i) isolation by effective distance (IED) that calculates the single best pathway to minimize passage through high-resistance (i.e. low canopy cover) areas, and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR), an implementation of circuit theory that identifies all low-resistance paths through the landscape. IBR, but not IED, models were significantly associated with three measures of gene flow (Nm from F(ST) , BayesAss+ and Migrate-n) after factoring out the influence of isolation by distance using partial Mantel tests. Predicted corridors for gene flow between city parks were largely narrow, linear parklands or vegetated spaces that are not managed for wildlife, such as cemeteries and roadway medians. These results have implications for understanding the impacts of urbanization trends on native wildlife, as well as for urban reforestation efforts that aim to improve urban ecosystem processes.

TI  - Toward best practices for developing regional connectivity maps.
PY  - 2011
AB  - To conserve ecological connectivity (the ability to support animal movement, gene flow, range shifts, and other ecological and evolutionary processes that require large areas), conservation professionals need coarse-grained maps to serve as decision-support tools or vision statements and fine-grained maps to prescribe site-specific interventions. To date, research has focused primarily on fine-grained maps (linkage designs) covering small areas. In contrast, we devised 7 steps to coarsely map dozens to hundreds of linkages over a large area, such as a nation, province, or ecoregion. We provide recommendations on how to perform each step on the basis of our experiences with 6 projects: California Missing Linkages (2001), Arizona Wildlife Linkage Assessment (2006), California Essential Habitat Connectivity (2010), Two Countries, One Forest (northeastern United States and southeastern Canada) (2010), Washington State Connected Landscapes (2010), and the Bhutan Biological Corridor Complex (2010). The 2 most difficult steps are mapping natural landscape blocks (areas whose conservation value derives from the species and ecological processes within them) and determining which pairs of blocks can feasibly be connected in a way that promotes conservation. Decision rules for mapping natural landscape blocks and determining which pairs of blocks to connect must reflect not only technical criteria, but also the values and priorities of stakeholders. We recommend blocks be mapped on the basis of a combination of naturalness, protection status, linear barriers, and habitat quality for selected species. We describe manual and automated procedures to identify currently functioning or restorable linkages. Once pairs of blocks have been identified, linkage polygons can be mapped by least-cost modeling, other approaches from graph theory, or individual-based movement models. The approaches we outline make assumptions explicit, have outputs that can be improved as underlying data are improved, and help implementers focus strictly on ecological connectivity.

TI  - Ranking European regions as providers of structural riparian corridors for conservation and management purposes
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract Riparian zones are of utmost importance in providing a wide range of ecological and societal services. Among these, their role in maintaining landscape connectivity through ecological corridors for animals and plants is of major interest from a conservation and management perspective. This paper describes a methodology to identify European regions as providers of structural riparian corridors, and to rank them with reference to conservation priority. Physical riparian connectors among core habitat patches are identified through a recent segmentation technique, the Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis. A multi-scale approach is followed by considering different edge distances to identify core and peripheral habitats for a range of hypothetical species. The ranking is performed using a simple set of indices that take into account the degree of environmental pressure and the presence of land protection schemes. An example for environmental reporting is carried out using European administrative regions and major rivers to summarize indices value. The approach is based on freely available software and simple metrics which can be easily reproduced in a GIS environment.

TI  - A GIS-based Green Infrastructure Planning for Sustainable Urban Land Use and Spatial Development
PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract Green infrastructure has been a popular framework for smart development and conservation planning. If it is proactively planned, developed, and maintained in a systematical way, it also should be a better model for land use and spatial development in a city. By integrating a GIS-based ecological connectivity assessment with the patch-corridor-matrix model, this study provided a green infrastructure planning approach to guide the sustainable land use decision in the Longgang District of Shenzhen in China. The method has an effective performance in identifying the vital ecological areas and linkages prior to development in suburban areas, and also the key sites for protection and restoration in developed sites. It is hoped that based on this planned green infrastructure frame, the land resource units could be developed or protected when most needed and most suitable in the future.

TI  - Urban permeability for birds: An approach combining mobbing-call experiments and circuit theory
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract The urban matrix was recently shown to be a mosaic of heterogeneous dispersal habitats. We conducted a playback experiment of mobbing calls to examine the probabilities of forest birds to cross a distance of 50 m over urban matrix with different land-cover types in an urban area. We treated the reciprocal of the crossing probabilities as a movement resistance for forest birds. We drew resistance surfaces based on the land-cover maps of urban Sapporo. We applied a circuit theory to examine the relative role of a detour route consisting of a riparian corridor and urban matrix for dispersing forest bird individuals from continuous forest to an isolated green space in the midst of an urban area. Our results showed that wood cover had the highest crossing probability, while open land (grassland and pavement) had the lowest probabilities. Buildings and water surface displayed an intermediate probability. Resistance surfaces and flow maps at 25- and 50-m resolutions were very similar and suggested that dispersing individuals are likely to use the intervening building areas that dominate the urban matrix rather than detour through riparian corridors. Our results showed the useful combination of experimental approaches and circuit theory, and the importance of the spatial configuration of corridors, as well as the composition and management of dispersal habitats, to landscape connectivity.

PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract Several aspects of the ecology of coyotes (Canis latrans) have been studied in cities (i.e., diet, use and selection of habitat, movements), but additional knowledge will assist persons that are responsible for management of urban predators. We studied coyotes in central Tucson, Pima Co., Arizona, during November 2005–November 2006. Our objectives were to monitor radiocollared coyotes to determine size of home range, to ascertain use of habitat based on land-use categories and movements, and to describe a den of urban coyotes. Average size of home range calculated using the 95% fixed-kernel method was 26.8 ± 5.1 SE km2 for resident coyotes. Overall, land categories used most often were washes, medium-density residential areas, and low-density residential areas. Movements were 800 m/h in areas that were used most during the night (i.e., high-density residential and comm...

TI  - Ecological Principles for the Design of Wildlife Corridors
PY  - 1993
AB  - Networks of wildlife corridors are increasingly being advocated as a key component of strategies for the conservation of biodiversity (Saunders & Hobbs 1991). While they have general support among conservationists, there is a paucity of data on the effectiveness of such corridors for nature conservation. In addition, there are few scientifically-based guiding principles for the evaluation and design of systems of retained areas. Harrison (1992) has drawn attention to these deficiencies and has proposed a theoretical basis for the design of wildlife corridors. While we support this initiative, we have reservations about the generality of the approach outlined by Harrison (1992). He calculates minimum corridor widths for a selected set of terrestrial mammals based on estimates of home range. Our data from studies of forest-dependent arboreal marsupials in southeastern Australia (Lindenmayer 1992a, Lindenmayer et al. in press) do not support Harrison's findings and suggest that additional criteria must be considered in developing a theoretical framework for the evaluation and design of wildlife corridors.

TI  - Cost distance modelling of landscape connectivity and gap‐crossing ability using radio‐tracking data
PY  - 2010
AB  - 1. Landscape connectivity, the ability of species to move between different elements of a landscape, has been evaluated mainly by expert opinion, proxy data or homing experiments, all of which have major limitations. Cost distance modelling can overcome these limitations, but the resistance values of different landscape elements are difficult to estimate. 2. Here, we present a novel method combining step selection functions with cost distance modelling to assess functional landscape connectivity. Instead of relying on movement metrics, the method uses a case-control design to assess whether the chosen steps differ from a random sample of alternatives of similar lengths. Alternative models of landscape connectivity and dispersal behaviour are represented as maps of resistance values, and compared using an information-theoretic approach to select those hypotheses that maximize the discrepancy between chosen steps and random alternatives. 3. We applied this method to daily locations recorded along the dispersal paths of 38 juvenile North Island robins Petroica longipes in a fragmented pastoral landscape in New Zealand. We compared models with different resistance values for four recognized vegetation types in the landscape and assessed gap-crossing behaviour by changing the resistance value of pasture as a function of distance to the closest woody vegetation. 4. Model comparison showed that juvenile robins move in decreasing order of preference through native forest, plantations and shrubland, and showed a marked reluctance for flying over pasture. Under the best model, the largest gap crossed was 110 m. 5. Synthesis and applications. In combination with data on the total cost distances travelled by dispersers, cost distance models of landscape connectivity can be used to predict distributions of dispersal distances in any landscape with similar vegetation types. They can therefore predict responses of species to landscape management or predict spatial dynamics of populations following reintroduction. Our method is potentially applicable to any dispersal data, even with a relatively small number of locations recorded in complex landscapes, meaning models can be fitted to data that cannot be analysed using previous method. Tools are freely available for download to allow researchers and wildlife managers to apply our methods to their own data.

TI  - Can landscape indices predict ecological processes consistently
PY  - 2001
AB  - The ecological interpretation of landscape patterns is one of the major objectives in landscape ecology. Both landscape patterns and ecological processes need to be quantified before statistical relationships between these variables can be examined. Landscape indices provide quantitative information about landscape pattern. Response variables or process rates quantify the outcome of ecological processes (e.g., dispersal success for landscape connectivity or Morisita's index for the spatial distribution of individuals). While the principal potential of this approach has been demonstrated in several studies, the robustness of the statistical relationships against variations in landscape structure or against variations of the ecological process itself has never been explicitly investigated. This paper investigates the consistency of correlations between a set of landscape indices (calculated with Fragstats) and three response variables from a simulated dispersal process across heterogeneous landscapes (cell immigration, dispersal success and search time) against variation in three experimental treatments (control variables): habitat amount, habitat fragmentation and dispersal behavior. I found strong correlations between some landscape indices and all three response variables. However, 68% of the statistical relationships were highly inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous for different landscape structures and for differences in dispersal behavior. Correlations between one landscape index and one response variable could range from highly positive to highly negative when derived from different spatial patterns. I furthermore compared correlation coefficients obtained from artificially generated (neutral) landscape models with those obtained from Landsat TM images. Both landscape representations produced equally strong and weak statistical relationships between landscape indices and response variables. This result supports the use of neutral landscape models in theoretical analyses of pattern-process relationships.

TI  - Conspecific and heterospecific attraction in assessments of functional connectivity
PY  - 2011
AB  - Functional connectivity is known to have an important, positive influence on species persistence. Measurements of functional connectivity traditionally focus on structural attributes of landscapes such as the distance and matrix type between habitat patches as well as on how species interact with those structural attributes. However, we propose that the social behavior of a species, through conspecific and heterospecific attraction, will also impact connectivity by changing how dispersers move with respect to each other and occupied patches. We analyzed functional connectivity patterns using circuit and graph theory for golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) in Brazil under three scenarios. In the first scenario, we looked at connectivity without the effects of attraction under varying maximum dispersal distance and ecological movement cost thresholds. In the second scenario, we allowed dispersers to travel over more hostile matrix than they normally would to reach an occupied patch. In the final scenario, we allowed dispersers to move only to occupied patches. We found that, according to the first scenario, range-wide functional landscape connectivity for golden-headed lion tamarins is low at realistic maximum dispersal distance and movement cost thresholds. Incorporating the effects of conspecific or heterospecific attraction would increase functional connectivity, in the case of scenario two, or decrease functional connectivity, in the case of scenario three. Because conspecific/heterospecific attraction can have an impact on movement for some species, this factor should be incorporated in assessments of functional connectivity patterns for social species and others where patch occupancy is likely to influence the movements of dispersers.

TI  - Critical Thresholds in Species' Responses to Landscape Structure
PY  - 1995
AB  - Critical thresholds are transition ranges across which small changes in spatial pattern produce abrupt shifts in ecological responses. Habitat fragmentation provides a familiar example of a critical threshold. As the landscape becomes dissected into smaller parcels of habitat. landscape connectivity-the functional linkage among habitat patches - may suddenly become disrupted, which may have important consequences for the distribution and persistence of populations. Landscape connectivity depends not only on the abundance and spatial patterning of habitat. but also on the habitat specificity and dispersal abilities of species. Habitat specialists with limited dispersal capabilities presumably have a much lower threshold to habitat fragmentation than highly vagile species, which may perceive the landscape as functionally connected across a greater range of fragmentation severity. To determine where threshold effects in species, responses to landscape structure are likely to occur, a simulation model modified from percolation theory was developed. Our simulations predicted the distributional patterns of populations in different landscape mosaics, which we tested empirically using two grasshopper species (Orthoptera: Acrididae) that occur in the shortgrass prairie of north-central Colorado. The distribution of these two species in this grassland mosaic matched the predictions from our simulations. By providing quantitative predictions of threshold effects, this modellingmore » approach may prove useful in the formulation of conservation strategies and assessment of land-use changes on species` distributional patterns and persistence.« less

TI  - A roadmap for urban evolutionary ecology
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban ecosystems are rapidly expanding throughout the world, but how urban growth affects the evolutionary ecology of species living in urban areas remains largely unknown. Urban ecology has advanced our understanding of how the development of cities and towns change environmental conditions and alter ecological processes and patterns. However, despite decades of research in urban ecology, the extent to which urbanization influences evolutionary and eco-evolutionary change has received little attention. The nascent field of urban evolutionary ecology seeks to understand how urbanization affects the evolution of populations, and how those evolutionary changes in turn influence the ecological dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Following a brief history of this emerging field, this Perspective article provides a research agenda and roadmap for future research aimed at advancing our understanding of the interplay between ecology and evolution of urban-dwelling organisms. We identify six key questions that, if addressed, would significantly increase our understanding of how urbanization influences evolutionary processes. These questions consider how urbanization affects nonadaptive evolution, natural selection, and convergent evolution, in addition to the role of urban environmental heterogeneity on species evolution, and the roles of phenotypic plasticity versus adaptation on species' abundance in cities. Our final question examines the impact of urbanization on evolutionary diversification. For each of these six questions, we suggest avenues for future research that will help advance the field of urban evolutionary ecology. Lastly, we highlight the importance of integrating urban evolutionary ecology into urban planning, conservation practice, pest management, and public engagement.

TI  - Habitat suitability modelling to correlate gene flow with landscape connectivity
PY  - 2008
AB  - Landscape connectivity is important in designing corridor and reserve networks. Combining genetic distances among individuals with least-cost path (LCP) modelling helps to correlate indirect measures of gene flow with landscape connectivity. Applicability of LCP modelling, however, is reduced if knowledge on dispersal pathways or routes is lacking. Therefore, we integrated habitat suitability modelling into LCP analysis to avoid the subjectivity common in LCP analyses lacking knowledge on dispersal pathways or routes. We used presence-only data and ecological niche factor analysis to model habitat suitability for the spiny rat, Niviventer coninga, in a fragmented landscape of western Taiwan. We adapted the resultant habitat suitability map for incorporation into LCP analyses. Slightly increased Mantel correlations indicated that a class-weighted suitability map better explained genetic distances among individuals than did geographical distances. The integration of habitat suitability modelling into LCP analysis can thus generate information on distribution of suitable habitats, on potential routes of dispersal, for placement of corridors, and evaluate landscape connectivity.

TI  - Proposed Conservation Landscape for Giant Pandas in the Minshan Mountains, China
PY  - 2008
AB  - The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), is one of the world's most endangered species. Habitat loss and fragmentation have reduced its numbers, shrunk its distribution, and separated the population into isolated subpopulations. Such isolated, small populations are in danger of extinction due to random demographic factors and inbreeding. We used least-cost modeling as a systematic approach to incorporate satellite imagery and data on ecological and behavioral parameters of the giant panda collected during more than 10 years of field research to design a conservation landscape for giant pandas in the Minshan Mountains. We identified 8 core habitats and 4 potential linkages that would link core habitats CH3, CH4, and CH5 with core habitats CH6, CH7, and CH8. Establishing and integrating the identified habitats with existing reserves would create an efficient reserve network for giant panda conservation. The core habitats had an average density of 4.9 pandas/100 km(2) and contained approximately 76.6% of the giant panda population. About 45% of the core habitat (3245.4 km(2)) existed outside the current nature reserves network. Total estimated core habitat decreased between 30.4 and 44.5% with the addition of residential areas and road networks factored into the model. A conservation area for giant panda in the Minshan Mountains should aim to ensure habitat retention and connectivity, improve dispersal potential of corridors, and maintain the evolutionary potential of giant pandas in the face of future environmental changes.

TI  - The ecological impact of city lighting scenarios: exploring gap crossing thresholds for urban bats.
PY  - 2015
AB  - As the global population urbanizes, dramatic changes are expected in city lighting and the urban form, which may threaten the functioning of urban ecosystems and the services they deliver. However, little is known about the ecological impact of lighting in different urban contexts. Movement is an important ecological process that can be disrupted by artificial lighting. We explored the impact of lighting on gap crossing for Pipistrellus pipistrellus, a species of bat (Chiroptera) common within UK cities. We aimed to determine whether the probability of crossing gaps in tree cover varied with crossing distance and lighting level, through stratified field surveys. We then used the resulting data on barrier thresholds to model the landscape resistance due to lighting across an entire city and explored the potential impact of scenarios for future changes to street lighting. The level of illumination required to create a barrier effect reduced as crossing distance increased. For those gaps where crossing was recorded, bats selected the darker parts of gaps. Heavily built parts of the case study city were associated with large and brightly lit gaps, and spatial models indicate movement would be highly restricted in these areas. Under a scenario for brighter street lighting, the area of accessible land cover was further reduced in heavily built parts of the city. We believe that this is the first study to demonstrate how lighting may create resistance to species movement throughout an entire city. That connectivity in urban areas is being disrupted for a relatively common species raises questions about the impacts on less tolerant groups and the resilience of bat communities in urban centres. However, this mechanistic approach raises the possibility that some ecological function could be restored in these areas through the strategic dimming of lighting and narrowing of gaps.

TI  - Research gaps in knowledge of the impact of urban growth on biodiversity
PY  - 2019
AB  - By 2030, an additional 1.2 billion people are forecast in urban areas globally. We review the scientific literature (n = 922 studies) to assess direct and indirect impacts of urban growth on habitat and biodiversity. Direct impacts are cumulatively substantial, with 290,000 km2 of natural habitat forecast to be converted to urban land uses between 2000 and 2030. Studies of direct impact are disproportionately from high-income countries. Indirect urban impacts on biodiversity, such as food consumption, affect a greater area than direct impacts, but comparatively few studies (34%) have quantified urban indirect impacts on biodiversity. The world is urbanizing. This Review assesses impacts of urban growth on habitat and biodiversity, finding direct impacts more in high-income countries while indirect impacts affect more land but are lesser studied.

TI  - Urban riparian systems function as corridors for both native and invasive plant species
PY  - 2017
AB  - Riparian areas are often the only green areas left in urban and suburban landscapes, providing opportunities for conservation and connectivity of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. While city planners and land managers often tout the importance of riparian networks for these uses, it is not well established if urban riparian plant communities are actually functioning as connected assemblages. Furthermore, urban riparian zones are well known to be highly invaded by non-native plant species and may be functioning to increase the spread of non-native species across the landscape. Here we examine connectivity of plant assemblages in riparian networks within an extensively urbanized landscape. We sampled riparian plant communities at 13 sites along three second-order streams of the Rahway River watershed, New Jersey. We also characterized propagule dispersal at each site by sampling litter packs on the river banks five times between March–October 2011 and identifying germinants from litter packs after cold stratification. Species turnover of both riparian and litter vegetation was more strongly associated with flow distance, particularly for native species, indicating that riverine systems are important for promoting connectivity of native plant assemblages in urban landscapes. However, non-native germinants significantly dominated propagule dispersal along the stream reaches, particularly early in the growing season, suggesting spread utilizing the river system and preemption may be an important mechanism for invasion success in this system. Our data show that management of invasive species should be planned and implemented at the watershed scale to reduce spread via the river system.

TI  - Merging connectivity rules and large-scale condition assessment improves conservation adequacy in river systems
PY  - 2012
AB  - Conservation adequacy is defined as the ability of conservation measures to sustain biodiversity. Although river network connectivity is important for maintaining key ecological processes and ensuring persistence of biodiversity, it also facilitates the propagation of threats along river networks, which may compromise the sustainability of freshwater biodiversity and therefore conservation adequacy. This study aims to introduce two modifications to river conservation planning related to connectivity and catchment condition that together can improve the adequacy of the priority areas identified. This will establish an operational framework for end-users, such as policy makers and NGOs. We operationalize the connectivity framework that has recently emerged in systematic river conservation planning by using a GIS coding system for catchment location in the conservation software package marxan. Additionally, we use a landscape measure of catchment disturbance to direct the conservation plan to the least-disturbed area while still meeting targets for the conservation of fish species used as surrogates for overall biodiversity in our study catchment, the Daly River in northern Australia. This proxy for condition aggregates information on land-use, extractive industries, point-source pollution, and water infrastructure. We successfully modelled the distribution of 39 fish species based on GIS-derived landscape descriptors (most important descriptors were; discharge, distance to river mouth, geology and conductivity). Results from the systematic planning analysis identified a portfolio of watersheds that delivered close to optimal upstream protection with around 4700 stream kilometres (30% of the total network). When using upstream disturbance as an extra penalty, most of the network stayed intact; however, a replacement area was found for a major tributary, which only added an extra 1% of the stream network to the total area. Synthesis and applications. Improving conservation adequacy by accounting for upstream connectivity and condition using this easy-to-implement framework and software package has the potential to facilitate further application of systematic methods in river conservation planning. Furthermore, integrating condition as a discounting factor can also improve conservation adequacy in a broad range of environments (including terrestrial and marine), while not necessarily increasing the management costs.

TI  - Integrating multidirectional connectivity requirements in systematic conservation planning for freshwater systems
PY  - 2012
AB  - Aim Recent efforts to apply the principles of systematic conservation planning to freshwater ecosystems have focused on the special connected nature of these systems as a way to ensure adequacy (long-term maintenance of biodiversity). Connectivity is important in maintaining biodiversity and key ecological processes in freshwater environments and is of special relevance for conservation planning in these systems. However, freshwater conservation planning has focused on longitudinal connectivity requirements within riverine ecosystems, while other habitats, such as floodplain wetlands or lakes and connections among them, have been overlooked. Here, we address this gap by incorporating a new component of connectivity in addition to the traditional longitudinal measure. Location Northern Australia. Methods We integrate lateral connections between freshwater areas (e.g. lakes and wetlands) that are not directly connected by the river network and the longitudinal upstream–downstream connections. We demonstrate how this can be used to incorporate ecological requirements of some water-dependent taxa that can move across drainage divides, such as waterbirds. Results When applied together, the different connectivity rules allow the identification of priority areas that contain whole lakes or wetlands, their closest neighbours whenever possible, and the upstream/downstream reaches of rivers that flow into or from them. This would facilitate longitudinal and lateral movements of biota while minimizing the influence of disturbances potentially received from upstream or downstream reaches. Main conclusions This new approach to defining and applying different connectivity rules can help improve the adequacy of freshwater-protected areas by enhancing movements of biodiversity within priority areas. The integration of multiple connectivity needs can also serve as a bridge to integrate freshwater and terrestrial conservation planning.

TI  - A conceptual framework for the spatial analysis of landscape genetic data
PY  - 2012
AB  - Understanding how landscape heterogeneity constrains gene flow and the spread of adaptive genetic variation is important for biological conservation given current global change. However, the integration of population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics remains an interdisciplinary challenge at the levels of concepts and methods. We present a conceptual framework to relate the spatial distribution of genetic variation to the processes of gene flow and adaptation as regulated by spatial heterogeneity of the environment, while explicitly considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of landscapes, organisms and their genes. When selecting the appropriate analytical methods, it is necessary to consider the effects of multiple processes and the nature of population genetic data. Our framework relates key landscape genetics questions to four levels of analysis: (i) node-based methods, which model the spatial distribution of alleles at sampling locations (nodes) from local site characteristics; these methods are suitable for modeling adaptive genetic variation while accounting for the presence of spatial autocorrelation. (ii) Link-based methods, which model the probability of gene flow between two patches (link) and relate neutral molecular marker data to landscape heterogeneity; these methods are suitable for modeling neutral genetic variation but are subject to inferential problems, which may be alleviated by reducing links based on a network model of the population. (iii) Neighborhood-based methods, which model the connectivity of a focal patch with all other patches in its local neighborhood; these methods provide a link to metapopulation theory and landscape connectivity modeling and may allow the integration of node- and link-based information, but applications in landscape genetics are still limited. (iv) Boundary-based methods, which delineate genetically homogeneous populations and infer the location of genetic boundaries; these methods are suitable for testing for barrier effects of landscape features in a hypothesis-testing framework. We conclude that the power to detect the effect of landscape heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of genetic variation can be increased by explicit consideration of underlying assumptions and choice of an appropriate analytical approach depending on the research question.

TI  - Geographical and taxonomic biases in research on biodiversity in human-modified landscapes
PY  - 2012
AB  - Biodiversity persistence in human-modified landscapes is crucial for conservation and maintaining ecosystem services. Studies of biodiversity in landscapes where humans live, work, and extract resources could support defensible policy-making to manage land-use. Yet, research should cover relevant regions, and biases in study topics should not lead to gaps in the evidence base. We systematically reviewed the literature of biogeography in human-modified landscapes published in eight eminent biogeography, conservation, and ecology journals to assess geographical bias among biomes and geopolitical regions and taxonomic bias among species groups. We compared research output per biome to area, biome type, species richness, proportion of transformed land, and the ratio of transformed to protected land. We also compared research output per geopolitical region to area, proportion of transformed land, the ratio of transformed to protected land, and human population density. Research output was distributed unequally among biomes, geopolitical regions, and species groups. Biome type was a clear factor in research bias, and forest biomes were the subject of 87% of papers, while species richness was not generally associated with bias. Conservation in human-modified landscapes is most important in regions with low protected area coverage, high land conversion, and high pressure from human populations, yet the distribution of published papers did not generally reflect these threats. Seventy-five percent of studies focused on the Americas and Europe, while Africa and Asia were critically understudied. Taxonomically, plants and invertebrates were the most studied groups; however, research output was not correlated with species richness per group. Protected areas alone will not conserve biodiversity in the long term. Thus, a strong biogeographical evidence base is required to support policies for biodiversity maintenance on human-modified land. Under-studied regions and species groups deserve further research to elucidate what, where, and how biodiversity persists in human-modified landscapes to inform conservation policy and enhance efficacy.

TI  - Urban ecological systems: Scientific foundations and a decade of progress
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urban ecological studies, including focus on cities, suburbs, and exurbs, while having deep roots in the early to mid 20th century, have burgeoned in the last several decades. We use the state factor approach to highlight the role of important aspects of climate, substrate, organisms, relief, and time in differen- tiating urban from non-urban areas, and for determining heterogeneity within spatially extensive metropolitan areas. In addition to reviewing key findings relevant to each state factor, we note the emergence of tentative "urban syndromes" concerning soils, streams, wildlife and plants, and homog- enization of certain ecosystem functions, such as soil organic carbon dynamics. We note the utility of the ecosystem approach, the human ecosystem framework, and watersheds as integrative tools to tie information about multiple state factors together. The organismal component of urban complexes includes the social organization of the human population, and we review key modes by which human populations within urban areas are differentiated, and how such differentiation affects environmentally relevant actions. Emerging syntheses in land change science and ecological urban design are also summarized. The multifaceted frameworks and the growing urban knowledge base do however identify some pressing research needs.

TI  - Contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration in a Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) artificial forest
PY  - 2000
AB  - Soil respiration was measured for 2 years in an artificial gap and in an undisturbed area in a Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) forest to estimate the contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration. Measurement plots were set up at the center of the gap, the edge of the gap, the edge of the surrounding stand and within the stand. Using a small gap (2.5 m × 2.5 m) enabled us to maintain the same soil temperature and soil moisture as found in the stand. Seasonal fluctuations in soil respiration, increasing in summer and decreasing in winter, corresponded to changes in the soil surface temperature. Soil respiration in the gap site did not differ significantly from those in the stand in the first year of gap formation. However, in the second year, the minimum CO2 flux was observed at the center of the gap and the maximum at the edge of the surrounding stand. Assuming that the differences between soil respiration in the center of the gap and that in the stand were equal to the root respiration, the root respiration rate was calculated from the relationship between the root respiration rates (Rr) and the soil surface temperature (Ts) by Ln(Rr) = 0.07Ts + 3.48. The average contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration, as estimated from the soil surface temperature in the stand by using the above equation, was 49%. After taking root decomposition into consideration, the contribution of root respiration to soil respiration increased from 49 to 57%.

It employs two stages of co-occurrence information extraction—semantic andrelational—using a different algorithm for each stage. The algorithms used are statistical, but they employ nonlinear dynamics and machine learning. This article is an attempt to validate the output of Leximancer, using a set of evaluation criteria taken from content analysis that are appropriate for knowledge discovery tasks.

TI  - Coupling landscape graph modeling and biological data: a review
PY  - 2020
AB  - Landscape graphs are widely used to model networks of habitat patches. As they require little input data, they are particularly suitable for supporting conservation decisions (and decisions about other issues as e.g. disease spread) taken by land planners. However, it may be problematic to use these methods in operational contexts without validating them with empirical data on species or communities. Since little is known about methodological alternatives for coupling landscape graphs with biological data, we have made an exhaustive review of these methods to analyze links between the main purposes of the studies, the way landscape graphs are constructed and used, the type of field data, and the way these data are integrated into the analysis. We systematically describe a corpus of 71 scientific papers dealing with terrestrial species, with particular emphasis on methodological choices and contexts of the studies. Despite a great variability of types of biological data and coupling strategies, our analyses reveal a dichotomy according to the objective of the studies, between (i) approaches aimed at improving ecological knowledge, mainly based on land-cover maps and using biological data to test the influence of landscape connectivity on biological responses, and (ii) approaches with an operational aim, in which biological data are directly integrated into the graph construction and assuming a positive effect of connectivity. Beyond these main contrasts, the review shows that landscape graphs can benefit from field data of different types at varying scales. The great variability of approaches adopted reveals the flexible nature of these tools.

TI  - Landscape connectivity and animal behavior: functional grain as a key determinant for dispersal
PY  - 2007
AB  - Landscape connectivity can be viewed from two perspectives that could be considered as extremes of a gradient: functional connectivity (refers to how the behavior of a dispersing organism is affected by landscape structure and elements) and structural connectivity (depends on the spatial configuration of habitat patches in the landscape like vicinity or presence of barriers). Here we argue that dispersal behavior changes with landscape configuration stressing the evolutionary dimension that has often been ignored in landscape ecology. Our working hypothesis is that the functional grain of resource patches in the landscape is a crucial factor shaping individual movements, and therefore influencing landscape connectivity. Such changes are likely to occur on the short-term (some generations). We review empirical studies comparing dispersal behavior in landscapes differing in their fragmentation level, i.e., with variable resource grain. We show that behavioral variation affecting each of the three stages of the dispersal process (emigration, displacement or transfer in the matrix, and immigration) is indeed likely to occur according to selective pressures resulting from changes in the grain of the landscape (mortality or deferred costs). Accordingly, landscape connectivity results from the interaction between the dispersal behavior of individuals and the grain of each particular landscape. The existence of this interaction requires that connectivity estimates (being based on individual-based models, least cost distance algorithms, and structural connectivity metrics or even Euclidian distance) should be carefully evaluated for their applicability with respect to the required level of precision in species-specific and landscape information.

TI  - A movement ecology paradigm for unifying organismal movement research
PY  - 2008
AB  - Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes. "Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever." (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.).

PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary Addressing spatial connectivity in conservation planning is important to ensure the maintenance of patterns and processes needed to support the persistence of biodiversity. In freshwater ecosystems, spatial connectivity is constrained by the presence of water, which exhibits marked temporal changes in regions with wet-dry seasonal climates. Previous studies have focused on spatial connectivity and overlooked the temporal component, which is required for the functionality of spatial connections (because of temporal changes in water availability). We identify priority areas for the conservation of freshwater fish, waterbirds and turtles in the Mitchell River catchment in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia. We demonstrate how adequacy of freshwater conservation can be enhanced by integrating an estimate of water residency time (WRT) into the prioritization process. WRT reflects refugial potential and connectivity in freshwater ecosystems and was quantified using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flood and post-flood Landsat satellite imagery. We compare the spatial allocation of priority areas and the spatial and temporal connectivity under two alternative scenarios: (i) accounting only for spatial connectivity and (ii) integrating spatial and temporal connectivity. Priority areas identified under the spatial and temporal connectivity scenario showed a 40% increase in WRT values with respect to the traditional spatial connectivity scenario. This was achieved at no additional cost in terms of total protected area and maintaining the same spatial connectivity. Despite priority areas identified under the two alternative scenarios showing intermediate spatial overlap (64%), the selection process was more efficiently biased towards planning units with high WRT values. WRT in planning units that were only selected under the temporal connectivity scenario was 2絠times higher than in planning units that only appeared in the traditional connectivity scenario. This reveals the importance of accounting for WRT when identifying freshwater priority areas in wet-dry seasonal environments. Synthesis and applications: Considering the temporal connectivity in conservation prioritization as we propose here helps to assess periods of longest spatial connections, thereby maximizing the refugial role of freshwater priority areas during dry periods. Using publicly available satellite imagery data and software, our approach allows improved management of aquatic resources and biodiversity during periods of water scarcity, which may increase in incidence and duration with climate change.

TI  - Landscape connectivity and population distributions in heterogeneous environments
PY  - 1997
AB  - Landscape connectivity refers to the functional relationship among habitat patches, owing to the spatial contagion of habitat and the movement responses of organisms to landscape structure. Heterogeneous landscapes provide a particular challenge for modelling population-level responses to habitat fragmentation, because individuals may be utilizing multiple habitats to varying degrees across the landscape. We apply neutral landscape models to understand how species' habitat affinities interacted with landscape structure (i.e., habitat abundance, distribution, and quality as measured by carrying capacity) to affect the redistribution of individuals. Two types of neutral models are presented: random maps, in which the distribution of habitat is spatially independent, and fractal maps, in which habitat exhibits an intermediate level of spatial dependence. The neutral landscapes comprised varying proportions of three habitat types, for which species exhibited a preference gradient (high, medium, low). We performed a series of simulation experiments as a factorial design of parameter states to tease apart the underlying factors responsible for population distributional patterns (random vs clumped) in spatially complex mosaics. Landscape connectivity is a threshold phenomenon, in which even a minimal loss of habitat near the critical threshold (p c ) is likely to disconnect the landscape, and which may have consequences for population distributions. The exact value of p c depends upon the spatial arrangement of habitat; fractal landscapes exhibited connectivity across a greater range of habitat abundance (p) than random maps (fractal p c = 0.29-0.50. random p c = 0.59). Although the spatial arrangement of habitat (random vs fractal) was the most important determinant of population distributional patterns, different landscape factors were important in structuring populations in the two types of maps. The relative abundance of habitat had the greatest effect on populations in random landscapes, whereas scale-dependent patterns were evident in fractal landscapes. At fine scales, population dispersion was determined by habitat abundance in both random and fractal maps, although populations were more aggregated (as measured by Morisita's Index, l m ) at this scale in random landscapes. But at coarse scales on fractal maps, population distribution was primarily influenced by species' habitat affinities. Assessment of the independent effects of habitat affinity and habitat carrying capacity on population distributions revealed that the differential interaction of species with landscape structure (i.e., different residence probabilities in each habitat type) was the primary determinant of distributional patterns. Neutral landscape models thus provide a useful tool for determining the relative importance of various components of landscape structure that affect population distributions.

TI  - The role of landscape connectivity in planning and implementing conservation and restoration priorities
PY  - 2012
AB  - Landscape connectivity, the extent to which a landscape facilitates the movements of organisms and their genes, faces critical threats from both fragmentation and habitat loss. Many conservation efforts focus on protecting and enhancing connectivity to offset the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity conservation, and to increase the resilience of reserve networks to potential threats associated with climate change. Loss of connectivity can reduce the size and quality of available habitat, impede and disrupt movement (including dispersal) to new habitats, and affect seasonal migration patterns. These changes can lead, in turn, to detrimental effects for populations and species, including decreased carrying capacity, population declines, loss of genetic variation, and ultimately species extinction.

TI  - Urban Ecology: Science of Cities
PY  - 2014
AB  - How does nature work in our human-created city, suburb, and exurb/peri-urb? Indeed how is ecology - including its urban water, soil, air, plant, and animal foundations - spatially entwined with this great human enterprise? And how can we improve urban areas for both nature and people? Urban Ecology: Science of Cities explores the entire urban area: from streets, lawns, and parks to riversides, sewer systems, and industrial sites. The book presents models, patterns, and examples from hundreds of cities worldwide. Numerous illustrations enrich the presentation. Cities are analyzed, not as ecologically bad or good, but as places with concentrated rather than dispersed people. Urban ecology principles, traditionally adapted from natural-area ecology, now increasingly emerge from the distinctive features of cities. Spatial patterns and flows, linking organisms, built structures, and the physical environment highlight a treasure chest of useful principles. This pioneering interdisciplinary book opens up frontiers of insight, as a valuable source and text for undergraduates, graduates, researchers, professionals, and others with a thirst for solutions to growing urban problems.

TI  - Landscape Connectivity Planning for Adaptation to Future Climate and Land-Use Change
PY  - 2019
AB  - We examined recent literature on promoting habitat connectivity in the context of climate change (CC) and land-use change (LUC). These two global change forcings have wide-reaching ecological effects that are projected to worsen in the future. Improving connectivity is a common adaptation strategy, but CC and LUC can also degrade planned connections, potentially reducing their effectiveness. We synthesize advances in connectivity design approaches, identify challenges confronted by researchers and practitioners, and offer suggestions for future research. Recent studies incorporated future CC into connectivity design more often than LUC and rarely considered the two drivers jointly. When considering CC, most studies have focused on relatively broad spatial and temporal extents and have included either species-based targets or coarse-filter targets like geodiversity and climate gradients. High levels of uncertainty about future LUC and lack of consistent, readily available model simulations are likely hindering its inclusion in connectivity modeling. This high degree of uncertainty extends to efforts to jointly consider future CC and LUC. We argue that successful promotion of connectivity as a means to adapt to CC and LUC will depend on (1) the velocity of CC, (2) the velocity of LUC, and (3) the degree of existing landscape fragmentation. We present a new conceptual framework to assist in identifying connectivity networks given these three factors. Given the high uncertainty associated with future CC and LUC, incorporating insights from decision science into connectivity planning will facilitate the development of more robust adaptation strategies.

TI  - The importance of functional connectivity in the conservation of a ground-dwelling mammal in an urban Australian landscape
PY  - 2007
AB  - The distribution of the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), a medium-sized ground-dwelling marsupial, was examined in habitat fragments within the urban landscape of the city of Brisbane, Australia. From surveys conducted in 68 fragments, bandicoots were found to be present in 33 (49%) despite widespread habitat loss and fragmentation. Logistic regression analysis revealed that of 13 measured independent variables, functional connectivity was the only factor that significantly predicted the presence of bandicoots within fragments, with connectivity positively correlated with the likelihood of occupation. Functional connectivity was equated to the likelihood of bandicoot immigration into the focal fragment from the nearest occupied fragment, based on the estimated resistance to movement offered by the intervening matrix. Within Brisbane, riparian habitat fragments typically have a relatively high level of functional connectivity, as thin strips of vegetation fringing waterways serve as corridors between larger riparian areas and facilitate the movement of bandicoots between patches. Analyses based on the Akaike Information Criterion revealed that the optimal model based on landscape context variables was convincingly better supported by the data than the optimal model produced from fragment characteristics. However, it is important to examine both internal attributes of habitat fragments and external features of the surrounding landscape when modelling the distribution of ground-dwelling fauna in urban environments, or other landscapes with a highly variable matrix. As urban centres throughout the world expand, it is crucial that the ecology of local wildlife be considered to ensure functional connection is maintained between habitat patches, especially for the conservation of species that are highly susceptible to fragmentation.

TI  - The Matrix Matters: Effective Isolation in Fragmented Landscapes
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract: Traditional approaches to the study of fragmented landscapes invoke an island‐ocean model and assume that the nonhabitat matrix surrounding remnant patches is uniform. Patch isolation, a crucial parameter to the predictions of island biogeography and metapopulation theories, is measured by distance alone. To test whether the type of interpatch matrix can contribute significantly to patch isolation, I conducted a mark‐recapture study on a butterfly community inhabiting meadows in a naturally patchy landscape. I used maximum likelihood to estimate the relative resistances of the two major matrix types (willow thicket and conifer forest) to butterfly movement between meadow patches. For four of the six butterfly taxa (subfamilies or tribes) studied, conifer was 3–12 times more resistant than willow. For the two remaining taxa (the most vagile and least vagile in the community), resistance estimates for willow and conifer were not significantly different, indicating that responses to matrix differ e...

AB  - We constructed a patch dynamics model which can be used to simulate the changing sizes of resident populations in a series of interconnected habitat patches. We applied the model to white—footed mice (Peromyscus Leucopus) inhabiting patches of forest in an agricultural landscape. The model predicts that mouse populations in isolated woodlots have lower growth rates and are thus more prone to extinction than those in connected woodlots. Field data support this prediction.

TI  - Integrating landscape connectivity in broad-scale forest planning through a new graph-based habitat availability methodology: application to capercaillie ( Tetrao urogallus ) in Catalonia (NE Spain)
PY  - 2007
AB  - The loss of connectivity of forest landscapes is seriously hindering dispersal of many forest-dwelling species, which may be critical for their viability and conservation. In this context, explicitly incorporating connectivity considerations is an important challenge in current forest planning and management, but as yet there is a lack of operative methods for appropriate decision making in this respect. We describe a new methodology based on graph structures and a habitat availability index (integral index of connectivity) that integrates forest attributes (like habitat quality) and network connectivity in a single measure. We apply this methodology to examine the connectivity of the highly fragmented habitat of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) in Catalonia (NE Spain), where the threatened status of this forest bird species calls for landscape-level forest planning solutions. We analyse data on the distribution of capercaillie forest habitat at 1 km spatial resolution obtained from the recent Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas. We determine the functionally connected regions existing within its habitat distribution and identify the forest habitat areas that are more important for the maintenance of overall landscape connectivity for this species. Based on these results, we provide recommendations on certain critical public forests where management oriented to the conservation of capercaillie habitat is more necessary. These results highlight the potential and practical interest of the proposed methodology for successfully integrating landscape connectivity in broad scale forest planning.

AB  - <jats:p>This is the urban century in which, for the first time, the majority of people live in towns and cities. Understanding how people influence, and are influenced by, the 'green' component of these environments is therefore of enormous significance. Providing an overview of the essentials of urban ecology, the book begins by covering the vital background concepts of the urbanisation process and the effect that it can have on ecosystem functions and services. Later sections are devoted to examining how species respond to urbanisation, the many facets of human-ecology interactions, and the issues surrounding urban planning and the provision of urban green spaces. Drawing on examples from urban settlements around the world, it highlights the progress to date in this burgeoning field, as well as the challenges that lie ahead.</jats:p>

TI  - How does landscape structure influence landscape connectivity
PY  - 2002
AB  - We investigated the impact of landscape structure on landscape connectivity using a combination of simulation and empirical experiments. In a previous study we documented the movement behaviour of a specialized goldenrod beetle (Trirhabda borealis Blake) in three kinds of patches: habitat (goldenrod) patches and two types of matrix patch (cut vegetation and cut vegetation containing camouflage netting as an impediment to movement). In the current study, we used this information to construct simulation and experimental landscapes consisting of mosaics of these three patch types, to study the effect of landscape structure on landscape connectivity, using the T. borealis beetle as a model system. In the simulation studies, landscape connectivity was based on movements of individual beetles, and was measured in six different ways. The simulations revealed that the six measures of landscape connectivity were influenced by different aspects of landscape structure, suggesting that: (1) landscape connectivity is a poorly defined concept, and (2) the same landscape may have different landscape connectivity values when different measures of landscape connectivity are used. There were two general predictions that held over all measures of landscape connectivity: (1) increasing interpatch distance significantly decreased landscape connectivity and (2) the influence of matrix elements on landscape connectivity was small in comparison to the influence of habitat elements. Empirical mark-release-resight experiments using Trirhabda beetles in experimental landscapes supported the simulation results.

TI  - Marine population connectivity identifies ecological neighbors for conservation planning in the Coral Triangle
PY  - 2012
AB  - Robust conservation plans seek to accommodate functional connectivity by establishing regional priorities and through decisions regarding the size and placement of protected areas. In marine systems, connectivity refers to the ecological linkages (primarily larval dispersal) between populations and protected areas. Unfortunately, connectivity data for the majority of populations are unavailable, requiring managers to rely on expert knowledge and general "scale" and "distance" guidelines. We present a novel approach for integrating model-based connectivity estimates into the conservation planning framework. We quantify multispecies connectivity across the Indo-Pacific and demonstrate how this informs conservation planning in the Coral Triangle across three levels: countries, ecoregions, and priority seascapes. The emergent network structure of ecological linkages between planning regions complements the current bioregionalization across the Coral Triangle. This new ecological network perspective will help (re)define partnerships and assist in coordinating policy actions, ultimately leading to a more effective planning process.

TI  - Functional connectivity defined through cost-distance and genetic analyses: a case study for the rock-dwelling mountain vizcacha ( Lagidium viscacia ) in Patagonia, Argentina
PY  - 2007
AB  - Landscape connectivity can have profound consequences for distribution and persistence of populations and metapopulations. Evaluating functional connectivity of a landscape for a species requires a measure of dispersal rates through landscape elements at a spatial scale sufficient to encompass movement capabilities of individuals over the entire landscape. We evaluated functional connectivity for a rock-dwelling mammal, the mountain vizcacha (Lagidium viscacia), in northern Patagonia. Because of the strict association of mountain vizcachas with rocks, we hypothesized that connectivity for this species would be influenced by geology. We used molecular genetic estimates of gene flow to test spatially explicit models of connectivity created with GIS cost-distance analysis of landscape resistance to movement. We analyzed the spatial arrangement of cliffs with join counts and local k-function analyses. We did not capture and genotype individuals, but sampled at the population level through non-invasive collection of feces of mountain vizcachas. The model of landscape connectivity for mountain vizcachas based on geology was corroborated by the pattern of genetic structure, supporting the hypothesis that functional connectivity for mountain vizcachas is influenced by geology, particularly by the distribution of appropriate volcanic rocks. Analysis of spatial arrangement of cliffs indicated that occupied cliffs are clustered and confirmed that rivers act as barriers to dispersal for mountain vizcachas. Our methods could be used, within certain constraints, to study functional landscape connectivity in other organisms, and may be particularly useful for cryptic or endangered species, or those that are difficult or expensive to capture.

TI  - Evaluating the Connectivity of a Protected Areas' Network under the Prism of Global Change: The Efficiency of the European Natura 2000 Network for Four Birds of Prey
PY  - 2013
AB  - Climate and land use changes are major threats to biodiversity. To preserve biodiversity, networks of protected areas have been established worldwide, like the Natura 2000 network across the European Union (EU). Currently, this reserve network consists of more than 26000 sites covering more than 17% of EU terrestrial territory. Its efficiency to mitigate the detrimental effects of land use and climate change remains an open research question. Here, we examined the potential current and future geographical ranges of four birds of prey under scenarios of both land use and climate changes. By using graph theory, we examined how the current Natura 2000 network will perform in regard to the conservation of these species. This approach determines the importance of a site in regard to the total network and its connectivity. We found that sites becoming unsuitable due to climate change are not a random sample of the network, but are less connected and contribute less to the overall connectivity than the average site and thus their loss does not disrupt the full network. Hence, the connectivity of the remaining network changed only slightly from present day conditions. Our findings highlight the need to establish species-specific management plans with flexible conservation strategies ensuring protection under potential future range expansions. Aquila pomarina is predicted to disappear from the southern part of its range and to become restricted to northeastern Europe. Gyps fulvus, Aquila chrysaetos, and Neophron percnopterus are predicted to locally lose some suitable sites; hence, some isolated small populations may become extinct. However, their geographical range and metapopulation structure will remain relatively unaffected throughout Europe. These species would benefit more from an improved habitat quality and management of the existing network of protected areas than from increased connectivity or assisted migration.

TI  - The importance of forest patch networks for the conservation of the Thorn-tailed Rayaditos in central Chile
PY  - 2010
AB  - Conservation of forest birds in fragmented landscapes requires not only determining the critical patch characteristics influencing local population persistence but also identifying patch networks providing connectivity and suitable habitat conditions necessary to ensure regional persistence. In this study, we assessed the importance of patch attributes, patch connectivity, and network components (i.e., groups of interconnected patches) in explaining the occupancy pattern of the Thorn-tailed Rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda), a forest bird species of central Chile. Using a daily movement threshold distance, we identified a total of 16 network components of sclerophyllous forest within the study area. Among those components, patch area and vegetation structure-composition were important predictors of patch occupancy. However, the inclusion of patch connectivity and component size (i.e., the area of a network component) into the models greatly increases the models’ accuracy and parsimony. Using the best-fitted model, a total of 33 patches were predicted to be occupied by rayaditos within the study area, but such occupied patches were distributed in only six network components. These results suggest that persistence of rayaditos in central Chile requires the maintenance of large single patches and patch networks providing habitat and connectivity.

TI  - Dispersal in Small Mammals
PY  - 1980
AB  - It is not surprising that dispersal of individuals or propagules at some stage of the life cycle is a characteristic of most biological species. An organism requires some finite space in the environment from which resources neces­ sary for its survival are acquired. The size of this space may fluctuate with changes in resource availability and population density, but there exists some critical minimum space that must be maintained if the organism is to persist. Although resources within this space may be diverted into repro­ duction and the rearing of young, the continued occupancy of the parent's resource space by the offspring, or vice versa, is a threat to survival. Yet the movement of either parent or offspring away from the natal site is likely to place the disperser at risk. The dispersal of individuals can have profound effects on the genetic structure and demographic processes of a population. The movement of individuals between populations facilitates gene flow and the maintenance of genetic variability (56, 76). Since dispersal promotes the utilization of new or depopulated areas, it can facilitate the persistence of local popula­ tions and therefore the stability of the species over large geographic areas (136, 139). In spite of this, ecologists until recently have largely neglected dispersal as a demographic parameter that affects population density. This may be because we cannot distinguish between natality and immigration or

TI  - Urban land use limits regional bumble bee gene flow.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Potential declines in native pollinator communities and increased reliance on pollinator-dependent crops have raised concerns about native pollinator conservation and dispersal across human-altered landscapes. Bumble bees are one of the most effective native pollinators and are often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats, yet little is known about how bumble bees move across fine spatial scales and what landscapes promote or limit their gene flow. In this study, we examine regional genetic differentiation and fine-scale relatedness patterns of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, to investigate how current and historic habitat composition impact gene flow. We conducted our study across a landscape mosaic of natural, agricultural and urban/suburban habitats, and we show that B. vosnesenskii exhibits low but significant levels of differentiation across the study system (F(ST) = 0.019, D(est) = 0.049). Most importantly, we reveal significant relationships between pairwise F(ST) and resistance models created from contemporary land use maps. Specifically, B. vosnesenskii gene flow is most limited by commercial, industrial and transportation-related impervious cover. Finally, our fine-scale analysis reveals significant but declining relatedness between individuals at the 1-9 km spatial scale, most likely due to local queen dispersal. Overall, our results indicate that B. vosnesenskii exhibits considerable local dispersal and that regional gene flow is significantly limited by impervious cover associated with urbanization.

TI  - Contribution of private gardens to habitat availability, connectivity and conservation of the common pipistrelle in Paris
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Urban sprawl is one of the greatest global changes with major negative impacts on biodiversity. Recent policies have acknowledged the value of urban green areas in counterbalancing such impacts. However, these policies are largely focused on public green areas, ignoring the role and potential of private green areas for urban ecological value. This paper aims at evaluating the importance of private gardens for habitat availability and connectivity in Paris, France, using the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) as model species. We hypothesize that public green areas contribute more to habitat availability than private gardens because of their large area, and that private gardens contribute more to connectivity than public green areas because of their scattered locations in the city. Using data on common pipistrelle activity and information on vegetation and building height, we quantify the respective contribution of public green areas and private gardens in the bat habitat availability and connectivity. Our results show that despite the low proportion of private green areas in Paris (36% of the total green areas), they still contributed up to 47.9% of bat habitat availability and decrease the resistance of the city matrix by 57%. The distribution in the city matrix and vegetation composition of those areas appeared especially beneficial for bat habitat availability and connectivity. The study demonstrates the importance of private gardens in the ecological value of cities in complementing public green areas. Our results confirm the need to develop more inclusive urban conservation strategies that include both public and private stakeholders.

TI  - Larval Dispersal and Marine Population Connectivity
PY  - 2009
AB  - Connectivity, or the exchange of individuals among marine populations, is a central topic in marine ecology. For most benthic marine species with complex life cycles, this exchange occurs primarily during the pelagic larval stage. The small size of larvae coupled with the vast and complex fluid environment they occupy hamper our ability to quantify dispersal and connectivity. Evidence from direct and indirect approaches using geochemical and genetic techniques suggests that populations range from fully open to fully closed. Understanding the biophysical processes that contribute to observed dispersal patterns requires integrated interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate high-resolution biophysical modeling and empirical data. Further, differential postsettlement survival of larvae may add complexity to measurements of connectivity. The degree to which populations self recruit or receive subsidy from other populations has consequences for a number of fundamental ecological processes that affect population regulation and persistence. Finally, a full understanding of population connectivity has important applications for management and conservation.

TI  - An Experimental Assessment of Landscape Connectivity
PY  - 1998
AB  - We experimentally assess the relative movement abilities of two sympatric, ecologically similar species of damselfly, Calopteryx maculata and Calopteryx aequabilis (Odonata: Calopterygidae), within two structurally dissimilar habitat types, forest and pasture. For both species, streams are required resources, forest is a potential resource, and pasture is neutral habitat. Experimental manipulations were conducted at a spatial scale approaching typical inter-stream distances within our study region. A portion of the individuals was displaced away from its required stream habitat within its native landscape, and the remaining individuals were transferred to another landscape of alternate habitat structure (either forest or pasture). Within each habitat type we equate relative movement ability, an essential component of landscape connectivity, with the proportion of displaced individuals observed to have reached the stream, as measured against reobservation rates of control individuals released at the stream. We found that C. maculata, the species more consistent in its use of forest as a resource, moved significantly more readily through 700 m of pasture habitat than through the same distance of forest, while C. aequabilis moved with equal abilities through both habitat types. Historical behavior - whether or not the individuals typically used forest as a resource before the manipulations did not have a statistically significant effect on the movement abilities of individuals of either species in either habitat type. There was, however, some evidence that C. maculata individuals native to non-forested landscapes moved more readily through forest than their forest-inhabiting counterparts. Both sexes moved with equal abilities irrespective of habitat type, but male C. aequabilis moved with greater ability through forest than females, while the reverse was true within pasture landscapes.

TI  - Toward ecologically scaled landscape indices.
PY  - 2001
AB  - abstract: Nature conservation is increasingly based on a landscape approach rather than a species approach. Landscape planning that includes nature conservation goals requires integrated ecological tools. However, species differ widely in their response to landscape change. We propose a framework of ecologically scaled landscape indices that takes into account this variation. Our approach is based on a combination of field studies of spatially structured populations (metapopulations) and model simulations in artificial landscapes. From these, we seek generalities in the relationship among species features, landscape indices, and metapopulation viability. The concept of ecological species profiles is used to group species according to characteristics that are important in metapopulations' response to landscape change: individual area requirements as the dominant characteristic of extinction risk in landscape patches and dispersal distance as the main determinant of the ability to colonize patches.

TI  - Construction of Cooling Corridors with Multiscenarios on Urban Scale: A Case Study of Shenzhen
PY  - 2020
AB  - Under the background of rapid urbanization, the urban heat island (UHI) effect is becoming increasingly significant. It is very important for the sustainable development of cities to carry out quantitative research on the mitigation of the UHI effect at an urban scale. Taking Shenzhen as an example, this paper puts forward a method for building a cooling corridor for the city with multiscenarios based on the theory of ecological security pattern (ESP), which can realize quantitative planning of the spatial layout of urban green infrastructure (UGI) to alleviate the UHI effect. In this study, cooling sources are identified from the three dimensions of habitat quality, landscape connectivity, and the capacity to provide cooling ecosystem services. The cooling corridors that are superior at cooling, isolation, and ventilation are selected and optimized. The results show that the identified ecological cooling source area accounts for 33.18% of the total area of Shenzhen, and more than 85% of the area falls within the scope of the basic ecological control line of Shenzhen. There are 48 cooling corridors with a total length of 289.17 km in the cooling priority scenario, which mostly pass through the high-temperature and subhigh-temperature areas of each administrative region and city, providing a good cooling effect but poor feasibility. There are 48 corridors with a total length of 326.66 km in the isolation priority scenario, which mostly pass through the administrative region boundary and have a weak connection with the urban heat island, avoiding the built-up areas with strong human activities. As consequence, cooling is relatively achievable, but its effect is not ideal. There are 47 corridors with a total length of 368.06 km in the ventilation priority scenario, including many urban main roads and river systems that fully utilize the area’s strong natural wind conditions and realize various functions; however, the cooling effect is suboptimal. Corridors with great potential in cooling, isolation, ventilation, and noise reduction were determined after comprehensive optimization.

TI  - Maximum entropy modeling of species geographic distributions
PY  - 2006
AB  - The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species’ range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Trends and missing parts in the study of movement ecology
PY  - 2008
AB  - Movement is important to all organisms, and accordingly it is addressed in a huge number of papers in the literature. Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34% focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement.

TI  - LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY: A GRAPH‐THEORETIC PERSPECTIVE
PY  - 2001
AB  - Ecologists are familiar with two data structures commonly used to represent landscapes. Vector-based maps delineate land cover types as polygons, while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure, the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (e.g., habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally (e.g., via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields, including geography (transportation networks, routing ap- plications, siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization). We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes, focusing especially on applications of metapo- pulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct, the minimum spanning tree, can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape con- nectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the

Land-cover pattern is classified as 'perforated,' 'edge,' 'patch,' and 'core' with higher spatial precision and the- matic accuracy compared to a previous approach based on image convolution, while retaining the capability to label these features at the pixel level for any scale of observation. The implementation of morphological image processing is explained and then demonstrated, with comparisons to results from image convolution, for a forest map of the Val Grande National Park in North Italy.

TI  - Urban evolution comes into its own: Emerging themes and future directions of a burgeoning field
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization has recently emerged as an exciting new direction for evolutionary research founded on our growing understanding of rapid evolution paired with the expansion of novel urban habitats. Urbanization can influence adaptive and nonadaptive evolution in urban-dwelling species, but generalized patterns and the predictability of urban evolutionary responses within populations remain unclear. This editorial introduces the special feature "Evolution in Urban Environments" and addresses four major emerging themes, which include: (a) adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity via physiological responses to urban climate, (b) adaptive evolution via phenotype-environment relationships in urban habitats, (c) population connectivity and genetic drift in urban landscapes, and (d) human-wildlife interactions in urban spaces. Here, we present the 16 articles (12 empirical, 3 review, 1 capstone) within this issue and how they represent each of these four emerging themes in urban evolutionary biology. Finally, we discuss how these articles address previous questions and have now raised new ones, highlighting important new directions for the field.

TI  - Forest species in an agricultural landscape in The Netherlands: effects of habitat fragmentation
PY  - 1997
AB  - For 312 forest patches on sandy soils in the Netherlands, effects of fragmentation are studied of forest habitat in the past on the present occurrence of forest plato species. Using regression techniques, the numbers of forest edge, interior, zoochorous and anemochorous species, as well as occurrence of 24 individual species were related to patch area and connectivity measures. Connectivity was defined as the amount of forest habitat around patches within three zones up to 1000 m. Plant categories were distinguished by habitat type anti dispersal mechanism. The results showed that number of total species and number of species of all habitat and dispersal categories increased with area. The occurrence of ten individually studied species were also positively related to area. Most of them were interior species. The number of zoochorous species increased with increasing connectivity. Also occurrence of ten individually studied species were affected by connectivity. Interior zoochorous species showed the highest percentage of affected species. The relationship of interior, animal-dispersed plants to connectivity can be explained by the limited distances covered by their dispersal agents (forest birds and ants) in a non-forest habitat. Also, some anemochorous plants appeared to be affected by connectivity, especially those with heavy seeds and potentially short distance dispersal. As not all species within a certain dispersal or habitat category react similar to area or isolation, it is suggested that differences in underlying processes of fragmentation such as local extinction and colonization need more focus.

TI  - Urban Ecological Corridor Network Construction: An Integration of the Least Cost Path Model and the InVEST Model
PY  - 2020
AB  - Under the background of urban expansion, ecological protection cannot be delayed. The construction of ecological networks is of considerable significance to ecosystem services. However, in the process of constructing a corridor network, there is no uniform standard for the selection of ecological sources and the determination of cost factors. The InVEST model is an effective complement to ecosystem service assessment for sensitively measuring external threats and their threat intensity. Therefore, taking Wuhan as an example, we combined InVEST and the least cost path model (LCP) to construct a multi-target corridor network with comprehensive cost factors for birds and small terrestrial mammals. The results showed that: (1) The InVEST model provided a reliable basis for ecological source screening by demonstrating the distribution of habitat quality. (2) The corridor with a length of 12–25 km presented a “U” shape, and the impact of urbanization on small terrestrial mammals was more significant than that of birds. (3) The integrated network pattern proposed by the “point-line-plane” principle would provide a reference for urban ecological construction and sustainable development.

TI  - Urban Landscape Genetics: Are Biologists Keeping Up with the Pace of Urbanization?
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization has the potential to jeopardize the sustainability of populations of organisms living within and dispersing across urban areas. Landscape genetics approaches offer a great promise for quantifying how urban features affect ecological and evolutionary processes for species living within and around cities. In this review, we assess the current state (2015–2020) of urban landscape genetics research, examining what types of urban features are quantified, what genetic measures are used, what species are studied, and in which geographic regions they are conducted. We then make recommendations for future research. We identified relatively few landscape genetic studies conducted within urban areas published in the last 5 years. We also found a publication bias towards certain taxa and geographic regions (mainly mammals studied in North America), based on results from relatively few molecular markers. These studies used varied measures of urbanization in their analysis, but the most common was urban land use/land cover measured at different resolutions, followed by buildings/development and transportation infrastructure (roads, railroads, and tramways). The results of these studies reflect previously conducted urban research findings that urban features may inhibit, facilitate, or have no correlation with gene flow, usually a product of which focal taxa is being studied, as well as what urban features are present/measured within variable cityscapes. We urge future research to directly measure urban features and stress the need for explicitly sampling within and around urban areas to gain full understanding of whether urbanization impedes, facilitates, or does not affect genetic differentiation between populations. To facilitate the development of robust theory, we urge the formation of a global network of urban landscape geneticists to collaborate and sample diverse taxa, in varied global landscapes and climates, and analyze genome-wide datasets for more robust conclusions about gene flow and genetic diversity. We advocate for analyzing urban features at multiple scales to allow broad conclusions about the effects of urbanization across studies, taxa, and regions. Finally, we recommend that study designs include social, cultural, and economic differences in human land use, which have the potential to affect how species disperse, survive, and reproduce in urban areas. Taking these factors into account, we can make novel advances in understanding how complex urban landscapes shape contemporary evolution.

TI  - Effects of landscape context on mammal richness in the urban forest mosaic of EThekwini Municipality, Durban, South Africa
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract The loss and fragmentation of natural habitats is a major threat to biodiversity globally. In fragmented landscapes, species are not only affected by patch-level attributes but also by the influence of the whole mosaic of landscape elements surrounding habitat patches. Therefore, it is important to understand the simultaneous effects of local and landscape-level attributes on biodiversity. In this study, we determined the influence of landscape context on species richness of forest mammals in an urban-forest mosaic of the EThekwini Municipality Area, Durban, South Africa. We determined presence/absence of mammals in 28 patches using remote-triggered camera traps over two sampling periods. We applied generalised linear modelling within an information-theoretic framework to quantify the effects of within-patch, isolation, matrix, and landscape level attributes on species richness. The results showed the importance of landscape context for occurrence patterns of mammals in fragmented landscapes. In particular, they showed that patch size, shape complexity, habitat amount in the immediate environment, habitat proximity and road density were the most important factors influencing mammalian richness patterns. Overall, the results stressed the importance of habitat area (patch size, habitat amount in the immediate environment, and habitat proximity) and its spatial configuration to faunal preservation and suggest that management efforts in this landscape should be aimed at protecting fragments from further loss and disturbance and matrix improvement to increase landscape connectivity.

TI  - Diffusion in Fractcal Landscapes: Simulations and Experimental Studies of Tenebrionid Beetle Movements
PY  - 1992
AB  - Organismal movement is frequently treated as a diffusion process arising from a simple random walk in a spatially uniform environment. However, anomalous diffusion may arise due to: (1) intrinsic departures from random movements of individuals; or (2) the effects of barriers that impede, or corridors that facilitate, movement. We examine anomalous diffusion in field studies of Eleodes beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and in simulations of correlated random walks on maps of real and artificial landscapes. We show how diffusion alternates between ordinary and anomalous diffusion depending on movement rules, landscape pattern, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Recent theories of diffusion in spatially complex media predict power law relations for anomalous diffusion. Over time scales of 5-500 s, Eleodes exhibited power laws for: (1) mean squared displacement with time; and (2) the mean time to travel from the center to the perimeter of circles of various radii. In grasslands, diffusion exponents changed significantly at a radius of 42 cm, which characterized the size of grass and bare soil patches. A second change in diffusion at scales of 24-600 h characterized home range activity. Marked discrepancies between the dynamics of beetles in the field and in simulations suggest a needmore » for more comprehensive models of individual movement that use different rules for various domains of space and time. Studies of anomalous diffusion identify the relative effects of environment vs. innate behavior and reveal a range of scales over which the effects pertain. 41 refs., 12 figs., 4 tabs.« less

TI  - Mapping landscape corridors
PY  - 2007
AB  - Corridors are important geographic features for biological conservation and biodiversity assessment. The identification and mapping of corridors is usually based on visual interpretations of movement patterns (functional corridors) or habitat maps (structural corridors). We present a method for automated corridor mapping with morphological image processing, and demonstrate the approach with a forest map derived from satellite imagery of northern Slovakia. We show how the approach can be used to differentiate between relativelynarrow (‘line’) and wide (‘strip’) structural corridors by mapping corridors at multiple scales of observation, and indicate how to map functional corridors with maps of observedor simulated organism movement. An application to environmental reporting is demonstrated by assessing structural forest corridors in relation to forest types in northern Slovakia. # 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Behavior of Landscape Metrics Commonly Used in the Study of Habitat Fragmentation
PY  - 1998
AB  - A meaningful interpretation of landscape metrics is possible only when the limitations of each measure are fully understood, the range of attainable values is known, and the user is aware of potential shifts in the range of values due to characteristics of landscape patches. To examine the behavior of landscape metrics, we generated artificial landscapes that mimicked fragmentation processes while controlling the size and shape of patches in the landscape and the mode of disturbance growth. We developed nine series of increasingly fragmented landscapes and used these to investigate the behavior of edge density, contagion, mean nearest neighbor distance, mean proximity index, perimeter-area fractal dimension, and mass fractal dimension. We found that most of the measures were highly correlated, especially contagion and edge density, which had a near-perfect inverse correspondence. Many of the measures were linearly-associated with increasing disturbance until the proportion of disturbance on the landscape was approximately 0.40, with non-linear associations at higher proportions. None of the measures was able to differentiate between landscape patterns characterized by dispersed versus aggregated patches. The highest attainable value of each measure was altered by either patch size or shape, and in some cases, by both attributes. We summarize our findings by discussing the utility of each metric.

TI  - Global patterns of fragmentation and connectivity of mammalian carnivore habitat
PY  - 2011
AB  - Although mammalian carnivores are vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and require landscape connectivity, their global patterns of fragmentation and connectivity have not been examined. We use recently developed high-resolution habitat suitability models to conduct comparative analyses and to identify global hotspots of fragmentation and connectivity for the world's terrestrial carnivores. Species with less fragmentation (i.e. more interior high-quality habitat) had larger geographical ranges, a greater proportion of habitat within their range, greater habitat connectivity and a lower risk of extinction. Species with higher connectivity (i.e. less habitat isolation) also had a greater proportion of high-quality habitat, but had smaller, not larger, ranges, probably reflecting shorter distances between habitat patches for species with restricted distributions; such species were also more threatened, as would be expected given the negative relationship between range size and extinction risk. Fragmentation and connectivity did not differ among Carnivora families, and body mass was associated with connectivity but not fragmentation. On average, only 54.3 per cent of a species' geographical range comprised high-quality habitat, and more troubling, only 5.2 per cent of the range comprised such habitat within protected areas. Identification of global hotspots of fragmentation and connectivity will help guide strategic priorities for carnivore conservation.

TI  - Divergent Perspectives on Landscape Connectivity Reveal Consistent Effects from Genes to Communities
PY  - 2016
AB  - Landscape connectivity is increasingly emphasized due to its relevance for interpreting effects of environmental change. Yet substantial uncertainty remains regarding the quantification of connectivity and the extent to which connectivity influences biodiversity. We review and synthesize 370 articles published since 2005 on the quantification and effects of landscape connectivity on biodiversity. We find a notable change in the quantification of connectivity from structural to functional approaches, a rise in network approaches, and a decline in approaches based on metapopulation theory. Most studies (54 %) did not test for the effects of connectivity, but of those that did, 91 % found effects on biodiversity, with over five times as many positive as negative effects reported. These effects were largely consistent across levels of biological organization, despite diverse perspectives on movement and connectivity across these domains. Nevertheless, we argue that several outstanding issues need to be addressed to advance our understanding of the effects of connectivity and its importance for conservation. These issues include the need for greater emphasis on estimating connectivity effects, explicitly incorporating the problem of scale, capturing impacts of movement processes relevant to different levels of organization, proper accounting of uncertainty, and isolating connectivity effects relative to other issues influencing biodiversity.

TI  - Rebuilding Resilience in the Sahel: Regreening in the Maradi and Zinder Regions of Niger
PY  - 2011
AB  - The societies and ecosystems of the Nigerien Sahel appeared increasingly vulnerable to climatic and eonomic uncertainty in the late twentieth century. Severe episodes of drought and famine drove massiv livestock losses and human migration and mortality. Soil erosion and tree loss reduced a woodland to a scrub steppe and fed a myth of the Sahara desert relentlessly advancing southward. Over the past two decades this myth has been shattered by the dramatic reforestation of more than 5 million hectares in the Maradi and Zinder Regions of Niger. No single actor, policy, or practice appear beind this successful regreening of the Sahel. Multiple actors, institutions and processes operated at different levels, times, and scales to initiate and sustain this reforestation trend. We used systems analysis to examine the patterns of interaction as biophysical, livelihood, and governance indicator changed relative to one another during forest decline and rebound. It appears that forest decline was reversed when critical interventions helped to shift the direction of reinforcing feedbacks, e.g.,vicious cycles changed to virtuous ones. Reversals toward de-forestation or reforestation were preceded by institutional changes in governance, then livelihoods and eventually in the biophysical environent. Biophysical change sustained change in the other two domains until interventions introduced new ideas and institutions that slowed and then reversed the pattern of feedbacks. However, while society seems better at coping with economic or climatic shock or stress, the resilience of society and natue in the Maradi/Zinder region to global sources of uncertainty remains a pressing question in a society with one of the highest population growth rates on Earth.

TI  - Confronting a biome crisis: global disparities of habitat loss and protection
PY  - 2004
AB  - Human impacts on the natural environment have reached such proportions that in addition to an extinction crisis, we now also face a broader biome crisis. Here we identify the world’s terrestrial biomes and, at a finer spatial scale, ecoregions in which biodiversity and ecological function are at greatest risk because of extensive habitat conversion and limited habitat protection. Habitat conversion exceeds habitat protection by a ratio of 8 : 1 in temperate grasslands and Mediterranean biomes, and 10 : 1 in more than 140 ecoregions. These regions include some of the most biologically distinctive, species rich ecosystems on Earth, as well as the last home of many threatened and endangered species. Confronting the biome crisis requires a concerted and comprehensive response aimed at protecting not only species, but the variety of landscapes, ecological interactions, and evolutionary pressures that sustain biodiversity, generate ecosystem services, and evolve new species in the future.

TI  - Least‐cost path analysis for urban greenways planning: A test with moths and birds across two habitats and two cities
PY  - 2020
AB  - 1.One of the major planning tools to respond to urban landscape fragmentation is the development of ecological corridors, that is, interconnected networks of urban green and blue spaces. Least‐cost paths (LCP) appear to be an easy and appropriate resistance‐based modelling method to respond to urban planners’ needs. However, the ecological validation of urban corridors using LCP is rarely performed and needs to be generalized to different species, habitats and cities.2.We developed an experimental design to test the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts that facilitate individual movements compared to movements in less connecting landscape contexts. We deliberately assigned LCP analysis parameters based on the scientific literature and expert knowledge to test a method potentially easy to use for urban stakeholders. To extend the validation, we applied our LCP model to two biological taxa with different habitat requirements: grassland‐dwelling moths and forest‐dwelling passerines, and to two medium‐sized cities.3.We used mark–release–recapture (MRR) methods for moths and playback recall protocols for passerines to compare the patterns of individual movement between two contrasted connectivity contexts determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. MRR protocol estimated movement rates between herbaceous patches and the two contrasted connectivity contexts. Playback recall protocol consisted in attracting individuals from wooded patches to the two contrasted connectivity contexts. A movement was considered facilitated, when displacement was rapidly engaged and individuals moved a long distance from their wooded patch.4.Moth and passerine movement patterns differed between the two connectivity contexts: moth recapture rates were higher in highly connecting contexts than in less connecting contexts. For passerine birds, responses to playback recalls were faster and movement distance longer in highly connecting contexts. All results support the hypothesis that both taxa were more prone to move in corridors modelled by LCP.5.Synthesis and applications. The convergence of the results for different biological models and across cities strengthens the relevance of LCP analysis for planning urban greenways and provides guidelines for landscape planners in the development of these corridors to favour the movement and survival of multiple urban species.

TI  - Improving Adherence and Clinical Outcomes in Self-Guided Internet Treatment for Anxiety and Depression: Randomised Controlled Trial
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background Depression and anxiety are common, disabling and chronic. Self-guided internet-delivered treatments are popular, but few people complete them. New strategies are required to realise their potential. Aims To evaluate the effect of automated emails on the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of a new automated transdiagnostic self-guided internet-delivered treatment, the Wellbeing Course, for people with depression and anxiety. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted through the website: www.ecentreclinic.org. Two hundred and fifty seven people with elevated symptoms were randomly allocated to the 8 week course either with or without automated emails, or to a waitlist control group. Primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7). Results Participants in the treatment groups had lower PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores at post-treatment than controls. Automated emails increased rates of course completion (58% vs. 35%), and improved outcomes in a subsample with elevated symptoms. Conclusions The new self-guided course was beneficial, and automated emails facilitated outcomes. Further attention to strategies that facilitate adherence, learning, and safety will help realise the potential of self-guided interventions.

TI  - Effects of experimental habitat fragmentation and connectivity on root vole demography
PY  - 1999
AB  - Summary 1. We used a factorial experimental design to test whether habitat fragmentation (two different fragment sizes) and connectivity (presence and absence of corridors between small fragments) affected population growth rate and two conventional measures of the demographic structure (proportion of reproductive adults and sex ratio) in 12 enclosed populations of root voles. 2. Because the matriline has been suggested to be a functional entity affecting the demography of Microtus populations, we employed a study protocol (including laboratory-raised founder animals and intensive live trapping combined with fluorescent powder techniques), which enabled us to track the matrilineal genealogy in the populations. Thus, the effect of habitat structure on the matrilineal structure of the populations, quantified by the Shannon–Wiener diversity index, could be tested for the first time. 3. Population growth rate was density dependent, but neither this population parameter nor sex ratio and proportion of reproductive adults differed between the habitat treatments. This was unexpected since the presumed determinants of Microtus demography, such as individual space use, dispersal distances and spatio-social organization had earlier been found to differ between the treatments. 4. The matrilineal structure (diversity) of the populations changed in response to the experimental habitat manipulations. In corridor-connected systems, some matrilines became numerically dominant, which lead to reduced matrilineal diversity compared to systems with isolated habitat fragments. We hypothesize that some matrilines were able to colonize and exploit corridor-connected fragments better than other matrilines. Matrilineal diversity was not related to any other demographic attribute (growth rate, sex ratio and functional stage structure) at the population level. 5. Our results suggest that fragmentation-induced changes of individual and matrilineal level attributes do not necessarily propagate into population level differences in vital rates. The notion that matrilines may be a functional entity in Microtus populations could not be supported. 6. Our experimental results suggest that population genetics, more than population demography, may be sensitive to habitat fragmentation and connectivity, within the specific temporal and spatial extent explored. In particular, the effect of corridors on matrilineal diversity imply that population genetic studies based on mtDNA markers should consider habitat connectivity when analysing genetic diversity.

TI  - Uncertainty analysis of least-cost modeling for designing wildlife linkages
PY  - 2009
AB  - Least-cost models for focal species are widely used to design wildlife corridors. To evaluate the least-cost modeling approach used to develop 15 linkage designs in southern California, USA, we assessed robustness of the largest and least constrained linkage. Species experts parameterized models for eight species with weights for four habitat factors (land cover, topographic position, elevation, road density) and resistance values for each class within a factor (e.g., each class of land cover). Each model produced a proposed corridor for that species. We examined the extent to which uncertainty in factor weights and class resistance values affected two key conservation-relevant outputs, namely, the location and modeled resistance to movement of each proposed corridor. To do so, we compared the proposed corridor to 13 alternative corridors created with parameter sets that spanned the plausible ranges of biological uncertainty in these parameters. Models for five species were highly robust (mean overlap 88%, little or no increase in resistance). Although the proposed corridors for the other three focal species overlapped as little as 0% (mean 58%) of the alternative corridors, resistance in the proposed corridors for these three species was rarely higher than resistance in the alternative corridors (mean difference was 0.025 on a scale of 1- 10; worst difference was 0.39). As long as the model had the correct rank order of resistance values and factor weights, our results suggest that the predicted corridor is robust to uncertainty. The three carnivore focal species, alone or in combination, were not effective umbrellas for the other focal species. The carnivore corridors failed to overlap the predicted corridors of most other focal species and provided relatively high resistance for the other focal species (mean increase of 2.7 resistance units). Least-cost modelers should conduct uncertainty analysis so that decision-makers can appreciate the potential impact of model uncertainty on conservation decisions. Our approach to uncertainty analysis (which can be called a worst-case scenario approach) is appropriate for complex models in which distribution of the input parameters cannot be specified.

TI  - Use of Linkage Mapping and Centrality Analysis Across Habitat Gradients to Conserve Connectivity of Gray Wolf Populations in Western North America
PY  - 2011
AB  - Centrality metrics evaluate paths between all possible pairwise combinations of sites on a landscape to rank the contribution of each site to facilitating ecological flows across the network of sites. Computational advances now allow application of centrality metrics to landscapes represented as continuous gradients of habitat quality. This avoids the binary classification of landscapes into patch and matrix required by patch-based graph analyses of connectivity. It also avoids the focus on delineating paths between individual pairs of core areas characteristic of most corridor- or linkage-mapping methods of connectivity analysis. Conservation of regional habitat connectivity has the potential to facilitate recovery of the gray wolf (Canis lupus), a species currently recolonizing portions of its historic range in the western United States. We applied 3 contrasting linkage-mapping methods (shortest path, current flow, and minimum-cost-maximum-flow) to spatial data representing wolf habitat to analyze connectivity between wolf populations in central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming). We then applied 3 analogous betweenness centrality metrics to analyze connectivity of wolf habitat throughout the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada to determine where it might be possible to facilitate range expansion and interpopulation dispersal. We developed software to facilitate application of centrality metrics. Shortest-path betweenness centrality identified a minimal network of linkages analogous to those identified by least-cost-path corridor mapping. Current flow and minimum-cost-maximum-flow betweenness centrality identified diffuse networks that included alternative linkages, which will allow greater flexibility in planning. Minimum-cost-maximum-flow betweenness centrality, by integrating both land cost and habitat capacity, allows connectivity to be considered within planning processes that seek to maximize species protection at minimum cost. Centrality analysis is relevant to conservation and landscape genetics at a range of spatial extents, but it may be most broadly applicable within single- and multispecies planning efforts to conserve regional habitat connectivity.

TI  - The Biological Deserts Fallacy: Cities in Their Landscapes Contribute More than We Think to Regional Biodiversity
PY  - 2021
AB  - Cities are both embedded within and ecologically linked to their surrounding landscapes. Although urbanization poses a substantial threat to biodiversity, cities also support many species, some of which have larger populations, faster growth rates, and higher productivity in cities than outside of them. Despite this fact, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the potentially beneficial links between cities and their surroundings. We identify five pathways by which cities can benefit regional ecosystems by releasing species from threats in the larger landscape, increasing regional habitat heterogeneity and genetic diversity, acting as migratory stopovers, preadapting species to climate change, and enhancing public engagement and environmental stewardship. Increasing recognition of these pathways could help cities identify effective strategies for supporting regional biodiversity conservation and could provide a science-based platform for incorporating biodiversity alongside other urban greening goals.

TI  - Dispersal functions and spatial models: expanding our dispersal toolbox
PY  - 2000
AB  - A brief review of recent metapopulation literature indicates that dispersal functions are generally highly simplified. We suggest that this oversight can often make the results of such models misleading. A number of factors are considered that can affect the patterns and functions of this potentially complex process, including conditional and “intel-ligent” dispersal, and dispersal distance. If a system is to be considered in spatially explicit terms then dispersal is an essential component. It follows therefore that a more thorough consideration of this fundamental population process is to be encouraged.

TI  - Use of empirically derived source-destination models to map regional conservation corridors
PY  - 2008
AB  - The ability of populations to be connected across large landscapes via dispersal is critical to long-term viability for many species. One means to mitigate population isolation is the protection of movement corridors among habitat patches. Nevertheless, the utility of small, narrow, linear features as habitat corridors has been hotly debated. Here, we argue that analysis of movement across continuously resistant landscapes allows a shift to a broader consideration of how landscape patterns influence connectivity at scales relevant to conservation. We further argue that this change in scale and definition of the connectivity problem improves one's ability to find solutions and may help resolve long-standing disputes regarding scale and definition of movement corridors and their importance to population connectivity. We used a new method that combines empirically derived landscape-resistance maps and least-cost path analysis between multiple source and destination locations to assess habitat isolation and identify corridors and barriers to organism movement. Specifically, we used a genetically based landscape resistance model for American black bears (Ursus americanus) to identify major movement corridors and barriers to population connectivity between Yellowstone National Park and the Canadian border. Even though western Montana and northern Idaho contain abundant public lands and the largest wilderness areas in the contiguous United States, moving from the Canadian border to Yellowstone Park along those paths indicated by modeled gene flow required bears to cross at least 6 potential barriers. Our methods are generic and can be applied to virtually any species for which reliable maps of landscape resistance can be developed.

TI  - Effects of habitat fragmentation on the red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris L.
PY  - 1990
AB  - The effects of woodlot size and isolation, in relation to habitat fragmentation, on the distribution of the red squirrel were studied. In The Netherlands, 50 woodlots (0.55–13.78 ha) were surveyed in an agricultural landscape for the presence of red squirrel. In 26 woodlots squirrel dreys (nests) were found. Logit regression analysis showed that woodlot size and the area per woodlot covered with coniferous trees were the best predictors of squirrel presence. Addition of isolation variables by means of a stepwise forward regression method showed significant effects of the distance to a large, permanently inhabited wood and the amount of surrounding wood. No effect was found for the distance to the nearest woodlot (>0.5 ha). The model could be further improved by adding a measure of the amount of hedgerows surrounding a woodlot.

TI  - Use of resistance surfaces for landscape genetic studies: considerations for parameterization and analysis
PY  - 2010
AB  - Measures of genetic structure among individuals or populations collected at different spatial locations across a landscape are commonly used as surrogate measures of functional (i.e. demographic or genetic) connectivity. In order to understand how landscape characteristics influence functional connectivity, resistance surfaces are typically created in a raster GIS environment. These resistance surfaces represent hypothesized relationships between landscape features and gene flow, and are based on underlying biological functions such as relative abundance or movement probabilities in different land cover types. The biggest challenge for calculating resistance surfaces is assignment of resistance values to different landscape features. Here, we first identify study objectives that are consistent with the use of resistance surfaces and critically review the various approaches that have been used to parameterize resistance surfaces and select optimal models in landscape genetics. We then discuss the biological assumptions and considerations that influence analyses using resistance surfaces, such as the relationship between gene flow and dispersal, how habitat suitability may influence animal movement, and how resistance surfaces can be translated into estimates of functional landscape connectivity. Finally, we outline novel approaches for creating optimal resistance surfaces using either simulation or computational methods, as well as alternatives to resistance surfaces (e.g. network and buffered paths). These approaches have the potential to improve landscape genetic analyses, but they also create new challenges. We conclude that no single way of using resistance surfaces is appropriate for every situation. We suggest that researchers carefully consider objectives, important biological assumptions and available parameterization and validation techniques when planning landscape genetic studies.

TI  - Evolution of Migration Rate in a Spatially Realistic Metapopulation Model
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract: We use an individual‐based, spatially realistic metapopulation model to study the evolution of migration rate. We first explore the consequences of habitat change in hypothetical patch networks on a regular lattice. If the primary consequence of habitat change is an increase in local extinction risk as a result of decreased local population sizes, migration rate increases. A nonmonotonic response, with migration rate decreasing at high extinction rate, was obtained only by assuming very frequent catastrophes. If the quality of the matrix habitat deteriorates, leading to increased mortality during migration, the evolutionary response is more complex. As long as habitat patch occupancy does not decrease markedly with increased migration mortality, reduced migration rate evolves. However, once mortality becomes so high that empty patches remain uncolonized for a long time, evolution tends to increase migration rate, which may lead to an “evolutionary rescue” in a fragmented landscape.

TI  - Finding habitat patches and directional connectivity
PY  - 2003
AB  - For animal species inhabiting patchy environments, the search behavior of individuals and the distance from which they can detect suitable habitat (perceptual range) are key determinants of the functional connectivity of landscapes. We examined the movement behavior and perceptual range of adult cactus bugs (Chelinidea vittiger), which are habitat specialists that feed and reproduce on Opuntia cactus. Movement pathways of walking individuals released into unsuitable matrix habitat (30-3000 m from Opuntia) were highly directional. These results supported predictions of optimal search behavior from published simulation models. A release experiment within natural patch networks indicated that the perceptual range of C. vittiger depended on size of the target patch, matrix structure, and direction of the target patch relative to prevailing winds. A strong effect of wind direction on orientation behavior (and presumed perceptual range) was evident in a release experiment using 'artificial' patches of potted Opuntia. In these two experiments, individuals released 50--100 cm from Opuntia patches were more likely to orientate toward patches located upwind than to those located crosswind or downwind. A reexamination of the pathways of individuals walking in the matrix also revealed a strong bias for movement upwind. Such upwind movement by individuals, both within and outside of patch networks, suggests that C. vittiger uses olfaction to navigate and it complicates our ability to interpret search behavior and to estimate perceptual range. Current techniques for assessing perceptual range have limitations for olfactory-based species. Furthermore, we need to broaden our view of perceptual range and of patch and landscape connectivity. Perceptual range may be anisotropic and connectivity may be directional. An organism-based approach to spatial ecology requires that we consider the dominant senses used by species when navigating around patchy landscapes.

TI  - Are hedgerows the route to increased farmland small mammal density? Use of hedgerows in British pastoral habitats
PY  - 2007
AB  - Linear habitats are becoming increasingly common as a consequence of habitat fragmentation, and may provide the sole habitat for some species. Hedgerows are linear features that can vary substantially in structure and quality. Having surveyed 180 hedgerows, in four locations, and sampled their small mammal communities we examined the effect of physical hedgerow attributes on the abundance of small mammal species. Using three elements of landscape structure, we explored whether variation was best explained by the Random Sample Hypothesis (that small islands represent a random sample of those species populating larger areas), or by the Fragmentation Hypothesis (that species abundance will decrease with a loss of habitat area). We tested the relationship between the relative abundance of small mammals and 1. hedgerow connectivity; 2. total habitat availability and 3. local habitat complexity. We then explored the predictive power of combinations of these habitat variables. Connectivity was a positive predictor of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus, and hedgerow gappiness was a negative predictor of bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus. The total amount of habitat available (hedgerow width, height and length) was a positive indicator of total small mammal biomass. These results support the Fragmentation Hypothesis that species abundance and distribution decrease with a loss of habitat area. The preservation of linear and associated habitats may therefore be important in maintaining metapopulations of the species we studied.

TI  - Animal movements and population dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes
PY  - 1992
AB  - Organisms respond to environmental heterogeneity at different scales and in different ways. These differences are consequences of how the movement characteristics of animals—their movement rates, directionality, turning frequencies, and turning angles—interact with patch and boundary features in landscape mosaics. The interactions of movement patterns with landscape features in turn produce spatial patterns in individual space-use, population dynamics and dispersion, gene flow, and the redistribution of nutrients and other materials. We describe several theoretical approaches for modeling the diffusion, foraging behavior, and population dynamics of animals in heterogeneous landscapes, including: (1) scaling relationships derived from percolation theory and fractal geometry, (2) extensions of traditional patch-based metapopulation models, and (3) individual-based, spatially explicit models governed by local rules. We conclude by emphasizing the need to couple theoretical models with empirical studies and the usefulness of ‘microlandscape’ investigations.

TI  - Effects of habitat fragment size and isolation on the density and genetics of urban red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus)
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban expansion is creating environmental stressors through land use change, habitat fragmentation, and habitat loss. These stressors, along with a host of others, are driving precipitous declines in vertebrate taxa around the world. Amphibians, often requiring a narrow range of environmental conditions, can be especially susceptible to the stressors of environmental change. Despite habitat loss and degradation, some amphibian species continue to persist in altered urban landscapes. The red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one such- species and in this study, we assess how habitat patch size affects population density and genetic diversity of salamander populations in and around an urban center in Ohio, United States. Further, we examined patterns of genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity to understand gene flow between populations and tested for historic demographic bottleneck effects. Populations were sampled from 9 urban forest patches ranging in size from less than 1 ha to approximately 250 ha. There was no apparent effect of contiguous habitat patch size on salamander density nor genetic diversity, but we did observe significant genetic differentiation between 97% of pairwise population comparisons. The differentiation observed was not a result of overland distance or effective distance due to landscape resistance. There was evidence of historic bottlenecks at every site. These results suggest that density is driven by within-patch heterogeneity and that genetic diversity is affected by drivers other than patch size or contemporary population density. Our study demonstrates that red-backed salamanders can persist in wooded, urban parks, but that genetic diversity remains susceptible to demographic changes.

TI  - Addressing longitudinal connectivity in the systematic conservation planning of fresh waters
PY  - 2010
AB  - P>1. Freshwater conservation has received less attention than its terrestrial or marine counterparts. Given the accelerated rate of change and intensive human use that freshwater ecosystems are submitted to, it is urgent to focus more attention on fresh waters. Existing conservation planning tools - such as Marxan - need to be modified to account for the special nature of these systems. Connectivity plays a key role in freshwater ecosystems. Threats are mediated along river corridors, and the condition of the entire catchment influences river biodiversity downstream. This needs to be considered in conservation planning.

TI  - A Conservation Design for the Central Coast of California and the Evaluation of Mountain Lion as an Umbrella Species
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Conservation planners use several methods to select conservation target areas. These include the use of umbrella species for large area requirements, site-specific locations of important biodiversity elements, and indications of ecosystem health. We tested the adequacy of using an umbrella species to represent finer-scale biodiversity elements on 45,205 km2 of the central coast of California. A network of core and linkages for mountain lion (Puma concolor [Kerr]) was developed and 22,069 km2, or 49% of the region, was selected. We analyzed network representation of a variety of biodiversity elements. The conservation network contained between 8% and 27% of five different endangered species locations in the region. It captured 77% of mapped serpentine rock, a surrogate for rare plants, 88% of the old-growth redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [(D. Don) Endl.]), 55% of the The Nature Conservancy conservation portfolio areas, a surrogate for biodiversity, a majority of three types of oak woodlands, and 79...

TI  - Fine‐scale variation within urban landscapes affects marking patterns and gastrointestinal parasite diversity in red foxes
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban areas are often considered to be a hostile environment for wildlife as they are highly fragmented and frequently disturbed. However, these same habitats can contain abundant resources, while lacking many common competitors and predators. The urban environment can have a direct impact on the species living there but can also have indirect effects on their parasites and pathogens. To date, relatively few studies have measured how fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within urban landscapes can affect parasite transmission and persistence.Here, we surveyed 237 greenspaces across the urban environment of Edinburgh (UK) to investigate how fine-scale variation in socio-economic and ecological variables can affect red fox (Vulpes vulpes) marking behavior, gastrointestinal (GI) parasite prevalence, and parasite community diversity.We found that the presence and abundance of red fox fecal markings were nonuniformly distributed across greenspaces and instead were dependent on the ecological characteristics of a site. Specifically, common foraging areas were left largely unmarked, which indicates that suitable resting and denning sites may be limiting factor in urban environments. In addition, the amount of greenspace around each site was positively correlated with overall GI parasite prevalence, species richness, and diversity, highlighting the importance of greenspace (a commonly used measure of landscape connectivity) in determining the composition of the parasite community in urban areas.Our results suggest that fine-scale variation within urban environments can be important for understanding the ecology of infectious diseases in urban wildlife and could have wider implication for the management of urban carnivores.

TI  - Connectivity and complexity in landscapes and ecosystems
PY  - 1994
AB  - The connectivity of sites in a landscape affects both species distribution patterns and the dynamics of whole ecosystems. Dispersal tends to produce clumped distributions, which promote species persistence and provide a possible mechanism for maintaining high species richness in tropical rainforests and other ecosystems. Simulations of multi-species systems show that, below a critical rate, disturbance regimes have little impact on species richness. With super-critical rates of disturbance the rate of decrease in species richness depends on the balance between the rate of disturbance and dispersal range. Theoretical and simulation studies discussed here reveal that landscape connectivity falls into three distinct classes: connected, disconnected, and critical. Landscape processes are inherently unpredictable when connectivity lies within the critical range. Critical levels of connectivity lead to phase changes in the behaviour of many ecosystem processes. For instance epidemics, fire spread and invasions by exotic plants or animals are all suppressed if inter-site connectivity is too low. Conversely, genetic drift within individual populations is an order of magnitude greater if connectivity is sub-critical.

TI  - Scale of habitat connectivity and colonization in fragmented nuthatch populations
PY  - 2008
AB  - Studies of effects of landscape pattern on population dynamics should consider the spatial scale at which habitat connectivity varies relative to the spatial scale of the species' behavioral response. In this paper, I investigate the relationship between the degree of connectivity of wooded patches measured at different spatial scales and the colonization of these patches by nuthatch Sitta europaea populations. I used different threshold distances to calculate the degree of habitat connectivity. A threshold distance is the distance beyond which the probability of successfully bridging the distance by dispersing individuals is assumed to decrease rapidly. The sum of the degree of connectivity over all patches in a region provides a measure for the overall degree of connectivity. Based on this measure, I could first give an indication under what conditions species may experience effects of constrained dispersal in that region. Second, the degree of connectivity of the individual patches was related with the observed colonizations of these patches. The degree of habitat connectivity measured for threshold distances of ca 2.4-3 km best explains the colonization probability of unoccupied patches. These threshold distances give an indication of the distances covered by dispersing nuthatches that led to successful colonizations.

TI  - Barrier-based Longitudinal Connectivity Index for Managing Urban Rivers
PY  - 2018
AB  - A large variety of barriers can affect longitudinal connectivity, which leads to shipping blocking and even flood hazard. However, few existing methods can quantify physically the river channel connectivity from the barrier’s details perspective in a watershed. This paper establishes a new model of the River Channel Connectivity Index (RCCI) to quantify the unobstructed degree of river flow in river channels within geographic information system (GIS ) platforms based on the modified concept of time accessibility. A comprehensive classification system of barriers is setup before these barriers are identified by the remote sensing technology. The model is applied to Dashi Watershed in suburban Beijing, China. Results show that submersible bridges and sediment siltation are the main barriers in the watershed. RCCI values in the mountainous areas are generally higher than that of the plains. The assessment results verified by two historical flood events show that the RCCI can reveal where the river channel connectivity is impaired, how serious it is, and what the reason is for managers. Through scenarios’ results, the best restoration measure for each tributary is obtained from the perspective of reducing flood hazards. The new RCCI method not only has methodological significance, but also helps policymakers to enhance river flooding reduction and determine restoration priorities of the river channel.

TI  - A Research Agenda for Urban Biodiversity in the Global Extinction Crisis
PY  - 2020
AB  - Rapid urbanization and the global loss of biodiversity necessitate the development of a research agenda that addresses knowledge gaps in urban ecology that will inform policy, management, and conservation. To advance this goal, we present six topics to pursue in urban biodiversity research: the socioeconomic and social-ecological drivers of biodiversity loss versus gain of biodiversity; the response of biodiversity to technological change; biodiversity-ecosystem service relationships; urban areas as refugia for biodiversity; spatiotemporal dynamics of species, community changes, and underlying processes; and ecological networks. We discuss overarching considerations and offer a set of questions to inspire and support urban biodiversity research. In parallel, we advocate for communication and collaboration across many fields and disciplines in order to build capacity for urban biodiversity research, education, and practice. Taken together we note that urban areas will play an important role in addressing the global extinction crisis.

TI  - Conservation of fragmented populations
PY  - 1994
AB  - In this paper we argue that landscape spatial structure is of central importance in understanding the ef- fects of fragmentation on population survival. Landscape spatial structure is the spatial relationships among habitat patches and the matrix in which they are embedded. Many general models of subdividedpopulations make the assump- tions that (1) all habitatpatches are equivalent in size and quality and (2) all local populations (in the patches) are equally accessible by dispersers. Models that gloss over spa- tial details of landscape structure can be useful for theoret- ical developments but will almost always be misleading when applied to real-world conservation problems. We show that local extinctions of fragmented populations are com- mon. From this it follows that recolonization of local ex- tinctions is criticalfor regional survival offragmented pop- ulations. The probability of recolonization depends on (1) spatial relationships among landscape elements used by the population, including habitat patches for breeding and ele- ments of the inter-patch matrix through which dispersers move, (2) dispersal characteristics of the organism of inter- est, and (3) temporal changes in the landscape structure. For endangered species, which are typically restricted in their dispersal range and in the kinds of habitat through which they can disperse, these factors are of primary importance and must be explicitly considered in management decisions.

TI  - Ecosystem Processes Along an Urban-to-Rural Gradient
PY  - NA
AB  - In order to understand the effect of urban development on the functioning of forest ecosystems during the past decade we have been studying red oak stands located on similar soil along an urban-rural gradient running from New York City ro rural Litchfield County, Connecticut. This paper summarizes the results of this work. Field measurements, controlled laboratory experiments, and reciprocal transplants documented soil pollution, soil hydrophobicity, litter decomposition rates, total soil carbon, potential nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, fungal biomass, and earthworm populations in forests along the 140 × 20 km study transect. The results revealed a complex urban-rural environmental gradient. The urban forests exhibit unique ecosystem structure and function in relation to the suburban and rural forest stands; these are likely linked to stresses of the urban environment such as air pollution, which has also resulted in elevated levels of heavy metals in the soil, the positive effects of the heat island phenomenon, and the presence of earthworms. The data suggest a working model to guide mechanistic work on the ecology of forests along urban-to-rural gradients, and for comparison of different metropolitan areas.

TI  - Stress and the city: Urbanization and its effects on the stress physiology in European Blackbirds
PY  - 2006
AB  - Animals colonizing cities are exposed to many novel and potentially stressful situations. There is evidence that chronic stress can cause deleterious effects. Hence, wild animals would suffer from city life unless they adjusted their stress response to the conditions in a city. Here we show that European Blackbirds born in a city have a lower stress response than their forest conspecifics. We hand-raised urban and forest-living individuals of that species under identical conditions and tested their corticosterone stress response at an age of 5, 8, and 11 months. The results suggest that the difference is genetically determined, although early developmental effects cannot be excluded. Either way, the results support the idea that urbanization creates a shift in coping styles by changing the stress physiology of animals. The reduced stress response could be ubiquitous and, presumably, necessary for all animals that thrive in ecosystems exposed to frequent anthropogenic disturbances, such as those in urban areas.

TI  - Connectivity Conservation: Quantifying connectivity: balancing metric performance with data requirements
PY  - 2006
AB  - INTRODUCTION Connectivity is an intuitively appealing and useful notion that is now a central concept in ecology and conservation science. Unfortunately, like many ideas that resonate widely, connectivity is plagued with a variety of definitions, interpretations, and methods of measurement. For example, several recent theoretical reviews have detailed how differences in spatial scale and underlying concepts influence how the issue of connectivity is addressed in landscape ecology and metapopulation ecology (Taylor et al . 1993; Tischendorf and Fahrig 2000; Moilanen and Hanski 2001; Tischendorf 2001a; Moilanen and Nieminen 2002). While definitions and measurement might seem boringly technical, conservation scientists must work to identify clear, replicable, and well-understood metrics of connectivity if conservation is to invest funds and efforts wisely and responsibly. Because connectivity is widely believed to facilitate population persistence in a fragmented landscape, on-the-ground applications of connectivity typically involve favoring one landscape configuration or reserve design over alternatives because of improved connectivity (e.g., Siitonen et al . 2002, 2003; Singleton et al . 2002; Cabeza 2003). The metrics used to make these decisions clearly matter. However, despite the importance of developing the theoretical foundations of connectivity, land managers are more likely to be interested in practical issues surrounding the measurement of connectivity. Most importantly, connectivity metrics must be pragmatic and based upon data that might actually be attained on a regular basis.

TI  - Directed dispersal by rotational shepherding supports landscape genetic connectivity in a calcareous grassland plant
PY  - 2014
AB  - Directed dispersal by animal vectors has been found to have large effects on the structure and dynamics of plant populations adapted to frugivory. Yet, empirical data are lacking on the potential of directed dispersal by rotational grazing of domestic animals to mediate gene flow across the landscape. Here, we investigated the potential effect of large-flock shepherding on landscape-scale genetic structure in the calcareous grassland plant Dianthus carthusianorum, whose seeds lack morphological adaptations to dispersal to animals or wind. We found a significant pattern of genetic structure differentiating population within grazed patches of three nonoverlapping shepherding systems and populations of ungrazed patches. Among ungrazed patches, we found a strong and significant effect of isolation by distance (r = 0.56). In contrast, genetic distance between grazed patches within the same herding system was unrelated to geographical distance but significantly related to distance along shepherding routes (r = 0.44). This latter effect of connectivity along shepherding routes suggests that gene flow is spatially restricted occurring mostly between adjacent populations. While this study used nuclear markers that integrate gene flow by pollen and seed, the significant difference in the genetic structure between ungrazed patches and patches connected by large-flock shepherding indicates the potential of directed seed dispersal by sheep across the landscape.

TI  - MEASURING LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY: THE CHALLENGE OF BEHAVIORAL LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
PY  - 2005
AB  - The recognition of behavior as a link between process and pattern in land- scape ecology is exemplified by the concept of functional connectivity: the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches. In this paper, I first argue that the actual operational definitions of this concept as applied to animal move- ment are not fully consistent with its formal definition. For instance, I question that a high likelihood of movement among the different points of primary habitat implies a high con- nectivity and contend that such a view can lead to misinterpretations. I also address two more hurdles to the measurement of functional connectivity: the fact that functional con- nectivity may not be equal along all axes and directions of movement and individual variation in functional connectivity within a given landscape. These points bring me to suggest that the concept of functional connectivity be bridged to the one of travel costs used in behavioral ecology. This would help define unequivocal operational definitions of functional connectivity as its measurement would then be dictated by its ecological role within specific models (e.g., travel costs within group membership models of foraging theory). I argue further that this ecological role shall in turn determine the motivation underlying the movement of individuals, implying that the latter should preferably be standardized when measuring functional connectivity in the field. I finally present some methods to do so. These include translocation and playback experiments, food-titration and giving-up densities experiments, and manipulating feeding and breeding site locations and

TI  - Gene flow and genetic drift in urban environments.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Evidence is growing that human modification of landscapes has dramatically altered evolutionary processes. In urban population genetic studies, urbanization is typically predicted to act as a barrier that isolates populations of species, leading to increased genetic drift within populations and reduced gene flow between populations. However, urbanization may also facilitate dispersal among populations, leading to higher genetic diversity within, and lower differentiation between, urban populations. We reviewed the literature on nonadaptive urban evolution to evaluate the support for each of these urban fragmentation and facilitation models. In a review of the literature with supporting quantitative analyses of 167 published urban population genetics studies, we found a weak signature of reduced within-population genetic diversity and no evidence of consistently increased between-population genetic differentiation associated with urbanization. In addition, we found that urban landscape features act as barriers or conduits to gene flow, depending on the species and city in question. Thus, we speculate that dispersal ability of species and environmental heterogeneity between cities contributes to the variation exhibited in our results. However, >90% of published studies reviewed here showed an association of urbanization with genetic drift or gene flow, highlighting the strong impact of urbanization on nonadaptive evolution. It is clear that species biology and city heterogeneity obscure patterns of genetic drift and gene flow in a quantitative analysis. Thus, we suggest that future research makes comparisons of multiple cities and nonurban habitats, and takes into consideration species' natural history, environmental variation, spatial modelling and marker selection.

TI  - The Complexity of Urban Eco-evolutionary Dynamics
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Urbanization is changing Earth's ecosystems by altering the interactions and feedbacks between the fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes that maintain life. Humans in cities alter the eco-evolutionary play by simultaneously changing both the actors and the stage on which the eco-evolutionary play takes place. Urbanization modifies land surfaces, microclimates, habitat connectivity, ecological networks, food webs, species diversity, and species composition. These environmental changes can lead to changes in phenotypic, genetic, and cultural makeup of wild populations that have important consequences for ecosystem function and the essential services that nature provides to human society, such as nutrient cycling, pollination, seed dispersal, food production, and water and air purification. Understanding and monitoring urbanization-induced evolutionary changes is important to inform strategies to achieve sustainability. In the present article, we propose that understanding these dynamics requires rigorous characterization of urbanizing regions as rapidly evolving, tightly coupled human–natural systems. We explore how the emergent properties of urbanization affect eco-evolutionary dynamics across space and time. We identify five key urban drivers of change—habitat modification, connectivity, heterogeneity, novel disturbances, and biotic interactions—and highlight the direct consequences of urbanization-driven eco-evolutionary change for nature's contributions to people. Then, we explore five emerging complexities—landscape complexity, urban discontinuities, socio-ecological heterogeneity, cross-scale interactions, legacies and time lags—that need to be tackled in future research. We propose that the evolving metacommunity concept provides a powerful framework to study urban eco-evolutionary dynamics.</jats:p>

TI  - Mapping Landscape Resistance to Identify Corridors and Barriers for Elephant Movement in Southern Africa
PY  - 2010
AB  - One of Africa's greatest conservation successes is the recovery of elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations within protected areas (e.g. Aleper and Moe 2006), such as those in northern Botswana. This recovery poses several challenges, however. First, habitat within protected areas is becoming degraded from high intensity elephant browsing. Second, the increasing elephant and human populations in the region have led to large increases in human—elephant conflict along the periphery of protected areas (Sitati et al. 2005; Lee and Graham 2006). Management options include facilitating natural dispersal, active relocation, and culling. Relocation is prohibitively expensive as a population-level solution given the high per capita cost. Culling is politically unpopular given Botswana's booming wildlife tourist industry. Simultaneously, large areas of the neighboring countries of Namibia, Zambia and Angola have low elephant densities. Some of these governments desire to increase elephant populations within their protected areas to promote the growth of wildlife tourism. Thus, facilitated dispersal of elephants from high density areas of northern Botswana to protected areas in other countries with low elephant densities is an attractive potential solution.

TI  - Effects of landscape context on herbivory and parasitism at different spatial scales
PY  - 2003
AB  - Local community structure and interactions have been shown to depend partly on landscape context. In this paper we tested the hypothesis that the spatial scale experienced by an organism depends on its trophic level. We analyzed plant-herbivore and herbivore-parasitoid interactions in 15 agricultural landscapes differing in structural complexity using the rape pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), an important pest on oilseed rape (Brassica napus), and its parasitoids. In the very center of each landscape a patch of potted rape plants was placed in a grassy field margin strip for standardized measurement. Percent non-crop area of landscapes was negatively related to plant damage caused by herbivory and positively to the herbivores’ larval mortality resulting from parasitism. In a geographic scale analysis, we quantified the structure of the 15 landscapes for eight circular sectors ranging from 0.5 to 6 km diameter. Correlations between parasitism and non-crop areas as well as between herbivory and non-crop area were strongest at a scale of 1.5 km, thereby not supporting the view that higher trophic levels experience the world at a larger spatial scale. However, the predictive power of non-crop area changed only slightly for herbivory, but greatly with respect to parasitism as scales from 0.5 to 1.5 km and from 1.5 to 6 km diameter increased. Furthermore, the effect of non-crop area tended to be stronger in parasitism than herbivory suggesting a greater effect of changes in landscape context on parasitoids. This is in support of the general idea that higher trophic levels should be more susceptible to disturbance.

TI  - Are fragments islands? Landscape context and density-area relationships in boreal forest birds.

AB  - Abstract: We investigated the role of matrix type as a determinant of change in bird densities with forest patch area (patch area effect) in two different Fennoscandian landscape types: mature forest fragments surrounded by cut‐over or regenerating forest and true forested islands surrounded by water. Since the matrix of forested archipelagoes offers no resources to and impedes movement of forest birds, we predict that patch area effects on bird densities should be stronger on forested islands than in forest patches fragmented by forestry. We compiled correlation estimates of the bird density–patch area relationship from the literature and analyzed the data using meta‐analysis. Combined correlation coefficients were significantly positive on islands but were not significantly different from 0 in fragments. Within‐species comparisons also showed that correlations were consistently more positive on islands than in fragments. On islands but not in fragments, the densities of forest specialist species were mo...

TI  - Habitat connectivity in biodiversity conservation: A review of recent studies and applications
PY  - 2015
AB  - The study of landscape connectivity in conservation has increased considerably since the early part of the 21st century. While the implications of landscape connectivity are self-evident for conservation, they are also important for physical geography since a proper understanding of landscape patterns and processes allows for better landscape management practices, which are at the core of geography. This paper presents a review of the literature based on 162 publications from 2000 to 2013, in which we evaluated the current state and recent advances in the integration of landscape connectivity in the identification and planning of conservation areas. The literature review and data analysis were based on a database organized into five categories: General information, study areas, research objectives, research methods in connectivity studies, and integration of connectivity with conservation. We found a substantial increase in the number of publications relating to connectivity and conservation from 2008 to ...

TI  - A Landscape Ecology Approach for the Study of Ecological Connectivity Across Tropical Marine Seascapes
PY  - 2009
AB  - Connectivity across the seascape is expected to have profound consequences for the behavior, growth, survival, and spatial distribution of marine species. A landscape ecology approach offers great utility for studying ecological connectivity in tropical marine seascapes. Landscape ecology provides a well developed conceptual and operational framework for addressing complex multi-scale questions regarding the influence of spatial patterning on ecological processes. Landscape ecology can provide quantitative and spatially explicit information at scales relevant to resource management decision making. It will allow us to begin asking key questions such as ‘how much habitat to protect?’, ‘What type of habitat to protect?’, and ‘Which seascape patterns provide optimal, suboptimal, or dysfunctional connectivity for mobile marine organisms?’. While landscape ecology is increasingly being applied to tropical marine seascapes, few studies have dealt explicitly with the issue of connectivity. Herein, we examine the application of landscape ecology to better understand ecological connectivity in tropical marine ecosystems by: (1) reviewing landscape ecology concepts, (2) discussing the landscape ecology methods and tools available for evaluating connectivity, (3) examining data needs and obstacles, (4) reviewing lessons learned from terrestrial landscape ecology and from coral reef ecology studies, and (5) discussing the implications of ecological connectivity for resource management. Several recent studies conducted in coral reef ecosystems demonstrate the powerful utility of landscape ecology approaches for improving our understanding of ecological connectivity and applying results to make more informed decisions for conservation planning.

TI  - Is landscape connectivity a dependent or independent variable
PY  - 2003
AB  - With growing interest in landscape connectivity, it is timely to ask what research has been done and what remains to be done. I surveyed papers investigating landscape connectivity from 1985 to 2000. From these papers, I determined if connectivity had been treated as an independent or dependent variable, what connectivity metrics were used, and if the study took an empirical or modeling approach to studying connectivity. Most studies treated connectivity as an independent variable, despite how little we know about how landscape structure and organism movement behaviour interact to determine landscape connectivity. Structural measures of connectivity were more common than functional measures, particularly if connectivity was treated as an independent variable. Though there was a good balance between modeling and empirical approaches overall – studies dealing with connectivity as a dependent, functional variable were mainly modeling studies. Based on the research achieved thus far, future landscape connectivity research should focus on: 1 elucidating the relationship between landscape structure, organism movement behaviour, and landscape connectivity e.g., treating connectivity as a dependent variable, 2 determining the relationships between different measures of connectivity, particularly structural and functional measures, and 3 empirically testing model predictions regarding landscape connectivity.

TI  - Applying network theory to prioritize multispecies habitat networks that are robust to climate and land-use change.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Designing connected landscapes is among the most widespread strategies for achieving biodiversity conservation targets. The challenge lies in simultaneously satisfying the connectivity needs of multiple species at multiple spatial scales under uncertain climate and land-use change. To evaluate the contribution of remnant habitat fragments to the connectivity of regional habitat networks, we developed a method to integrate uncertainty in climate and land-use change projections with the latest developments in network-connectivity research and spatial, multipurpose conservation prioritization. We used land-use change simulations to explore robustness of species' habitat networks to alternative development scenarios. We applied our method to 14 vertebrate focal species of periurban Montreal, Canada. Accounting for connectivity in spatial prioritization strongly modified conservation priorities and the modified priorities were robust to uncertain climate change. Setting conservation priorities based on habitat quality and connectivity maintained a large proportion of the region's connectivity, despite anticipated habitat loss due to climate and land-use change. The application of connectivity criteria alongside habitat-quality criteria for protected-area design was efficient with respect to the amount of area that needs protection and did not necessarily amplify trade-offs among conservation criteria. Our approach and results are being applied in and around Montreal and are well suited to the design of ecological networks and green infrastructure for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in other regions, in particular regions around large cities, where connectivity is critically low.

TI  - Ecological consequences of artificial night lighting
PY  - 2006
AB  - One of the less obvious effects of population growth is that a vastly increased proportion of the Earth is now illuminated at night, with increasingly powerful lights. This book will provide the first reference on the profound effects that these lights have on plants, animals, and whole ecosystems. The best-known research on this topic has focused on birds and sea turtles. But artificial lighting also affects other species in ways that are less well-known: foraging behavior of amphibians is altered, lights affect the dispersal patterns young cougars, and fireflies may be inhibited from finding mates. Because of the tremendous prevalence of night lights, and because of the intricate (and often poorly understood) interactions of different life forms, these impacts are far-reaching, affecting not only survival of various species, but also influencing adaptations and evolution. These are important issues for people who are researching and working to protect biodiversity. To date, research on the impacts of artificial light has been isolated within taxonomic specialties, with no synthesis of overall effects of the loss of natural darkness on ecological communities. This volume will help to remedy the information need.

TI  - An experimental test of matrix permeability and corridor use by an endemic understory bird.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Because of widespread habitat fragmentation, maintenance of landscape connectivity has become a major focus of conservation planning, but empirical tests of animal movement in fragmented landscapes remain scarce. We conducted a translocation experiment to test the relative permeability of three landscape elements (open habitat, shrubby secondary vegetation, and wooded corridors) to movement by the Chucao Tapaculo (Scelorchilus rubecula), a forest understory bird endemic to South American temperate rainforest. Forty-one radio-tagged subjects were translocated (individually) to three landscape treatments consisting of small release patches that were either entirely surrounded by open habitat (pasture), entirely surrounded by dense shrubs, or linked to other patches by wooded corridors that were otherwise surrounded by open matrix. The number of days subjects remained in release patches before dispersal (a measure of habitat resistance) was significantly longer for patches surrounded by open habitat than for patches adjoining corridors or surrounded by dense shrubs. These results indicate that open habitat significantly constrains Chucao dispersal, in accord with expectation, but dispersal occurs equally well through wooded corridors and shrub-dominated matrix. Thus, corridor protection or restoration and management of vegetation in the matrix (to encourage animal movement) may be equally feasible alternatives for maintaining connectivity.

TI  - Costs of dispersal
PY  - 2011
AB  - Dispersal costs can be classified into energetic, time, risk and opportunity costs and may be levied directly or deferred during departure, transfer and settlement. They may equally be incurred during life stages before the actual dispersal event through investments in special morphologies. Because costs will eventually determine the performance of dispersing individuals and the evolution of dispersal, we here provide an extensive review on the different cost types that occur during dispersal in a wide array of organisms, ranging from micro-organisms to plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. In general, costs of transfer have been more widely documented in actively dispersing organisms, in contrast to a greater focus on costs during departure and settlement in plants and animals with a passive transfer phase. Costs related to the development of specific dispersal attributes appear to be much more prominent than previously accepted. Because costs induce trade-offs, they give rise to covariation between dispersal and other life-history traits at different scales of organismal organisation. The consequences of (i) the presence and magnitude of different costs during different phases of the dispersal process, and (ii) their internal organisation through covariation with other life-history traits, are synthesised with respect to potential consequences for species conservation and the need for development of a new generation of spatial simulation models.

TI  - Changes in landscape patterns in Georgia, USA
PY  - 1988
AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine how landscape patterns in Georgia, USA have changed through time and whether the spatial patterns varied by physiographic region. Historical aerial photography was used to analyze spatial patterns of land use from the 1930's to the 1980's. Land use patterns were quantified by: (1) mean number and size of patches; (2) fractal dimension of patches; (3) amount of edge between land uses; and (4) indices of diversity, dominance, and contagion. Forest cover increased in aerial extent and in mean patch size. The mean size of agricultural patches increased in the coastal plain and decreased in the mountains and piedmont. Edges between land uses decreased through time, indicating less dissection of the landscape. Fractal dimensions also decreased, indicating simpler patch shapes. Indices of diversity and dominance differed through time but not among regions; the contagion index differed among regions but not through time. A geographic trend of decreasing diversity and increasing dominance and contagion was observed from the mountains to the lower coastal plain. Landscape patterns exhibited the greatest changes in the piedmont region. Overall, the Georgia landscape has become less fragmented and more connected during the past 50 years. Changing patterns in the landscape may have implications for many ecological processes and resources.

TI  - Highways block gene flow and cause a rapid decline in genetic diversity of desert bighorn sheep
PY  - 2005
AB  - The rapid expansion of road networks has reduced connectivity among populations of flora and fauna. The resulting isolation is assumed to increase population extinction rates, in part because of the loss of genetic diversity. However, there are few cases where loss of genetic diversity has been linked directly to roads or other barriers. We analysed the effects of such barriers on connectivity and genetic diversity of 27 populations of Ovis canadensis nelsoni (desert bighorn sheep). We used partial Mantel tests, multiple linear regression and coalescent simulations to infer changes in gene flow and diversity of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers. Our findings link a rapid reduction in genetic diversity (up to 15%) to as few as 40 years of anthropogenic isolation. Interstate highways, canals and developed areas, where present, have apparently eliminated gene flow. These results suggest that anthropogenic barriers constitute a severe threat to the persistence of naturally fragmented populations.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing for applied ecologists: opportunities and challenges
PY  - 2014
AB  - 1. Habitat loss and degradation, overexploitation, climate change and the spread of invasive species are drastically depleting the Earth's biological diversity, leading to detrimental impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being. 2. Our ability to monitor the state of biodiversity and the impacts of global environmental change on this natural capital is fundamental to designing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies for preventing further loss of biological diversity. This requires the scientific community to assess spatio-temporal changes in the distribution of abiotic conditions (e.g. temperature, rainfall) and in the distribution, structure, composition and functioning of ecosystems. 3. The potential for satellite remote sensing (SRS) to provide key data has been highlighted by many researchers, with SRS offering repeatable, standardized and verifiable information on long-term trends in biodiversity indicators. SRS permits one to address questions on scales inaccessible to ground-based methods alone, facilitating the development of an integrated approach to natural resource management, where biodiversity, pressures to biodiversity and consequences of management decisions can all be monitored. 4. Synthesis and applications. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary perspective on the prospects of satellite remote sensing (SRS) for ecological applications, reviewing established avenues and highlighting new research and technological developments that have a high potential to make a difference in environmental management. We also discuss current barriers to the ecological application of SRS-based approaches and identify possible ways to overcome some of these limitations.

TI  - Terrestrial animal tracking as an eye on life and planet
PY  - 2015
AB  - BACKGROUND The movement of animals makes them fascinating but difficult study subjects. Animal movements underpin many biological phenomena, and understanding them is critical for applications in conservation, health, and food. Traditional approaches to animal tracking used field biologists wielding antennas to record a few dozen locations per animal, revealing only the most general patterns of animal space use. The advent of satellite tracking automated this process, but initially was limited to larger animals and increased the resolution of trajectories to only a few hundred locations per animal. The last few years have shown exponential improvement in tracking technology, leading to smaller tracking devices that can return millions of movement steps for ever-smaller animals. Finally, we have a tool that returns high-resolution data that reveal the detailed facets of animal movement and its many implications for biodiversity, animal ecology, behavior, and ecosystem function. ADVANCES Improved technology has brought animal tracking into the realm of big data, not only through high-resolution movement trajectories, but also through the addition of other on-animal sensors and the integration of remote sensing data about the environment through which these animals are moving. These new data are opening up a breadth of new scientific questions about ecology, evolution, and physiology and enable the use of animals as sensors of the environment. High–temporal resolution movement data also can document brief but important contacts between animals, creating new opportunities to study social networks, as well as interspecific interactions such as competition and predation. With solar panels keeping batteries charged, “lifetime” tracks can now be collected for some species, while broader approaches are aiming for species-wide sampling across multiple populations. Miniaturized tags also help reduce the impact of the devices on the study subjects, improving animal welfare and scientific results. As in other disciplines, the explosion of data volume and variety has created new challenges and opportunities for information management, integration, and analysis. In an exciting interdisciplinary push, biologists, statisticians, and computer scientists have begun to develop new tools that are already leading to new insights and scientific breakthroughs. OUTLOOK We suggest that a golden age of animal tracking science has begun and that the upcoming years will be a time of unprecedented exciting discoveries. Technology continues to improve our ability to track animals, with the promise of smaller tags collecting more data, less invasively, on a greater variety of animals. The big-data tracking studies that are just now being pioneered will become commonplace. If analytical developments can keep pace, the field will be able to develop real-time predictive models that integrate habitat preferences, movement abilities, sensory capacities, and animal memories into movement forecasts. The unique perspective offered by big-data animal tracking enables a new view of animals as naturally evolved sensors of environment, which we think has the potential to help us monitor the planet in completely new ways. A massive multi-individual monitoring program would allow a quorum sensing of our planet, using a variety of species to tap into the diversity of senses that have evolved across animal groups, providing new insight on our world through the sixth sense of the global animal collective. We expect that the field will soon reach a transformational point where these studies do more than inform us about particular species of animals, but allow the animals to teach us about the world.

TI  - Ecological light pollution
PY  - 2004
AB  - Ecologists have long studied the critical role of natural light in regulating species interactions, but, with limited exceptions, have not investigated the consequences of artificial night lighting. In the past century, the extent and intensity of artificial night lighting has increased such that it has substantial effects on the biology and ecology of species in the wild. We distinguish “astronomical light pollution”, which obscures the view of the night sky, from “ecological light pollution”, which alters natural light regimes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Some of the catastrophic consequences of light for certain taxonomic groups are well known, such as the deaths of migratory birds around tall lighted structures, and those of hatchling sea turtles disoriented by lights on their natal beaches. The more subtle influences of artificial night lighting on the behavior and community ecology of species are less well recognized, and constitute a new focus for research in ecology and a pressing conservation challenge.

PY  - 1989
AB  - Correlated random walk models provide a framework for making quantitative predictions about an organism's rate of spread. In this paper we present an algorithm that calculates the variance in squared displacement for a correlated random walk model. This can be used to make statistical comparisons of observed displacements to the model and to approximate the expected net displacement of the model. We illustrate the techniques with examples of insect movement and the vegetative spread of clonal plants. See full-text article at JSTOR

TI  - Effect of landscape connectivity on plant communities: a review of response patterns
PY  - 2019
AB  - Context Fragmentation in agricultural landscapes is considered as a major threat to biodiversity. Thus, ecological corridors are deployed at multiple scales to increase connectivity. However, there is limited consensus about their efficiency, especially for plants. Objectives We assimilated existing knowledge to assess whether and how landscape connectivity impacts plant communities. Methods We reviewed published literature across more than 20 years, providing an overview on the influence of connectivity on plant communities. Results We found that landscape connectivity has a varying and complex influence on the composition and diversity of plant communities (i.e. community taxonomic structure), due to the multiplicity of factors that modulate its effect. Our understanding of how of landscape connectivity impacts the dispersal of plants is improved by using biological traits (i.e. community functional structure). Finally, we showed that landscape connectivity promotes actual dispersal between connected communities. Conclusions This review emphasises the pertinence of trait-based and actual dispersal approaches to improve our understanding and ability to predict the effect of connectivity loss on plant communities, allowing us to identify new prospects for future research.

TI  - Dispersal and metapopulation viability in a heterogeneous landscape
PY  - 1999
AB  - Abstract Conditions of persistence or extinction of a metapopulation of a colonizing annual species are studied in a heterogeneous landscape, a mixture of two elementary landscapes. An elementary landscape is a landscape whose age-structure is described by only one transition matrix, giving the probability for a site to be disturbed, or to follow the process of succession. We first provide an analytical study of the range of dispersal rates that allow metapopulation persistence in an elementary landscape. Second, conditions for metapopulation persistence in a heterogeneous landscape are derived from results obtained in each elementary landscape. Three cases are distinguished. If the two ranges of dispersal rates defined in each elementary landscape overlap, the metapopulation persists in any mixture of the elementary landscapes. If these two dispersal rates ranges are non-overlapping, either the metapopulation goes extinct for some values of the proportion of the elementary landscapes, or two discontinuous ranges of dispersal rates allow the metapopulation persistence. The consequences of these results are discussed in terms of landscape management. In particular, it is shown that under some conditions, a rapid change in environment (from one elementary landscape to another one) might less often lead to metapopulation extinction than a slower change.

TI  - Linking like with like: optimising connectivity between environmentally-similar habitats
PY  - 2012
AB  - Habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. To minimise the effect of fragmentation on biodiversity, connectivity between otherwise isolated habitats should be promoted. However, the identification of linkages favouring connectivity is not trivial. Firstly, they compete with other land uses, so they need to be cost-efficient. Secondly, linkages for one species might be barriers for others, so they should effectively account for distinct mobility requirements. Thirdly, detailed information on the auto-ecology of most of the species is lacking, so linkages need being defined based on surrogates. In order to address these challenges we develop a framework that (a) identifies environmentally-similar habitats; (b) identifies environmental barriers (i.e., regions with a very distinct environment from the areas to be linked), and; (c) determines cost-efficient linkages between environmentally-similar habitats, free from environmental barriers. The assumption is that species with similar ecological requirements occupy the same environments, so environmental similarity provides a rationale for the identification of the areas that need to be linked. A variant of the classical minimum Steiner tree problem in graphs is used to address c). We present a heuristic for this problem that is capable of handling large datasets. To illustrate the framework we identify linkages between environmentally-similar protected areas in the Iberian Peninsula. The Natura 2000 network is used as a positive ‘attractor’ of links while the human footprint is used as ‘repellent’ of links. We compare the outcomes of our approach with cost-efficient networks linking protected areas that disregard the effect of environmental barriers. As expected, the latter achieved a smaller area covered with linkages, but with barriers that can significantly reduce the permeability of the landscape for the dispersal of some species.

TI  - Interpatch movements in spatially structured populations: a literature review
PY  - 2004
AB  - We used published data of individuals moving among habitat patches to answer questions pertaining to frequency of interpatch movements and subsequent effects on population dynamics. A review of 415 published articles produced data for 89 species-system combinations where movements were recorded in sufficient detail to include in our analysis. The percentage of individuals in a population that moved among habitat patches ranged from 0.00 to 93.00%, with a mean of 16.84%. Scaling this statistic by generation time yielded a mean movement rate of 15.45 ± 3.27% per generation. The relatively low movement rates suggest that subpopulations, except those of invertebrates, should not be highly integrated. Less than half of the empirical studies reported on the population effects of interpatch movement. Of these, thirty-three studies yielded population effects on 34 individual species in 45 species-systems. They reported movement having a positive effect 28 times, a negative effect twice and a neutral effect 14 times. Despite its importance, relatively few studies document rates of interpatch movement and far fewer determine population level consequences of these movements. This deficiency limits our ability to understand the dynamics of spatially structured populations and apply that knowledge to conservation efforts.

TI  - Gravity model toolbox: An automated and open-source ArcGIS tool to build and prioritize ecological corridors in urban landscapes
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract In an increasingly urbanized world, habitat fragmentation and lack of corridors among the fragmented habitats in urbanized ecosystems have compromised the survival of many species both at regional and global scale. Green corridors that connect isolated remnant habitat patches (e.g. parks) can increase connectivity and provide ecosystem services in cities. In the current study, we introduce an open-source ArcGIS toolset, the Gravity model toolbox, a programmed ArcGIS tool to map and prioritize the potential green corridors. The new toolset is based on the least-cost modelling and the improved gravity model, comprising of two script tools, the gravity model tool, and the network analysis tool. The gravity model tool can produce a spatially-explicit map of potential corridors for urban green space, as well as prioritize these corridors considering the opportunity cost. The network analysis tool is aimed at offering multiple scenarios of corridor networks based on the demands of users. To elucidate how the toolbox could be used by the urban planners and ecology researchers, a case study of the toolbox was conducted in the Tongzhou District, Beijing, China. This study presents a novel approach to assess urban connectivity and a systematic methodology for planning greening networks that connects landscape ecology with practical planning and designing considerations to maximize social and ecological functions of urban green space.

TI  - The rise of Network Ecology: Maps of the topic diversity and scientific collaboration
PY  - 2014
AB  - Network ecologists investigate the structure, function, and evolution of ecological systems using network models and analyses. For example, network techniques have been used to study community interactions (i.e., food-webs, mutualisms), gene flow across landscapes, and the sociality of individuals in populations. The work presented here uses a bibliographic and network approach to (1) document the rise of Network Ecology, (2) identify the diversity of topics addressed in the field, and (3) map the structure of scientific collaboration among contributing scientists. Our aim is to provide a broad overview of this emergent field that highlights its diversity and to provide a foundation for future advances. To do this, we searched the ISI Web of Science database for ecology publications between 1900 and 2012 using the search terms for research areas of Environmental Sciences & Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the topic ecology. From these records we identified the Network Ecology publications using the topic terms network, graph theory, and web, while controlling for the usage of misleading phrases. The resulting corpus entailed 29,513 publications between 1936 and 2012. We found that Network Ecology spans across more than 1500 sources with core ecological journals being among the top 20 most frequent outlets. We document the rapid rise in Network Ecology publications per year reaching a magnitude of over 5% of the ecological publications in 2012. Drawing topical information from the publication record content (titles, abstracts, keywords) and collaboration information from author listing, our analysis highlights the diversity and clustering of topics addressed within Network Ecology. The largest connected component of the topic network contained 73% of the corpus, and exhibited strong clustering (clustering coefficient 0.93). The co-authorship network revealed that while network ecologists are generally collaborative, the field is deeply fragmented into topic and co-author cliques. The largest component of the co-author network comprised 46% of the authors and contained 149 distinct clusters. We suggest ways to build on the collaborative spirit and reduce the field fragmentation so as to improve the development and spread of ideas. We conclude that Network Ecology will likely continue to grow because the forces driving its increase are likely to persist.

TI  - Corridor Use Predicted from Behaviors at Habitat Boundaries
PY  - 1999
AB  - abstract: Through empirical studies and simulation, I demonstrate how simple behaviors can be used in lieu of detailed dispersal studies to predict the effects of corridors on interpatch movements. Movement paths of three butterfly species were measured in large (1.64 ha) experimental patches of open habitat, some of which were connected by corridors. Butterflies that “reflected” off boundaries between open patches and the surrounding forest also emigrated from patches through corridors at rates higher than expected from random movement. This was observed for two open‐habitat species, Eurema nicippe and Phoebis sennae; however, edges and corridors had no effect on a habitat generalist, Papilio troilus. Behaviorally based simulation models, which departed from correlated random walks only at habitat boundaries, predicted that corridors increase interpatch movement rates of both open‐habitat species. Models also predicted that corridors have proportionately greater effects as corridor width increases, that ...

TI  - Connectivity Planning to Address Climate Change
PY  - 2013
AB  - As the climate changes, human land use may impede species from tracking areas with suitable climates. Maintaining connectivity between areas of different temperatures could allow organisms to move along temperature gradients and allow species to continue to occupy the same temperature space as the climate warms. We used a coarse-filter approach to identify broad corridors for movement between areas where human influence is low while simultaneously routing the corridors along present-day spatial gradients of temperature. We modified a cost–distance algorithm to model these corridors and tested the model with data on current land-use and climate patterns in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The resulting maps identified a network of patches and corridors across which species may move as climates change. The corridors are likely to be robust to uncertainty in the magnitude and direction of future climate change because they are derived from gradients and land-use patterns. The assumptions we applied in our model simplified the stability of temperature gradients and species responses to climate change and land use, but the model is flexible enough to be tailored to specific regions by incorporating other climate variables or movement costs. When used at appropriate resolutions, our approach may be of value to local, regional, and continental conservation initiatives seeking to promote species movements in a changing climate. Planificacion de Conectividad para Atender el Cambio Climatico Resumen A medida que cambia el clima, el uso de suelo por humanos puede impedir que las especies encuentren areas con climas adecuados. El mantenimiento de la conectividad entre areas con temperaturas diferentes permitiria que los organismos se muevan a lo largo de gradientes de temperatura y permitiria que las especies continuen ocupando el mismo espacio de temperatura a medida que el clima cambia. Utilizamos un metodo de grano grueso para identificar corredores para el movimiento entre areas con baja influencia humana y simultaneamente trazando los corredores a lo largo de gradientes de temperatura actuales. Modificamos un algoritmo de costo–distancia para modelar estos corredores y probamos el modelo con datos sobre el uso de suelo y patrones climaticos actuales en el Noroeste de Estados Unidos. Los mapas resultantes identificaron una red de parches y corredores en los que las especies se pueden mover a medida que el clima cambia. Es posible que los corredores sean robustos a la incertidumbre en la magnitud y direccion del cambio climatico futuro porque estan derivados de gradientes y patrones de uso de suelo. Los supuestos que aplicamos en nuestro modelo simplificaron la estabilidad de los gradientes de temperatura y las respuestas de las especies al cambio climatico y uso de suelo, pero el modelo es lo suficientemente flexible para ser adaptado a regiones especificas mediante la incorporacion de otras variables climaticas o costos de movimiento. Cuando se utiliza en resoluciones apropiadas, nuestro metodo puede ser valioso para iniciativas de conservacion locales, regionales y continentales que buscan promover el movimiento de especies en un clima cambiante.

TI  - Beyond the least-cost path: evaluating corridor redundancy using a graph-theoretic approach
PY  - 2008
AB  - The impact of the landscape matrix on patterns of animal movement and population dynamics has been widely recognized by ecologists. However, few tools are available to model the matrix’s influence on the length, relative quality, and redundancy of dispersal routes connecting habitat patches. Many GIS software packages can use land use/land cover maps to identify the route of least resistance between two points—the least-cost path. The limitation of this type of analysis is that only a single path is identified, even though alternative paths with comparable costs might exist. In this paper, we implemented two graph theory methods that extend the least-cost path approach: the Conditional Minimum Transit Cost (CMTC) tool and the Multiple Shortest Paths (MSPs) tool. Both methods enable the visualization of multiple dispersal routes that, together, are assumed to form a corridor. We show that corridors containing alternative dispersal routes emerge when favorable habitat is randomly distributed in space. As clusters of favorable habitat start forming, corridors become less redundant and dispersal bottlenecks become visible. Our approach is illustrated using data from a real landscape in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We explored the effect of small, localized disturbance on dispersal routes linking conservation units. Simulated habitat destruction caused the appearance of alternative dispersal routes, or caused existing corridors to become narrower. These changes were observed even in the absence of significant differences in the length or cost of least-cost paths. Last, we discuss applications to animal movement studies and conservation initiatives.

TI  - Animal Dispersal in Fragmented Habitat: Measuring Habitat Connectivity, Corridor Use, and Dispersal Mortality
PY  - 1999
AB  - We used a spatially explicit dispersal simulation to generate movement frequencies and distances for comparison with real dispersal frequencies collected in the field from two habitat−specific, sedentary bird species. The relationship between these two data sets allowed us to (1) test the hypothesis that the study species used corridor routes during dispersal; (2) measure the degree of reliance on corridor continuity; (3) estimate the rate of dispersal mortality with respect to distance traveled, and (4) give examples of how the model can be used to assess habitat connectivity with respect to similarly behaved species. We found that Blue−breasted Fairy−wrens and White−browed Babblers both used corridor routes during dispersal. Blue−breasted Fairy−wrens were inhibited by gaps greater than about 60 m, whereas White−browed Babblers crossed gaps of at least 270 m wide. For each species, the rate of dispersal mortality per unit distance traveled was about the same. Because we have effectively partitioned the risk of dispersal mortality from the chance of outside dispersal, and because our mortality estimates are model dependent but landscape independent, they can be transported to other landscapes on which simulations have been run and, therefore, can be used in population viability assessment of unstudied or hypothetical animal populations.

TI  - A new analytical approach to landscape genetic modelling: least‐cost transect analysis and linear mixed models
PY  - 2012
AB  - Landscape genetics aims to assess the effect of the landscape on intraspecific genetic structure. To quantify interdeme landscape structure, landscape genetics primarily uses landscape resistance surfaces (RSs) and least-cost paths or straight-line transects. However, both approaches have drawbacks. Parameterization of RSs is a subjective process, and least-cost paths represent a single migration route. A transect-based approach might oversimplify migration patterns by assuming rectilinear migration. To overcome these limitations, we combined these two methods in a new landscape genetic approach: least-cost transect analysis (LCTA). Habitat-matrix RSs were used to create least-cost paths, which were subsequently buffered to form transects in which the abundance of several landscape elements was quantified. To maintain objectivity, this analysis was repeated so that each landscape element was in turn regarded as migration habitat. The relationship between explanatory variables and genetic distances was then assessed following a mixed modelling approach to account for the nonindependence of values in distance matrices. Subsequently, the best fitting model was selected using the statistic. We applied LCTA and the mixed modelling approach to an empirical genetic dataset on the endangered damselfly, Coenagrion mercuriale. We compared the results to those obtained from traditional least-cost, effective and resistance distance analysis. We showed that LCTA is an objective approach that identifies both the most probable migration habitat and landscape elements that either inhibit or facilitate gene flow. Although we believe the statistical approach to be an improvement for the analysis of distance matrices in landscape genetics, more stringent testing is needed.

TI  - Analyzing insect movement as a correlated random walk.
PY  - 1983
AB  - This paper develops a procedure for quantifying movement sequences in terms of move length and turning angle probability distributions. By assuming that movement is a correlated random walk, we derive a formula that relates expected square displacements to the number of consecutive moves. We show this displacement formula can be used to highlight the consequences of different searching behaviors (i.e. different probability distributions of turning angles or move lengths). Observations of Pieris rapae (cabbage white butterfly) flight and Battus philenor (pipe-vine swallowtail) crawling are analyzed as a correlated random walk. The formula that we derive aptly predicts that net displacements of ovipositing cabbage white butterflies. In other circumstances, however, net displacements are not well-described by our correlated random walk formula; in these examples movement must represent a more complicated process than a simple correlated random walk. We suggest that progress might be made by analyzing these more complicated cases in terms of higher order markov processes.

TI  - Using place names to interpret former floodplain connectivity in the Morava River, Czech Republic
PY  - 2007
AB  - Toponyms, or place names have been used to reveal historical land-use patterns based on degree of wetness in the Morava River floodplain. Eleven patch types were plotted on three land cover types representing broad ecological niches with different moisture regimes for four time periods. The river’s simultaneous decrease in sinuosity, which underscores the loss of the landscape’s ecohydrological connectivity, was quanified. The results show that long-term human-dominated land use worked in concert with a naturally occuring seasonal flood regime. The findings strongly indicate that high human density and intensive exploitation can co-exist with a functioning floodplain. Landscape change was interpreted by using a new concept, that of the place-name patch, which can be universally applied to interpret historical land use changes in river basins. Our method is reproducible in river basins with a history of intensive human use.

PY  - 2008
AB  - Urban areas are hot spots that drive environmental change at multiple scales. Material demands of production and human consumption alter land use and cover, biodiversity, and hydrosystems locally to regionally, and urban waste discharge affects local to global biogeochemical cycles and climate. For urbanites, however, global environmental changes are swamped by dramatic changes in the local environment. Urban ecology integrates natural and social sciences to study these radically altered local environments and their regional and global effects. Cities themselves present both the problems and solutions to sustainability challenges of an increasingly urbanized world.

TI  - Patterns of spread in biological invasions dominated by long-distance jump dispersal: Insights from Argentine ants.
PY  - 2001
AB  - Invading organisms may spread through local movements (giving rise to a diffusion-like process) and by long-distance jumps, which are often human-mediated. The local spread of invading organisms has been fit with varying success to models that couple local population growth with diffusive spread, but to date no quantitative estimates exist for the relative importance of local dispersal relative to human-mediated long-distance jumps. Using a combination of literature review, museum records, and personal surveys, we reconstruct the invasion history of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), a widespread invasive species, at three spatial scales. Although the inherent dispersal abilities of Argentine ants are limited, in the last century, human-mediated dispersal has resulted in the establishment of this species on six continents and on many oceanic islands. Human-mediated jump dispersal has also been the primary mode of spread at a continental scale within the United States. The spread of the Argentine ant involves two discrete modes. Maximum distances spread by colonies undergoing budding reproduction averaged 150 m/year, whereas annual jump-dispersal distances averaged three orders of magnitude higher. Invasions that involve multiple dispersal processes, such as those documented here, are undoubtedly common. Detailed data on invasion dynamics are necessary to improve the predictive power of future modeling efforts.

TI  - Dispersal distances of nuthatches, Sitta europaea, in a highly fragmented forest habitat
PY  - 1995
AB  - We studied dispersal distances of nuthatches in a highly fragmented landscape with only 2% of its area covered by suitable habitat (mature forest and parkland). We estimate that most surviving nestlings settled outside the 200-km 2 study area, and that mean dispersal distance was several times larger compared to more densely forested landscapes. However, local recruitment, defined as the proportion of nestlings settling within a small number of territories from the site of birth, did not differ between this study and other studies in large forests. Once young nuthatches had settled, they were less likely to move again in the fragmented landscape compared to large forests. We conclude that fragmentation causes an increase in natal dispersal distance but no discernible change in the number of territories between birth and establishment. However, fragmentation does effectively induce isolation once the young birds have settled

TI  - The Effect of Landscape Heterogeneity on the Probability of Patch Colonization
PY  - 1996
AB  - The effect of landscape heterogeneity on the dispersal of organisms between habitat islands is poorly understood. Preferred pathways for dispersal (i.e., corridors), as well as dispersal barriers, are difficult to identify when the landscape matrix is composed of a complex mixture of land cover types. We developed an individual-based dispersal model to measure immigration and emigration rates between habitat islands within hetero- geneous landscapes. Dispersing individuals of a model organism were simulated as self- avoiding random walkers (SAW) traversing a digital land cover map, with each habitat type assigned a priori a probability that the SAW would enter that habitat type. Each individual began the dispersal process on a random site at the edge of a deciduous forest patch and was allowed to move until it reached a different deciduous forest patch. Visu- alization of the movement patterns across the landscape was achieved by tabulating the frequency of visitation Qf successful dispersers to each grid cell on the map. The model was used to estimate the probabilities of disperser transfer between patches by varying the a priori probabilities of movement into each habitat type in order to: (1) estimate the effect of changing landscape heterogeneity on the transfer probabilities, and (2) visualize dispersal corridors and barriers as perceived by model organisms operating by specific movement rules and at specific scales. The results show that 89% of the variability in dispersal success can be accounted for by differences in the size and isolation of forest patches, with closer and larger patches having significantly greater exchange of dispersing organisms. However, changes in the heterogeneity of the landscape matrix could significantly enhance or decrease emigration success from an individual patch, depending on the landscape. Changes in emigration success from an individual patch resulting from changes in matrix heterogeneity were not predictable, and transfer rates between patches were not symmetrical due to differences in the proximity of neighboring patches, and differences in the funneling at- tributes of certain landscape patterns. Visualizations showed that corridors are often diffuse and difficult to identify from structural features of the landscape. A wide range of organisms with differing movement capabilities can be simulated using the approach presented to increase our understanding of how landscape structure affects organism dispersal.

TI  - Comparison and development of new graph-based landscape connectivity indices: towards the priorization of habitat patches and corridors for conservation
PY  - 2006
AB  - The loss of connectivity of natural areas is a major threat for wildlife dispersal and survival and for the conservation of biodiversity in general. Thus, there is an increasing interest in considering connectivity in landscape planning and habitat conservation. In this context, graph structures have been shown to be a powerful and effective way of both representing the landscape pattern as a network and performing complex analysis regarding landscape connectivity. Many indices have been used for connectivity analyses so far but comparatively very little efforts have been made to understand their behaviour and sensitivity to spatial changes, which seriously undermines their adequate interpretation and usefulness. We systematically compare a set of ten graph-based connectivity indices, evaluating their reaction to different types of change that can occur in the landscape (habitat patches loss, corridors loss, etc.) and their effectiveness for identifying which landscape elements are more critical for habitat conservation. Many of the available indices were found to present serious limitations that make them inadequate as a basis for conservation planning. We present a new index (IIC) that achieves all the properties of an ideal index according to our analysis. We suggest that the connectivity problem should be considered within the wider concept of habitat availability, which considers a habitat patch itself as a space where connectivity exists, integrating habitat amount and connectivity between habitat patches in a single measure.

PY  - 1988
AB  - The spatial patterning of resources constrains the movement of consumers on the landscape. Percolation theory predicts that an organism can move freely if its critical resource or habitat occupies 59.28% of the landscape. Sparse resources require an organism to operate on larger resource utilization scales. Multiple critical resources necessitate larger scales, while substitutable resources ease the scale requirements. Contagious spatial patterns require larger scales to permit movement between resource clusters. The study indicates a strong link between spatial pattern and ecological processes on a landscape.

TI  - Finding the missing link between landscape structure and population dynamics: a spatially explicit perspective
PY  - 1999
AB  - abstract: We construct and explore a general modeling framework that allows for a systematic investigation of the impact of changes in landscape structure on population dynamics. The essential parts of the framework are a landscape generator with independent control over landscape composition and physiognomy, an individual‐based spatially explicit population model that simulates population dynamics within heterogeneous landscapes, and scale‐dependent landscape indices that depict the essential aspects of landscape that interact with dispersal and demographic processes.

TI  - Seasonal Differences in Foraging Dynamics, Habitat Use and Home Range Size of Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bat in an Urban Environment
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urbanization through the process of habitat loss and fragmentation affects ecosystems. Many species are no longer able to survive in these urban areas; however, there are some that have been able to persist and even thrive in these habitats. One such species is Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi). Little is known about its existence in urban areas. Consequently we studied their seasonal variation in home range size, movements and foraging dynamics in the urban environment of Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. In a pilot study in summer, adult fruit bats (n = 8) were caught, fitted with radio-transmitters, and their movements followed for 12 nights and days. Although their movements varied considerably, no bats left the urban environment. Some of the larger distances covered in a single night were 2 and 5 km. In winter, an additional ten adult fruit bats were caught and fitted with radio-transmitters. Movements were followed for three weeks during winter and spring respectively. Winter home range size was greater than spring home range size. During winter the bats fed mostly on syringa fruits (Melia azedarach), an alien invasive, while their diet in spring was more varied and included species of indigenous and exotic fruits. The reduced variety of fruit eaten in winter may be explained by a reduction in fruiting plant species, and thus a reliance on a few species to meet their dietary requirements. The bats would have a role in seed dispersal but therein lies the problem of them also dispersing invasive plants. Further research is needed to assess the role played by exotic and alien plant species in the continued success of urban wildlife, in particular fruit bats. The seasonal variation in home range size gives insight into the urban movements of Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bats. The use of exotic and invasive plants by these bats is also significant.

TI  - Sustaining forest landscape connectivity under different land cover change scenarios.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Managing forest landscapes to sustain functional connectivity is considered one of the key strategies to counteract the negative effects of climate and human-induced changes in forest species pools. With this objective, we evaluated whether a robust network of forest connecting elements can be identified so that it remains efficient when facing different types of potential land cover changes that may affect forest habitat networks and ecological fluxes. For this purpose we considered changes both in the forested areas and in the non-forest intervening landscape matrix. We combined some of the most recent developments in graph theory with models of land cover permeability and least-cost analysis through the forest landscape. We focused on a case of study covering the habitat of a forestdwelling bird (nuthatch, Sitta europaea) in the region of Galicia (NW Spain). Seven land-use change scenarios were analysed for their effects on connecting forest elements (patches and links): one was the simplest case in which the landscape is represented as a binary forest/non-forest pattern (and where matrix heterogeneity is disregarded), four scenarios in which forest lands were converted to other cover types (to scrubland due to wildfires, to extensive and intensive agriculture, and to urban areas), and two scenarios that only involved changes in the non-forested matrix (renaturalization and intensification). Our results show that while the network of connecting elements for the species was very robust to the conversion of the forest habitat patches to different cover types, the different change scenarios in the landscape matrix could more significantly weaken its long-term validity and effectiveness. This is particularly the case when most of the key connectivity providers for the nuthatch are located outside the protected areas or public forests in Galicia, where biodiversity-friendly measures might be more easily implemented. We discuss how the methodology can be applied to a wide range of forest landscape management situations, where both the conservation of the forest critical areas and an adequate management of the landscape matrix between them are of concern to achieve the sustainability of the ecological flows and ecosystem services at the wider forest landscape scale.

TI  - Landscape Genetics
PY  - 2008
AB  - This is the accepted manuscript of an article published by the Oxford University Press.Landscape genetics is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field integrating approaches from population genetics and landscape ecology. In the context of habitat fragmentation, the current focus of landscape genetics is on assessing the degree to which landscapes facilitate the movement of organisms (landscape connectivity) by relating gene flow patterns to landscape structure. Neutral genetic variation among individuals or direct estimates of current gene flow are statistically related to landscape characteristics such as the presence of hypothesized barriers or the least-cost distance for an organism to move from one habitat patch to another, given the nature of the intervening matrix or habitat types. In the context of global change, a future challenge of landscape genetics lies in addressing the spread of adaptive variation across landscapes. Genome scans combined with genetic sample collection along environmental gradients or in different habitat types aim at identifying molecular markers that are statistically related to specific environmental conditions, indicating adaptive genetic variation. The landscape genetics of adaptive variation may also help to answer the fundamental evolutionary question of the collective evolution of populations

TI  - Factors influencing occurrence of a freshwater turtle in an urban landscape: a resilient species?
PY  - 2014
AB  - Context Species vary broadly in their ability to adapt to urbanisation. Freshwater turtles are vulnerable to the loss and degradation of terrestrial and aquatic habitat in urban environments. There have been few publications investigating impacts of urbanisation on freshwater turtles in Australia. Aims We investigated the effects of urbanisation on the distribution and abundance of the eastern long-necked turtle (Chelodina longicollis) in greater Melbourne. Methods We examined occurrence and relative abundance of C. longicollis at 55 wetlands across an urban–rural gradient in relation to site- and landscape-level factors. Occupancy was modelled using the program PRESENCE, and incorporated landscape and habitat covariates. A negative binomial regression model was used to examine the influence of landscape and habitat factors on relative abundance by using WinBUGS. Key results C. longicollis occupied 85% of the 55 wetlands we surveyed, and we found no evidence that wetland occupancy was influenced by the variables we measured. However, relative abundance was highest at wetlands with low water conductivity and heavy metal pollution, and in wetlands furthest from rivers. Conclusions C. longicollis appears to be resilient to urbanisation and is likely to persist in urban landscapes, possibly because of the creation of new wetlands in Australian cities. However, long-term studies focussed on demographic parameters, or survivorship, may elucidate as yet undetected effects of urbanisation. Although no specific management recommendations may be necessary for C. longicollis in urban areas at this time, this species may be in decline in non-urban areas as a result of climatic changes and wetland drying. Implications Our findings suggest that caution is required before drawing generalised conclusions on the impacts of urbanisation on turtles, as the effects are likely to be species-specific, dependent on specific ecology and life-history requirements. Further studies are required to ascertain these relationships for a wider array of species and over longer time spans.

TI  - Area Delineation and Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of Urban Heat Island in Lanzhou City, China Using Remote Sensing Imagery
PY  - 2015
AB  - One of the key impacts of rapid urbanization on the environment is the effect of urban heat island (UHI). By using the Landsat TM/ETM+ thermal infrared remote sensing data of 1993, 2001 and 2011 to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of Lanzhou City, and by adopting object-oriented fractal net evolution approach (FNEA) to make image segmentation of the LST, the UHI elements were extracted. The G* index spatial aggregation analysis was made to calculate the urban heat island ratio index (URI), and the landscape metrics were used to quantify the changes of the spatial pattern of the UHI from the aspects of quantity, shape and structure. The impervious surface distribution and vegetation coverage were extracted by a constrained linear spectral mixture model to explore the relationships of the impervious surface distribution and vegetation coverage with the UHI. The information of urban built-up area was extracted by using UBI (NDBI-NDVI) index, and the effects of urban expansion on city thermal environment were quantitatively analyzed, with the URI and the LST grade maps built. In recent 20 years, the UHI effect in Lanzhou City was strengthened, with the URI increased by 1.4 times. The urban expansion had a spatiotemporal consistency with the UHI expansion. The patch number and density of the UHI landscape were increased, the patch shape and the whole landscape tended to be complex, the landscape became more fragmented, and the landscape connectivity was decreased. The heat island strength had a negative linear correlation with the urban vegetation coverage, and a positive logarithmic correlation with the urban impervious surface coverage.

TI  - Combining a dispersal model with network theory to assess habitat connectivity
PY  - 2010
AB  - Assessing the potential for threatened species to persist and spread within fragmented landscapes requires the identification of core areas that can sustain resident populations and dispersal corridors that can link these core areas with isolated patches of remnant habitat. We developed a set of GIS tools, simulation methods, and network analysis procedures to assess potential landscape connectivity for the Delmarva fox squirrel (DFS; Sciurus niger cinereus), an endangered species inhabiting forested areas on the Delmarva Peninsula, USA. Information on the DFS's life history and dispersal characteristics, together with data on the composition and configuration of land cover on the peninsula, were used as input data for an individual-based model to simulate dispersal patterns of millions of squirrels. Simulation results were then assessed using methods from graph theory, which quantifies habitat attributes associated with local and global connectivity. Several bottlenecks to dispersal were identified that were not apparent from simple distance-based metrics, highlighting specific locations for landscape conservation, restoration, and/or squirrel translocations. Our approach links simulation models, network analysis, and available field data in an efficient and general manner, making these methods useful and appropriate for assessing the movement dynamics of threatened species within landscapes being altered by human and natural disturbances.

TI  - Factors affecting the permeability of transportation and riparian corridors to the movements of songbirds in an urban landscape
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. Linear features associated with transportation and riparian corridors are known to inhibit the mobility of birds and other wildlife, yet the factors contributing to their barrier effects are poorly understood. The diversity of roads in urban landscapes provides an opportunity for elucidating the relative importance of factors such as noise, traffic volume, gap width and adjacent vegetation on animal movement. 2. Using an avian mobbing call as a lure, we tested the willingness of forest songbirds to cross four types of linear features in the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada: (1) roads of varying widths and traffic volumes, (2) conventional railways and light transit lines, (3) transportation bridges across riparian corridors, and (4) rivers. 3. Using mixed effects logistic regression, we found that the size of the gap in vegetation was the most important determinant of movement (P < 0·001). As the gap in vegetation exceeded 30 m, the likelihood of movement decreased dramatically and by 45 m, birds were only half as likely to move across gaps as they were to move an equivalent distance in continuous tree cover. Traffic volume also had a significant dampening effect on movement (odds ratio = 0·952 per 1000 vehicle per day increase; P < 0·001) and generally explained more variation in the data than noise levels. 4. Railroads proved to be the most permeable of the features we tested, probably owing to their relatively narrow width, which never exceeded 30 m. Surprisingly, rivers were less permeable than the anthropogenic linear features we tested, with a significant barrier effect evident even at widths <50 m. 5. The birds in our study showed a marked preference for flying over, rather than under, transportation bridges, particularly when adjacent vegetation was available. 6.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that linear features, both anthropogenic and natural, can significantly impede the movements of forest songbirds and that managing adjacent vegetation is a potentially effective way to mitigate these barrier effects in cities and other fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Integrative approach for landscape-based graph connectivity analysis: a case study with the common frog (Rana temporaria) in human-dominated landscapes
PY  - 2012
AB  - Graph-based analysis is a promising approach for analyzing the functional and structural connectivity of landscapes. In human-shaped landscapes, species have become vulnerable to land degradation and connectivity loss between habitat patches. Movement across the landscape is a key process for species survival that needs to be further investigated for heterogeneous human-dominated landscapes. The common frog (Rana temporaria) was used as a case study to explore and provide a graph connectivity analysis framework that integrates habitat suitability and dispersal responses to landscape permeability. The main habitat patches influencing habitat availability and connectivity were highlighted by using the software Conefor Sensinode 2.2. One of the main advantages of the presented graph-theoretical approach is its ability to provide a large choice of variables to be used based on the study’s assumptions and knowledge about target species. Based on dispersal simulation modelling in potential suitable habitat corridors, three distinct patterns of nodes connections of differing importance were revealed. These patterns are locally influenced by anthropogenic barriers, landscape permeability, and habitat suitability. And they are affected by different suitability and availability gradients to maximize the best possible settlement by the common frog within a terrestrial habitat continuum. The study determined the key role of landscape-based approaches for identifying the “availability-suitability-connectivity” patterns from a local to regional approach to provide an operational tool for landscape planning.

TI  - A southern California freeway is a physical and social barrier to gene flow in carnivores.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Roads present formidable barriers to dispersal. We examine movements of two highly mobile carnivores across the Ventura Freeway near Los Angeles, one of the busiest highways in the United States. The two species, bobcats and coyotes, can disappear from habitats isolated and fragmented by roads, and their ability to disperse across the Ventura Freeway tests the limits of vertebrates to overcome anthropogenic obstacles. We combine radiotelemetry data and genetically based assignments to identify individuals that have crossed the freeway. Although the freeway is a significant barrier to dispersal, we find that carnivores can cross the freeway and that 5–32% of sampled carnivores crossed over a 7-year period. However, despite moderate levels of migration, populations on either side of the freeway are genetically differentiated, and coalescent modelling shows their genetic isolation is consistent with a migration fraction less than 0.5% per generation. These results imply that individuals that cross the freeway rarely reproduce. Highways and development impose artificial home range boundaries on territorial and reproductive individuals and hence decrease genetically effective migration. Further, territory pile-up at freeway boundaries may decrease reproductive opportunities for dispersing individuals that do manage to cross. Consequently, freeways are filters favouring dispersing individuals that add to the migration rate but little to gene flow. Our results demonstrate that freeways can restrict gene flow even in wide-ranging species and suggest that for territorial animals, migration levels across anthropogenic barriers need to be an order of magnitude larger than commonly assumed to counteract genetic differentiation.

TI  - Quantifying the spatial ecology of wide-ranging marine species in the Gulf of California: implications for marine conservation planning.
PY  - 2011
AB  - There is growing interest in systematic establishment of marine protected area (MPA) networks and representative conservation sites. This movement toward networks of no-take zones requires that reserves are deliberately and adequately spaced for connectivity. Here, we test the network functionality of an ecoregional assessment configuration of marine conservation areas by evaluating the habitat protection and connectivity offered to wide-ranging fauna in the Gulf of California (GOC, Mexico). We first use expert opinion to identify representative species of wide-ranging fauna of the GOC. These include leopard grouper, hammerhead sharks, California brown pelicans and green sea turtles. Analyzing habitat models with both structural and functional connectivity indexes, our results indicate that the configuration includes large proportions of biologically important habitat for the four species considered (25–40%), particularly, the best quality habitats (46–57%). Our results also show that connectivity levels offered by the conservation area design for these four species may be similar to connectivity levels offered by the entire Gulf of California, thus indicating that connectivity offered by the areas may resemble natural connectivity. The selected focal species comprise different life histories among marine or marine-related vertebrates and are associated with those habitats holding the most biodiversity values (i.e. coastal habitats); our results thus suggest that the proposed configuration may function as a network for connectivity and may adequately represent the marine megafauna in the GOC, including the potential connectivity among habitat patches. This work highlights the range of approaches that can be used to quantify habitat protection and connectivity for wide-ranging marine species in marine reserve networks.

TI  - Widespread genetic connectivity of feral pigeons across the Northeastern megacity.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urbanization may restrict, facilitate, or have no effect on gene flow, depending on the organism and extent of urbanization. In human commensals, with high dispersal ability, urbanization can facilitate gene flow by providing continuous suitable habitat across a wide range. Additionally, suburban or rural areas with lower human population density may act as a barrier to gene flow for these human commensals. Spatial population genetic approaches provide a means to understand genetic connectivity across geographically expansive areas that encompass multiple metropolitan areas. Here, we examined the spatial genetic patterns of feral pigeons (Columba livia) living in cities in the eastern United States. We focused our sampling on the Northeastern megacity, which is a region covering six large cities (Boston, Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC). We performed ddRAD-Seqon 473 samples, recovered 35,200 SNPs, and then used multiple evolutionary clustering analyses to investigate population structuring. These analyses revealed that pigeons formed two genetic clusters-a northern cluster containing samples from Boston and Providence and a southern cluster containing all other samples. This substructuring is possibly due to reduced urbanization across coastal Connecticut that separates Boston and Providence from New York and mid-Atlantic cities. We found that pairs of pigeons within 25 km are highly related (Mantel r = 0.217, p = .001) and that beyond 50 km, pigeons are no more related than they would be at random. Our analysis detected higher-than-expected gene flow under an isolation by distance model within each city. We conclude that the extreme urbanization characteristic of the Northeastern megacity is likely facilitating gene flow in feral pigeons.

TI  - A Multiscale Network Analysis of Protected-Area Connectivity for Mammals in the United States
PY  - 2010
AB  - Protected areas must be close, or connected, enough to allow for the preservation of large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes, such as gene flow, migration, and range shifts in response to climate change. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether the network of protected areas in the United States is connected in a way that will preserve biodiversity over large temporal and spatial scales. It is also unclear whether protected-area networks that function for larger species will function for smaller species. We assessed the connectivity of protected areas in the three largest biomes in the United States. With methods from graph theory--a branch of mathematics that deals with connectivity and flow--we identified and measured networks of protected areas for three different groups of mammals. We also examined the value of using umbrella species (typically large-bodied, far-ranging mammals) in designing large-scale networks of protected areas. Although the total amount of protected land varied greatly among biomes in the United States, overall connectivity did not. In general, protected-area networks were well connected for large mammals but not for smaller mammals. Additionally, it was not possible to predict connectivity for small mammals on the basis of connectivity for large mammals, which suggests the umbrella species approach may not be an appropriate design strategy for conservation networks intended to protect many species. Our findings indicate different strategies should be used to increase the likelihood of persistence for different groups of species. Strategic linkages of existing lands should be a conservation priority for smaller mammals, whereas conservation of larger mammals would benefit most from the protection of more land.

TI  - A survey and overview of habitat fragmentation experiments.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Habitat destruction and fragmentation are the root causes of many conservation problems. We conducted a literature survey and canvassed the ecological community to identify experimental studies of terrestrial habitat fragmentation and to determine whether consistent themes were emerging from these studies. Our survey revealed 20 fragmentation experiments worldwide. Most studies focused on effects of fragmentation on species richness or on the abundance(s) ofparticular species. Other important themes were the effect offragmentation in interspecific interactions, the role of corridors and landscape connectivity in in- dividual movements and species richness, and the influences of edge effects on ecosystem services. Our com- parisons showed a remarkable lack of consistency in results across studies, especially with regard to species richness and abundance relative to fragment size. Experiments with arthropods showed the best fit with the- oretical expectations of greater species richness on larger fragments. Highly mobile taxa such as birds and mammals, early-successional plant species, long-lived species, and generalist predators did not respond in the "expected" manner. Reasons for these discrepancies included edge effects, competitive release in the habitat fragments, and the spati.al scale of the experiments. One of the more consistently supported hypotheses was that movement and species richness are positively affected by corridors and connectivity, respectively. Tran- sient effects dominated many systems;,for example, crowding of individuals on fragments commonly was ob- served afterfragmentation, followed by a relaxation toward lower abundance in subsequentyears. The three long-term studies (?14 years) revealed strong patterns that would have been missed in short-term investiga- tions. Our results emphasize the wide range of species-specific responses to fragmentation, the need for eluci- dation of behavioral mechanisms affecting these responses, and the potentialfor changing responses to frag- mentation over time.

TI  - Effects of habitat fragmentation and road density on the distribution pattern of the moor frog Rana arvalis
PY  - 1998
AB  - 1. The effects of habitat fragmentation on the distribution pattern of the moor frog Rana arvalis were investigated. Also, the possible isolation effects of the road network were taken into account. 2. Indications were found that habitat fragmentation partly explains the distribution pattern of the moor frog. The statistical models showed a positive effect of pond size (or marsh area) and a negative effect of road density on the probability of occupation of a moorland pond. 3. Because of the strong correlation between habitat quality variables and isolation variables, no unambiguous effects of isolation, described as the amount of suitable terrestrial habitat (moorland) in the surroundings of a moorland pond in a radius of 100-2000 m, could be demonstrated. 4. Spatial differences in road density can play a role in the selection of optimal locations for nature protection areas. The regression model used in this study predicts a reduced occupation probability in 55% of the study area. In the part of the study area adjacent to a motorway, occupation probability is lowered to less than 30%. 5. European studies of habitat fragmentation on amphibian species revealed a mean distance between occupied ponds of <1 km in all studies. This could be a general rule of thumb for persistent amphibian populations. Effects of pond size on the probability of occupation were more variable. 6. When discussing the effects of habitat fragmentation on amphibians and other ground dwelling species, the negative effects of roads are often underestimated.

AB  - Landscape ecology concepts developed from terrestrial systems have recently emerged as theoretical and analytical frameworks that are equally useful for evaluating the ecological consequences of spatial patterns and structural changes in the submerged landscapes of coastal ecosystems. The benefits of applying a spatially-explicit perspective to resource management and restoration planning in the coastal zone are rapidly becoming apparent. This Theme Section on the application of landscape ecology to the estuarine and coastal environment emerged from a special symposium at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) 20th Biennial Conference (Estuaries and Coasts in a Changing World) held in Portland, Oregon, USA, in November 2009. The 7 contributions in this Theme Section collectively provide substantial insights into the current status and application of the landscape approach in shallow marine environments, and identify significant knowledge gaps, as well as potential directions for the future advancement of ‘seascape ecology’.

TI  - Ten years of pulling: Ecosystem recovery after long-term weed management in Garry oak savanna
PY  - 2019
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is the practice of assisting recovery in degraded ecological communities. The aims of restoration are typically broad, involving the reinstatement of composition, structure, function, and resilience to disturbances. One common restoration tactic in degraded urban systems is to control invasive species, relying on passive restoration for further ecosystem‐level recovery. Here, we test whether this is an effective restoration strategy in Garry oak savanna, a highly threatened and ecologically important community in the North American Pacific Northwest. In urban savanna patches surrounding Victoria, British Columbia, community members have been actively removing aggressive invasive exotic species for over a decade. Based on vegetation surveys from 2007, we tested ecosystem changes in structure, composition, and resilience (i.e., functional redundancy and response diversity) across 10 years of varied management levels. We expected higher levels of invasive species management would correspond with improvements to these ecosystem metrics. However, management explained little of the patterns found over the 10‐year‐period. Woody encroachment was a complicated process of native and exotic invasion, while resilience and compositional changes were most closely tied with landscape connectivity. Thus, though invasive species management may prevent further degradation, active restoration strategies after removal are likely required for recovery of the ecosystem.

TI  - Deforestation in central Chile causes a rapid decline in landscape connectivity for a forest specialist bird species
PY  - 2013
AB  - The abundance of woodland birds in fragmented forest landscapes may depend on the properties of patch networks. Understanding the consequences of deforestation on woodland birds, therefore, necessarily requires determining which changes in landscape structure make a major contribution to the degradation and subdivision of patch networks. In this study, we addressed how accelerated deforestation in central Chile has modified the landscape structure and function for thorn-tailed rayaditos—a woodland specialist bird. Using a graphical approach based on the habitat use and movement patterns of rayaditos, we quantified the reduction of the internal connectivity of components (i.e., connected patch networks) in the last two decades and determined the main mechanisms responsible for this connectivity loss. Forest cover decreased 61.7 % between 1989 and 2009. The component size, the fraction of components with ≥1 occupied patches and the number of patches per component experienced a large decline during the study period. Over time, most forest cover (ca. 80 %) was contained in only two components. The connectivity of components decreased steeply by 90 %. Only the loss of large patches made a highly significant contribution to explaining changes in connectivity, while the removal of stepping stones was marginally significant. The conversion of forest both to shrubland and to peri-urban areas were the only land-use variables explaining connectivity change with effects that changed over time. Conservation measures to ensure persistence of rayaditos populations in central Chile should be focused on the retention of key elements for connectivity.

TI  - Numerically Exploring Habitat Fragmentation Effects on Populations Using Cell-Based Coupled Map Lattices☆
PY  - 1999
AB  - Abstract We examine habitat size, shape, and arrangement effects on populations using a discrete reaction–diffusion model. Diffusion is modeled passively and applied to a cellular grid of territories forming a coupled map lattice. Dispersal mortality is proportional to the amount of nonhabitat and fully occupied habitat surrounding a given cell, with distance decay. After verifying that our model produces the results expected for single patches of uniform habitat, we investigate heterogeneous and fragmented model landscapes. In heterogeneous single-patch systems near critical patch size, populations approach Gaussian spatial distributions with total population constrained by the capacity of the most limiting cell. In fragmented habitat landscapes, threshold effects are more complex and parametrically sensitive. The results from our experiments suggest the following: the ability to achieve persistence in hyperdispersed patchy habitats by adding similarly fragmented patches requires meeting threshold reproduction rates; persistent metapopulations in which no local population is individually persistent appear when dispersal distances and reproduction rates are both high, but only within narrow parameter ranges that are close to extinction thresholds; successful use of stepping-stone patches to support metapopulation systems appears unlikely for passively diffusing species; elongated patches offer early colonization advantages, but blocky patches offer greater population resilience near extinction thresholds. A common theme running through our findings is that population viability estimates may depend on our ability to determine when population and habitat systems are approaching extinction threshold conditions.

TI  - Using GPS telemetry to validate least-cost modeling of gray squirrel ( Sciurus carolinensis) movement within a fragmented landscape
PY  - 2013
AB  - In Britain, the population of native red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris has suffered population declines and local extinctions. Interspecific resource competition and disease spread by the invasive gray squirrel Sciurus carolinensis are the main factors behind the decline. Gray squirrels have adapted to the British landscape so efficiently that they are widely distributed. Knowledge on how gray squirrels are using the landscape matrix and being able to predict their movements will aid management. This study is the first to use global positioning system (GPS) collars on wild gray squirrels to accurately record movements and land cover use within the landscape matrix. This data were used to validate Geographical Information System (GIS) least-cost model predictions of movements and provided much needed information on gray squirrel movement pathways and network use. Buffered least-cost paths and least-cost corridors provide predictions of the most probable movements through the landscape and are seen to perform better than the more expansive least-cost networks which include all possible movements. Applying the knowledge and methodologies gained to current gray squirrel expansion areas, such as Scotland and in Italy, will aid in the prediction of potential movement areas and therefore management of the invasive gray squirrel. The methodologies presented in this study could potentially be used in any landscape and on numerous species.

TI  - Landscape genetics of mountain lions (Puma concolor) in southern Brazil
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract It is suggested that mountain lions have suffered a bottleneck and lost their genetic diversity in an area in southern Brazil. In this study, we correlated landscape connectivity and patterns of gene flow to identify landscape permeability and possible sources of migrants for the population of mountain lions in southern Brazil, using circuit theory. Population structure was analyzed with Bayesian methods, and density and parentage relationships were also estimated, to evaluate the population genetic profile. We did not find genetic structure between samples, and landscape analysis indicated that all individuals were connected by areas that are permeable to mountain lion movements. The estimated population density was low, 0.09 and 0.32 mountain lions/100 km 2 ( N e / N = 0.11 and N e / N = 0.4, respectively). Parentage results indicated that individuals killed in the same spot were not related, suggesting that mountain lions are still able to disperse through the landscape. Evidence indicates that severe habitat loss and consequent illegal hunting were responsible for a bottleneck and consequent loss of genetic variability, we demonstrated that the landscape still allows mountain lions to move, and that protected areas in southern Brazil may be acting as a source of migrants. This information indicates that conservation actions to reduce illegal hunting and to monitor protected areas are important to understand the impact of hunted areas on source areas.

TI  - Evaluation of Ecosystem Services related to Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity (BELC) for land use decision making across different planning scales
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Landscape connectivity is of paramount importance not only in maintaining both functionality and resilience of social-ecological systems, but also in providing Ecosystem Services (ESs). Despite recent efforts, several issues still need to be faced to fully integrate ESs evaluation relating to landscape connectivity into effective plans and environmental assessment procedures. Choosing an appropriate scale of analysis is one of the most problematic topics, since it can profoundly affect the evaluation of single patch contribution to global connectivity. Moreover, the effect of different scales on ESs assessment based on spatial modelling has not yet been investigated. In this paper, an innovative approach to the assessment of Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity (BELC) and related ESs for Biodiversity conservation, is presented, based on the PANDORA 3.0 landscape evolution model. A new index (dMtot) for the evaluation of each patch's contribution to global BELC is proposed and employed to build a new formulation for the assessment of ESs in monetary terms. A set of Non Urbanized Areas (NUAs) is therefore analyzed in the Metropolitan area of Bari (Southern Italy) across three planning scales commonly adopted in planning practice. The results bring to light the sensitivity of evaluation to the choice of scale, underlining the need to consider a higher level of analysis when local plans are drawn up for land use decision making. A thorough evaluation of this larger extension could therefore require more resources. As a result, modelling approaches that are less data and time consuming would become even more necessary. In this view, the PANDORA 3.0 model could provide a valid and reliable support, since it uses data that are usually available to land managers (e.g. land cover/land use maps, soil maps, Digital Elevation Models). Moreover, it could also be employed to assess land use scenarios at different scales relatively quickly. Limits of the current approaches and research challenges are then discussed. The final goal of the article is to provide an additional tool, which will allow ESs and Landscape Ecology concepts to be integrated not only into assessment procedures (e.g. EIA, SEA) but also into landscape and urban planning practice.

TI  - Population connectivity and genetic diversity of American marten ( Martes americana ) in the United States northern Rocky Mountains in a climate change context
PY  - 2012
AB  - Climate change is likely to alter population connectivity, particularly for species associated with higher elevation environments. The goal of this study is to predict the potential effects of future climate change on population connectivity and genetic diversity of American marten populations across a 30.2 million hectare region of the in the US northern Rocky Mountains. We use a landscape resistance model validated from empirical landscape genetics modeling to predict the current and expected future extent and fragmentation of American marten dis- persal habitat under five climate change scenarios, corre- sponding to climatic warming of between 0.7 and 3.3 C, consistent with expected climate change by year 2080. We predict the regions of the current and future landscapes where gene flow is expected to be governed by isolation by distance and the regions where population fragmentation is expected to limit gene flow. Finally, we predict changes in the strength and location of predicted movement corridors, fracture zones and the location of dispersal barriers across the study area in each scenario. We found that under the current climate, gene flow is predicted to be limited primarily by distance (isolation), and landscape structure does not significantly limit gene flow, resulting in very high genetic diversity over most of the study area. Projected climatic warming substantially reduces the extent and increases the fragmentation of marten populations in the western and northwestern parts of the study area. In con- trast, climate change is not predicted to fragment the extensive higher elevation mountain massifs in central Idaho, the northern U.S. continental divide, and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. In addition, we show locations in the study area that are important corridors in the current landscape that remain intact across the climate change scenarios.

TI  - A Comparison of Corridors and Intrinsic Connectivity to Promote Dispersal in Transient Successional Landscapes
PY  - 1997
AB  - Low-vagility organisms that specialize on transitory successional habitats may be especially dependent upon habitat connectivity to maintain population viability. We analyzed the theoretical intrinsic connectivity of successional landscapes (i.e., the natural juxtaposition of similar habitats that allows dispersal) as a function of patch geometry coupled with the disperser’s habitat specificity. Habitat specialists living in poorly connected landscapes (approximating hexagonal patches) have only a 26.5% chance of colonizing a new site when their resident patch becomes unsuitable. In contrast, generalists living in well connected landscapes can virtually always colonize a new site when needed. We infer from our simulation that for some habitat specialists, such as the rare, endemic Florida scrub lizard (Sceloporus woodi), anthropogenic control of successional dynamics for commercial logging may significantly reduce intrinsic connectivity. Lizard population viability may now depend upon the extrinsic connectivity provided by artificial corridors. However, the use of corridors will not serve as a general solution to the problem of anthropogenically reduced intrinsic connectivity until key logistical design problems have been resolved. Moreover, efforts to enhance intrinsic connectivity by modifying patch geometry may produce undesirable edge effects and conflict with old-growth preservation. Future research should focus on developing spatially explicit corridor models, documenting natural levels of intrinsic connectivity, quantifying anthropogenic disruption of natural connectivity, and describing species-specific mechanisms of inter-patch dispersal. Organismos de baja dispersion que se especializan en habitats sucesionales transitorios pueden depender especialmente de la conectividad del habitat para mantener su viabilidad poblacional. Analizamos la conectividad intrinseca teorica de paisajes sucesionales (i.e., la yuxtaposicion natural de habitats similares que permite la dispersion) como una funcion de geometria de parches combinada con la especificidad de habitat del dispersante. Los especialistas que viven en paisajes mal conectados (cercanos a parches hexagonales) solo tienen una probabilidad de 26.5% de colonizar un nuevo sitio cuando su parche deja de ser adecuado. En contraste, los generalistas que viven en paisajes bien conectados virtualmente pueden siempre colonizar un nuevo sitio cuando necesario. De nuestra simulacion, inferimos que, para algunos especialistas como la rara y endenuca kagartuha de Florida (Sceloporus woodi), el control antropogenico de la dinamica sucesional con fines comerciales puede reducir la conectividad intrinseca significativamente. La viabilidad poblacional de lagartijas puede entonces depender de la conectividad extrinseca proporcionada por corredores artificiales. Sin embargo, el uso de corredores no sera una solucion general al problema de la reduccion antropogenica de la conectividad intrinseca hasta que se resuelvan algunos problemas claves de diseno logistico. Mas aun, los esfuerzos para incrementar la conectividad intrinseca mediante la modificacion de la geometria de parche pueden tener efectos colaterales indeseables y chocar con la preservacion de bosques maduros. Investigaciones futuras deben enforcarse a desarrollar modelos de corredores espacialmente explicitos, a documentar niveles naturales de conectividad intrinseca, cuantificar la transformacion antropogenica de la conectividad natural y en la descripcion de mecanismos especifos de dispersion entre parches.

TI  - Assessing functional connectivity using empirical data
PY  - 2008
AB  - The potential for connectivity to impact populations in heterogeneous landscapes, and the obvious implications for conservation biology, has led to increasing interest in connectivity and a proliferation of connectivity measures. Despite the pivotal role of this measure in ecology, however, there is no generally accepted and employed formal definition of connectivity. In addition, despite the strong desire from conservationists, who are increasingly asked to design and implement corridor plans, empirically determining measures of movement and dispersal, and assessing connectivity from field data remain challenging tasks in spatial ecology. Here I summarize the current use of connectivity concepts in terms of both metapopulation and landscape ecology, and present recently developed promising techniques in spatial ecology, such as graph theory, pattern-oriented modeling, and state–space modeling, which will help to improve assessment of species-centered or functional connectivity based on empirical data.

TI  - Using circuit theory to model connectivity in ecology, evolution, and conservation.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Connectivity among populations and habitats is important for a wide range of ecological processes. Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efficient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.

TI  - The effects of landscape composition and physiognomy on metapopulation size : the role of corridors
PY  - 1997
AB  - We develop and analyze a model that examines the effects of corridor quality, quantity, and arrangement on metapopulation sizes. These ideas were formerly investigated by Lefkovitch and Fahrig (1985) and Henein and Merriam (1990). Our simulations provide results similar to the Henein and Merriam model, indicating that the quality of corridors in a landscape and their arrangement will influence the size of a metapopulation. We then go one step further, describing how corridor arrangement alters the metapopulation, and provide a method for predicting which corridor arrangements should support larger metapopulations. In contrast to the Henein and Merriam model, we find that the number of corridor connections has no influence on the size of a metapopulation in a landscape unless there is an accompanying change in the uniformity of the distribution of corridor connections among patches.

TI  - Patchy Landscapes and Animal Movements: Do Beetles Percolate?
PY  - 1997
AB  - Simple neutral percolation models of ecological landscapes predict a critical threshold of landscape connectivity at ca 60% coverage of cells that are permeable to movement. Using such models as an inspiration, we conducted a field experiment in which we employed an experimental model system of tenebrionid beetles (Eleodes obsoleta) moving through mosaics of grass and bare ground in which grass coverage was systematically varied from 0% to 80% in a random pattern. Three parameters of beetle movement pathways (mean step length, mean vector length, and net displacement rate) all showed a sharp reduction between 0% and 20% grass cover and no differences over further 20% coverage increments; the mean fractal dimension of pathways (which could not be derived for the 0% coverage treatment) also did not differ with increasing grass coverage from 20% to 80%. The proportion of time spent by beetles in grass patches did not increase with increasing grass coverage, although individuals spent significantly more time steps in grass in the 20% grass-cover treatment than would be expected by chance. The distance moved per time step was greater when beetles moved over bare ground than in grass, but the mean step length while on grass was significantly lower when grass constituted only 20% of the experimental landscape than when more grass was present, perhaps because beetles stopped more frequently on grass when little of it was present. The threshold in beetle movement through the experimental landscapes differed markedly from that predicted by simple neutral percolation models, probably because, in contrast to the models, both cover types were permeable to beetle movements and individuals moved nonrandomly. The results of this experiment indicate that definitions of landscape connectivity depend on both the spatial pattern of the landscape and how individuals move within and among patches. Moreover, it appears that movement patterns within a particular patch may be contingent on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. As a consequence, a land-cover map alone may not predict whether, to a particular kind of organism, a landscape is fragmented or connected, and the spatial distribution of individuals in a population may not map closely onto the distribution of suitable habitat patches. This finding suggests that assessments of metapopulation structure must consider both overall landscape patterns and the nonlinear responses of organisms to such patterns.

TI  - Understanding the importance of dynamic landscape connectivity
PY  - 2020
AB  - Landscape connectivity is increasingly promoted as a conservation tool to combat the negative effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, and climate change. Given its importance as a key conservation strategy, connectivity science is a rapidly growing discipline. However, most landscape connectivity models consider connectivity for only a single snapshot in time, despite the widespread recognition that landscapes and ecological processes are dynamic. In this paper, we discuss the emergence of dynamic connectivity and the importance of including dynamism in connectivity models and assessments. We outline dynamic processes for both structural and functional connectivity at multiple spatiotemporal scales and provide examples of modeling approaches at each of these scales. We highlight the unique challenges that accompany the adoption of dynamic connectivity for conservation management and planning in the context of traditional conservation prioritization approaches. With the increased availability of time series and species movement data, computational capacity, and an expanding number of empirical examples in the literature, incorporating dynamic processes into connectivity models is more feasible than ever. Here, we articulate how dynamism is an intrinsic component of connectivity and integral to the future of connectivity science.

TI  - Optimal width of movement corridors for root voles : not too marrow and not too wide
PY  - 1996
AB  - 1. The characteristics of male root vole movements as a function of corridor width were tested in a 310 m long habitat corridor connecting two habitat patches. Detailed observations of movements were made by means of radiotelemetry and recording of footprints. 2. The highest connectivity, in terms of transference rate of individuals in the corridor system, was observed in the intermediate of three corridor widths tested (3 m, 1 m and 0.4 m). 3. The behavioural mechanism behind the lower connectivity of the narrowest corridor was a reluctance of voles to enter it, while linear progress in the widest corridor was hampered by a high frequency of cross-directional movements. 4. The relationship between corridor width and movement behaviour was unaffected by the simulated presence of competitors and predators. 5. Our results challenge the 'the-wider-the-better' principle of movement corridor design, and provide elements for an understanding of the behavioural mechanisms underlying the movement ecology of individuals in linear habitats.

TI  - Landform Effects on Ecosystem Patterns and Processes
PY  - 1988
AB  - U nderstanding the form, behavior, and historical context of landscapes is crucial to understanding ecosystems on several temporal and spatial scales. Landforms, such as floodplains and alluvial fans, and geomorphic processes, such as stream erosion and deposition, are important parts of the setting in which ecosystems develop and material and energy flows take place. Over the long term, geomorphic processes create landforms; over a shorter term, landforms are boundary conditions controlling the spatial arrangement and rates of geomorphic processes. Ecosystems respond to both landforms and geomorphic processes. The history of geomorphic processes may be expressed directly in the composition and structure of vegetation, where geomorphic events and vegetation develop together. Geomorphic processes operating before the establishment of existing vegetation, or those subtly coexisting with the vegetation, may have their greatest influence on vegetation through controlling patterns of soil properties across a landscape, as in toposequences

TI  - Landscape connectivity for wildlife: development and validation of multispecies linkage maps
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary The ability to identify regions of high functional connectivity for multiple wildlife species is of conservation interest with respect to habitat management and corridor planning. We present a method that does not require independent, field-collected data, is insensitive to the placement of source and destination sites (nodes) for modeling connectivity, and does not require the selection of a focal species. In the first step of our approach, we created a cost surface that represented permeability of the landscape to movement for a suite of species. We randomly selected nodes around the perimeter of the buffered study area and used circuit theory to connect pairs of nodes. When the buffer was removed, the resulting current density map represented, for each grid cell, the probability of use by moving animals. We found that using nodes that were randomly located around the perimeter of the buffered study area was less biased by node placement than randomly selecting nodes within the study area. We also found that a buffer of ≥ 20% of the study area width was sufficient to remove the effects of node placement on current density. We tested our method by creating a map of connectivity in the Algonquin to Adirondack region in eastern North America, and we validated the map with independently collected data. We found that amphibians and reptiles were more likely to cross roads in areas of high current density, and fishers (Pekania [Martes] pennanti) used areas with high current density within their home ranges. Our approach provides an efficient and cost effective method of predicting areas with relatively high landscape connectivity for multiple species..

TI  - Future options in landscape ecology: development and research:
PY  - 2009
AB  - The aim of this brief overview is to highlight some new and promising research fields in landscape ecology, which is essentially an interdisciplinary field of study. We also analyse the development of some classical branches of landscape ecology regarding pattern and process relationships at broad spatial and temporal scales, such as landscape metrics, the influence of anthropogenic factors and global climate change on landscape development, the fragmentation of ecosystems and disturbances of populations, and material and energy cycling in and between ecosystems.

TI  - Connectivity measures: a review
PY  - 2008
AB  - One of the central problems in contemporary ecology and conservation biology is the drastic change of landscapes induced by anthropogenic activities, resulting in habitat loss and fragmentation. For many wild living species, local extinctions of fragmented populations are common and recolonization is critical for regional survival. Successful recolonization depends on the availability of dispersing individuals and the degree of landscape connectivity. The obvious implications of landscape connectivity for conservation biology have led to a proliferation of connectivity measures. However, general relationships between landscape connectivity and landscape structure are lacking, and so are the relationships between different connectivity metrics. Consequently, there is a need to develop landscape metrics that more accurately characterize the landscape with an emphasis on the underlying processes. Here we review various definitions of landscape connectivity, explain their mathematical connotations, and make some unifying conclusions and suggestions for future research.

TI  - Yards increase forest connectivity in urban landscapes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Tree canopy connectivity is important for supporting biodiversity. In urban landscapes, empirical examinations of habitat connectivity often overlook residential land, though yards and gardens often comprise a large portion of urban forests. We quantify structural composition (patches and paths), connectivity and fragmentation of an entire tree canopy network spanning 1220 Boston’s neighborhoods to assess the configuration of the urban forest potentially affecting tree-dependent wildlife species, such as some birds and arboreal mammals. The urban landscape was classified by land use, and residential yards were further subdivided into front yards, backyards, and corner yards. Structural composition, connectivity and fragmentation of the tree canopy was assessed using morphological spatial pattern and network analysis. Canopy metrics were then related to the land use of 349,305 property parcels. Back yard tree canopy cover was 65.23%. The majority of canopy links were on residential land (60.95% total), and particularly in backyards. Back yards contained the highest number of canopy fragments (48.65% total). Fragmentation of the canopy network peaked at ~ 23% of total canopy cover. Canopy fragmentation, distance among patches and their shape complexity were lower in neighborhoods with more tree canopy. The important role that yards have in sustaining canopy connectivity across urban landscapes poses challenges and opportunities. Urban land management and planning need to protect connectivity links within urban forests when located on private residential realm. A prioritization strategy aimed at expanding urban tree cover could focus on yards to ensure that urban landscape connectivity is maintained and increased.

TI  - Combining Measures of Dispersal to Identify Conservation Strategies in Fragmented Landscapes
PY  - 2011
AB  - Understanding the way in which habitat fragmentation disrupts animal dispersal is key to identifying effective and efficient conservation strategies. To differentiate the potential effectiveness of 2 frequently used strategies for increasing the connectivity of populations in fragmented landscapes-corridors and stepping stones-we combined 3 complimentary methods: behavioral studies at habitat edges, mark-recapture, and genetic analyses. Each of these methods addresses different steps in the dispersal process that a single intensive study could not address. We applied the 3 methods to the case study of Atrytonopsis new species 1, a rare butterfly endemic to a partially urbanized stretch of barrier islands in North Carolina (U.S.A.). Results of behavioral analyses showed the butterfly flew into urban and forested areas, but not over open beach; mark-recapture showed that the butterfly dispersed successfully through short stretches of urban areas ( 5 km) were a dispersal barrier, but shorter stretches of urban areas (≤5 km) were not. Although results from all 3 methods indicated natural features in the landscape, not urbanization, were barriers to dispersal, when we combined the results we could determine where barriers might arise: forests restricted dispersal for the butterfly only when there were long stretches with no habitat. Therefore, urban areas have the potential to become a dispersal barrier if their extent increases, a finding that may have gone unnoticed if we had used a single approach. Protection of stepping stones should be sufficient to maintain connectivity for Atrytonopsis new species 1 at current levels of urbanization. Our research highlights how the use of complementary approaches for studying animal dispersal in fragmented landscapes can help identify conservation strategies.

TI  - Dispersal and connectivity in metapopulations
PY  - 1991
AB  - This paper reviews characteristics of dispersal that influence metapopulation functioning, such as releasing factors, density dependence, timing and types and health of dispersers. Economic thresholds, intraspecific conflicts and avoidance ofinbreeding are often regarded as the key ultimate or proximate (or both) causes of dispersal, but there is no consensus aboutthe most important mechanisms. Dispersing individuals are often considered to differ genetically from the residents but goodsupporting evidence has only been presented for some insect species. Sex and age differences in dispersal rates are mostcommon in polygamous species and in long-lived species with many litters per female. A bimodal distribution of dispersaldistances, earlier thought to be a common pattern, is probably an artifact, caused by habitat heterogeneity and varyingsurvival of settled individuals. Dispersal distances are longer in poor environments. Habitat specialists are more affected byboundaries during dispersal than generalists. Dispersal just before or during the early reproductive season is common incertain species occupying early successional habitats. Dispersal increased both population and metapopulation size andpersistence in plants, insects and small mammals.

TI  - The application of graph theory and percolation analysis for assessing change in the spatial configuration of pond networks
PY  - 2017
AB  - Pond networks support high levels of biodiversity when compared to other freshwater ecosystems such as rivers, lakes and streams. The persistence of species in these small, sometimes ephemeral, aquatic habitats depends on the dispersal of individuals among ponds in the landscape. However, the number of ponds across the landscape is at a historical low as urbanisation and intensified agricultural practices have led to a substantial loss of ponds (nodes in the pond network) over more than a century. Here, we examine the extent and drivers of pond loss in a heavily urbanised landscape (Birmingham, UK) over 105 years and determine how pond loss influences key structural properties of the pond network using graph theoretic approaches. Specifically, we calculated minimum spanning trees (MST) and performed percolation analyses to determine changes in both the spatial configuration and resilience of the pond network through time. Pond numbers declined by 82% between ca1904 and 2009, such that pond density decreased from 7.1 km-2 to 1.3 km-2. The MST analyses revealed increased distance between ponds in the network (i.e. edge length increased) by up to 49% over the 105-year period, indicating that ponds in the modern landscape (2009) were considerably more isolated, with fewer neighbours. This study demonstrates that graph theory has an excellent potential to inform the management of pond networks in order to support ecological communities that are less vulnerable to environmental change.

TI  - Monitoring Urban Green Infrastructure Changes and Impact on Habitat Connectivity Using High-Resolution Satellite Data
PY  - 2020
AB  - In recent decades, the City of Stockholm, Sweden, has grown substantially and is now the largest city in Scandinavia. Recent urban growth is placing pressure on green areas within and around the city. In order to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services, green infrastructure is part of Stockholm municipal planning. This research quantifies land-cover change in the City of Stockholm between 2003 and 2018 and examines what impact urban growth has had on its green infrastructure. Two 2018 WorldView-2 images and three 2003 QuickBird-2 images were used to produce classifications of 11 land-cover types using object-based image analysis and a support vector machine algorithm with spectral, geometric and texture features. The classification accuracies reached over 90% and the results were used in calculations and comparisons to determine the impact of urban growth in Stockholm between 2003 and 2018, including the generation of land-cover change statistics in relation to administrative boundaries and green infrastructure. For components of the green infrastructure, i.e., habitat networks for selected sensitive species, habitat network analysis for the European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus) and common toad (Bufo bufo) was performed. Between 2003 and 2018, urban areas increased by approximately 4% while green areas decreased by 2% in comparison with their 2003 areal amounts. The most significant urban growth occurred through expansion of the transport network, paved surfaces and construction areas which increased by 12%, mainly at the expense of grassland and coniferous forest. Examination of urban growth within the green infrastructure indicated that most land area was lost in dispersal zones (28 ha) while the highest percent change was within habitat for species of conservation concern (14%). The habitat network analysis revealed that overall connectivity decreased slightly through patch fragmentation and areal loss mainly caused by road expansion on the outskirts of the city. The habitat network analysis also revealed which habitat areas are well-connected and which are most vulnerable. These results can assist policymakers and planners in their efforts to ensure sustainable urban development including sustaining biodiversity in the City of Stockholm.

TI  - Finding and Losing Host Plants by Phyllotreta: Patch Size and Surrounding Habitat
PY  - 1985
AB  - This study examined the effects of size and surrounding habitat of food plant patches on the density, immigration, and emigration of two specialized phytophagous insects. Two flea beetles, Phyllotreta cruciferae and P. striolata, were censused for 3 wk in host plant patches of four sizes, with background vegetation of three types. Densities of both beetle species declined with decreasing patch size. Single isolated host plants (collards) were without flea beetles because of high rates of emigration. By releasing and recapturing marked flea beetles, I found that the emigration rates of both beetle species consistently increased with decreasing patch size. This sensitivity of emigration to host patch size may be common among phytophagous insects because of simple changes in perimeter: area ratios. When this is the case there may be a "critical patch size" below which host islands do not sustain herbivore populations. Immigration rates were also affected by patch size and habitat, but only in P. striolata, not in P. cruciferae. Even in P. striolata, variation in immigration was less consistent and less dramatic than was variation in emigration. Beetles wandering out of patches apparently do not readily return to the host patch. To quantify how far beetles would have to wander before "losing" their host patch, I released marked beetles in two different habitats (a goldenrod field or a cultivated garden) at varying distances (2, 4, 6, or 8 m) from a target patch of collards. For both beetle species, the percentage of individuals discovering the collards after 1 d declined rapidly beyond 2 m and was dramatically reduced by the presence of goldenrod between released beetles and the collard target.

TI  - Illumination and the perception of remote habitat patches by white-footed mice.
PY  - 1999
AB  - Perceptual range, or the distance at which habitat 'patches' can be perceived, constrains an animal's informational window on a given landscape. If such constraints are great, they may limit successful dispersal between distant habitat patches. On dark nights, nocturnal white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, have surprisingly limited perceptual abilities regarding distant forested habitat. In fact, their ability to orient towards such habitat while travelling in a bare agricultural field indicates a perceptual range under 30 m. However, increasing illumination can increase perceptual range. For example, full moonlight extends the perceptual range of mice to about 60 m. Light levels at dusk (twilight) extend perceptual range still further to about 90 m. These results suggest that interpatch dispersal by white-footed mice would be more successful under greater illumination, but travelling under such conditions entails a considerable risk of predation. These mice might avoid such a conflict by travelling under the cover of darkness with the aid of information gathered remotely during relatively high illumination. We show that mice are indeed capable of such a 'look now and move later' strategy: mice retain directional information gained under bright conditions and maintain a previously determined bearing in conditions under which distant navigational stimuli may be largely absent (e.g. maximal darkness). Ultimately, a better understanding of the behavioural and ecological factors affecting the movements of animals across landscapes should produce a clearer picture of the interaction between landscape structure and population ecology.

TI  - Graph-theoretic connectivity measures: what do they tell us about connectivity?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Graph-theoretic connectivity analyses have received much attention in connectivity evaluation during the last few years. Here, we explore the underlying conceptual differences of various graph-theoretic connectivity measures. Based on connectivity analyses from three reserve networks in forested landscapes in Central Finland, we illustrate how these conceptual differences cause inconsistent connectivity evaluations at both the landscape and patch level. Our results also illustrate how the characteristics of the networks (patch density) may affect the performance of the different measures. Many of the connectivity measures react to changes in habitat connectivity in an ecologically undesirable manner. Patch prioritisations based on a node removal analysis were sensitive to the connectivity measure they were based on. The patch prioritisations derived from different measures showed a disparity in terms of how much weight they put on patch size versus patch location and how they value patch location. Although graphs operate at the interface of structure and function, there is still much to do for incorporating the inferred ecological process into graph structures and analyses. If graph analyses are going to be used for real-world management and conservation purposes, a more thorough understanding of the caveats and justifications of the graph-theoretic connectivity measures will be needed.

TI  - Movement patterns of the bush cricket Platycleis albopunctata in different types of habitat: matrix is not always matrix
PY  - 2003
AB  - . 1. Inter-patch movement is usually assumed to be homogeneous across a landscape. As the intervening area between suitable patches is usually richly textured, it cannot be assumed to be uniform in real landscapes. 2. In an experimental mark-and-resight study, the movement behaviour of the bush cricket Platycleis albopunctata in four habitat types as well as at the border between two of these habitat types was observed. 3. Analysis of recapture data indicated differences in mortality risk (or emigration rates) between habitat types. 4. When released at the border between suitable habitat and a crop field, P. albopunctata did not show a consistent preference for the suitable habitat. This suggests that the crop field is at least temporarily attractive for P. albopunctata. 5. Movement in suitable habitat was not always different from movement in the matrix, and movement between different types of matrix also differed. 6. The results indicate that the movement behaviour of P. albopunctata is influenced not only by suitability for breeding but also by structural resistance and other factors (e.g. food availability or habitat-specific mortality risk).

TI  - Focal Species: A Multi-Species Umbrella for Nature Conservation
PY  - 1997
AB  - To prevent the further loss of species from landscapes used for productive enterprises such as agri- culture, forestry, and grazing, it is necessary to determine the composition, quantity, and configuration of landscape elements required to meet the needs of the species present. I present a multi-species approach for de- fining the attributes required to meet the needs of the biota in a landscape and the management regimes that should be applied. The approach builds on the concept of umbrella species, whose requirements are believed to encapsulate the needs of other species. It identifies a suite of "focal species," each of which is used to define different spatial and compositional attributes that must be present in a landscape and their appropriate man- agement regimes. All species considered at risk are grouped according to the processes that threaten their per- sistence. These threats may include habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, weed invasion, and fire. Within each group, the species most sensitive to the threat is used to define the minimum acceptable level at which that threat can occur. For example, the area requirements of the species most limited by the availability of partic- ular habitats will define the minimum suitable area of those habitat types; the requirements of the most dis- persal-limited species will define the attributes of connecting vegetation; species reliant on critical resources will define essential compositional attributes; and species whose populations are limited by processes such as fire, predation, or weed invasion will define the levels at which these processes must be managed. For each rel- evant landscape parameter, the species with the most demanding requirements for that parameter is used to define its minimum acceptable value. Because the most demanding species are selected, a landscape designed and managed to meet their needs will encompass the requirements of all other species.

TI  - Landscape connectivity modeling from the perspective of animal dispersal
PY  - 2019
AB  - Dispersal plays a key role in linking populations, habitat (re)-colonization, and species range expansion. As fragmentation and habitat loss are ubiquitous threats and can disrupt dispersal, landscape connectivity modeling has become a valuable tool in conservation planning. We provide an overview of how current connectivity modeling has incorporated the different aspects of animal dispersal. We describe the most popular connectivity models and highlight their main assumptions related to dispersal, suggesting a series of questions that could clarify the advantages and disadvantages of using a particular approach. We review the structure of the connectivity models based on least-cost analysis, circuit theory, and the individual-based dispersal models. We use some studies as case examples to discuss how important elements of animal dispersal were considered through models to predict movement routes. Ongoing developments in connectivity modeling have made it possible to represent animal dispersal in a more realistic way by implementing key elements such as dispersal behaviors, mortality, and inter-individual variability. However, the potential to consider such elements and how this is done in connectivity modeling depends on the selected approach, since each model represents animal dispersal through a different perspective. We recommend that the choice of a connectivity model should be made after considering the study objectives, the species dispersal mechanism, and the prior knowledge available about it. By understanding and incorporating dispersal behavior into connectivity modeling, we can improve our capacity to generate useful information aimed to construct more effective conservation strategies.

TI  - Mapping behavioral landscapes for animal movement: a finite mixture modeling approach
PY  - 2013
AB  - Because of its role in many ecological processes, movement of animals in response to landscape features is an important subject in ecology and conservation biology. In this paper, we develop models of animal movement in relation to objects or fields in a landscape. We took a finite mixture modeling approach in which the component densities are conceptually related to different choices for movement in response to a landscape feature, and the mixing proportions are related to the probability of selecting each response as a function of one or more covariates. We combined particle swarm optimization and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters. We used this approach to analyze data for movement of three bobcats in relation to urban areas in southern California, USA. A behavioral interpretation of the models revealed similarities and differences in bobcat movement response to urbanization. All three bobcats avoided urbanization by moving either parallel to urban boundaries or toward less urban areas as the proportion of urban land cover in the surrounding area increased. However, one bobcat, a male with a dispersal-like large-scale movement pattern, avoided urbanization at lower densities and responded strictly by moving parallel to the urban edge. The other two bobcats, which were both residents and occupied similar geographic areas, avoided urban areas using a combination of movements parallel to the urban edge and movement toward areas of less urbanization. However, the resident female appeared to exhibit greater repulsion at lower levels of urbanization than the resident male, consistent with empirical observations of bobcats in southern California. Using the parameterized finite mixture models, we mapped behavioral states to geographic space, creating a representation of a behavioral landscape. This approach can provide guidance for conservation planning based on analysis of animal movement data using statistical models, thereby linking connectivity evaluations to empirical data.

TI  - A common currency for the different ways in which patches and links can contribute to habitat availability and connectivity in the landscape
PY  - 2010
AB  - Graph structures and habitat availability metrics are two recent and complementary approaches for analysing landscape connectivity. They have gained rapid popularity and provided significant conceptual improvements for decision making in conservation planning. We present a further methodological development of the habitat availability concept and metrics by partitioning them into three separate fractions that quantify the different ways in which individual landscape elements can contribute to overall habitat connectivity and availability in the landscape, including stepping stone effects. These fractions are derived from the same concept, are measured in the same units and can be directly compared and combined within a unifying framework. This avoids the problematic and, so far, usual combination of metrics coming from different backgrounds and the arbitrary weighting of connectivity considerations in a broader context of conservation alternatives. We analyse how the relative importance of each fraction varies with species traits. In addition, we show how the critical patches differ for each of the fractions by analysing various forest habitats in the province of Lleida (NE Spain). We discuss the conceptual and conservation implications of this approach, which can be adapted to different degrees of ecological and spatial detail within the graph while still maintaining a coherent framework for the identification of critical elements in the landscape network.

TI  - Landscape Ecology: The Effect of Pattern on Process
PY  - 1989
AB  - Consideration of spatial dynamics in many areas of ecology has received increased attention during the past decade. For example, the role of disturbance in creating and maintaining a spatial mosaic in the rocky intertidal zone was studied. Patch size could be predicted very well by using a model based on past patterns of disturbance and on measured patterns of mussel movement and recruitment. The dynamics of many natural disturbances and their effects on the spatial mosaic have received considerable study in a variety of terrestrial and aquatic systems. This paper demonstrates that a long history of ecological studies provides a basis for the study of spatial patterns and landscape-level processes. However, the emphasis previously was on describing the processes that created the patterns observed in the biota. The explicit effects of spatial patterns on ecological processes have not been well studied; the emphasis on pattern and process is what differentiates landscape ecology from other ecological disciplines. Therefore, this review focuses on the characterization of landscape patterns and their effects on ecological processes.

TI  - How should we measure landscape connectivity
PY  - 2000
AB  - The methods for measuring landscape connectivity have never been compared or tested for their responses to habitat fragmentation. We simulated movement, mortality and boundary reactions across a wide range of landscape structures to analyze the response of landscape connectivity measures to habitat fragmentation. Landscape connectivity was measured as either dispersal success or search time, based on immigration into all habitat patches in the landscape. Both measures indicated higher connectivity in more fragmented landscapes, a potential for problematic conclusions for conservation plans. We introduce cell immigration as a new measure for landscape connectivity. Cell immigration is the rate of immigration into equal-sized habitat cells in the landscape. It includes both within- and between-patch movement, and shows a negative response to habitat fragmentation. This complies with intuition and existing theoretical work. This method for measuring connectivity is highly robust to reductions in sample size (i.e., number of habitat cells included in the estimate), and we hypothesize that it therefore should be amenable to use in empirical studies. The connectivity measures were weakly correlated to each other and are therefore generally not comparable. We also tested immigration into a single patch as an index of connectivity by comparing it to cell immigration over the landscape. This is essentially a comparison between patch-scale and landscape-scale measurement, and revealed some potential for patch immigration to predict connectivity at the landscape scale. However, this relationship depends on the size of the single patch, the dispersal characteristics of the species, and the amount of habitat in the landscape. We conclude that the response of connectivity measures to habitat fragmentation should be understood before deriving conclusions for conservation management.

TI  - Habitat loss and connectivity of reserve networks in probability approaches to reserve design
PY  - 2003
AB  - Quantitative methods for the design of reserve networks often select over-dispersed reserves, and consequently a number of species extinctions can be expected in such reserves, especially if unprotected surrounding habitat is lost. A novel approach that deals with this problem is presented by considering factors such as habitat quality and spatial configuration of reserves during the selection process. Species-specific effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, together with habitat composition, are taken into account when computing species probabilities of local occurrence. Sites are then chosen to represent all species with a given target probability. The method is applied to a dataset of butterflies and moths from the Creuddyn Peninsula, North Wales, UK, which includes species with various responses to habitat quality and configuration. The results show that the resulting level of reserve clustering will depend on the number of species for which the spatial configuration plays an important role (at the scale under consideration), and on the pattern and amount of habitat loss that is expected to follow around the reserves. The method represents a step towards taking better into account species persistence when selecting reserve networks in a changing world.

TI  - Neutral models for the analysis of broad-scale landscape pattern
PY  - 1987
AB  - The relationship between a landscape process and observed patterns can be rigorously tested only if the expected pattern in the absence of the process is known. We used methods derived from percolation theory to construct neutral landscape models,i.e., models lacking effects due to topography, contagion, disturbance history, and related ecological processes. This paper analyzes the patterns generated by these models, and compares the results with observed landscape patterns. The analysis shows that number, size, and shape of patches changes as a function of p, the fraction of the landscape occupied by the habitat type of interest, and m, the linear dimension of the map. The adaptation of percolation theory to finite scales provides a baseline for statistical comparison with landscape data. When USGS land use data (LUDA) maps are compared to random maps produced by percolation models, significant differences in the number, size distribution, and the area/perimeter (fractal dimension) indices of patches were found. These results make it possible to define the appropriate scales at which disturbance and landscape processes interact to affect landscape patterns.

TI  - Effects of weighting schemes on the identification of wildlife corridors generated with least-cost methods
PY  - 2012
AB  - The importance of movement corridors for maintaining connectivity within metapopulations of wild animals is a cornerstone of conservation. One common approach for determining corridor locations is least-cost corridor (LCC) modeling, which uses algorithms within a geographic information system to search for routes with the lowest cumulative resistance between target locations on a landscape. However, the presentation of multiple LCCs that connect multiple locations generally assumes all corridors contribute equally to connectivity, regardless of the likelihood that animals will use them. Thus, LCCs may overemphasize seldom-used longer routes and underemphasize more frequently used shorter routes. We hypothesize that, depending on conservation objectives and available biological information, weighting individual corridors on the basis of species-specific movement, dispersal, or gene flow data may better identify effective corridors. We tested whether locations of key connectivity areas, defined as the highest 75th and 90th percentile cumulative weighted value of approximately 155,000 corridors, shift under different weighting scenarios. In addition, we quantified the amount and location of private land that intersect key connectivity areas under each weighting scheme. Some areas that appeared well connected when analyzed with unweighted corridors exhibited much less connectivity compared with weighting schemes that discount corridors with large effective distances. Furthermore, the amount and location of key connectivity areas that intersected private land varied among weighting schemes. We believe biological assumptions and conservation objectives should be explicitly incorporated to weight corridors when assessing landscape connectivity. These results are highly relevant to conservation planning because on the basis of recent interest by government agencies and nongovernmental organizations in maintaining and enhancing wildlife corridors, connectivity will likely be an important criterion for prioritization of land purchases and swaps.

TI  - Biological Corridors: Form, Function, and Efficacy
PY  - 1997
AB  - H abitat loss and fragmentation are among the most pervasive threats to the conservation of biological diversity (Wilcove et al. 1986, Wilcox and Murphy 1985). Habitat fragmentation often leads to the isolation of small populations, which have higher extinctionrates (e.g., Pimm et al. 1988). Ultimately, the processes of isolation and population extinction lead to a reduction in biological diversity. Concern for this loss has motivated conservation biologists to discuss the actions that are needed to increase the effective size of local populations. Predominant among these possible str,ltegies has been the recommendation that corridors be induded in conservation plans (Figure 1) to increase the connectivity of otherwise isolated patches (Meffe and Carroll1994). The indusion of corridors in reserve designs has become an importa nt conservation tactic for protecting biological diversity. This strategy was motivated by theoretical and empirical observations demonstrating that increased interchange of in-

TI  - The concept of land ecological network and its design using a land unit approach
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract The introduction of ecological networks into nature conservation policies promotes a new planning model for maintaining biological and landscape diversity and assisting policy sectors in the conservation of natural ecosystems. We propose a method to design an ecological network of sites that satisfy the main ecological needs of species, community and ecosystems by analysing the pattern of natural elements in the land mosaic. We define the concept of land ecological network (LEN) and design the LEN in the province of Rome (Lazio, Italy) on a local scale (1:50,000). The LEN is composed of core areas, buffer zones and landscape connections each of which has its own management regime. This work was carried out as part of the province of Rome planning scheme, which represents a prescriptive document of General Provincial Territorial Plan of Rome. The LEN integrates ecological data with a hierarchical land classification and provides a scientifically sound basis for conservation strategies at different...

TI  - Permeability of the urban matrix to arboreal gliding mammals: Sugar gliders in Melbourne, Australia
PY  - 2012
AB  - Habitat corridors that facilitate functional connectivity are a fundamental component of wildlife conservation in fragmented landscapes. However, the landscape matrix separating suitable habitat is not uniformly impermeable to movement and management to increase matrix permeability could be an alternative means to maintain connectivity. Gliding mammals are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because their movements are constrained by glide distance thresholds. Populations of gliders in cities are at risk of being isolated by increasing habitat loss and urban development, yet little is known about how the urban matrix affects glider movement. Here we investigate how the level of urbanization and tree cover in the matrix influence matrix permeability to sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) within suburban forest reserves. Twenty-two sugar gliders were radio-tracked over winter and summer at four reserves. Boundary crossing behaviour was measured as the number of times each glider crossed into the matrix, and matrix permeability was determined as the maximum distance travelled by gliders into the matrix. The majority of gliders (81%) were located in the matrix at least once, and rates of boundary crossing were consistent across urbanization and tree cover levels. Matrix permeability was negatively affected by matrix urbanization, but not by matrix tree cover, and no interaction effects were found. Although distances travelled by gliders into the matrix did not exceed 180m, they were comparable with typical movement distances by gliders in reserves. Our results demonstrate that the urban matrix can provide suitable habitat for gliding mammals to move and forage, but that increased urbanization may inhibit glider use of the matrix irrespective of tree cover. This finding has implications for conservation planning and suggests that structurally connected areas may not be used if movement behaviour is inhibited. Conversely, management of matrix permeability could be used to maintain connectivity without needing to construct physical corridors. © 2012 Ecological Society of Australia.

TI  - Urbanization, oxidative stress and inflammation: a question of evolving, acclimatizing or coping with urban environmental stress
PY  - 2015
AB  - To estimate the impact of urbanization on wild animals, it is important to know how different species, populations and/or individuals deal with and respond to environmental stress. Are more urbanized species adapted to their environment, or do individuals acclimatize over the course of their life? Alternatively, do they simply cope at the expense of other functions? These are three key processes that I will address using two important physiological responses as case traits, namely oxidative stress and inflammation, - which are known to be under genetic control as well as showing great plasticity. Oxidative stress is a state of more reactive oxidants than antioxidants, which may cause tissue damage linked to disease and senescence. Inflammation, on the other hand, is the response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli. However, under progressive stimuli, inflammation may also cause tissue destruction and pathology. Although patterns and strengths of effects are not always clear cut, the often interconnected oxidative stress and inflammation have the potential to be severely affected by urban stressors, thereby mechanistically linking ecology to fitness. Here I discuss five major urban stressors: chemical, noise and artificial night light pollution, disease and diet, and how their individual and combinatory effects may affect these two physiological responses. To start to disentangle whether physiological responses are a question of evolving, acclimatizing or coping with the urban environment, population genetics along with regulatory mechanisms of gene expression will shed light on the costs' of urban life and help to understand why some species or genotypes thrive, while others are absent, in urban areas. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been successful for explaining local adaptation and tolerance towards acute toxic substances. However, for multiple stressors acting in concert, at low chronic exposure, investigations of epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression may be more illuminating. Here I review the pathways by which genetic and epigenetic mechanisms can affect oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in urban environments, thereby affecting overall fitness. By doing so, I identify the major outstanding gaps of knowledge in the interfaces between ecology, toxicology, evolutionary and molecular biology to inform future studies of urban wildlife. (Less)

TI  - Rapid adaptive evolution of northeastern coyotes via hybridization with wolves
PY  - 2009
AB  - The dramatic expansion of the geographical range of coyotes over the last 90 years is partly explained by changes to the landscape and local extinctions of wolves, but hybridization may also have facilitated their movement. We present mtDNA sequence data from 686 eastern coyotes and measurements of 196 skulls related to their two-front colonization pattern. We find evidence for hybridization with Great Lakes wolves only along the northern front, which is correlated with larger skull size, increased sexual dimorphism and a five times faster colonization rate than the southern front. Northeastern haplotype diversity is low, suggesting that this population was founded by very few females moving across the Saint Lawrence River. This northern front then spread south and west, eventually coming in contact with an expanding front of non-hybrid coyotes in western New York and Pennsylvania. We suggest that hybridization with wolves in Canada introduced adaptive variation that contributed to larger size, which in turn allowed eastern coyotes to better hunt deer, allowing a more rapid colonization of new areas than coyotes without introgressed wolf genes. Thus, hybridization is a conduit by which genetic variation from an extirpated species has been reintroduced into northeastern USA, enabling northeastern coyotes to occupy a portion of the niche left vacant by wolves.

TI  - Linking connectivity to viability: insights from spatially explicit population models of large carnivores
PY  - 2006
AB  - INTRODUCTION Increasingly, conservation groups and agencies attempt to create regional reserve designs that move beyond a simple aggregation of important sites to form a biologically functional network. As natural habitats are converted for human uses, remaining natural areas simultaneously become smaller and more isolated, reflecting the twin processes of habitat reduction and fragmentation (Wilcove et al. 1986). Maintaining connectivity between these remnant natural habitat patches is important for several reasons (Crooks and Sanjayan Chapter 1); on a timescale of generations, a single reserve or patch of natural habitat is unlikely to be large enough to sustain populations of area-sensitive species that are subject to the processes of demographic and environmental stochasticity (Harrison 1994); on a timescale of tens of generations, a single reserve may not be large enough to sustain a population's genetic diversity and maintain evolutionary processes, or allow the species to shift its range in response to long-term environmental trends such as climate change (Frankel and Soule 1981). Early literature on assessing landscape connectivity (e.g., Forman and Godron 1986) focused primarily on classifying landscape structure rather than relating this structure to population dynamics of particular species (Hanski 1994; Tischendorf and Fahrig 2000; Moilanen and Hanski 2001). In contrast, functional connectivity, at the scale discussed in this chapter, is a population-level process that implies that individuals of a species successfully disperse between connected patches and survive to breed in the destination patch.

TI  - Movements of carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) inhabiting cereal fields: a field tracing study
PY  - 1988
AB  - The individual movements of four carabid species were investigated by tracing beetles in the field using a portable radar system (harmonic radar). The field-inhabiting a Pterostichus melanarius Illiger, P. niger Schaller and Harpalus rufipes De Geer were traced in cereal fields. The movements of P. melanarius Mnd P. niger were also tracked in a wood and then compared with the movements of the forest-species Carabus nemoralis Muller. P. melanarius and P. niger displayed directed movements in cereal fields, although P. niger moved faster than P. melanarius. The movement pattern of H. rufipes in the field, and C. nemoralis and P. malanarius in the wood can be described as a c correlated random walk. In cereal fields, P. melanarius burrowed actively into the soil, and P. niger searched out crevices. In contrast, none of these two carabids burrowed in the forest soil, whereas C. nemoralis did. No statistically significant difference was observed between the movements of hungry and satiated beetles, although starved beetles tended to disperse shorter distances per move and turned back more often (especially P. niger). The significance of the various movement patterns exhibited by the species studied for their reproduction and survival on arable land is discussed.

TI  - Assessing the capacity of different urban forms to preserve the connectivity of ecological habitats
PY  - 2012
AB  - This paper addresses the relationship between anthropogenic forest habitat fragmentation and the form of urban patterns. Using a two-step methodology we first generate 40 theoretical residential development scenarios following a repeatable procedure; the simulated urban forms are either moderately compact or fractal. Then, we compare the scenarios according to the functional connectivity of the remaining forest habitat using a graph-based approach. The methodology is applied to the urban region of Besancon (France), where forest surfaces are considered as a generic habitat for several animal species. Results obtained show that fractal scenarios of residential development are almost equivalent to moderately compact scenarios regarding the connectivity of forest habitat when the residential development is weak. In the case of a more intense residential development, fractal scenarios are superior to nonfractal scenarios when low dispersal distances of animals are concerned.

TI  - A conceptual model of land conversion processes: predictions and evidence from a microlandscape experiment with grassland insects
PY  - 1998
AB  - Land conversion due to human activities produces distinctive spatial patterns across the landscape. It remains unclear, however, how particular spatial arrangements of remnant habitat patches influence species persistence. We present a conceptual model of landscape change that focuses explicitly on habitat spatial arrangement. Four sequences, characterized as shrinkage, bisection, fragmentation, and perforation, differ qualitatively in the spatial arrangement of intact habitat and differ quantitatively in boundary length, amount of interior area, and connectivity. We tested the predictions of this conversion sequence model in a microlandscape field experiment with insects in a native grassland habitat. The four conversion sequences significantly influenced the species composition of the above-ground insect community, and insect species groups varied in their responses. Four patterns were evident from the field experiment: (1) as habitat decreased, insect density rose sharply on small dispersed patches of the bisection and fragmentation sequences, an effect less evident in the large remnant patch of the shrinkage sequence; (2) species richness declined only in the case of shrinkage, whereas richness increased in the fragmentation sequence; (3) most individual species examined responded similarly to the community as a whole: and (4) large rare species were concentrated in remaining habitat of the shrinkage and fragmentation sequences. Overall, the shrinkage and perforation sequences, which had high connectivity, were similar to one another in species composition, while the bisection and fragmentation sequences, which had low connectivity, were similar to one another. Based on these results, we conclude that a spatial pattern of land conversion that maintains one or more large, closely spaced remnant patches of native vegetation is essential for species persistence.

TI  - Applying a socio-ecological green network framework to Xi’an City, China
PY  - 2020
AB  - Green–blue space loss and fragmentation are particularly acute in Chinese cities due to rapid urbanization, large ring-road system and the following city compartments. Therefore, connecting urban green–blue spaces has been recently advocated by central government. This paper revised and applied the recently developed urban green network approach to the case of Xi’an city, China, a city which has been rarely studied before from this perspective. The focus was on connecting fragments of urban green–blue spaces to compact green–blue networks, integrating both social and ecological functions into a fully functioning entity. Landscape metric analysis was added to identify that the main city outside the city core should be a planning priority zone. The Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) and humans at leisure were selected as three focal species to meet the emerged socio-ecological benefits. Sociotope and biotope maps were drawn up to identify patches with high human recreation and wildlife shelter values and providing crucial network structures. Least-cost-path model was used for identifying potential linkages between patches. This model was based on network structures and cost surface, which measures the theoretical energy cost of travelling between landscape elements. By integrating the potential paths for the selected organisms with density analysis, the updated framework generated three improvement maps for species indicators, and 10 network corridors for establishing green–blue networks at city scale. At neighbourhood scale, one site with habitat and linkage examples illustrated specific measures that could be taken in local practice.

TI  - Estimating landscape resistance to movement: a review
PY  - 2012
AB  - Resistance surfaces are often used to fill gaps in our knowledge surrounding animal movement and are frequently the basis for modeling connectivity associated with conservation initiatives. However, the methods for quantifying resistance surfaces are varied and there is no general consensus on the appropriate choice of environmental data or analytical approaches. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic to highlight methods used and identify knowledge gaps. Our review includes 96 papers that parameterized resistance surfaces (sometimes using multiple approaches) for a variety of taxa. Data types used included expert opinion (n = 76), detection (n = 23), relocation (n = 8), pathway (n = 2), and genetic (n = 28). We organized the papers into three main analytical approaches; one-stage expert opinion, one-stage empirical, and two-stage empirical, each of which was represented by 43, 22, and 36 papers, respectively. We further organized the empir- ical approaches into five main resource selection functions; point (n = 16), matrix (n = 38), home range (n = 3), step (n = 1), and pathway (n = 1). We found a general lack of justification for choice of environmental variables and their thematic and spatial representation, a heavy reliance on expert opinion and detection data, and a tendency to confound movement behavior and resource use. Future research needs include comparative analyses on the choice of envi- ronmental variables and their spatial and thematic scales, and on the various biological data types used to estimate resistance. Comparative analyses amongst analytical processes is also needed, as well as trans- parency in reporting on uncertainty in parameter estimates and sensitivity of final resistance surfaces, especially if the resistance surfaces are to be used for conservation and planning purposes.

TI  - The use of gradient analysis studies in advancing our understanding of the ecology of urbanizing landscapes: current status and future directions
PY  - 2008
AB  - Over the past decade, the urban–rural gradient approach has been effectively used to study the ecology of cities and towns around the world. These studies have focused on understanding the distribution of plants and animals as well as ecosystem processes along gradients of urbanization that run from densely urbanized inner city to more rural exurban environments. We reviewed 300 papers investigating urbanization gradients that were published in peer-reviewed journals between 1990 and May 2007. Sixty-three percent of the papers investigated the distribution of organisms along urbanization gradients. Only five papers addressed the measures used to quantify the urbanization gradient itself. Within the papers addressing the distribution of organisms, 49% investigated the responses of birds to urbanization gradients, and <10% of the papers investigated more cryptic organisms. Most of these studies utilized a variety of broad measures of urbanization, but future advances in the field will require the development of some standardized broad measures to facilitate comparisons between cities. More specific measures of urbanization can be used to gain a mechanistic understanding of species and ecosystem responses to urbanization gradients. While the gradient approach has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the ecology of cities and towns, there is now a need to address our current knowledge gaps so that the field can reach its full potential. We present two examples of research questions that demonstrate how we can enhance our understanding of urbanization gradients, and the ecological knowledge that we can obtain from them.

PY  - 2007
AB  - Landscape Ecology seeks to understand the influence of environmental spatial heterogeneity on ecological processes, emphasizing human actions on the environment or the spatial context on biological species. It is a new science still consolidating concepts which makes strong use of technological improvements in remote sensing and geographical information systems. Aiming at verifying the main themes, methodological approaches and techniques that are being used in Landscape Ecology in Brazil, as well as the research institutes involved, we carried out a survey and analyzed the abstracts on Landscape Ecology researches submitted to the main national scientific meetings where this subject was discussed (years 2000-2005), and the abstracts of MSc and PhD theses produced from 2000 to 2004. The abstracts were classified according to 7 themes, 7 methodological approaches and 5 techniques of analysis. We analyzed 226 congress abstracts and 222 theses abstracts, from which most dealt with the description of spatial patterns, the relationships between patterns and processes, and environmental planning. A descriptive approach and the use of qualitative techniques or simple quantifications (measurements and percentages) prevailed. Less than 20% of the studies used quantitative techniques under an experimental approach, but a growing tendency on the use of quantitative procedures was verified throughout the years. Comparing both the research institutes where the theses were produced and those represented in the meetings with the research institutes which appear in the CNPq research groups database we noticed a low correspondence among them. We also verified that the Brazilian contribution in the Landscape Ecology scientific production worldwide is still very small, probably due to the prevailing descriptive nature of the current researches. We believe that the growth of Brazilian research in Landscape Ecology must go beyond the description of patterns, and that clear scientific hypotheses must be established and tested quantitatively in future researches.

TI  - Role of habitat and landscape in structuring small mammal assemblages in hedgerow networks of contrasted farming landscapes in Brittany, France
PY  - 2007
AB  - In this study, we investigated the environmental factors driving small mammal (rodents and shrews) assemblages in permanent habitat patches in response to a gradient of agricultural intensification. Small mammals were sampled using a trapping standard method in the hedgerow networks of three contrasted landscapes differing by their level of land-use intensity and hedgerow network density (BOC1: slightly intensified; BOC2: moderately intensified and POL: highly intensified). We hypothesized that habitat and landscape characteristics have to be considered to understand the structure of local community. In that way, we carried out a multi-scale study using environmental variables ranging from local habitat (structure and composition of the hedgerows) to hedgerows neighbourhoods in a radius of 300 m (land cover and connectivity around hedges) and to landscape units (three sites). During 1 year, 24 hedgerows were sampled seven times, representing a total of 1,379 captures (86% of rodents and 14% of shrews) and eight species, dominated by the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). Inter-site variability was significant and accounted for 18% of total variation in small mammal species abundances. But intra-site variability was also highlighted: species abundance profiles may differ greatly among hedgerows within a site. The more explanatory variables were identified at the different scales of the study: the landscape unit POL was shown to be an important factor in structuring the community, but the predominant factors explaining differences of abundances among hedgerows were about local habitat. In fact, the width of hedges and the tree species richness appeared to be significant and explaining the greatest part of the total variation of the small mammal community composition.

TI  - A Framework to Optimize Biodiversity Restoration Efforts Based on Habitat Amount and Landscape Connectivity
PY  - 2013
AB  - The effectiveness of ecological restoration actions toward biodiversity conservation depends on both local and landscape constraints. Extensive information on local constraints is already available, but few studies consider the landscape context when planning restoration actions. We propose a multiscale framework based on the landscape attributes of habitat amount and connectivity to infer landscape resilience and to set priority areas for restoration. Landscapes with intermediate habitat amount and where connectivity remains sufficiently high to favor recolonization were considered to be intermediately resilient, with high possibilities of restoration effectiveness and thus were designated as priority areas for restoration actions. The proposed method consists of three steps: (1) quantifying habitat amount and connectivity; (2) using landscape ecology theory to identify intermediate resilience landscapes based on habitat amount, percolation theory, and landscape connectivity; and (3) ranking landscapes according to their importance as corridors or bottlenecks for biological flows on a broader scale, based on a graph theory approach. We present a case study for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (approximately 150 million hectares) in order to demonstrate the proposed method. For the Atlantic Forest, landscapes that present high restoration effectiveness represent only 10% of the region, but contain approximately 15 million hectares that could be targeted for restoration actions (an area similar to today's remaining forest extent). The proposed method represents a practical way to both plan restoration actions and optimize biodiversity conservation efforts by focusing on landscapes that would result in greater conservation benefits.

TI  - A bird’s eye view: using circuit theory to study urban landscape connectivity for birds
PY  - 2017
AB  - Connectivity is fundamental to understanding how landscape form influences ecological function. However, uncertainties persist due to the difficulty and expense of gathering empirical data to drive or to validate connectivity models, especially in urban areas, where relationships are multifaceted and the habitat matrix cannot be considered to be binary. This research used circuit theory to model urban bird flows (i.e. ‘current’), and compared results to observed abundance. The aims were to explore the ability of this approach to predict wildlife flows and to test relationships between modelled connectivity and variation in abundance. Circuitscape was used to model functional connectivity in Bedford, Luton/Dunstable, and Milton Keynes, UK, for great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), drawing parameters from published studies of woodland bird flows in urban environments. Model performance was then tested against observed abundance data. Modelled current showed a weak yet positive agreement with combined abundance for P. major and C. caeruleus. Weaker correlations were found for other woodland species, suggesting the approach may be expandable if re-parameterised. Trees provide suitable habitat for urban woodland bird species, but their location in large, contiguous patches and corridors along barriers also facilitates connectivity networks throughout the urban matrix. Urban connectivity studies are well-served by the advantages of circuit theory approaches, and benefit from the empirical study of wildlife flows in these landscapes to parameterise this type of modelling more explicitly. Such results can prove informative and beneficial in designing urban green space and new developments.

TI  - A Graph-Theory Framework for Evaluating Landscape Connectivity and Conservation Planning
PY  - 2008
AB  - Connectivity of habitat patches is thought to be important for movement of genes, individuals, populations, and species over multiple temporal and spatial scales. We used graph theory to characterize multiple aspects of landscape connectivity in a habitat network in the North Carolina Piedmont (U.S.A). We compared this landscape with simulated networks with known topology, resistance to disturbance, and rate of movement. We introduced graph measures such as compartmentalization and clustering, which can be used to identify locations on the landscape that may be especially resilient to human development or areas that may be most suitable for conservation. Our analyses indicated that for songbirds the Piedmont habitat network was well connected. Furthermore, the habitat network had commonalities with planar networks, which exhibit slow movement, and scale-free networks, which are resistant to random disturbances. These results suggest that connectivity in the habitat network was high enough to prevent the negative consequences of isolation but not so high as to allow rapid spread of disease. Our graph-theory framework provided insight into regional and emergent global network properties in an intuitive and visual way and allowed us to make inferences about rates and paths of species movements and vulnerability to disturbance. This approach can be applied easily to assessing habitat connectivity in any fragmented or patchy landscape.

TI  - EXCHANGE OF THE WANDERING ALBATROSS DIOMEDEA EXULANS BETWEEN THE PRINCE EDWARD AND CROZET ISLANDS: IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION
PY  - 2003
AB  - Exchange of 61 wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans has been recorded between the French Crozet Islands and the South African Prince Edward Islands, 1 068 km apart in the Southern Ocean. Most movements of banded birds (57) have been westwards, from the Crozets to the Prince Edwards. In all, 18 fledglings banded at Possession Island, Crozets, have bred at Marion Island, Prince Edwards, but only one fledgling from Marion Island has been recorded breeding on Possession. The wandering albatrosses of the two island groups form a metapopulation that ideally should be conserved as a single unit. It is suggested that France and South Africa collaborate through the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels to effect an improved conservation status for the wandering albatrosses of the two island groups.

TI  - Seascape ecology of coastal biogenic habitats: advances, gaps, and challenges
PY  - 2011
AB  - We review the progress made in the emerging field of coastal seascape ecology, i.e. the ap- plication of landscape ecology concepts and techniques to the coastal marine environment. Since the early 1990s, the landscape ecology approach has been applied in several coastal subtidal and intertidal biogenic habitats across a range of spatial scales. Emerging evidence indicates that animals in these seascapes respond to the structure of patches and patch mosaics in different ways and at different spa- tial scales, yet we still know very little about the ecological significance of these relationships and the consequences of change in seascape patterning for ecosystem functioning and overall biodiversity. Eco- logical interactions that occur within patches and among different types of patches (or seascapes) are likely to be critically important in maintaining primary and secondary production, trophic transfer, bio- diversity, coastal protection, and supporting a wealth of ecosystem goods and services. We review faunal responses to patch and seascape structure, including effects of fragmentation on 5 focal habitats: seagrass meadows, salt marshes, coral reefs, mangrove forests, and oyster reefs. Extrapolating and generalizing spatial relationships between ecological patterns and processes across scales remains a sig- nificant challenge, and we show that there are major gaps in our understanding of these relationships. Filling these gaps will be crucial for managing and responding to an inevitably changing coastal envi- ronment. We show that critical ecological thresholds exist in the structural patterning of biogenic ecosys- tems that, when exceeded, cause abrupt shifts in the distribution and abundance of organisms. A bet- ter understanding of faunal-seascape relationships, including the identifications of threshold effects, is urgently needed to support the development of more effective and holistic management actions in restoration, site prioritization, and forecasting the impacts of environmental change.

TI  - Corridors as Conduits for Small Animals: Attainable Distances Depending on Movement Pattern, Boundary Reaction and Corridor Width
PY  - 1997
AB  - Corridors are supposed to facilitate and conduct moving individuals between habitat remnants within an otherwise inhospitable landscape. Despite the scientific interest in corridors, their function as conduits is open to question. In this paper we present hypothetical answers to this question based on simulations of individual movements through corridors. Our generic modeling approach is individual-based and spatially explicit. The model is designed to simulate conceivable movements of small animals through line corridors with clear boundaries such as hedgerows. The parameters of the individual movements correspond with empirical data of tracking studies. We define the transition probability as the likelihood that moving individuals attain a distant target area within a certain period of time. We determine the transition probability based on distance frequency distributions. Our results show how the transition probability depends on the degree of movement autocorrelation, the returning angle at boundaries and the corridor width. In general, the transition probability is essentially determined by the degree of movement autocorrelation. The relative importance of both the returning angle at boundaries and the corridor width on the transition probability increases with higher degrees of movement autocorrelation. With increasing corridor width the transition probability increases asymptotically towards an upper level depending on movement velocity and time. Consequently, the corridor width has to be regarded as the main easily modified aspect for controlling transition probabilities. We use our findings to discuss the issue of an optimum corridor width. We take up the important effects of movement canalization within corridors and the way corridors influence both mortality en route and movement velocity. We compare the consequences of these effects on transition probabilities to situations without corridors in order to evaluate corridors in a more unbiased fashion.

TI  - Dynamics of fractal networks
PY  - 1986
AB  - Random structures often exhibit fractal geometry, defined in terms of the mass scaling exponent, D, the fractal dimension. The vibrational dynamics of fractal networks are expressed in terms of the exponent d, the fracton dimensionality. The eigenstates on a fractal network are spatially localized for d less than or equal to 2. The implications of fractal geometry are discussed for thermal transport on fractal networks. The electron-fracton interaction is developed, with a brief outline given for the time dependence of the electronic relaxation on fractal networks. It is suggested that amorphous or glassy materials may exhibit fractal properties at short length scales or, equivalently, at high energies. The calculations of physical properties can be used to test the fractal character of the vibrational excitations in these materials.

TI  - Comparing linkage designs based on land facets to linkage designs based on focal species.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Least-cost modeling for focal species is the most widely used method for designing conservation corridors and linkages. However, these designs depend on today's land covers, which will be altered by climate change. We recently proposed an alternative approach based on land facets (recurring landscape units of relatively uniform topography and soils). The rationale is that corridors with high continuity of individual land facets will facilitate movement of species associated with each facet today and in the future. Conservation practitioners might like to know whether a linkage design based on land facets is likely to provide continuity of modeled breeding habitat for species needing connectivity today, and whether a linkage for focal species provides continuity and interspersion of land facets. To address these questions, we compared linkages designed for focal species and land facets in three landscapes in Arizona, USA. We used two variables to measure linkage utility, namely distances between patches of modeled breeding habitat for 5–16 focal species in each linkage, and resistance profiles for focal species and land facets between patches connected by the linkage. Compared to focal species designs, linkage designs based on land facets provided as much or more modeled habitat connectivity for 25 of 28 species-landscape combinations, failing only for the three species with the most narrowly distributed habitat. Compared to land facets designs, focal species linkages provided lower connectivity for about half the land facets in two landscapes. In areas where a focal species approach to linkage design is not possible, our results suggest that conservation practitioners may be able to implement a land facets approach with some confidence that the linkage design would serve most potential focal species. In areas where focal species designs are possible, we recommend using the land facet approach to complement, rather than replace, focal species approaches.

TI  - Using gap‐crossing capacity to evaluate functional connectivity of two Atlantic rainforest birds and their response to fragmentation
PY  - 2008
AB  - One of the main consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation is the increase in patch isolation and the consequent decrease in landscape connectivity. In this context, species persistence depends on their responses to this new landscape configuration, particularly on their capacity to move through the interhabitat matrix. Here, we aimed first to determine gap-crossing probabilities related to different gap widths for two forest birds (Thamnophilus caerulescens, Thamnophilidae; and Basileuterus culicivorus, Parulidae) from the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. These values were defined with a playback technique and then used in analyses based on graph theory to determine functional connections among forest patches. Both species were capable of crossing forest gaps between patches, and these movements were related to gap width. The probability of crossing 40 m gaps was 50% for both species. This probability falls to 10% when the gaps are 60 m (for B. culicivorus) or 80 m (for T. caerulescens). Actually, birds responded to stimulation about two times more distant inside forest trials (control) than in gap-crossing trials. Models that included gap-crossing capacity improved the explanatory power of species abundance variation in comparison to strictly structural models based merely on patch area and distance measurements. These results highlighted that even very simple functional connectivity measurements related to gap-crossing capacity can improve the understanding of the effect of habitat fragmentation on bird occurrence and abundance.

TI  - Urbanization homogenizes the interactions of plant-frugivore bird networks
PY  - 2020
AB  - Anthropogenic activities are the main cause of habitat loss and fragmentation, which directly affects biodiversity. Disruption in landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization, one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species, which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits, including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of ecosystems functions. Thus, urbanization plans should consider the proportion and distribution of green areas within cities, coupling human and ecosystem wellbeing.

TI  - Reducing light pollution improves connectivity for bats in urban landscapes
PY  - 2019
AB  - Light pollution can alter animal movements and landscape connectivity. This is particularly true in urban landscapes where a need to incorporate conservation issues in urban planning is urgent. We investigated how potential light-reduction scenarios at conurbation scale change landscape connectivity for bats. Through random stratified sampling and species distribution modelling, we assessed the relative importance of light pollution on bat presence probability and activity. We recorded bats during one entire night on each 305 sampling points in 2015. In 2016, we surveyed 94 supplementary points to evaluate models performance. We used our spatial predictions to characterize landscape resistance to bat movements. Then we applied a least-cost modelling approach to identify nocturnal corridors and estimated the impact of five light-reduction scenarios on landscape connectivity for two light non-tolerant bat species. We found that light pollution detected from satellite images was a good predictor of bat presence and activity up to 700 m radius. Our results exhibited contrasting responses to average radiance: M. daubentonii responded negatively, P. nathusii had a positive response for low values then a negative response after a threshold radiance value of 20 W.m−2.sr−1 and E. serotinus responded positively. Five and four light-reduction scenarios significantly improved landscape connectivity for M. daubentonii and P. nathusii respectively. Light-reduction measures should be included in urban planning to provide sustainable conditions for bats in cities. We advocate for the use of our methodological approach to further studies to find the best trade-off between conservation needs and social acceptability.

PY  - 1995
AB  - Multi-state capture-recapture models can be used to estimate survival rates in populations that are stratified by location or by state variables associated with individual animals. In populations stratified by location, movement probabilities can be estimated and used to test hypotheses relevant to population genetics and evolutionary ecology. When the interest is in state variables, these models permit estimation and testing of hypotheses about state-specific survival probabilities. If the state variable of interest is reproductive activity or success, then the multi-state modeling approach can be used to test hypotheses about life history trade-offs and a possible cost of reproduction.

TI  - Where to restore ecological connectivity? Detecting barriers and quantifying restoration benefits.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Landscape connectivity is crucial for many ecological processes, including dispersal, gene flow, demographic rescue, and movement in response to climate change. As a result, governmental and non-governmental organizations are focusing efforts to map and conserve areas that facilitate movement to maintain population connectivity and promote climate adaptation. In contrast, little focus has been placed on identifying barriers—landscape features which impede movement between ecologically important areas—where restoration could most improve connectivity. Yet knowing where barriers most strongly reduce connectivity can complement traditional analyses aimed at mapping best movement routes. We introduce a novel method to detect important barriers and provide example applications. Our method uses GIS neighborhood analyses in conjunction with effective distance analyses to detect barriers that, if removed, would significantly improve connectivity. Applicable in least-cost, circuit-theoretic, and simulation modeling frameworks, the method detects both complete (impermeable) barriers and those that impede but do not completely block movement. Barrier mapping complements corridor mapping by broadening the range of connectivity conservation alternatives available to practitioners. The method can help practitioners move beyond maintaining currently important areas to restoring and enhancing connectivity through active barrier removal. It can inform decisions on trade-offs between restoration and protection; for example, purchasing an intact corridor may be substantially more costly than restoring a barrier that blocks an alternative corridor. And it extends the concept of centrality to barriers, highlighting areas that most diminish connectivity across broad networks. Identifying which modeled barriers have the greatest impact can also help prioritize error checking of land cover data and collection of field data to improve connectivity maps. Barrier detection provides a different way to view the landscape, broadening thinking about connectivity and fragmentation while increasing conservation options.

TI  - Targeting and evaluating biodiversity conservation action within fragmented landscapes: an approach based on generic focal species and least-cost networks
PY  - 2010
AB  - The focus of biodiversity conservation is shifting to larger spatial scales in response to habitat fragmentation and the need to integrate multiple landscape objectives. Conservation strategies increasingly incorporate measures to combat fragmentation such as ecological networks. These are often based on assessment of landscape structure but such approaches fail to capitalise on the potential offered by more ecologically robust assessments of landscape function and connectivity. In this paper, we describe a modelling approach to identifying functional habitat networks and demonstrate its application to a fragmented landscape where policy initiatives seek to improve conditions for woodland biodiversity including increasing woodland cover. Functional habitat networks were defined by identifying suitable habitat and by modelling connectivity using least-cost approaches to account for matrix permeability. Generic focal species (GFS) profiles were developed, in consultation with stakeholders, to represent species with high and moderate sensitivity to fragmentation. We demonstrated how this form of analysis can be used to aid the spatial targeting of conservation actions. This ‘targeted’ action scenario was tested for effectiveness against comparable scenarios, which were based on random and clumped actions within the same landscape. We tested effectiveness using structural metrics, network-based metrics and a published functional connectivity indicator. Targeting actions within networks resulted in the highest mean woodland area and highest connectivity indicator value. Our approach provides an assessment of landscape function by recognising the importance of the landscape matrix. It provides a framework for the targeting and evaluation of alternative conservation options, offering a pragmatic, ecologically-robust solution to a current need in applied landscape ecology.

AB  - Given widespread declines in pollinator communities and increasing global reliance on pollinator-dependent crops, there is an acute need to develop a mechanistic understanding of native pollinator population and foraging biology. Using a population genetics approach, we determine the impact of habitat and floral resource distributions on nesting and foraging patterns of a critical native pollinator, Bombus vosnesenskii. Our findings demonstrate that native bee foraging is far more plastic and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble bees forage further in pursuit of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives bee foraging distance. Furthermore, we find a negative impact of paved habitat and a positive impact of natural woodland on bumble bee nesting densities. Overall, this study reveals that natural and human-altered landscapes can be managed for increased native bee nesting and extended foraging, dually enhancing biodiversity and the spatial extent of pollination services.

TI  - Ecological connectivity research in urban areas
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary The successful movement of individuals is fundamental to life. Facilitating these movements by promoting ecological connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation. Urban areas contain more than half of the world's human population, and their potential to support biodiversity and to connect their citizens to nature is increasingly recognized. Promoting ecological connectivity within these areas is essential to reaching this potential. However, our current understanding of ecological connectivity within urban areas appears limited. We reviewed the published scientific literature to assess the state-of-the-art of ecological connectivity research in urban areas, summarized trends in study attributes and highlighted knowledge gaps. We found 174 papers that investigated ecological connectivity within urban areas. These papers addressed either structural (48) or functional connectivity (111), and some addressed both (15), but contained substantial geographic and taxonomic biases. These papers rarely defined the aspect of connectivity they were investigating and objective descriptions of the local urban context were uncommon. Formulated hypotheses or a priori predictions were typically unstated and many papers used suboptimal study designs and methods. We suggest future studies explicitly consider and quantify the landscape within their analyses and make greater use of available and rapidly developing tools and methods for measuring functional connectivity (e.g. biotelemetry or landscape genetics). We also highlight the need for studies to clearly define how the terms ‘urban’ and ‘connectivity’ have been applied. Knowledge gaps in ecological connectivity in urban areas remain, partly because the field is still in its infancy and partly because we must better capitalize on the state-of-the-art technological and analytical techniques that are increasingly available. Well-designed studies that employed high-resolution data and powerful analytical techniques highlight our abilities to quantify ecological connectivity in urban areas. These studies are exemplary, setting the standards for future research to facilitate data-driven and evidence-based biodiversity-friendly infrastructure planning in urban areas.

TI  - Modeling population connectivity by ocean currents, a graph-theoretic approach for marine conservation
PY  - 2007
AB  - The dispersal of individuals among marine populations is of great importance to meta- population dynamics, population persistence, and species expansion. Understanding this connectivity between distant populations is key to their effective conservation and management. For many marine species, population connectivity is determined largely by ocean currents transporting larvae and juveniles between distant patches of suitable habitat. Recent work has focused on the biophysics of marine larval dispersal and its importance to population dynamics, although few studies have evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of this potential dispersal. Here, we show how an Eulerian advection-diffusion approach can be used to model the dispersal of coral larvae between reefs throughout the Tropical Pacific. We illustrate how this connectivity can be analyzed using graph theory—an effective approach for exploring patterns in spatial connections, as well as for determining the importance of each site and pathway to local and regional connectivity. Results indicate that the scale (average distance) of dispersal in the Pacific is on the order of 50-150 km, consistent with recent studies in the Caribbean (Cowen, et al. 2006). Patterns in the dispersal graphs highlight pathways for larval dispersal along major ocean currents and through island chains. A series of critical island 'stepping stones' are discovered providing potential pathways across the equatorial currents and connect- ing distant island groups. Patterns in these dispersal graphs highlight possible pathways for species expansions, reveal connected upstream/downstream populations, and suggest areas that might be priori- tized for marine conservation efforts.

TI  - UNICOR: a species connectivity and corridor network simulator
PY  - 2012
AB  - We introduce UNIversal CORridor network simulator (UNICOR), a species connectivity and corridor identifi cation tool. UNICOR applies Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to individual-based simulations. Outputs can be used to designate movement corridors, identify isolated populations, and prioritize conservation plans to promote species persistence. The key features include a driver-module framework, connectivity mapping with thresholding and buffering, and calculation of graph theory metrics. Through parallel-processing, computational efficiency is greatly improved, allowing analyses of large extents and entire populations. Previously available approaches are limited by prolonged computational times and poor algorithmic efficiency, restricting problem-size and requiring artificial subsampling of populations.

TI  - Modeling Ecoregional Connectivity
PY  - 2010
AB  - Nature reserves increasingly function as islands in a human-dominated matrix. Habitat conservation initiatives that seek to reconnect patches using functional corridors are increasingly part and ­parcel of conservation planning projects. Numerous methods have evolved all based on similar of least cost paths, functional rather than structural connectivity, and landscape resistance. However significant differences in approach exist including whether a network of patches is considered simultaneously or as patch–patch pairs, and whether the goal is to model spatially explicit corridors or movement bottlenecks. We review these approaches and then describe ecological connectivity modeling for an ecoregion using the graph-theoretic approach considering two different patch-node scenarios, at the ecoregion scale and apply a more localized connectivity modeling exercise for a subregion and a single focal species the American Black bear (Ursus americanus). We discuss the difficulties of attempting to model functional corridors for focal species over heterogenous landscapes, and the potential benefits of using ‘naturalness’ or Human Footprint surrogates for connectivity.

TI  - Isolation by resistance.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Despite growing interest in the effects of landscape heterogeneity on genetic structuring, few tools are available to incorporate data on landscape composition into population genetic studies. Analyses of isolation by distance have typically either assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation-by-resistance (IBR) model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance, a distance metric that exploits precise relationships between random walk times and effective resistances in electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation, the resistance distance is both more theoretically justified and more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least cost path-based distance measures. Moreover, the metric can be applied with a wide range of data inputs, including coarse-scale range maps, simple maps of habitat and nonhabitat within a species' range, or complex spatial datasets with habitats and barriers of differing qualities. The IBR model thus provides a flexible and efficient tool to account for habitat heterogeneity in studies of isolation by distance, improve understanding of how landscape characteristics affect genetic structuring, and predict genetic and evolutionary consequences of landscape change.

TI  - Cougar space use and movements in the wildland–urban landscape of western Washington
PY  - 2011
AB  - The wildland–urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes, creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Because wildlife ecology, behavior, and evolution at this interface are shaped by both natural and human phenomena, this requires greater understanding of how diverse factors affect ecosystem and population processes. We illustrate the challenge of understanding and managing a frequent and often undesired inhabitant of the wildland–urban landscape, the cougar (Puma concolor). In wildland and residential areas of western Washington State, USA, we captured and radiotracked 27 cougars to model space use and understand the role of landscape features in interactions (sightings, encounters, and depredations) between cougars and humans. Resource utilization functions (RUFs) identified cougar use of areas with features that were probably attractive to prey, influential on prey vulnerability, and associated with limited or no residential development. Early-successional forest (+), conifer forest (+), distance to road (−), residential density (−), and elevation (−) were significant positive and negative predictors of use for the population, whereas use of other landscape features was highly variable. Space use and movement rates in wildland and residential areas were similar because cougars used wildland-like forest patches, reserves, and corridors in residential portions of their home range. The population RUF was a good predictor of confirmed cougar interactions, with 72% of confirmed reports occurring in the 50% of the landscape predicted to be medium-high and high cougar use areas. We believe that there is a threshold residential density at which the level of development modifies the habitat but maintains enough wildland characteristics to encourage moderate levels of cougar use and maximize the probability of interaction. Wildlife managers trying to reduce interactions between cougars and people should incorporate information on spatial ecology and landscape characteristics to identify areas with the highest overlap of human and cougar use to focus management, education, and landscape planning. Resource utilization functions provide a proactive tool to guide these activities for improved coexistence with wildlife using both wildland and residential portions of the landscape.

TI  - Two measures of landscape-graph connectivity: assessment across gradients in area and configuration
PY  - 2007
AB  - Landscape connectivity is critical to species persistence in the face of habitat loss and fragmentation. Graph theory is a well-defined method for quantifying connectivity that has tremendous potential for ecology, but its application has been limited to a small number of conservation scenarios, each with a fixed proportion of habitat. Because it is important to distinguish changes in habitat configuration from changes in habitat area in assessing the potential impacts of fragmentation, we investigated two metrics that measure these different influences on connectivity. The first metric, graph diameter, has been advocated as a useful measure of habitat configuration. We propose a second area-based metric that combines information on the amount of connected habitat and the amount of habitat in the largest patch. We calculated each metric across gradients in habitat area and configuration using multifractal neutral landscapes. The results identify critical connectivity thresholds as a function of the level of fragmentation and a parallel is drawn between the behavior of graph theory metrics and those of percolation theory. The combination of the two metrics provides a means for targeting sites most at risk of suffering low potential connectivity as a result of habitat fragmentation.

TI  - Citizen Science as a Tool for Conservation in Residential Ecosystems
PY  - 2007
AB  - Human activities, such as mining, forestry, and agriculture, strongly influence processes in natural systems. Because conservation has focused on managing and protecting wildlands, research has focused on understanding the indirect influence of these human activities on wildlands. Although a conservation focus on wildlands is critically important, the concept of residential area as an ecosystem is relatively new, and little is known about the potential of such areas to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity. As urban sprawl increases, it becomes urgent to construct a method to research and improve the impacts of management strategies for residential landscapes. If the cumulative activities of individual property owners could help conserve biodiversity, then residential matrix management could become a critical piece of the conservation puzzle. "Citizen science" is a method of integrating public outreach and scientific data collection locally, regionally, and across large geographic scales. By involving citizen participants directly in monitoring and active management of residential lands, citizen science can generate powerful matrix management efforts, defying the "tyranny of small decisions" and leading to positive, cumulative, and measurable impacts on biodiversity.

TI  - Landscape patterns in a disturbed environment
PY  - 1987
AB  - Deciduous forest patterns were evaluated, using fractal analysis, in the U. S. Geological Survey 1: 250,000 Natchez Quadrangle, a region that has experienced relatively recent conversion of forest cover to cropland. A perimeter-area method was used to determine the fractal dimension; the results show a different dimension for small compared with large forest patches. This result is probably related to differences in the scale of human versus natural processes that affect this particular forest pattern. By identifying transition zones in the scale at which landscape patterns change this technique shows promise for use in developing hypotheses related to scale-dependent processes and as a simple metric to evaluate changes on the earth's surface using remotely sensed data.

TI  - How to define a patch: a spatial model for hierarchically delineating organism-specific habitat patches
PY  - 2007
AB  - Landscape analysis and delineation of habitat patches should take into account organism-specific behavioral and perceptual responses to landscape structure because different organisms perceive and respond to landscape features over different ranges of spatial scales. The commonly used methods for delineating habitat based on rules of contiguity do not account for organism-specific responses to landscape patch structure and have undesirable properties, such as being dependent on the scale of base map used for analysis. This paper presents an improved patch delineation algorithm, “PatchMorph,” which can delineate patches across a range of spatial scales based on three organism-specific thresholds: (1) land cover density threshold, (2) habitat gap maximum thickness (gap threshold), and (3) habitat patch minimum thickness (spur threshold). This algorithm was tested on an “idealized” landscape with landscape gaps and spurs of known size, and delineated patches as expected. It was then applied to delineate patches from a neutral random fractal landscape, which showed that as the input gap and spur thickness thresholds were increased, the number of patches decreased from 59 (low thresholds) patches to 1 (high thresholds). The algorithm was then applied to model western yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis) nesting habitat patches based on spur and gap thresholds specific to this organism. Both these analyses showed that fewer patches were delineated by PatchMorph than by rules of contiguity, and those patches were larger, had smoother edges, and had fewer gaps within the patches. This algorithm has many applications beyond those presented in this paper, including habitat suitability analysis, spatially explicit population modeling, and habitat connectivity analysis.

TI  - The Global 200: Priority ecoregions for global conservation
PY  - 2002
AB  - A global strategy to conserve biodiversity must aim to protect representative examples of all of the world's ecosystems, as well as those areas that contain exceptional concentrations of species and endemics. Although lacking the richness of tropical forests, deserts, tropical lakes, and subpolar seas all contain distinct species, communities, and ecological phenomena. We analyzed global patterns of biodiversity to identify a set of the Earth's terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecoregions that harbor exceptional biodiversity and are representative of its ecosystems. We placed each of the Earth's ecoregions within a system of 30 biomes and biogeographic realms to facilitate a representation analysis. Biodiversity features were compared among ecoregions to assess their irreplaceability or distinctiveness. These features included species richness, endemic species, unusual higher taxa, unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and the global rarity of habitats. This process yielded 238 ecoregions-the Global 200-comprised of 142 terrestrial, 53 freshwater, and 43 marine priority ecoregions. Effective conservation in this set of ecoregions would help conserve the most outstanding and representative habitats for biodiversity nn this planet.

TI  - A gradient analysis of urban landscape pattern: a case study from the Phoenix metropolitan region, Arizona, USA
PY  - 2002
AB  - Urbanization is arguably the most dramatic form of land transformation that profoundly influences biological diversity and human life. Quantifying landscape pattern and its change is essential for the monitoring and assessment of ecological consequences of urbanization. Combining gradient analysis with landscape metrics, we attempted to quantify the spatial pattern of urbanization in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, USA. Several landscape metrics were computed along a 165 km long and 15 km wide transect with a moving window. The research was designed to address four research questions: How do different land use types change with distance away from the urban center? Do different land use types have their own unique spatial signatures? Can urbanization gradients be detected using landscape pattern analysis? How do the urban gradients differ among landscape metrics? The answers to these questions were generally affirmative and informative. The results showed that the spatial pattern of urbanization could be reliably quantified using landscape metrics with a gradient analysis approach, and the location of the urbanization center could be identified precisely and consistently with multiple indices. Different land use types exhibited distinctive, but not necessarily unique, spatial signatures that were dependent on specific landscape metrics. The changes in landscape pattern along the transect have important ecological implications, and quantifying the urbanization gradient, as illustrated in this paper, is an important first step to linking pattern with processes in urban ecological studies.

TI  - A socio-ecological perspective of urban green networks: the Stockholm case
PY  - 2017
AB  - Landscape fragmentation threatens habitats, biodiversity and other ecosystem services. In tackling this threat, the dynamic processes of social-ecological systems should be recognised and understood. Although network analysis based on graph theory has been recognised as an efficient way of spatially understanding landscape or habitat connectivity, only few studies have offered specific approaches or suggestions for integrating detailed social-ecological values into geographical distributions. As a contribution to bridging this gap, this paper introduces a social-ecological network model for the issue of landscape or habitat fragmentation applied to the case of Stockholm, Sweden. Graph theory was used in combination with sociotope and biotope maps for simple visualisation of network situations in two-dimensional maps. The European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus), European common toad (Bufo bufo) and human beings were selected as indicator species, based on a landscape ecology analysis in Stockholm Municipality in 2009. Slope, land use and human disturbance maps were assessed in order to decide cost values of travelling from node to node. Lease-cost-path accumulation was used to create ideal reference maps of green networks. Three separate maps were then developed for suggesting efficient routes for three indicators in city scale that mainly connect from the Royal National City Park to the other parts of the city. The model in Hjorthagen neighbourhood to highlight two practical paths that link this fragmented community to its neighbouring park areas. Findings make it possible to address two scales of network improvement strategies, namely first for the city-scale green network that connects geographical habitats (nodes) and the regional green wedges of the city, and the second that of neighbourhood links between habitats in detailed layers of green networks. Strategic improvement potentials are presented based on ideal reference maps of green networks correspondingly.

TI  - Habitat destruction, dispersal, and deterministic extinction in competitive communities
PY  - 1997
AB  - An analytical model of competitive coexistence in spatial habitats, modified to address habitat destruction, predicts that the most abundant species can be among the first species driven extinct by habitat destruction, given that abundant species are the poorest dispersers and best competitors. This contrasts with the classical view of biased extinction of rare species. Here we explore the robustness of this prediction both analytically and in spatially explicit simulations of more realistic cases. The prediction proved surprisingly robust. The poorest dispersers, which in this model generally are the best competitors and may be the most abundant species, were among the first driven extinct by habitat destruction whether they were abundant or rare, had short or long range dispersal, or reproduced continuously or periodically; whether competitive displacement was immediate or gradual; whether habitat destruction was clumped, uniform, or random and whether destruction occurred at once or progressively; and ...

TI  - Key Topics in Conservation Biology 2 - Biological corridors and connectivity
PY  - 2013
AB  - The ability of individual animals to move across complex landscapes is critical for maintaining regional populations in the short term (Fahrig 2003; Cushman 2006), and for species to shift their geographic range in response to climate change (Heller & Zavaleta 2009). As organisms move through spatially complex landscapes, they respond to multiple biotic and abiotic factors to maximize access to resources and mates while minimizing fitness costs such as mortality risks. Habitat fragmentation decreases dispersal success (Gibbs 1998), increases mortality (Fahrig et al. 1995) and reduces genetic diversity (Reh & Seitz 1990; Wilson & Provan 2003). Local populations may decline if immigration is prevented (Brown & Kodric-Brown 1977; Harrison 1991) and may prevent recolonization following local extinction (Semlitsch & Bodie 1998). The goal of this chapter is to describe the state of the art in quantitative corridor and connectivity modelling. We will review several critical issues in modelling, and provide expert guidance and examples to help practitioners implement effective programmes to preserve, enhance or create connectivity among wildlife populations.

TI  - Dispersal success on fractal landscapes: a consequence of lacunarity thresholds
PY  - 1999
AB  - Habitat fragmentation is expected to disrupt dispersal, and thus we explored how patch metrics of landscape structure, such as percolation thresholds used to define landscape connectivity, corresponded with dispersal success on neutral landscapes. We simulated dispersal as either a purely random process (random direction and random step lengths) or as an area-limited random walk (random direction, but movement limited to an adjacent cell at each dispersal step) and quantified dispersal success for 1000 individuals on random and fractal landscape maps across a range of habitat abundance and fragmentation. Dispersal success increased with the number of cells a disperser could search (m), but poor dispersers (m<5) searching via area-limited dispersal on fractal landscapes were more successful at locating suitable habitat than random dispersers on either random or fractal landscapes. Dispersal success was enhanced on fractal landscapes relative to random ones because of the greater spatial contagion of habitat. Dispersal success decreased proportionate to habitat loss for poor dispersers (m=1) on random landscapes, but exhibited an abrupt threshold at low levels of habitat abundance (p<0.1) for area-limited dispersers (m<10) on fractal landscapes. Conventional metrics of patch structure, including percolation, did not exhibit threshold behavior in the region of the dispersal threshold. A lacunarity analysis of the gap structure of landscape patterns, however, revealed a strong threshold in the variability of gap sizes at low levels of habitat abundance (p<0.1) in fractal landscapes, the same region in which abrupt declines in dispersal success were observed. The interpatch distances or gaps across which dispersers must move in search of suitable habitat should influence dispersal success, and our results suggest that there is a critical gap-size structure to fractal landscapes that interferes with the ability of dispersers to locate suitable habitat when habitat is rare. We suggest that the gap structure of landscapes is a more important determinant of dispersal than patch structure, although both are ultimately required to predict the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation.

TI  - The effect of habitat destruction pattern on species persistence : a cellular model
PY  - 1995
AB  - A simple, but spatially explicit, model of competition between two hypothetical species is presented. The two species exist as metapopulations, where habitat patches are characterised by local extinctions and colonizations. One species is a superior competitor and the other a superior disperser. The model determines the proportion of habitat patches that can be destroyed before the species become extinct, confirming the results of deterministic models. It further shows that the pattern of habitat destruction affects the minimum amount of habitat required to avoid extinction. If intensity of habitat loss occurs along a gradient, rather than at random, species persist until a much greater overall habitat loss has occurred. This is also the result if habitat is lost in blocks or in lines. The implication of this result for conservation policy is discussed.

TI  - Analysis of molecular variance inferred from metric distances among DNA haplotypes: application to human mitochondrial DNA restriction data.
PY  - 1992
AB  - We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and phi-statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.

TI  - Boundary dynamics: a conceptual framework for studying landscape ecosystems
PY  - 1985
AB  - We develop a conceptual foundation for the investigation of ecosystem patterns and processes that explicitly considers the spatial patchiness of ecological landscapes. Our emphasis is on "boundary dynamics" the factors determining the location of boundaries between patch types in a landscape mosaic, how boundaries affect ecological processes and the movement of materials over an area, and how imbalances in these transfers in space can affect boundary characteristics and landscape configuration. We suggest that, other things being equal, the edaphic patterns of a landscape will determine the spatial patterning of the biota in the system, primarily through their effects on vegetation. Boundaries in a landscape may be located as direct consequences of the edaphic pattern, or may reflect perturbations of this underlying pattern due to physical disturbances or the actions of various transfer agents or "vectors." Abiotic vectors such as wind or surface water flow respond differently to boundary features than do biotic vectors such as beetles or rodents. Both abiotic and biotic vectors may create disturbances through their actions, which in turn may alter patch boundary locations. Vectors also contribute directly to movements of materials, energy, or organisms over the landscape, both within and between patches, and thereby may determine the spatial patterns of the spread of perturbations through the system. If there are net imbalances in fluxes or the spread of disturbances across boundaries in relation to within-patch processes, a directional bias to system fluxes will be established. Over time, this changes the characteristics and locations of patch boundaries. Boundaries thus have dynamics that are superimposed on the edaphic foundation. Consideration of these dynamics offers the potential to gain insight into the spatial configuration of ecosystem functioning and emphasizes the value of a reductionist approach to ecosystem studies.

TI  - SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY PREDICTABLE FISHCOMMUNITIES ON CORAL REEFS
PY  - 1998
AB  - Spatial and temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of site-attached fish species inhabiting small, isolated patches of coral reef has been attributed to variability in larval recruitment. However, the relative importance of settlement and postsettlement processes in determining the structure of fish communities in general, i.e., including non-site-attached species inhabiting large sections of contiguous reef, remains to be determined. Here, we examine the degree of spatial and temporal variation in community structure and population density of fish inhabiting sections of coral reef varying in size and connectivity. To investigate spatial variability in fish community structure and population density, we surveyed 36 sites on contiguous reef and 39 patch-reef sites varying in size and isolation from neighboring patches. Ordination and regression analyses indicated that the structure of fish assemblages inhabiting contiguous reef varied predictably along habitat gradients. In contrast, intrinsic habitat characteristics, such as the shelter availability and the composition of the substratum, were apparently unrelated to the structure of fish assemblages on patch reefs. For sites on contiguous reef, multiple regression models explained a significant proportion of spatial variation in the population density of 10 site-attached and vagile species (including 90% of variation in the density of Pomacentrus moluccensis, a site-attached damselfish). For patch-reef sites, models of spatial variation in population density were significant for six species, five of which were not site attached. The overall pattern across most species was that patch-reef models were characterized by a reduced r2 relative to corresponding models of contiguous-reef populations, but the reduction was substantially less for vagile species than for site-attached species. Ordination analysis of temporal variability in community structure over two years suggested that none of the fish communities at the sites examined was in a consistent state of community succession. For most sites, community structure varied randomly over time, although at some sites, the structure of resident fish communities tended towards a stable position in multivariate community space. Across all sites, temporal change in community structure was significantly higher during periods of recruitment than at other times of the year, although there was little evidence to suggest that recruitment was the sole source of temporal variation. At most sites, the structure of fish assemblages fluctuated considerably during nonrecruitment periods. Patterns of temporal variation in the population density of four site-attached species indicated that population increases corresponding with pulses of recruitment were modified by postsettlement processes. For site-attached and moderately vagile species, overall temporal variability in assemblage structure increased significantly as sites became smaller and more isolated. Temporal variability in assemblages of highly vagile species was unrelated to survey area and connectivity. Overall, the results of the analyses of spatial and temporal variability in fish community structure suggest that species' vagility and reef connectivity strongly influence the relative importance of recruitment and postrecruitment processes in determining local population density. Individuals of highly vagile species are able to move among isolated patches in response to habitat preferences or resource availability. Conversely, the continuous shelter provided by contiguous reef may allow sedentary species to migrate to more favorable areas. We suggest that for many fish species, including vagile species on patchy reef and site-attached species on contiguous reef, patterns in distribution and abundance established at recruitment are modified by postsettlement migration, which enhances the relationship between population density and habitat structure. Thus, while recruitment patterns may explain much of the spatial and temporal variation in populations of site-attached fish on small, isolated patch reefs, this result cannot necessarily be extrapolated to fish communities inhabiting large sections of contiguous reef.

TI  - Accelerometer-informed GPS telemetry : Reducing the trade-off between resolution and longevity
PY  - 2012
AB  - Tracking animal movement using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is an increasingly popular method for studying animal ecology, behavior, and conservation. To date, most GPS location schedules have been set at regular intervals. If intervals are too long, they undersample the details of movement paths, and if too short, they oversample resting sites and deplete the unit's battery without providing new information. We address this problem by creating a dynamic GPS schedule that is linked to the activity level of the animal via an accelerometer onboard the tracking tag. We deployed traditional and accelerometer-informed GPS tags on northern tamanduas anteater (Tamandua mexicana) in tropical forest in the Republic of Panama (2009–2010), and on fisher (Martes pennanti) in temperate forest in New York, USA (2009–2011). These species are medium-sized forest-dwellers that frequently use tree cavities, ground burrows, and thick vegetation for resting and foraging, all traits that make them particularly challenging for GPS tracking. The accelerometer-informed tags performed better than the traditional GPS tags: they attempted 73.6% more locations per day, achieved 61.7% higher location success rates, spent 28.2% less time searching for satellites, made 67.4% fewer redundant location attempts in places where animals were inactive, and ultimately provided more data for a given battery size. The resulting tracks of animal movement had high temporal resolution, revealing aspects of their behavior and ecology that would have been missed by traditional tags, especially for the fast-moving fisher. By dynamically linking the location schedule to animal movement rate, accelerometer-informed GPS tags reduce the trade-off between collecting detailed movement data and recording movement data for a longer period of time. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

TI  - Connectivity Conservation: List of contributors
PY  - 2006
AB  - <jats:p>One of the biggest threats to the survival of many plant and animal species is the destruction or fragmentation of their natural habitats. The conservation of landscape connections, where animals, plants, and ecological processes can move freely from one habitat to another, is therefore an essential part of any new conservation or environmental protection plan. In practice, however, maintaining, creating, and protecting connectivity in our increasingly dissected world is a daunting challenge. This fascinating volume provides a synthesis on the current status and literature of connectivity conservation research and implementation. It shows the challenges involved in applying existing knowledge to real-world examples and highlights areas in need of further study. Containing contributions from leading scientists and practitioners, this topical and thought-provoking volume will be essential reading for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners working in conservation biology and natural resource management.</jats:p>

TI  - Program MARK: survival estimation from populations of marked animals
PY  - 1999
AB  - MARK provides parameter estimates from marked animals when they are re-encountered at a later time as dead recoveries, or live recaptures or re-sightings. The time intervals between re-encounters do not have to be equal. More than one attribute group of animals can be modelled. The basic input to MARK is the encounter history for each animal. MARK can also estimate the size of closed populations. Parameters can be constrained to be the same across re-encounter occasions, or by age, or group, using the parameter index matrix. A set of common models for initial screening of data are provided. Time effects, group effects, time x group effects and a null model of none of the above, are provided for each parameter. Besides the logit function to link the design matrix to the parameters of the model, other link functions include the log—log, complimentary log—log, sine, log, and identity. The estimates of model parameters are computed via numerical maximum likelihood techniques. The number of parameters that are...

TI  - Do corridors promote dispersal in grassland butterflies and other insects
PY  - 2007
AB  - Ecological corridors are frequently suggested to increase connectivity in fragmented landscapes even though the empirical evidence for this is still limited. Here, we studied whether corridors, in the form of linear grass strips promote the dispersal of three grassland butterflies, using mark-recapture technique in an agricultural landscape in southern Sweden. We found no effects of the presence of corridors or of corridor length on inter-patch dispersal probabilities. Instead, dispersal probabilities appeared to be related to the quality, areas and population densities of the source and recipient patches. For two of the species, the density of captured individuals along corridors was better predicted by the corridor length than by the straight-line distance from a pasture, suggesting that short-distance movements within habitat patches result in a diffusion of individuals along corridors. A literature review revealed that only 16 published studies had explicitly studied the effect of corridors on insect movement. The context in which studies were performed appeared to affect whether corridors facilitated dispersal or not. All seven studies where the corridors consisted of open areas surrounded by forest showed positive effects, while only two out of six studies where corridors consisted of grassland surrounded by other open habitats showed positive effects of corridors. Our results clearly demonstrate that corridors do not always have positive effects on insect dispersal and that the effect seems to depend on the quality of the surrounding matrix, on the spatial scale in which the study is performed and on whether true dispersal or routine movements are considered.

TI  - ESTIMATING THE PARAMETERS OF SURVIVAL AND MIGRATION OF INDIVIDUALS IN METAPOPULATIONS
PY  - 2000
AB  - Ecologists working with metapopulations are interested in the rate of migration among several local populations, mortality during migration, and the scaling of migration rate with habitat patch area and isolation. We describe a model of individual capture histories obtained from multisite mark–release–recapture studies, which allows one to measure these parameters using maximum likelihood estimation. The model yields separate estimates of mortality within habitat patches and mortality during migration, on the assumption that only the latter is affected by the isolation of the source population. The model is suitable for studies involving 10 or more populations, with differences in habitat patch areas and isolation, and in which several hundred individuals have been marked and recaptured. We apply the model to a metapopulation of the butterfly Melitaea diamina with 14 local populations, 557 marked individuals, and 1301 recaptures. Immigration and emigration scaled as patch area to power 0.2. Roughly half of the daily losses of individuals from habitat patches of 1 ha in area were due to emigration, 1 km, and 16% of all deaths were estimated to have occurred during migration. Programs are available to calculate the parameter estimates, their confidence intervals, and goodness-of-fit tests.

TI  - Comparison of habitat-isolation parameters in relation to fragmented distribution patterns in the tree frog (Hyla arborea)
PY  - 1996
AB  - The distribution pattern of the tree frog (Hyla arborea) in an intensively used agricultural landscape in Zealand Flanders, was analyzed for effects of habitat fragmentation. The logistic regression models showed that the chance that a pond (potential reproduction site) was occupied by tree frogs depended on three isolation factors. The density of ponds within 750 m of the occupied pond was higher compared to ponds that remained unoccupied during the survey period. Additionally both the density of shrubs as well as the density of high herbs, two terrestrial habitat factors, was higher within 1000 m of occupied ponds. The explanatory value of two different types of isolation measures was compared with logistic regression analysis. It is discussed that ‘Concentric isolation measures’, which take size and distance of potential habitat patches in all directions into account, are expected to give a better description of isolation than the more often used 'distance from the nearest habitat patch'.

TI  - Fencerows, Edges, and Implications of Changing Connectivity Illustrated by Two Contiguous Ohio Landscapes.
PY  - 1995
AB  - : We evaluated the amounts and implications of changes in habitat connectivity on rural land-scapes by modeling the colonization success and subsequent habitat colonization of a model edge organism within real landscapes. We first inventoried the changes in the fencerow and forest-edge network of two contiguous Ohio (U.S.A.) landscapes, an agriculturally dominated till plain and a more diverse and dynamic moraine landscape, from 1940 to 1988. On the moraine the number of fencerows changed little from 1940 to 1971. The number increased by 86 during 1971–1988 as marginal farms were subdivided. The total length of fencerows on the moraine increased 2.5-fold over 48 years. On the till plain the number and total length of fencerows remained relatively constant through the study period. The sum of fencerows and forest edges was used as a measure of total ecotonal edge. On the moraine total edge increased through the study period, whereas on the till plain it decreased. We selected two levels of landscape connectivity, low and high, to model animal habitat colonization success. As connectivity increased the earliest successful colonists preempted an increasingly large proportion of the total suitable habitat, and the probability of successful colonization by later-arriving individuals decreased. The changes in connectivity that resulted from changes in both the fencerow network and the proportion of forested land have resulted in contiguous landscapes that present very different colonization potentials to organisms with long-distance dispersal capability. Given the current uncertainty of the effects of corridors on species-preservation efforts, we suggest that further modeling of this type prior to field testing will add useful insights, especially if conducted using specific species and landscape types. Las cercas, los bordes y las connotaciones de los cambios en la conectividad ilustrados por dos paisajes contiguos de Ohio Resumen: Evaluamos la cantidad y las connotaciones de los cambios en la conectividad del habitat, en paisajes rurales modelando el exito en la colonizacion y la subsecuente colonizacion del habitat en un organismo de los bordes modelo dentro de paisajes reales. En primer lugar, inventariamos los cambios en las cercas y el sistema de bordes del bosque de dos paisajes contiguos de Ohio, una planicie de tillita dominada por agricultura y un paisaje morenico mas diverso y dinamico, durante 1940–1988. En la morena el numero de cercas cambio poco entre 1940–1971. El numero se incremento en 86 durante 1971–1988, a medida que las granjas marginales fueron subdivididas. La extension total de las cercas en la morena se multiplico 2.5 veces durante un periodo de 48 anos. En la planicie de tillita el numero y la extension total de las cercas permanecio relativamente constante a traves del periodo de estudio. La suma de las cercas y el borde del bosque fue utilizado como medida del borde total del ecotono. En la morena el borde total se incremento durante el periodo de estudio, mientras que en la planicie de tillita decrecio. Seleccionamos dos niveles de conectividad del paisaje, bajo y alto, para modelar el suceso de la colonizacion del habitat animal. En la medida en que la conectividad se incremento, los colonizadores tempranos mas exitosos se apropiaron de una gran proporcion del habitat total disponible y la probabilidad del exito en la colonizacion de los individuos que fueron llegando mas tarde decrecio. Los cambios en conectividad que resultaron de los cambios en el conjunto de las cercas y la proporcion de la tierra forestada, ha resultado en paisajes contiguous que presentan potenciales de colonizacion muy diferentes para los organismos con una capacidad de dispersion a gran distancia. Dada la incertidumbre actual sobre los efectos de los corredores sobre los esfuerzos de preservacion de las especies, sugerimos que la intesificacion en este tipo de modelado antes de ser probando en el campo puede adicionar informacion util, especialmente si se conduce utilizando especies y tipos de paisajes especificos.

TI  - Connectivity is a vital element of landscape structure
PY  - 1993
AB  - In a recent FORUM article, Dunning et al. (1992) put forward a framework of landscape processes that stimulated considerable discussion amongst us. We are in general agreement with their ideas, but feel that a more explicit recognition of the importance of movement as a component of landscape structure would add clarity and utility to the framework. We wish to build on their foundation by presenting some additional ideas. Dunning et al. (1992) outline four ecological processes acting at the landscape scale: 1) landscape complementation; 2) landscape supplementation; 3) sources and sinks; and 4) neighbourhood effects. Each process depends upon the distribution of resources in the landscape. Resources are distributed in patches. Implicit in the definition of each process is that animals move among the resource patches. In the first two, animals move among resource patches to: 1) acquire a full complement of resources to meet their needs; and 2) supplement their existing resources with those in additional patches. In the third, movement from sources to sinks is required for the maintenance of sink populations. The fourth process, neighbourhood effects, implies that individuals move between patches, but focuses on the permeability of the boundaries between contiguous patches. Dunning et al. (1992) assume thaf the ability of an organism to complement or supplement its resource requirements depends only on the distance to those resource patches. In a related paper, Pulliam et al. (1992) state: "When both landscape physiognomy and composition are incorporated into a population model, the dispersal of organisms across the landscape can be followed...". However, an animal's ability to utilize a resource patch will also be dependent upon its ability to get there. This ability will be determined not only by the distance between patches (i.e. physiognomy), but also by the biophysical nature of the route(s) between two patches and the biology and behaviour of the organism (Henein and Merriam 1990). Some routes facilitate or allow unimpeded movement among patches; others impede to varying degrees the amount, or success, of movement. Because movement is so critical to animal population survival, we recognize a third measure of landscape structure (sensu Dunning et al. 1992) namely landscape 'connectivity' (Merriam 1984, Baudry and Merriam 1988, Merriam 1991). Landscape physiognomy and landscape composition measure the distribution of resource patches in a landscape (Dunning et al. 1992). Landscape connectivity is the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches. Each of the components of landscape structure (landscape physiognomy, landscape composition and landscape connectivity) can be measured. Turner (1989) pre-

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity in urban ecosystems: reconceptualizing land cover and a framework for classification
PY  - 2007
AB  - Urban areas are heterogeneous. Transitions in architecture and building density, vegetation, economic activity, and culture can occur at the scale of city blocks. Ecologists have been criticized for treating the city as homogeneous and urbanization as one-dimensional. To develop ecological understanding of integrated human–natural systems, the fine-scale heterogeneity of their built and natural components must be quantified. There have been calls for the integration of the biophysical and human components of systems, but here we provide a new tool to quantify this integrated heterogeneity by reconceptualizing urban land-use and land-cover classification approaches. This new tool, High Ecological Resolution Classification for Urban Landscapes and Environmental Systems (HERCULES), balances detail and efficiency and is flexible, allowing it to be used for interdisciplinary research, with ancillary datasets, and across urban systems.

TI  - Quantifying Landscape Spatial Pattern: What Is the State of the Art?
PY  - 1998
AB  - Landscape ecology is based on the premise that there are strong links between ecological pattern and ecological function and process. Ecological systems are spatially heterogeneous, exhibiting considerable complexity and variability in time and space. This variability is typically represented by categorical maps or by a collection of samples taken at specific spatial locations (point data). Categorical maps quantize variability by identifying patches that are relatively homogeneous and that exhibit a relatively abrupt transition to adjacent areas. Alternatively, point-data analysis (geostatistics) assumes that the system property is spatially continuous, making fewer assumptions about the nature of spatial structure. Each data model provides capabilities that the other does not, and they should be considered complementary. Although the concept of patches is intuitive and consistent with much of ecological theory, point-data analysis can answer two of the most critical questions in spatial pattern analysis: what is the appropriate scale to conduct the analysis, and what is the nature of the spatial structure? I review the techniques to evaluate categorical maps and spatial point data, and make observations about the interpretation of spatial pattern indices and the appropriate application of the techniques. Pattern analysis techniques are most useful when applied and interpreted in the context of the organism(s) and ecological processes of interest, and at appropriate scales, although some may be useful as coarse-filter indicators of ecosystem function. I suggest several important needs for future research, including continued investigation of scaling issues, development of indices that measure specific components of spatial pattern, and efforts to make point-data analysis more compatible with ecological theory.

TI  - The influence of corridors on the movement behavior of individual Peromyscus polionotus in experimental landscapes
PY  - 2000
AB  - To assess corridor effects on movement in Peromyscus polionotus (old-field mice), we used a set of three experimental landscapes that contained multiple patches (1.64 ha) of usable, open habitat embedded in a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest matrix. Some patches were connected by corridors and others were isolated (unconnected). We introduced mice to nest boxes in experimental patches and followed them through the landscapes via trapping. We found weak evidence that the presence of corridors decreased the probability that P. polionotus (particularly females) would disperse or disappear from a patch. In the process of live trapping the patches, we also encountered `feral' P. polionotus, Sigmodon hispidus (cotton rats), and Peromyscus gossypinus (cotton mice). The average number of feral animals did not differ between isolated and connected patches. This suggests that corridors do not act as drift fences that `sieve' individuals out of the matrix and into the patches. However, more male than female P. polionotus and S. hispidus were trapped in isolated patches. This intersexual difference did not exist in connected patches.

To make planning more scientific, this paper explored green-space structure planning via multidimensional perspectives and methods using a case study of Zhengzhou. The paper applies theories (from landscape architecture and landscape ecology) and technologies (like remote sensing, GIS—geographic information system, graph theory, and aerography) from different disciplines to analyze current green-space structure and relevant physical factors to identify and exemplify different green-space planning strategies. Overall, our analysis reveals that multiple green-space structures should be considered together and that planners and designers should have multidisciplinary knowledge. For specific strategies, the analysis finds (i) that green complexes enhance various public spaces and guide comprehensive development of urban spaces; (ii) that green ecological corridors play a critical role in regional ecological stability through maintaining good connectivity and high node degree (Dg) and betweenness centrality index (BC) green spaces; (iii) that greenway networks can integrate all landscape resources to provide more secured spaces for animals and beautiful public spaces for humans; (iv) that blue-green ecological networks can help rainwater and urban flooding disaster management; and (v) that green ventilation corridors provide air cleaning and urban cooling benefits, which can help ensure healthy and comfortable urban–rural environments. In our view, this integrated framework for planning and design green-space structure helps make the process scientific and relevant for guiding future regional green-space structure.

TI  - Quantifying landscape linkages among giant panda subpopulations in regional scale conservation
PY  - 2012
AB  - Understanding habitat requirements and identifying landscape linkages are essential for the survival of isolated populations of endangered species. Currently, some of the giant panda populations are isolated, which threatens their long-term survival, particularly in the Xiaoxiangling mountains. In the present study, we quantified niche requirements and then identified potential linkages of giant panda subpopulations in the most isolated region, using ecological niche factor analysis and a least-cost path model. Giant pandas preferred habitat with conifer forest and gentle slopes (>20 to ≤30°). Based on spatial distribution of suitable habitat, linkages were identified for the Yele subpopulation to 4 other subpopulations (Liziping, Matou, Xinmin and Wanba). Their lengths ranged from 15 to 54 km. The accumulated cost ranged from 693 to 3166 and conifer forest covered over 31%. However, a variety of features (e.g. major roads, human settlements and large unforested areas) might act as barriers along the linkages for giant panda dispersal. Our analysis quantified giant panda subpopulation connectivity to ensure long-term survival.

TI  - What can genetics tell us about population connectivity
PY  - 2010
AB  - Genetic data are often used to assess ‘population connectivity’ because it is difficult to measure dispersal directly at large spatial scales. Genetic connectivity, however, depends primarily on the absolute number of dispersers among populations, whereas demographic connectivity depends on the relative contributions to population growth rates of dispersal vs. local recruitment (i.e. survival and reproduction of residents). Although many questions are best answered with data on genetic connectivity, genetic data alone provide little information on demographic connectivity. The importance of demographic connectivity is clear when the elimination of immigration results in a shift from stable or positive population growth to negative population growth. Otherwise, the amount of dispersal required for demographic connectivity depends on the context (e.g. conservation or harvest management), and even high dispersal rates may not indicate demographic interdependence. Therefore, it is risky to infer the importance of demographic connectivity without information on local demographic rates and how those rates vary over time. Genetic methods can provide insight on demographic connectivity when combined with these local demographic rates, data on movement behaviour, or estimates of reproductive success of immigrants and residents. We also consider the strengths and limitations of genetic measures of connectivity and discuss three concepts of genetic connectivity that depend upon the evolutionary criteria of interest: inbreeding connectivity, drift connectivity, and adaptive connectivity. To conclude, we describe alternative approaches for assessing population connectivity, highlighting the value of combining genetic data with capture-mark-recapture methods or other direct measures of movement to elucidate the complex role of dispersal in natural populations.

TI  - Corridors for Conservation: Integrating Pattern and Process
PY  - 2006
AB  - Corridors are commonly used to connect fragments of wildlife habitat, yet the identification of conservation corridors typically neglects processes of habitat selection and movement for target organisms. Instead, corridor designs often are based on binary patterns of habitat suitability. New technologies and analytical tools make it possible to better integrate landscape patterns with behavioral processes. We show how resource selection functions can be used to describe habitat suitability with continuous and multivariable metrics and review methods by which animal movement can be quantified, analyzed, and modeled. We then show how the processes of habitat selection and movement can be integrated with landscape features using least-cost paths, graph theory, and step selection functions. These tools offer new ways to design, implement, and study corridors as landscape linkages more objectively and holistically.

TI  - Conservation of the Brazilian Cerrado
PY  - 2005
AB  - The Cerrado is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. In the last 35 years, more than 50% of its approximately 2 million km 2 has been transformed into pasture and agricultural lands planted in cash crops. The Cerrado has the richest flora among the world's savannas (>7000 species) and high levels of endemism. Species richness of birds, fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and insects is equally high, whereas mammal diversity is relatively low. Deforestation rates have been higher in the Cerrado than in the Amazon rainforest, and conservation efforts have been modest: only 2.2% of its area is under legal protection. Numerous animal and plant species are threatened with extinction, and an estimated 20% of threatened and endemic species do not occur in protected areas. Soil erosion, the degradation of the diverse Cerrado vegetation formations, and the spread of exotic grasses are widespread and major threats. The use of fire for clearing land and to encourage new growth for pasture has also caused damage, even though the Cerrado is a fire-adapted ecosystem. Ecosystem experiments and modeling show that change in land cover is altering the hydrology and affecting carbon stocks and fluxes. Cerrado agriculture is lucrative, and agricultural expansion is expected to continue, requiring improvements in and extension of the transportation infrastructure, which will affect not only the Cerrado but also the Amazon forest. Large-scale landscape modification and threats to numerous species have led to renewed interest from various sectors in promoting the conservation of the Cerrado, particularly through strengthening and enlarging the system of protected areas and improving farming practices and thus the livelihoods of local communities.

TI  - Use and misuse of landscape indices
PY  - 2004
AB  - Landscape ecology has generated much excitement in the past two decades. One reason was that it brought spatial analysis and modeling to the forefront of ecological research. However, high expectations for landscape analysis to improve our understanding and prediction of ecological processes have largely been unfulfilled. We identified three kinds of critical issues: conceptual flaws in landscape pattern analysis, inherent limitations of landscape indices, and improper use of pattern indices. For example, many landscape analyses treat quantitative description of spatial pattern as an end itself and fail to explore relationships between pattern and process. Landscape indices and map data are sometimes used without testing their ecological relevance, which may not only confound interpretation of results, but also lead to meaningless results. In addition, correlation analysis with indices is impeded by the lack of data because of difficulties in large-scale experimentation and by complicated behavior of indices because of their varying responses to changes in scale and spatial pattern. These problems represent significant challenges to landscape pattern analysis, especially in terms of relating pattern to process. In this perspective paper, we examine the underlying problems of these challenges and offer some solutions.

TI  - Connectivity of Tiger ( Panthera tigris ) Populations in the Human-Influenced Forest Mosaic of Central India
PY  - 2013
AB  - Today, most wild tigers live in small, isolated Protected Areas within human dominated landscapes in the Indian subcontinent. Future survival of tigers depends on increasing local population size, as well as maintaining connectivity between populations. While significant conservation effort has been invested in increasing tiger population size, few initiatives have focused on landscape-level connectivity and on understanding the effect different landscape elements have on maintaining connectivity. We combined individual-based genetic and landscape ecology approaches to address this issue in six protected areas with varying tiger densities and separation in the Central Indian tiger landscape. We noninvasively sampled 55 tigers from different protected areas within this landscape. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian genetic assignment tests indicate long-range tiger dispersal (on the order of 650 km) between protected areas. Further geo-spatial analyses revealed that tiger connectivity was affected by landscape elements such as human settlements, road density and host-population tiger density, but not by distance between populations. Our results elucidate the importance of landscape and habitat viability outside and between protected areas and provide a quantitative approach to test functionality of tiger corridors. We suggest future management strategies aim to minimize urban expansion between protected areas to maximize tiger connectivity. Achieving this goal in the context of ongoing urbanization and need to sustain current economic growth exerts enormous pressure on the remaining tiger habitats and emerges as a big challenge to conserve wild tigers in the Indian subcontinent.

TI  - Functional connectivity within conservation networks: Delineating corridors for African elephants
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract Managing multiple parks, reserves, and conservation areas collectively as conservation networks is a recent, yet growing trend. But in order for these networks to be ecologically viable, the functional connectivity of the landscape must be ensured. We assessed the connectivity between six African savanna elephant populations in southern Africa to test whether existing conservation networks were functioning and to identify other areas that could benefit from being managed as conservation networks. We used resource selection function models to create an index of habitat selection by males and female elephants. We employed this habitat use index as a resistance surface, and applied circuit theory to assess connectivity between adjacent elephant populations within six clusters of protected areas across southern Africa. Circuit theory current flow maps predicted a high likelihood of connectivity in the central portion of our study area (i.e. between the Chobe, Kafue, Luangwa, and Zambezi cluster). Main factors limiting connectivity across the study area were high human density in the east and a lack of surface water in the west. These factors effectively isolate elephants in the Etosha cluster in Namibia and Niassa clusters in Mozambique from the central region. Our models further identified two clusters where elephants might benefit from being managed as part of a conservation network, (1) northern Zambia and Malawi and (2) northern Mozambique. We conclude that using habitat selection and circuit theory models to identify conservation networks is a data-based method that can be applied to other focal species to identify and conserve functional connectivity.

TI  - Habitat-specific larval dispersal and marine connectivity: implications for spatial conservation planning
PY  - 2013
AB  - Connectivity via larval dispersal is an important ingredient in setting effective marine reserve networks. Simple guidance for establishing spacing between individual protected sites can provide reliable rules of thumb to help ensure connectivity. Spacing rules for protected network design are relatively new to marine spatial planning, though so far they have been generically and indiscriminately applied to all types of habitats based on a single range of distance values. Here we address the extent to which such rules capture subtleties associated with dispersal distances varying among species in different regions and habitats. We applied a 50–100 km global spacing rule (SRglob), also recently applied in the California Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) process and based on available global larval dispersal data, to a previously assessed network in the Gulf of California. Using larval dispersal data for species within this region (SRreg), we associated each species with eight unique habitats (SRhab*) and we evaluated connectivity by means of different spacing rules (SRglob, SRreg and SRhab*) using graph-theory. The existing spacing rule employed by the MLPA process (SRglob) was found to be robust and conservative when applied to the Gulf of California or to its different habitats (i.e., the lower limit for dispersal distance includes the distance for all species in the Gulf). We found that species in different habitats exhibit statistically distinct dispersal profiles. Therefore, some habitats could be evaluated with more relaxed spacing rules (i.e., larger distances), than those proposed by the rules of thumb. Our work identifies a conservation planning trade-off when implementing spacing rules: already proposed rules are robust but at the cost of efficiency. Habitat-specific spacing rules should be considered for more efficient marine conservation planning solutions.

TI  - EFFECTS OF GRASSLAND FRAGMENTATION ON INSECT SPECIES LOSS, COLONIZATION, AND MOVEMENT PATTERNS
PY  - 2000
AB  - Ecological theory predicts that isolated habitat patches will experience greater rates of species loss and lower rates of recolonization compared to less isolated habitats. As a corollary, corridors of suitable habitat should reduce patch isolation, thereby decreasing species loss and enhancing colonization. Little ecological evidence exists, however, to compare species loss and colonization in habitat patches with and without corridors under field conditions. Using insects in a native grassland habitat, I performed a three-year field experiment that varied fragment size and connectivity to test the hypotheses that corridors influence patterns of insect species loss, rates of recolonization, and insect movement among habitat fragments. I detected few effects of corridors consistent with theoretical predictions. First, corridors generally failed to reduce insect species loss from otherwise isolated grassland patches, except for subtle effects in medium-sized patches. Species richness was slightly higher in medium patches with corridors than in medium isolated patches when averaged over the three years of the study. I observed the strongest positive effect of corridors in the third and driest year of the study. Second, corridors did not significantly influence overall rate of patch colonization, but slightly increased the probability of colonization by less vagile species. Interestingly, corridors did not affect recolonization by rare species, which are often the subject of conservation concern. Third, I characterized individual movement pathways of three insect species in plots with and without corridors. One of the three species significantly preferred corridors, while the other two species moved independently of corridors. Taken together, these results suggest that corridors have the potential to promote movement of organisms among habitat patches, but that their function may depend upon species characteristics, landscape context, patch size, and environmental variation.

TI  - The effects of rapid urbanization on forest landscape connectivity in Zhuhai City, China
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban forests can provide the necessary ecosystem services for their residents and play an important part in improving the urban environment. Forest landscape connectivity is a vital indicator reflecting the quality of the ecological environment and ecological functions. Detecting changes in landscape connectivity is, therefore, an important step for providing sound scientific evidence for the better urban planning. Using remote sensing images of a study area in Zhuhai City in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013, the dynamic forest landscape connectivity of Zhuhai city can be evaluated based on a graph-theoretic approach. The aims of our study were to discover and interpret the effect of rapid urbanization on forest landscape connectivity. The construction of ecological corridors helps us specifically compare the landscape connectivity of three parts of urban forests. On the basis of functional landscape metrics, the correlation of these metrics and patch area was discussed in order to comprehensively identify the key patches. The analysis showed that the total areas of forestlands reduced from 1999 to 2009 and then increased from 2009 to 2013, and the same trend was found in overall forest landscape connectivity. To improve the overall landscape connectivity, construct urban ecological network and appropriately protect biodiversity in the future, the existing important patches with large areas or key positions should be well protected. This study revealed that urbanization reduced the area of key patches and consequently reduced the forest landscape connectivity, which increased while the patch areas increased due to the environmental protection policy. Functional connectivity indicators could provide more comprehensive information in the development of environmental protection strategies.

TI  - Daytime noise predicts nocturnal singing in urban robins
PY  - 2007
AB  - Ambient noise interferes with the propagation of acoustic signals through the environment from sender to receiver. Over the past few centuries, urbanization and the development of busy transport networks have led to dramatic increases in the levels of ambient noise with which animal acoustic communications must compete. Here we show that urban European robins Erithacus rubecula, highly territorial birds reliant on vocal communication, reduce acoustic interference by singing during the night in areas that are noisy during the day. The effect of ambient light pollution, to which nocturnal singing in urban birds is frequently attributed, is much weaker than that of daytime noise.

TI  - Designing a Coherent Ecological Network for Large Mammals in Northwestern Europe
PY  - 2003
AB  - In densely populated northwestern Europe, native large mammals are confronted with a very fragmented landscape, and most of the areas they inhabit are island-like reserves threatened with total isolation from other reserves. The only way to counteract the threat of further decline in the numbers of large-mammal species is to restore their habitats. The appropriate size of future reserves could be estimated from the habitat requirements of wild ungulates that are considered key species for ecosystem functioning. The species selected to guide the design of large nature reserves in northwestern Europe is the red deer ( Cervus elaphus) because of its widespread distribution, key role in ecosystem functioning, and home-range size. We describe a network analysis of the Netherlands, Belgium, and adjacent parts of France and Germany, performed with the LARCH landscape ecology model, that was conducted in order to identify the structure of the ecological network for red deer and the spatial connectivity of the landscape. The resulting maps show areas that could support viable populations and indicate habitat areas that will support persistent populations only if they are in a network of linked habitats. The gaps and barriers that prevent connectivity in such networks guide the design of effective corridors to increase spatial connectivity. The results of our analysis can be used for policy decisions on nature conservation and spatial planning, and the method is applicable to other regions and species.

TI  - Measuring connectivity in habitat mosaics: the equivalence of two existing network indices and progress beyond them
PY  - 2010
AB  - Network-based methods are being actively developed to respond to the needs for operational assessments of the degree of landscape connectivity and of the impact of landscape changes in ecological flows and related ecological processes. Among these, a recent paper by Matisziw and Murray (2009) presented the C index as an adequate and advantageous way of ranking habitat patches by their importance for the maintenance of landscape connectivity. We show that this index is equivalent and conveys the same information in undirected graphs as a previously described index, the landscape coincidence probability (LCP), which can be readily computed in any landscape network through the Conefor Sensinode software package. We slightly generalize the LCP definition for cases involving asymmetric dispersal, which makes LCP compatible with C and maintains the equivalency between both indices in directed graphs. We place LCP and C in a broader context of other existing indices and ongoing developments and describe how some of these may be better suited for the analysis of the connectivity in landscape networks and their changes. We conclude by highlighting the need (1) to go beyond the identification of unobstructed movement paths or habitat components (sets of interconnected patches) when pursuing the most appropriate landscape connectivity indices and (2) for increased efforts in assessing and reporting the potential overlaps, coincidences and synergies between the available approaches in order to guide the final user and facilitate index selection in a densely populated metric space.

TI  - Urbanization and the ecology of wildlife diseases
PY  - 2006
AB  - Urbanization is intensifying worldwide, with two-thirds of the human population expected to reside in cities within 30 years. The role of cities in human infectious disease is well established, but less is known about how urban landscapes influence wildlife-pathogen interactions. Here, we draw on recent advances in wildlife epidemiology to consider how environmental changes linked with urbanization can alter the biology of hosts, pathogens and vectors. Although urbanization reduces the abundance of many wildlife parasites, transmission can, in some cases, increase among urban-adapted hosts, with effects on rarer wildlife or those living beyond city limits. Continued rapid urbanization, together with risks posed by multi-host pathogens for humans and vulnerable wildlife populations, emphasize the need for future research on wildlife diseases in urban landscapes.

TI  - Urbanization impacts apex predator gene flow but not genetic diversity across an urban-rural divide.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Apex predators are important indicators of intact natural ecosystems. They are also sensitive to urbanization because they require broad home ranges and extensive contiguous habitat to support their prey base. Pumas (Puma concolor) can persist near human developed areas, but urbanization may be detrimental to their movement ecology, population structure, and genetic diversity. To investigate potential effects of urbanization in population connectivity of pumas, we performed a landscape genomics study of 130 pumas on the rural Western Slope and more urbanized Front Range of Colorado, USA. Over 12,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using double-digest, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). We investigated patterns of gene flow and genetic diversity, and tested for correlations between key landscape variables and genetic distance to assess the effects of urbanization and other landscape factors on gene flow. Levels of genetic diversity were similar for the Western Slope and Front Range, but effective population sizes were smaller, genetic distances were higher, and there was more admixture in the more urbanized Front Range. Forest cover was strongly positively associated with puma gene flow on the Western Slope, while impervious surfaces restricted gene flow and more open, natural habitats enhanced gene flow on the Front Range. Landscape genomic analyses revealed differences in puma movement and gene flow patterns in rural versus urban settings. Our results highlight the utility of dense, genome-scale markers to document subtle impacts of urbanization on a wide-ranging carnivore living near a large urban center.

TI  - The Challenges Associated With Connectivity in Ecosystem Processes
PY  - 2018
AB  - Developing a framework to quantify the transformation, sequestration or connectivity of energy and matter across habitats is one of the most significant challenges faced by ecologists and resource managers today. However, there are significant challenges associated with quantifying the ecosystem processes that connect and interact across habitats. These processes include the movement of nutrients and energy and can have substantial effects on the structure and dynamics of adjacent habitats and ecosystem functioning. Here, we use a connectivity framework developed for populations to inform our understanding of the challenges associated with connectivity in ecosystem processes, and how specific habitats can contribute to overall ecosystem functioning. The landscape patterns and potential connections between habitats in terms of material storage or transformation have important implications for understanding how fragmentation and degradation of habitats in ecosystems will influence broad-scale ecosystem function.

TI  - Movement behavior explains genetic differentiation in American black bears.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Individual-based landscape genetic analyses provide empirically based models of gene flow. It would be valuable to verify the predictions of these models using independent data of a different type. Analyses using different data sources that produce consistent results provide strong support for the generality of the findings. Mating and dispersal movements are the mechanisms through which gene flow operates in animal populations. The best means to verify landscape genetic predictions would be to use movement data to independently predict landscape resistance. We used path-level, conditional logistic regression to predict landscape resistance for American black bear (Ursus americanus) in a landscape in which previous work predicted population connectivity using individual-based landscape genetics. We found consistent landscape factors influence genetic differentiation and movement path selection, with strong similarities between the predicted landscape resistance surfaces. Genetic differentiation in American black bear is driven by spring movement (mating and dispersal) in relation to residential development, roads, elevation and forest cover. Given the limited periods of the year when gene flow events primarily occur, models of landscape connectivity should carefully consider temporal changes in functional landscape resistance.

TI  - Multispecies conservation planning: identifying landscapes for the conservation of viable populations using local and continental species priorities
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary 1 Faced with unpredictable environmental change, conservation managers face the dual challenges of protecting species throughout their ranges and protecting areas where populations are most likely to persist in the long term. The former can be achieved by protecting locally rare species, to the potential detriment of protecting species where they are least endangered and most likely to survive in the long term. 2 Using British butterflies as a model system, we compared the efficacy of two methods of identifying persistent areas of species’ distributions: a single-species approach and a new multispecies prioritization tool called ZONATION. This tool identifies priority areas using population dynamic principles (prioritizing areas that contain concentrations of populations of each species) and the reserve selection principle of complementarity. 3 ZONATION was generally able to identify the best landscapes for target (i.e. conservation priority) species. This ability was improved by assigning higher numerical weights to target species and implementing a clustering procedure to identify coherent biological management units. 4 Weighting British species according to their European rather than UK status substantially increased the protection offered to species at risk throughout Europe. The representation of species that are rare or at risk in the UK, but not in Europe, was not greatly reduced when European weights were used, although some species of UK-only concern were no longer assigned protection inside their best landscapes. The analysis highlights potential consequences of implementing parochial vs. wider-world priorities within a region. 5 Synthesis and applications. Wherever possible, reserve planning should incorporate an understanding of population processes to identify areas that are likely to support persistent populations. While the multispecies prioritization tool ZONATION compared favourably to the selection of ‘best’ areas for individual species, a user-defined input of species weights was required to produce satisfactory solutions for long-term conservation. Weighting species can allow international conservation priorities to be incorporated into regional action plans but the potential consequences of any putative solution should always be assessed to ensure that no individual species of local concern will be threatened.

TI  - Automated content analysis: Addressing the big literature challenge in ecology and evolution
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary 1.The exponential growth of scientific literature—which we call the “big literature” phenomenon—has created great challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The traditional manual literature synthesis processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new literature synthesis methods to address this challenge. 2.In this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, Automated Content Analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the fields of ecological and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine-learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical research. 3.Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists to ACA and illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First, we provide a brief history of the ACA method and summarize the fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally, we discuss how to maximize the utility and contributions of ACA, as well as potential research directions that may help to advance the use of ACA in future ecological and evolutionary research. 4.Unlike manual methods of literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature at substantially shorter timespans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allows for a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to address more targeted research questions. By allowing for more extensive and comprehensive review of big literature, ACA has the potential to fill an important methodological gap and to therefore contribute to the advancement of ecological and evolutionary research.

TI  - Breaking Functional Connectivity into Components: A Novel Approach Using an Individual-Based Model, and First Outcomes
PY  - 2011
AB  - Landscape connectivity is a key factor determining the viability of populations in fragmented landscapes. Predicting ‘functional connectivity’, namely whether a patch or a landscape functions as connected from the perspective of a focal species, poses various challenges. First, empirical data on the movement behaviour of species is often scarce. Second, animal-landscape interactions are bound to yield complex patterns. Lastly, functional connectivity involves various components that are rarely assessed separately. We introduce the spatially explicit, individual-based model FunCon as means to distinguish between components of functional connectivity and to assess how each of them affects the sensitivity of species and communities to landscape structures. We then present the results of exploratory simulations over six landscapes of different fragmentation levels and across a range of hypothetical bird species that differ in their response to habitat edges. i) Our results demonstrate that estimations of functional connectivity depend not only on the response of species to edges (avoidance versus penetration into the matrix), the movement mode investigated (home range movements versus dispersal), and the way in which the matrix is being crossed (random walk versus gap crossing), but also on the choice of connectivity measure (in this case, the model output examined). ii) We further show a strong effect of the mortality scenario applied, indicating that movement decisions that do not fully match the mortality risks are likely to reduce connectivity and enhance sensitivity to fragmentation. iii) Despite these complexities, some consistent patterns emerged. For instance, the ranking order of landscapes in terms of functional connectivity was mostly consistent across the entire range of hypothetical species, indicating that simple landscape indices can potentially serve as valuable surrogates for functional connectivity. Yet such simplifications must be carefully evaluated in terms of the components of functional connectivity they actually predict.

TI  - Prioritizing restoration of structural connectivity in rivers: a graph based approach
PY  - 2013
AB  - Longitudinal connectivity is considered a key issue in river management, as it shapes ecological processes from single organisms to populations and ecosystems. Recently, it was shown that network analysis based on spatial graphs has promising applications as a tool for the assessment of connectivity in riverine systems. In this study we used a graph theory approach to identify which barriers most impacted the structural connectivity of a river basin and which connections should preferably be restored or enhanced in order to effectively improve the overall connectivity. An innovative aspect of the proposed methodology is the consideration of the cumulative non-additive impacts produced by barriers, which are especially relevant to organisms of high mobility such as fish. The portuguese river Tagus basin was used as a case study. The cumulative effect of barriers was studied using two approaches: (1) an historical approach in which the impact of barriers was assessed sequentially following the historical succession of construction; (2) a “backward” approach in which barriers were sequentially removed according to their impact. The overall structural connectivity of the river basin decreased to about 50 % of its original value after the major dams were constructed. Results show that it would be necessary to rehabilitate 11 connections in order to increase the overall structural connectivity to 90 % of its original value. This work proposes a novel and straightforward approach to prioritize rehabilitation actions in river systems, providing a promising tool for decision-makers.

TI  - Population size dependence, competitive coexistence and habitat destruction
PY  - 1998
AB  - 1. Spatial dynamics can lead to coexistence of competing species even with strong asymmetric competition under the assumption that the inferior competitor is a better colonizer given equal rates of extinction. Patterns of habitat fragmentation may alter competitive coexistence under this assumption. 2. Numerical models were developed to test for the previously ignored effect of population size on competitive exclusion and on extinction rates for coexistence of competing species. These models neglect spatial arrangement. 3. Cellular automata were developed to test the effect of population size on competitive coexistence of two species, given that the inferior competitor is a better colonizer. The cellular automata in the present study were stochastic in that they were based upon colonization and extinction probabilities rather than deterministic rules. 4. The effect of population size on competitive exclusion at the local scale was found to have little consequence for the coexistence of competitors at the metapopulation (or landscape) scale. In contrast, population size effects on extinction at the local scale led to much reduced landscape scale coexistence compared to simulations not including localized population size effects on extinction, especially in the cellular automata models. Spatially explicit dynamics of the cellular automata vs. deterministic rates of the numerical model resulted in decreased survival of both species. One important finding is that superior competitors that are widespread can become extinct before less common inferior competitors because of limited colonization. 5. These results suggest that population size–extinction relationships may play a large role in competitive coexistence. These results and differences are used in a model structure to help reconcile previous spatially explicit studies which provided apparently different results concerning coexistence of competing species.

TI  - The sensitivity of least-cost habitat graphs to relative cost surface values
PY  - 2009
AB  - Maintaining and restoring connectivity among high-quality habitat patches is recognized as an important goal for the conservation of animal populations. To provide an efficient measure of potential connectivity pathways in heterogeneous landscapes, least-cost route analysis has been combined with graph-theoretical techniques. In this study we use spatially explicit least-cost habitat graphs to examine how matrix quality and spatial configuration influence assessments of habitat connectivity. We generated artificial landscapes comprised of three landcover types ranked consistently from low to high quality: inhospitable matrix, hospitable matrix, and habitat. We controlled the area and degree of fragmentation of each landcover in a factorial experiment for a total of 20 combinations replicated 100 times. In each landscape we compared eight sets of relative landcover qualities (cost values of 1 for habitat, between 1.5 and 150 for hospitable matrix, and 3–10,000 for inhospitable matrix). We found that the spatial location of least-cost routes was sensitive to differences in relative cost values assigned to landcover types and that the degree of sensitivity depended on the spatial structure of the landscape. Highest sensitivity was found in landscapes with fragmented habitat and between 20 and 50% hospitable matrix; sensitivity decreased as habitat fragmentation decreased and the amount of hospitable matrix increased. As a means of coping with this sensitivity, we propose identifying multiple low-cost routes between pairs of habitat patches that collectively delineate probable movement zones. These probable movement zones account for uncertainty in least-cost routes and may be more robust to variation in landcover cost values.

TI  - pathmatrix: a geographical information system tool to compute effective distances among samples
PY  - 2005
AB  - PATHMATRIX is a tool used to compute matrices of effective geographical distances among samples using a least-cost path algorithm. This program is dedicated to the study of the role of the environment on the spatial genetic structure of populations. Punctual locations (e.g. individuals) or zones encompassing sample data points (e.g. demes) are used in conjunction with a species-specific friction map representing the cost of movement through the land- scape. Matrices of effective distances can then be exported to population genetic software to test, for example, for isolation by distance. PATHMATRIX is an extension to the geographical information system (GIS) software ARCVIEW 3.x.

TI  - The effects of urbanization on ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation in southernmost Yunnan Province, Southwest China
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urbanization can profoundly influence the ecosystem service for biodiversity conservation. However, few studies have investigated this effect, which is significant for maintaining regional sustainable development. We take the rapidly developing, mountainous and biodiversity hotspot region, Jinghong, in southern Yunnan Province as the case study. An integrated ecosystem service model (PANDORA) is used to evaluate this regional BESV (ecosystem service value for biodiversity conservation). The modeled BESV is sensitive to landscape connectivity changes. From the 1970s to 2010, regional urban lands increased from 18.64 km2 to 36.81 km2, while the BESV decreased from $6.08 million year−1 to $5.32 million year−1. Along with distance gradients from the city center to the fringe, BESV varies as an approximate hump-shaped pattern. Because correlation analysis reveals a stronger influence of landscape composition on spatial BESV estimates than the landscape configuration does, we conclude that the projected urban expansion will accelerate the BESV reduction. Of the projected urban land, 95% will show a decreasing BESV trend by approximately $2 m−2 year−1. To prevent this, we recommend compact urban planning for the mountainous city.

TI  - Patterns of Movement of Radioactive Carabid Beetles
PY  - 1979
AB  - Tracking of individual 192Ir-labeled ground beetles released in the field revealed that both the day-active and night-active species studied showed periods of small distances covered per day in random directions, alternating with periods of directed movement with large distances covered per day. This pattern occurred not only in the reproductive period but outside the breeding season as well in juvenile Pterostichus versicolor and spent Calathus melanocephalus. Although mean locomotory activity increased with temperature, great daily differences occurred between individuals, pointing to asynchronous behavior. In an unfavorable habitat directed movement occurred both more frequently and more extremely, sometimes resulting in escape to more favorable areas. Most of the radioactive beetles died within 7 weeks due to radiation effects, but independent field experiments and simulations showed that the recorded patterns were valid. Simulated individuals of P. versicolor living on 1 ha spread over 49 ha, whereas simulated C. melanocephalus covered only 9 ha after one activity season. Normal locomotory activities lead to both exchange of individuals between subpopulations and dispersal out of the habitat. The significance of these phenomena for population stability and for the survival of the species is discussed.

TI  - Optimizing dispersal and corridor models using landscape genetics
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary 1. Better tools are needed to predict population connectivity in complex landscapes. ‘Least-cost modelling’ is one commonly employed approach in which dispersal costs are assigned to distinct habitat types and the least-costly dispersal paths among habitat patches are calculated using a geographical information system (GIS). Because adequate data on dispersal are usually lacking, dispersal costs are often assigned solely from expert opinion. Spatially explicit, high-resolution genetic data may be used to infer variation in animal movements. We employ such an approach to estimate habitatspecific migration rates and to develop least-cost connectivity models for desert bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis nelsoni . 2. Bighorn sheep dispersal is thought to be affected by distance and topography. We incorporated both factors into least-cost GIS models with different parameter values and estimated effective geographical distances among 26 populations. We assessed which model was correlated most strongly with gene flow estimates among those populations, while controlling for the effect of anthropogenic barriers. We used the bestfitting model to (i) determine whether migration rates are higher over sloped terrain than flat terrain; (ii) predict probable movement corridors; (iii) predict which populations are connected by migration; and (iv) investigate how anthropogenic barriers and translocated populations have affected landscape connectivity. 3. Migration models were correlated most strongly with migration when areas of at least 10% slope had 1/10th the cost of areas of lower slope; thus, gene flow occurred over longer distances when ‘escape terrain’ was available. Optimal parameter values were consistent across two measures of gene flow and three methods for defining population polygons. 4. Anthropogenic barriers disrupted numerous corridors predicted to be high-use dispersal routes, indicating priority areas for mitigation. However, population translocations have restored high-use dispersal routes in several other areas. Known intermountain movements of bighorn sheep were largely consistent with predicted corridors. 5. Synthesis and applications. Population genetic data provided sufficient resolution to infer how landscape features influenced the behaviour of dispersing desert bighorn sheep. Anthropogenic barriers that block high-use dispersal corridors should be mitigated, but population translocations may help maintain connectivity. We conclude that developing least-cost models from similar empirical data could significantly improve the utility of these tools.

TI  - Using electric network theory to model the spread of oak processionary moth, Thaumetopoea processionea, in urban woodland patches.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Context Habitat fragmentation is increasing as a result of anthropogenic activities, especially in urban areas. Dispersal through fragmented habitats is key for species to spread, persist in metapopulations and shift range in response to climate change. However, high habitat connectivity may also hasten the spread of invasive species. Objective To develop a model of spread in fragmented landscapes and apply it to the spread of an invasive insect in urban woodland. Methods We applied a patch-based model, based on electric network theory, to model the current and predicted future spread of oak processionary moth (OPM: Thaumetopoea processionea) from its source in west London. We compared the pattern of ‘effective distance’ from the source (i.e. the patch ‘voltage’ in the model) with the observed spread of the moth from 2006 to 2012. Results We showed that ‘effective distance’ fitted current spread of OPM. Patches varied considerably in their ‘current’ and ‘power’ (metrics from the model), which is an indication of their importance in the future spread of OPM. Conclusions Patches identified as ‘important’ are potential ‘pinch points’ and regions of high ‘flow’, where resources for detection and management will be most cost-effectively deployed. However, data on OPM dispersal and the distribution of oak trees limited the strength of our conclusions, so should be priorities for further data collection. This application of electric network theory can be used to inform landscape-scale conservation initiatives both to reduce the spread of invasives and to facilitate large-scale species’ range shifts in response to climate change.

TI  - Circuit theory predicts gene flow in plant and animal populations
PY  - 2007
AB  - Maintaining connectivity for broad-scale ecological processes like dispersal and gene flow is essential for conserving endangered species in fragmented landscapes. However, determining which habitats should be set aside to promote connectivity has been difficult because existing models cannot incorporate effects of multiple pathways linking populations. Here, we test an ecological connectivity model that overcomes this obstacle by borrowing from electrical circuit theory. The model vastly improves gene flow predictions because it simultaneously integrates all possible pathways connecting populations. When applied to data from threatened mammal and tree species, the model consistently outperformed conventional gene flow models, revealing that barriers were less important in structuring populations than previously thought. Circuit theory now provides the best-justified method to bridge landscape and genetic data, and holds much promise in ecology, evolution, and conservation planning.

TI  - Title: Ecological relevance of least cost path analysis: An easy implementation method for landscape urban planning.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Landscape connectivity promotes dispersal and other types of movement, including foraging activity; consequently, the inclusion of connectivity concept is a priority in conservation and landscape planning in response to fragmentation. Urban planners expect the scientific community to provide them with an easy, but scientifically rigorous, method to identify highly connecting contexts in landscapes. The least-cost paths (LCP) method is one of the simplest resistance-based models that could be a good candidate to spatially identify areas where movement is potentially favored in a given landscape. We tested the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts facilitating individual movements compared to those performed in un-connecting landscape contexts. We used a landscape-level behavioral experiment based on a translocation protocol and individual repeated measures. In the city of Rennes (France), 30 male hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were translocated and radio-tracked in both highly connecting and un-connecting contexts, respectively, which were determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. Individual movement patterns were compared between the two predicted contexts. Individuals travelled longer distances, moved faster, and were more active in the highly connecting contexts compared to the un-connecting contexts. Moreover, in highly connecting contexts, hedgehog movement followed LCP orientation, with individuals using more wooded habitats than other land cover class. By using a rigorous experimental design, this study validated the ecological relevance of LCP analysis to identify highly connecting areas, and could be easily implemented by urban landscape planners.

TI  - Extinction Thresholds and Metapopulation Persistence in Dynamic Landscapes
PY  - 2000
AB  - abstract: Models of metapopulations have focused on the effects of extinction and colonization rate upon metapopulation persistence and dynamics, assuming static landscapes wherein patches are neither created nor go extinct. However, for species living in ephemeral (patchy) habitats, landscapes are highly dynamic rather than static. In this article, we develop a lattice metapopulation model, of the patch occupancy type, based on interacting particle systems that incorporate explicitly both metapopulation and patch dynamics. Under this scenario, we study the effects of different regimes of patch dynamics upon metapopulation persistence. We analyze the lattice behavior by numerical simulations and a mean field approximation (MF). We show that metapopulation persistence and extinction are strongly influenced by the rate at which the landscape changes, in addition to the amount of habitat destroyed. We derive MF analytical expressions for extinction thresholds related to landscape properties such as habitat s...

TI  - Ecological mechanisms and landscape ecology
PY  - 1993
AB  - Landscape ecology deals with the effects of the spatial configuration of mosaics on a wide variety of ecological phenomena. Because problems in many areas of conservation biology and resource management are related to landscape use, development of a rigorous theoretical and empirical foundation for landscape ecology is essential. We present an approach to research that focuses on how individual-level mechanisms operating in a heterogeneous mosaic produce ecological patterns that are spatially dependent. The theoretical framework that we develop considers the density and distribution of a population among patches as a function of (a) within-patch movement patterns of individuals; (b) emigration from patches as a function of population density, patch configuration, patch context, and within-patch movement; and (c) loss of individuals as they disperse through landscape elements

TI  - Forks in the Road: Choices in Procedures for Designing Wildland Linkages
PY  - 2008
AB  - Models are commonly used to identify lands that will best maintain the ability of wildlife to move between wildland blocks through matrix lands after the remaining matrix has become incompatible with wildlife movement. We offer a roadmap of 16 choices and assumptions that arise in designing linkages to facilitate movement or gene flow of focal species between 2 or more predefined wildland blocks. We recommend designing linkages to serve multiple (rather than one) focal species likely to serve as a collective umbrella for all native species and ecological processes, explicitly acknowledging untested assumptions, and using uncertainty analysis to illustrate potential effects of model uncertainty. Such uncertainty is best displayed to stakeholders as maps of modeled linkages under different assumptions. We also recommend modeling corridor dwellers (species that require more than one generation to move their genes between wildland blocks) differently from passage species (for which an individual can move between wildland blocks within a few weeks). We identify a problem, which we call the subjective translation problem, that arises because the analyst must subjectively decide how to translate measurements of resource selection into resistance. This problem can be overcome by estimating resistance from observations of animal movement, genetic distances, or interpatch movements. There is room for substantial improvement in the procedures used to design linkages robust to climate change and in tools that allow stakeholders to compare an optimal linkage design to alternative designs that minimize costs or achieve other conservation goals.

TI  - Evaluating functional connectivity with matrix behavior uncertainty for an endangered butterfly
PY  - 2013
AB  - Understanding animal responses to landscape elements helps forecast population reactions to changing landscape conditions. The challenge is that some behaviors are poorly known and difficult to estimate. We assessed how uncertainty in behavioral responses to dense woods, an avoided landscape structure, impacts functional connectivity among reproductive habitat patches for Fender’s blue butterfly, an endangered prairie species of western Oregon, USA. We designed a factorial simulation experiment using a spatially explicit individual-based model to project functional connectivity for female butterflies across current and alternative landscapes. We varied the probability of dense woods entry and turning angle standard deviation for movements within the dense woods over a range of biologically reasonable and observed values. Butterflies in the current landscape (46 % dense woods) and one with prairie encroached by forest (60 % dense woods) showed reductions in functional connectivity estimates consistent with the expectations of habitat fragmentation. Although dense woods entrance uncertainty impacted functional connectivity projections, uncertainty in the dense woods turning angle standard deviation had comparatively little impact on connectivity estimates. Reduction and reconfiguration of the current dense woods to 27 % cover (restored landscape) appeared to facilitate a corridor behavior in dispersing individuals, likely providing a functional connectivity estimate comparable to the historic landscape (<5 % dense woods). Our simulations suggest that additional study of butterfly movement within the dense woods is unnecessary and that a partial reduction in dense woods would be sufficient to achieve historic levels of functional connectivity for Fender’s blue across the study landscape.

TI  - Urban drivers of plant-pollinator interactions
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary Plant–pollinator interactions are affected by global change, with largely negative impacts on pollination and plant reproduction. Urban areas provide a unique and productive study system for understanding the impacts of many global change drivers on plant–pollinator interactions. We review the mechanistic pathways through which urban drivers alter plant–pollinator interactions. The literature on urban drivers of plant–pollinator interactions is small but growing and has already produced exciting insights about how population processes or pollinator behaviour interacts with landscape urban drivers to affect pollination outcomes. Habitat loss and fragmentation can change flower visitation rates and pollination success through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour or through population-level effects on pollinators. Urban environments, where impermeable surface provides an inhospitable matrix, may allow researchers to identify habitat fragments more clearly than in many other environments. Recent studies have found that non-native plants are not differently preferred by pollinators relative to native plants, therefore removing the basis for expecting pollinator-mediated competition between native and non-native plants in urban habitats. However, non-native species together with managed vegetation may have powerful effects in urban habitats via changes in community-level plant phenology and consequent changes in pollinator phenology. The current level of climate warming has not caused plants and pollinators to become detectably temporally separated, although at the same time, diversity among species’ phenological responses could buffer plant–pollinator interactions from climate variation. Due to the urban warming effect, cities provide a promising system for better understanding the warming effects on plant–pollinator interactions. Environmental contaminants such as soil nitrogen and heavy metal pollution have been examined with respect to plant–pollinator interactions in small-scale, mechanistic studies. The extent to which environmental contaminants drive plant–pollinator interactions in actual urban landscapes is, however, currently unknown. Important knowledge gaps that require research attention include understanding the consequences of plant and pollinator trait filtering on plant–pollinator interactions, and expanding the literature to include underrepresented biomes and pollinator taxa.

TI  - Carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in a forest patchwork: a connectivity analysis of the Bereg Plain landscape graph
PY  - 2007
AB  - For many species, one important key to persistence is maintaining connectivity among local populations that allow for dispersal and gene flow. This is probably true for carabid species (Coleoptera:Carabidae) living in the fragmented forests of the Bereg Plain (NE Hungary and W Ukraine). Based on field data, we have drafted a landscape graph of the area representing the habitat network of these species. Graph nodes and links represented two kinds of landscape elements: habitat (forest) patches and corridors, respectively. The quality of habitat patches and corridors were ranked (from low (1) to high (4)), reflecting local population sizes in the case of patches and estimated permeability in the case of corridors. We analysed (1) the positional importance of landscape elements in maintaining the connectivity of the intact network, (2) the effect of inserting hypothetical corridors into the network, (3) the effects of improving the quality of the existing corridors, and (4) how to connect every patch in a cost-effective way. Our results set quantitative priorities for conservation practice by identifying important corridors: what to protect, what to build and what to improve. Several network analytical techniques were used to account for the directed (source-sink) and highly fragmented nature of the landscape graph. We provide conservation priority ranks for the landscape elements and discuss the conditions for the use of particular network indices. Our study could be of extreme relevance, since a new highway is being planned through the area.

TI  - Between-habitat movement of dusky-footed woodrats and vulnerability to predation
PY  - 1997
AB  - Management of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in northwestern California is aided by knowledge of its prey base, the dusky-footed woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes). From late April through September 1990, we radiotracked 25 dusky-footed woodrats representing both sexes and a cross section of age classes (ad, subad, and juv). Animals were captured in sapling/poletimber shrubfields resulting from past clearcut timber harvest. In northwestern California woodrats reach their highest densities in this seral stage. During evening radiotracking sessions, we detected intermittent, short distance movements of juvenile and subadult males and females, and adult females from shrubfields into adjacent old-growth forests occupied by spotted owls. None of the radiotagged woodrats permanently emigrated to older-aged forests during our study period. Between-year emigration from shrubfield to old forest, however, was documented for marked individuals. Our telemetry results indicate that woodrats are not averse to crossing sharp ecotonal boundaries from shrubfields into adjacent old forest, into canopy openings in these forests, or into natural openings within dense shrubfields. A substantial number of our radiotagged woodrats were killed by predators, with carcasses most often (5 of 9 depredated woodrats) found in adjacent old forest. These observations suggest that during these between-habitat forays, woodrats may be more vulnerable to avian and mammal predators. Therefore, to some degree, the existence of brushy shrubfields adjacent to older forest may increase the availability of woodrats to predators, such as spotted owls, that exploit prey from a variety of habitats but spend the majority of their time hunting in late seral stage forests.

TI  - Network analysis to assess landscape connectivity trends: application to European forests (1990–2000)
PY  - 2011
AB  - Landscape networks and ecosystems worldwide are undergoing changes that may impact in different ways relevant ecological processes such as gene flow, pollination, or wildlife dispersal. A myriad of indices have been developed to characterize landscape patterns, but not all of them are equally suited to evaluate temporal changes in landscape connectivity as is increasingly needed for biodiversity monitoring and operational indicator delivery. Relevant advancements in this direction have been recently proposed based on graph theoretical methods to analyze landscape network connectivity and on the measurement of habitat availability at the landscape scale. Building from these developments, we modify a recent index and present the equivalent connected area (ECA) index, defined as the size of a single patch (maximally connected) that would provide the same probability of connectivity than the actual habitat pattern in the landscape. The temporal changes in ECA can be directly compared with the changes in total habitat area. This allows for additional and straightforward insights on the degree to which the gains or losses in habitat amount can be beneficial or deleterious by affecting landscape elements that uphold connectivity in a wider landscape context. We provide a demonstrative example of application and interpretation of this index and approach to monitor changes in functional landscape connectivity. We focus on the trends in European forests at the province level in the period 1990–2000 from Corine land cover data, considering both changes in the forest spatial pattern and in the average permeability of the landscape matrix. The degree of connectivity was rather stable over most of the study area, with a slight overall increase in forest connectivity in Europe. However, a few countries and regions concentrated remarkably high changes in the analyzed period, particularly those with a low forest cover. The species traits also affected the responses to landscape pattern changes, which were more prominent for those species with limited dispersal abilities. We conclude discussing the potential of this approach for consistent indicator delivery, as well as the limitations and possibilities of application to a variety of situations, for which the required quantitative tools are freely available as open source projects.

TI  - Identifying Potential Connectivity for an Urban Population of Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) in a Canadian Park System
PY  - 2020
AB  - In the face of ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, maintaining an adequate level of landscape connectivity is needed to both encourage dispersal between habitat patches and to reduce the extinction risk of fragmented wildlife populations. In a developing region of southwestern Ontario, Canada, a declining population of Eastern Massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) persists in fragmented remnants of tallgrass prairie in an urban park system. The goal of this study was to identify potential connectivity pathways between habitat patches for this species by using a GIS least-cost permeability swath model, and to evaluate the outputs with snake road mortality data. Results identified seven pathways between five core habitat blocks, a subset of which were validated with aerial imagery and mortality data. Four high-ranking pathways intersected roads through or near road mortality hotspots. This research will guide conservation interventions aimed at recovering endangered reptiles in a globally rare ecosystem, and will inform the use of permeability swaths for the identification of locations most suitable for connectivity interventions in dynamic, urbanizing landscapes.

TI  - Early warning signals of regime shifts from cross-scale connectivity of land-cover patterns
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract Increasing external pressures from human activities and climate change can lead to desertification, affecting the livelihood of more than 25% of the world's population. Thus, determining proximity to transition to desertification is particularly central for arid regions before they may convert into deserts, and recent research has focused on devising early warning signals for anticipating such regime shifts. We here draw the attention to some emerging land-cover cross-scale patterns with a historical characteristic sequence of different regimes in arid or semi-arid Mediterranean regions that could indicate an impending transition to the tightening and extension of desertification processes. Inflexibility of land administration may, in turn, reinforce desertification processes, erode the resilience and promote regime shifts and collapse instead of the adaptability required to counter surprises due to climate change. Various theoretical studies have designated the increase in spatial connectivity as the leading indicator of early warning for an impending critical transition of regime shifts. We show that a potential way to address early warning signals of regime shifts to monitor and predict changes is to look at current land-cover regime within a simple framework for interpreting cross-scale spatial patterns. We provide examples of this approach for the Apulia region in southern Italy with desertification processes in place, and discuss what a cross-scale land-cover pattern could mean, what it says about the condition of socio-ecological landscapes, and what could be the effects of changing observed conditions ought to, for instance, climate change. We took advantage of the rich information provided by cross-scale pattern analysis in the pattern transition space provided by classic neutral landscape models. We show potentially dramatic shifts of connectivity at low land-cover composition below certain thresholds, and suggest that the degree to which the observed pattern departs from a particular neutral model can indicate early warning signals of regime shifts, and how those landscapes might evolve/react to additional land-cover variation. Moreover, as the land-cover pattern mostly depends on social-economic factors, we argue that we have to change societal values at the root of inflexibility.

TI  - Identification of functional corridors with movement characteristics of brown bears on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska
PY  - 2007
AB  - We identified primary habitat and functional corridors across a landscape using Global Positioning System (GPS) collar locations of brown bears (Ursus arctos). After deriving density, speed, and angular deviation of movement, we classified landscape function for a group of animals with a cluster analysis. We described areas with high amounts of sinuous movement as primary habitat patches and areas with high amounts of very directional, fast movement as highly functional bear corridors. The time between bear locations and scale of analysis influenced the number and size of corridors identified. Bear locations should be collected at intervals ≤6 h to correctly identify travel corridors. Our corridor identification technique will help managers move beyond the theoretical discussion of corridors and linkage zones to active management of landscape features that will preserve connectivity.

TI  - A review of climate-change adaptation strategies for wildlife management and biodiversity conservation.
PY  - 2009
AB  - The scientific literature contains numerous descriptions of observed and potential effects of global climate change on species and ecosystems. In response to anticipated effects of climate change, conservation organizations and government agencies are developing "adaptation strategies" to facilitate the adjustment of human society and ecological systems to altered climate regimes. We reviewed the literature and climate-change adaptation plans that have been developed in United States, Canada, England, Mexico, and South Africa and found 16 general adaptation strategies that relate directly to the conservation of biological diversity. These strategies can be grouped into four broad categories: land and water protection and management; direct species management; monitoring and planning; and law and policy. Tools for implementing these strategies are similar or identical to those already in use by conservationists worldwide (land and water conservation, ecological restoration, agrienvironment schemes, species translocation, captive propagation, monitoring, natural resource planning, and legislation/regulation). Although our review indicates natural resource managers already have many tools that can be used to address climate-change effects, managers will likely need to apply these tools in novel and innovative ways to meet the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change.

PY  - 2009
AB  - ConsNet is a comprehensive software package for the design of conservation area networks (CANs). The software selects areas to be potentially placed under conservation management for the representation of biodiversity surrogates. Additionally, ConsNet optimizes spatial criteria including compactness, connectivity, replication, and alignment, as well as socio-economic criteria as specified by users. ConsNet uses an advanced tabu search engine to identify efficient alternatives quickly, offering capabilities beyond existing planning software. The ability to perform ongoing interactive analysis with multi-criteria objectives makes ConsNet an ideal decision support tool for large scale planning exercises.

TI  - Bayesian Inference of Recent Migration Rates Using Multilocus Genotypes
PY  - 2003
AB  - A new Bayesian method that uses individual multilocus genotypes to estimate rates of recent immigration (over the last several generations) among populations is presented. The method also estimates the posterior probability distributions of individual immigrant ancestries, population allele frequencies, population inbreeding coefficients, and other parameters of potential interest. The method is implemented in a computer program that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to carry out the estimation of posterior probabilities. The program can be used with allozyme, microsatellite, RFLP, SNP, and other kinds of genotype data. We relax several assumptions of early methods for detecting recent immigrants, using genotype data; most significantly, we allow genotype frequencies to deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions within populations. The program is demonstrated by applying it to two recently published microsatellite data sets for populations of the plant species Centaurea corymbosa and the gray wolf species Canis lupus. A computer simulation study suggests that the program can provide highly accurate estimates of migration rates and individual migrant ancestries, given sufficient genetic differentiation among populations and sufficient numbers of marker loci.

TI  - Comparing Habitat Suitability and Connectivity Modeling Methods for Conserving Pronghorn Migrations
PY  - 2012
AB  - Terrestrial long-distance migrations are declining globally: in North America, nearly 75% have been lost. Yet there has been limited research comparing habitat suitability and connectivity models to identify migration corridors across increasingly fragmented landscapes. Here we use pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) migrations in prairie habitat to compare two types of models that identify habitat suitability: maximum entropy (Maxent) and expert-based (Analytic Hierarchy Process). We used distance to wells, distance to water, NDVI, land cover, distance to roads, terrain shape and fence presence to parameterize the models. We then used the output of these models as cost surfaces to compare two common connectivity models, least-cost modeling (LCM) and circuit theory. Using pronghorn movement data from spring and fall migrations, we identified potential migration corridors by combining each habitat suitability model with each connectivity model. The best performing model combination was Maxent with LCM corridors across both seasons. Maxent out-performed expert-based habitat suitability models for both spring and fall migrations. However, expert-based corridors can perform relatively well and are a cost-effective alternative if species location data are unavailable. Corridors created using LCM out-performed circuit theory, as measured by the number of pronghorn GPS locations present within the corridors. We suggest the use of a tiered approach using different corridor widths for prioritizing conservation and mitigation actions, such as fence removal or conservation easements.

TI  - Technology on the Move: Recent and Forthcoming Innovations for Tracking Migratory Birds
PY  - 2011
AB  - Basic questions about the life histories of migratory birds have confounded scientists for generations, yet we are nearing an era of historic discovery as new tracking technologies make it possible to determine the timing and routes of an increasing number of bird migrations. Tracking small flying animals as they travel over continental-scale distances is a difficult logistical and engineering challenge. Although no tracking system works well with all species, improvements to traditional technologies, such as satellite tracking, along with innovations related to global positioning systems, cellular networks, solar geolocation, radar, and information technology are improving our understanding of when and where birds go during their annual cycles and informing numerous scientific disciplines, including evolutionary biology, population ecology, and global change. The recent developments described in this article will help us answer many long-standing questions about animal behavior and life histories.

TI  - SIMPLE CONNECTIVITY MEASURES IN SPATIAL ECOLOGY
PY  - 2002
AB  - Connectivity is a fundamental concept that is widely utilized in spatial ecology. The majority of connectivity measures used in the recent ecological literature only consider the nearest neighbor patch/population, or patches within a limited neighborhood of the focal patch (a buffer). Meta-analysis suggests that studies using nearest neighbor connectivity measures are much less likely to find statistically significant effects of connectivity than studies that use more complex measures. Here we compare simple connectivity measures in their ability to predict colonization events in two large and good-quality empirical data sets. The nearest neighbor distance to an occupied patch is found to be an inferior measure. Buffer measures do much better, but their performance is found to be sensitive to the estimate of the buffer radius. For highly fragmented habitats, the best and most consistent performance is found for a measure that takes into account the size of the focal patch and the sizes of and distances to all potential source populations. When experimenting with reduced data sets, it was discovered that nearest neighbor measures fail to find a statistically significant effect of connectivity for a large range of data set sizes for which the more complex measures still detect a highly significant effect. We conclude that the simplicity of a nearest neighbor measure is not an adequate compensation for poor performance.

TI  - Coupling inter-patch movement models and landscape graph to assess functional connectivity
PY  - 2012
AB  - Landscape connectivity is a key process for the functioning and persistence of spatially-structured populations in fragmented landscapes. Butterflies are particularly sensitive to landscape change and are excellent model organisms to study landscape connectivity. Here, we infer functional connectivity from the assessment of the selection of different landscape elements in a highly fragmented landscape in the Ile-de-France region (France). Firstly we measured the butterfly preferences of the Large White butterfly (Pieris brassicae) in different landscape elements using individual release experiments. Secondly, we used an inter-patch movement model based on butterfly choices to build the selection map of the landscape elements to moving butterflies. From this map, functional connectivity network of P. brassicae was modelled using landscape graph-based approach. In our study area, we identified nine components/groups of connected habitat patches, eight of them located in urbanized areas, whereas the last one covered the more rural areas. Eventually, we provided elements to validate the predictions of our model with independent experiments of mass release-recapture of butterflies. Our study shows (1) the efficiency of our inter-patch movement model based on species preferences in predicting complex ecological processes such as dispersal and (2) how inter-patch movement model results coupled to landscape graph can assess landscape functional connectivity at large spatial scales.

TI  - Individual dispersal, landscape connectivity and ecological networks.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Connectivity is classically considered an emergent property of landscapes encapsulating individuals’ flows across space. However, its operational use requires a precise understanding of why and how organisms disperse. Such movements, and hence landscape connectivity, will obviously vary according to both organism properties and landscape features. We review whether landscape connectivity estimates could gain in both precision and generality by incorporating three fundamental outcomes of dispersal theory. Firstly, dispersal is a multi-causal process; its restriction to an ‘escape reaction’ to environmental unsuitability is an oversimplification, as dispersing individuals can leave excellent quality habitat patches or stay in poor-quality habitats according to the relative costs and benefits of dispersal and philopatry. Secondly, species, populations and individuals do not always react similarly to those cues that trigger dispersal, which sometimes results in contrasting dispersal strategies. Finally, dispersal is a major component of fitness and is thus under strong selective pressures, which could generate rapid adaptations of dispersal strategies. Such evolutionary responses will entail spatiotemporal variation in landscape connectivity. We thus strongly recommend the use of genetic tools to: (i) assess gene flow intensity and direction among populations in a given landscape; and (ii) accurately estimate landscape features impacting gene flow, and hence landscape connectivity. Such approaches will provide the basic data for planning corridors or stepping stones aiming at (re)connecting local populations of a given species in a given landscape. This strategy is clearly species- and landscape-specific. But we suggest that the ecological network in a given landscape could be designed by stacking up such linkages designed for several species living in different ecosystems. This procedure relies on the use of umbrella species that are representative of other species living in the same ecosystem.

TI  - The influence of landscape pattern on the risk of urban water-logging and flood disaster.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Most Chinese cities face a series of ‘urban diseases’ or problems during rapid urbanization, and of which urban precipitation and subsequent water-logging is a severe hotspot. A better understanding of the influence of urban land-use patterns on water-logging will be helpful for enhancing urban flood resistance. The relationship between the characteristics of land-use patterns and the risk of urban water-logging and flood disaster (UWLFD) was analyzed in this paper, using landscape pattern indicators to describe the land-use structure. These included patch density (PD), edge density (ED), landscape division index (DIVISION), contagion (CONTAG), Shannon’s evenness index (SHEI), and Shannon’s diversity index (SHDI). The risk of UWLFD was measured using the topographic slope and urban surface cover. Based on GIS and remote sensing data in 2003 and 2013, a case study of the metropolitan region of Kunming City showed that the risk of UWLFD had a positive correlation with landscape fragmentation (e.g., PD and ED), and strong negative correlation with landscape contagion (e.g., CONTAG) during the study period. This implied that landscape fragmentation aggravated the risk of UWLFD while landscape connectivity reduced the risk. Measures such as unified and long-term urban planning and design and the construction of green infrastructure will reduce the risk of UWLFD. The relationship between the landscape pattern and the risk of UWLFD provides a new perspective for systematic urban planning.

TI  - Effect of landscape structure on the movement behaviour of a specialized goldenrod beetle, Trirhabda borealis
PY  - 2002
AB  - We hypothesize that the ability of an organism to move through a landscape is determined by the interaction between its movement behaviour and the landscape structure. In contrast, models predicting spatial distribution, local population stability, or metapopulation stability typically assume that movement ability is independent of landscape structure. These model predictions will be invalid if the assumption of constant movement ability is incorrect. To assess the influence of landscape structure on movement behaviour (and therefore movement ability), we tracked individual goldenrod beetles (Trirhabda borealis) through microlandscapes composed of three patch types (goldenrod, cut vegetation, and cut vegetation containing camouflage netting to a height of 50 cm) that differed in terms of available food resources and structural complexity. In goldenrod patches, beetles moved infrequently in brief bursts of slow meandering movements. In cut patches, beetles moved frequently in sustained bursts of slow direc...

TI  - Landscape genetics: where are we now?
PY  - 2010
AB  - Landscape genetics has seen rapid growth in number of publications since the term was coined in 2003. An extensive literature search from 1998 to 2008 using keywords associated with landscape genetics yielded 655 articles encompassing a vast array of study organisms, study designs and methodology. These publications were screened to identify 174 studies that explicitly incorporated at least one landscape variable with genetic data. We systematically reviewed this set of papers to assess taxonomic and temporal trends in: (i) geographic regions studied; (ii) types of questions addressed; (iii) molecular markers used; (iv) statistical analyses used; and (v) types and nature of spatial data used. Overall, studies have occurred in geographic regions proximal to developed countries and more commonly in terrestrial vs. aquatic habitats. Questions most often focused on effects of barriers and/or landscape variables on gene flow. The most commonly used molecular markers were microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLPs), with AFLPs used more frequently in plants than animals. Analysis methods were dominated by Mantel and assignment tests. We also assessed differences among journals to evaluate the uniformity of reporting and publication standards. Few studies presented an explicit study design or explicit descriptions of spatial extent. While some landscape variables such as topographic relief affected most species studied, effects were not universal, and some species appeared unaffected by the landscape. Effects of habitat fragmentation were mixed, with some species altering movement paths and others unaffected. Taken together, although some generalities emerged regarding effects of specific landscape variables, results varied, thereby reinforcing the need for species-specific work. We conclude by: highlighting gaps in knowledge and methodology, providing guidelines to authors and reviewers of landscape genetics studies, and suggesting promising future directions of inquiry.

TI  - Linking Landscape Connectivity and Ecosystem Service Provision: Current Knowledge and Research Gaps
PY  - 2013
AB  - Human activities are rapidly changing ecosystems, landscapes and ecosystem service provision, yet there remain significant gaps in our understanding of the spatial ecology of ecosystem services. These gaps hinder our ability to manage landscapes effectively for multiple ecosystem services. In particular, we do not fully understand how changes in landscape connectivity affect ecosystem service provision, despite theory suggesting that connectivity is important. Here, we perform a semi-quantitative review of the literature that investigates how landscape connectivity affects the provision of specific ecosystem services. The vast majority of studies, including reviews, models, and field studies, suggest that decreased connectivity will have negative effects on ecosystem service provision. However, only 15 studies provided empirical evidence of these effects. Average effect sizes from these 15 studies suggest negative effects of connectivity loss on pollination and pest regulation. We identify a number of significant gaps in the connectivity-ecosystem services literature, including: a lack of multiple service studies, which precludes identification of trade-offs between services as connectivity changes; few studies that directly measure organism movement and its effects on ecosystem services; and few empirical studies that investigate the importance of abiotic flows on service provision. We propose that future research should aim to understand how different aspects of connectivity affect ecosystem service provision; which services are most influenced by connectivity; and how connectivity influences how humans access and benefit from ecosystem services. Studies that answer these questions will advance our understanding of connectivity-ecosystem service provision relationships and allow for better ecosystem and landscape management and restoration.

TI  - Getting the most connectivity per conservation dollar
PY  - 2014
AB  - The importance of connectivity for species conservation has resulted in myriad attempts to identify corridors linking habitat patches and conservation areas. However, making smart decisions for restoring connectivity requires information beyond simple maps of corridors. Here, we combine land-parcel cost estimates with a new analytical approach that pinpoints where barrier removal can best improve connectivity to develop a return-on-investment framework for connectivity restoration. An iterative series of barrier analyses followed by simulated restorations allowed us to incorporate cumulative effects of previous restoration decisions, which can alter the potential value of future restorations. To demonstrate our approach, we identify specific sites that, if restored, would most increase habitat connectivity for the Washington ground squirrel (Urocitellus washingtoni). The analysis was performed in two ways: first without consideration of economic costs and then again, explicitly incorporating the costs of ...

TI  - Dispersion and Population Interactions
PY  - 1974
AB  - The spatial component of environment, often neglected in modeling of ecological interactions, in general operates to increase species diversity. This arises due to the heterogeneity of the environment, but such heterogeneity can arise in an initially homogeneous environment due to what may be random initial events (e.g., colonization patterns), effects of which are magnified by species interactions. In this way, homogeneous environments may become heterogeneous and heterogeneous environments even more so. In patchy environments, distinct patches are likely to be colonized initially by different species, and thereby a kind of founder effect results whereby individual patches evolve along different paths simply as a consequence of initial colonization patterns. Species which would be unable to invade may nevertheless survive by establishing themselves early and will moreover be found in lower densities in other areas as overflow from their "safe" areas. Spatially continuous environments may evolve toward es...

TI  - Designing a conservation plan for protecting the habitat for giant pandas in the Qionglai mountain range, China
PY  - 2006
AB  - Population viability of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is threatened by small population sizes in scattered isolated habitat areas. Designing a conservation plan for protecting and connecting the fragmented habitat will improve the chances for survival of this endangered species. For such a plan, this study assessed the overall habitat suitability for the species in the Qionglai mountain range (Sichuan, China) using Landsat TM imagery acquired in 2001, geographical data, field surveys, and information acquired in previous researches. Results show that the habitat is separated by roads and rivers, as well as by human settlements and cropland areas, into four main habitat blocks. Overlapping these four habitat blocks with the current nature reserve network reveals that only 36% of the total habitat is protected within nature reserves. Thus, the current nature reserve network is failing to preserve essential habitat for dispersal and genetic exchange. In this study, five key areas and four linkage areas were identified and suggested as nature reserves and/or corridors. These areas, together with the six currently established nature reserves in the mountain range, will form a conservation unit for facilitating the exchange of giant panda individuals among previously isolated habitat blocks. Policies recently implemented by the Chinese government, including the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP), could aid in the formation of such a conservation unit.

TI  - Integrating movement ecology with biodiversity research - exploring new avenues to address spatiotemporal biodiversity dynamics.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Movement of organisms is one of the key mechanisms shaping biodiversity, e.g. the distribution of genes, individuals and species in space and time. Recent technological and conceptual advances have improved our ability to assess the causes and consequences of individual movement, and led to the emergence of the new field of ‘movement ecology’. Here, we outline how movement ecology can contribute to the broad field of biodiversity research, i.e. the study of processes and patterns of life among and across different scales, from genes to ecosystems, and we propose a conceptual framework linking these hitherto largely separated fields of research. Our framework builds on the concept of movement ecology for individuals, and demonstrates its importance for linking individual organismal movement with biodiversity. First, organismal movements can provide ‘mobile links’ between habitats or ecosystems, thereby connecting resources, genes, and processes among otherwise separate locations. Understanding these mobile links and their impact on biodiversity will be facilitated by movement ecology, because mobile links can be created by different modes of movement (i.e., foraging, dispersal, migration) that relate to different spatiotemporal scales and have differential effects on biodiversity. Second, organismal movements can also mediate coexistence in communities, through ‘equalizing’ and ‘stabilizing’ mechanisms. This novel integrated framework provides a conceptual starting point for a better understanding of biodiversity dynamics in light of individual movement and space-use behavior across spatiotemporal scales. By illustrating this framework with examples, we argue that the integration of movement ecology and biodiversity research will also enhance our ability to conserve diversity at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.

TI  - Foraging: Behavior and Ecology - Foraging : behavior and ecology
PY  - 2007
AB  - Foraging is fundamental to animal survival and reproduction, yet it is much more than a simple matter of finding food; it is a biological imperative. Animals must find and consume resources to succeed, and they make extraordinary efforts to do so. For instance, pythons rarely eat, but when they do, their meals are large - as much as 60 percent larger than their own bodies. The snake's digestive system is normally dormant, but during digestion metabolic rates can increase fortyfold. A python digesting quietly on the forest floor has the metabolic rate of a thoroughbred in a dead heat. This and related foraging processes have broad applications in ecology, cognitive science, anthropology, and conservation biology - and they can be further extrapolated in economics, neurobiology, and computer science. "Foraging" is the first comprehensive review of the topic in more than twenty years. A monumental undertaking, this volume brings together twenty-two experts from throughout the field to offer the latest on the mechanics of foraging, modern foraging theory, and foraging ecology. The fourteen essays cover all the relevant issues, including cognition, individual behavior, caching behavior, parental behavior, anti-predator behavior, social behavior, population and community ecology, herbivory, and conservation. Considering a wide range of taxa, from birds to mammals to amphibians, "Foraging" will be the definitive guide to the field.

TI  - Riverine landscapes: taking landscape ecology into the water
PY  - 2002
AB  - SUMMARY 1. Landscape ecology deals with the influence of spatial pattern on ecological processes. It considers the ecological consequences of where things are located in space, where they are relative to other things, and how these relationships and their consequences are contingent on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape mosaic at multiple scales in time and space. Traditionally, landscape ecologists have focused their attention on terrestrial ecosystems, and rivers and streams have been considered either as elements of landscape mosaics or as units that are linked to the terrestrial landscape by flows across boundaries or ecotones. Less often, the heterogeneity that exists within a river or stream has been viewed as a ‘riverscape’ in its own right. 2. Landscape ecology can be unified about six central themes: (1) patches differ in quality (2) patch boundaries affect flows, (3) patch context matters, (4) connectivity is critical, (5) organisms are important, and (6) the importance of scale. Although riverine systems differ from terrestrial systems by virtue of the strong physical force of hydrology and the inherent connectivity provided by water flow, all of these themes apply equally to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and to the linkages between the two. 3. Landscape ecology therefore has important insights to offer to the study of riverine ecosystems, but these systems may also provide excellent opportunities for developing and testing landscape ecological theory. The principles and approaches of landscape ecology should be extended to include freshwater systems; it is time to take the ‘land’ out of landscape ecology.

TI  - Using Landscape Indices to Predict Habitat Connectivity
PY  - 1996
AB  - The ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation include the direct effects of habitat loss and the indirect effects of reduced inter-patch dispersal. In particular, habitat patches that survive the process of fragmentation become increasingly isolated from one another, and this can cause species' declines in excess of predictions based strictly on reductions in habitat area. To quantify the hindrance of dispersal caused by habitat frag- mentation, landscape ecologists have invented the notion of habitat connectivity. Indices of landscape pattern are frequently used to estimate habitat connectivity, but whether they actually do so remains undocumented. If indices of habitat pattern do indeed estimate habitat connectivity, then these indices should correlate well with predictions of dispersal success. To test this possibility, I looked for correlations between nine common indices of habitat pattern and the results of a simulated dispersal process conducted using GIS data on the distribution of old-growth forest through the Pacific Northwest. The nine indices of habitat pattern that I examined were only weakly correlated with the results from the dispersal modeling, but I identified a new pattern index, termed patch cohesion, for which the fit was much better. Moreover, I found patch cohesion to be insensitive to the details and artifacts of the dispersal model. The methodology described here will be useful to inves- tigators using indices of landscape pattern to quantify habitat fragmentation.

TI  - Discontinuous habitat corridors : effects on male root vole movements
PY  - 1996
AB  - We tested how movement rates of male root voles were affected by discontinuities (gaps) in a 1-m wide habitat corridor. Gaps of increasing size (0.25-4m) were created experimentally by mowing the vegetation. Movement rates (recorded by radiotelemetry) were compared between the manipulated corridor and a contemporal, unmanipulated (continuous) control corridor. Male root voles did not respond to gaps until the gap size became 4m which is equivalent to 10-20% of the normal home range diameter. Gap sizes of 4 m in the corridor decreased the movement rates significantly and to the same degree for two behaviourally distinct strains of root voles. The similar responses of the two vole strains indicated that the results may have validity beyond the particular experimental setting employed.

TI  - Modeling connectivity of black bears in a desert sky island archipelago
PY  - 2011
AB  - Landscape features such as rivers, mountains, desert basins, roads, and impermeable man-made structures may influence dispersal and gene flow among populations, thereby creating spatial structure across the landscape. In the US–Mexico borderland, urbanization and construction of the border fence have the potential to increase genetic subdivision and vulnerability to isolation in large mammal populations by bisecting movement corridors that have enabled dispersal between adjacent Sky Island mountain ranges. We examined genetic variation in black bears (Ursus americanus) from three regions in central and southern Arizona, US, to assess genetic and landscape connectivity in the US–Mexico border Sky Islands. We found that the three regions grouped into two subpopulations: the east-central subpopulation comprised of individuals sampled in the central highland and high desert regions, and the border subpopulation comprised of individuals sampled in the southern Sky Islands. Occupancy for the border subpopulation of black bears was influenced by cover type and distance to water, and occupancy-based corridor models identified 14 potential corridors connecting border Sky Island habitat cores with the east-central subpopulation. Biological quality of corridors, defined as length:width ratio and proportions of suitable habitat within corridors, declined with Sky Island dispersion. Our results show that black bears in the border subpopulation are moderately isolated from the east-central subpopulation, the main population segment of black bears in Arizona, and that connectivity for border bears may be vulnerable to anthropogenic activities, such as those associated with urbanization and trans-border security.

TI  - Land use/cover predictions incorporating ecological security for the Yangtze River Delta region, China
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Rapid changes in anthropogenic land use threaten ecological security; thus, it is vital to determine future land use structures and spatial layouts for ecological security and sustainable development. Studies on scenario-based land use simulations have taken insufficient account of land use in terms of ecological security and this prevented the realization of ecological civilization. Therefore, in this study, we developed a land use/cover prediction framework that incorporates ecological security. Focusing on ecological security objectives, we integrated habitat quality, the importance of ecosystem services and landscape connectivity to identify the ecological security source areas (ESSA) as a minimum protection area in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. We then set up ESSA-based ecological protection (EP) and natural growth (NG) scenarios to predict land use/cover in the YRD region for 2030 using the future land use simulation (FLUS) model. The results show that the total area of the ESSA is 64,911 km2, accounting for 32.51% of the YRD, mainly in southern Anhui and western Zhejiang provinces. Under the NG scenario, construction land shows the highest growth proportion by 2.10% of the total area of YRD, while the farmland area decreases by 1.73%, followed by woodland (0.27%). Under ESSA-based EP, the areas of woodland and construction land increase by 1.11% and 0.7%, respectively. Through the delineation of ESSA, 159 km2 of woodland, 150 km2 of orchard, 523 km2 of water area and 98 km2 of wetland are protected; in addition, the growth of the construction land slows down and all new construction land is located outside the ESSA under ESSA-based EP. The findings of this study can provide fundamental scientific guidance for land spatial planning given an ecological security premise.

TI  - A simulation-based evaluation of methods for inferring linear barriers to gene flow
PY  - 2012
AB  - Different analytical techniques used on the same data set may lead to different conclusions about the existence and strength of genetic structure. Therefore, reliable interpretation of the results from different methods depends on the efficacy and reliability of different statistical methods. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of multiple analytical methods to detect the presence of a linear barrier dividing populations. We were specifically interested in determining if simulation conditions, such as dispersal ability and genetic equilibrium, affect the power of different analytical methods for detecting barriers. We evaluated two boundary detection methods (Monmonier’s algorithm and WOMBLING), two spatial Bayesian clustering methods (TESS and GENELAND), an aspatial clustering approach (STRUCTURE), and two recently developed, non-Bayesian clustering methods [PSMIX and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC)]. We found that clustering methods had higher success rates than boundary detection methods and also detected the barrier more quickly. All methods detected the barrier more quickly when dispersal was long distance in comparison to shortdistance dispersal scenarios. Bayesian clustering methods performed best overall, both in terms of highest success rates and lowest time to barrier detection, with GENELAND showing the highest power. None of the methods suggested a continuous linear barrier when the data were generated under an isolation-by-distance (IBD) model. However, the clustering methods had higher potential for leading to incorrect barrier inferences under IBD unless strict criteria for successful barrier detection were implemented. Based on our findings and those of previous simulation studies, we discuss the utility of different methods for detecting linear barriers to gene flow.

TI  - Habitat Fragmentation and Extinction Thresholds in Spatially Explicit Models
PY  - 1996
AB  - The incidence of habitat destruction on the survivorship of a single metapopulation is studied by means of a spatially explicit model. As the proportion of destroyed sites increases, the structural properties of the resulting landscape change in a non-linear way, showing the existence of critical thresholds and phase transitions. Such critical thresholds are identified by means of an order parameter, which discriminates a quantitative process, i.e. habitat loss, from a qualitative one, i.e. habitat fragmentation. This difference is only well understood using a spatially explicit framework. We introduce on such a fragmented landscape the dynamics of a metapopulation balanced by local colonization and extinction by means of the cellular automaton formalism. The existence of extinction thresholds when a given fraction of habitat is destroyed is reported. These thresholds are determined both by the critical behaviour of the landscape structural properties, and by the demographic properties of the metapopulation. Some differences between these results and those derived from the study of spatially implicit models are described and explained. In particular, the percentage of patch occupancy is lower for a given value of habitat destruction in the spatially explicit formulation. Extinction threshold also take place for a lower destruction value. Some implications for the management of natural landscapes are discussed.

TI  - Assessing Structural Connectivity of Urban Green Spaces in Metropolitan Hong Kong
PY  - 2017
AB  - Connectivity is a vital element in landscape structure because of its importance in species–landscape interactions. Connectivity analysis of green spaces in urban landscapes, especially in high-density cities such as Hong Kong, differs from that of habitats in natural or rural landscapes. Using the human being as the target species, we formulated with GIS techniques a resistance weight, a structural connectivity index and an ecological barrier effect index to assess connectivity of green spaces. Two factors were included in the modeling, namely the resistance of different land uses related to human activities, and the distance between different urban green spaces. We analyzed the relationships between the connectivity index of green spaces and green cover, elevation, building density and population density. Our results indicate that low connectivity usually occurs in both old and new town centers with high building density and low green cover, and in areas occupied by land uses with a high resistance weight. However, urban density may not necessarily have a negative influence on the structural connectivity of green spaces. Green cover also may not necessarily have positive impact on connectivity if the green spaces have a poor spatial pattern. Adding more green stepping stones, large green spaces and green corridors to form greenways and shortening the distance between urban green spaces can offer a spatial-planning strategy to increase the green space connectivity in Hong Kong. The study provides insights to optimize connectivity of green spaces to improve the urban living environment in high-density metropolises.

TI  - Key concepts and research topics in landscape ecology revisited: 30 years after the Allerton Park workshop
PY  - 2012
AB  - This year marks the 30th anniversary of a momentous meeting in the history of landscape ecology—the Landscape Ecology Workshop held in Allerton Park, Illinois, USA in 1983. On this special occasion, I am inspired to make some observations and comments on the state-of-the-science of landscape ecology as a tribute to this historic event. One may argue that the workshop galvanized a shift in paradigm and the development of an ''identity'' for landscape ecology. The field has advanced swiftly and produc- tively during the past three decades, and reviewing the publications in the flagship journal Landscape Ecol- ogy indicates that the Allerton Park vision has been amazingly influential in shaping the direction of the field. Based on a synoptic analysis of the literature, I discuss the core questions, key topics, and future direction of landscape ecology.

AB  - Road ecology has developed into a significant branch of ecology with steady growth in the number of refereed journal articles, books, conferences, symposia, and “best practice” guidelines being produced each year. The main objective of this special issue of Ecology and Society is to highlight the need for studies that document the population, community, and ecosystem-level effects of roads and traffic by publishing studies that document these effects. It became apparent when compiling this special issue that there is a paucity of studies that explicitly examined higher order effects of roads and traffic. No papers on landscape function or ecosystem-level effects were submitted, despite being highlighted as a priority for publication. The 17 papers in this issue, from Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and USA, all deal to some extent with either population or community-level effects of roads and traffic. Nevertheless, many higher order effects remain unquantified, and must become the focus of future studies because the complexity and interactions among the effects of roads and traffic are large and potentially unexpected. An analysis of these complex interrelations requires systematic research, and it is necessary to further establish collaborative links between ecologists and transportation agencies. Many road agencies have “environmental sustainability” as one of their goals and the only way to achieve such goals is for them to support and foster long-term and credible scientific research. The current situation, with numerous small-scale projects being undertaken independently of each other, cannot provide the information required to quantify and mitigate the negative effects of roads and traffic on higher levels. The future of road ecology research will be best enhanced when multiple road projects in different states or countries are combined and studied as part of integrated, well-replicated research projects.

TI  - A comparison-shopper's guide to connectivity metrics
PY  - 2004
AB  - Connectivity is an important but inconsistently defined concept in spatial ecology and conservation biology. Theoreticians from various subdisciplines of ecology argue over its definition and measurement, but no consensus has yet emerged. Despite this disagreement, measuring connectivity is an integral part of many resource management plans. A more practical approach to understanding the many connectivity metrics is needed. Instead of focusing on theoretical issues surrounding the concept of connectivity, we describe a data-dependent framework for classifying these metrics. This framework illustrates the data requirements, spatial scales, and information yields of a range of different connectivity measures. By highlighting the costs and benefits associated with using alternative metrics, this framework allows practitioners to make more informed decisions concerning connectivity measurement.

TI  - Applying ant colony algorithm to identify ecological security patterns in megacities
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Ecological security patterns composed of ecological sources and corridors provide an effective approach to conserving natural ecosystems. Although the direction of ecological corridors has been identified in previous studies, the precise range remains unknown. To address this crucial gap, ant colony algorithm and kernel density estimation were applied to identify the range and restoration points of ecological corridors, which is important for natural conservation and ecological restoration. In this case study of Beijing City, ecological sources were identified based on habitat importance and landscape connectivity. The results showed that, in total 3119.65 km2 of ecological land had been extracted as ecological sources, which were mainly located in the northern, northwestern and northeastern mountainous areas. The identified key ecological corridor covered an area of 198.86 km2, with 567.30 km2 for potential ecological corridors, both connecting the ecological sources. 34 key points were also identified with priority in restoring ecological corridors.

TI  - METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS: EFFECTS OF HABITAT QUALITY AND LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE
PY  - 1998
AB  - Metapopulation dynamics have received much attention in conservation and population biology, but the standard approach has also been criticized for being too restrictive, as it is based on the effects of habitat patch area and isolation only. Here we demonstrate how the effects of habitat quality (extra environmental factors) and detailed landscape structure (described with GIS [Geographical Information System]) can be included in a spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. Expanded models are tested with a large data set on the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). The incidence function model supplemented with additional environmental factors revealed some new and confirmed some previously known interactions between M. cinxia and its environment. However, the ability of the additional environmental factors to explain the error in the fit of the basic model was generally low (≤15%). In the second variant of the basic model, landscape structure was used to modify effective patch isolations. This approach, though biologically appealing, failed to improve significantly the fit of the incidence function model. There are several possible reasons for this failure, including inaccurate satellite data, problems with habitat classification, and most importantly, generic problems in the modeling of migration. Our results demonstrate that additional complexity beyond the effects of habitat patch area and isolation does not necessarily improve the predictive power of a metapopulation model.

TI  - Fine-scale movement behaviors of calopterygid damselflies are influenced by landscape structure: an experimental manipulation
PY  - 2000
AB  - We explore the effect of differences in landscape structure, arising from habitat loss, on the fine-scale movement behaviors of two congeneric damselflies –Calopteryx aequabilis and C. maculata. Both species require streams for breeding and naiad development and both often use forest for foraging. We compare movement behaviors across three types of landscape: forested landscapes, where stream and forest habitat are adjacent; partially forested landscapes, where streams and forest habitat are disjunct, and non-forested landscapes, where little to no forest habitat is available. We employ a reciprocal transplant experiment to determine the extent to which movement along and away from streams is influenced by landscape structure and historical behavior or morphological adaptations. For both species, we show that both the propensity to move away from streams and rates of net displacement differ among landscape types. Both species move away from streams on landscapes with high or moderate levels of forest cover but neither moves away from streams on landscapes with little or no forest. Furthermore, C. maculata native to predominantly forested landscapes are more likely to move away from streams, regardless of the landscape structure they encounter, than are individuals native to moderately forested or non-forested landscapes. There was no effect of natal landscape on C. aequabilis. Comparisons with microlandscape studies suggest that there may be some general similarities among the different systems but these are clouded by uncertainty regarding the similarity of the underlying processes responsible for observed behavioral responses to landscape structure. Despite this uncertainty, animal movement behaviors are contingent upon the structure of the broader landscape, regardless of the absolute scale of the landscape.

TI  - A practical toolbox for design and analysis of landscape genetics studies
PY  - 2014
AB  - Landscape genetics integrates theory and analytical methods of population genetics and landscape ecology. Research in this area has increased in recent decades, creating a plethora of options for study design and analysis. Here we present a practical toolbox for the design and analysis of landscape genetics studies following a seven-step framework: (1) define the study objectives, (2) consider the spatial and temporal scale of the study, (3) design a sampling regime, (4) select a genetic marker, (5) generate genetic input data, (6) generate spatial input data, and (7) choose an analytical method that integrates genetic and spatial data. Study design considerations discussed include choices of spatial and temporal scale, sample size and spatial distribution, and genetic marker selection. We present analytical methods suitable for achieving different study objectives. As emerging technologies generate genetic and spatial data sets of increasing size, complexity, and resolution, landscape geneticists are challenged to execute hypothesis-driven research that combines empirical data and simulation modeling. The landscape genetics framework presented here can accommodate new design considerations and analyses, and facilitate integration of genetic and spatial data by guiding new landscape geneticists through study design, implementation, and analysis.

TI  - Health Evaluation and Risk Factor Identification of Urban Lakes—A Case Study of Lianshi Lake
PY  - 2020
AB  - Health assessment and risk factor identification represent the premise and foundation of scientific management and ecological restoration of urban lakes. Based on in-depth understanding of the nature–society duality of urban lakes, a framework for evaluating urban lake health was constructed, including four modules, namely, establishing an index system; determining the index weight; identifying risk factors; and a comprehensive lake health evaluation. Employing this framework, we evaluated Lianshi Lake, Beijing, classifying the lake condition as “sub-healthy”. Based on the evaluation data, we identified the health risk factors of the lake. We applied standard difference rate (SDR) and risk degree (Rd) (safe degree (Sd)) concepts, and classified the indices of risk areas employing the Pareto analysis method. Finally, we identified the lake residence period, landscape connectivity, and eutrophication as the major risk factors in Lianshi Lake. Three factors constitute the basis of ecosystem health and are key targets of ecological restoration: the lake residence period represents the hydrological and hydrodynamic characteristics of the lake; landscape connectivity is described from an ecological perspective, and represents the integrity of the lake ecosystem; and the eutrophication states describe the water quality characteristics and represent the availability of lake water. The results contribute to decision-making for comprehensive urban lake management.

TI  - Habitat connectivity, habitat continuity, and metapopulations in dynamic landscapes
PY  - 1999
AB  - Landscape ecology and metapopulation ecology share a common interest in developing measures that describe the structure of heterogeneous landscapes, but the specific aim in metapopulation ecology is to construct measures that help predict the dynamics of species with information about the structure of fragmented landscapes. The amount of habitat that individuals in a metapopulation have access to can be divided into four components, the amount of habitat in the present habitat patch (A i ), the amount of connected habitat in other patches available via migration (Γ i ), the amount of preserved habitat in the present patch after time period Δt(A' i ), and the amount of linked habitat in other patches after time period Δt(Γ' i ). Deterministic threshold conditions for metapopulation persistence in patch networks can be approximated with these quantities. For instance, in a version of the Levins model with extinction risk proportional to the inverse of patch area and colonization probability proportional to patch connectivity, the threshold condition for metapopulation persistence is given by ΓA + Var(Γ A)/ΓA >e/c, where e and c are the species-specific extinction and colonization parameters. I conjecture that with measures A' and Γ' the threshold condition for metapopulation persistence can be extended to dynamic landscapes, in which all or part of population turnover is caused by turnover in the habitat patches themselves. The measures of habitat availability described in this paper can be used to rank dissimilar fragmented landscapes in terms of their capacity to support a viable metapopulation.

TI  - Climate forcing of wetland landscape connectivity in the Great Plains
PY  - 2014
AB  - Habitat connectivity is a landscape attribute critical to the long-term viability of many wildlife species, including migratory birds. Climate change has the potential to affect habitat connectivity within and across the three main wetland complexes in the Great Plains of North America: the prairie potholes of the northern plains, the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, and the playas of the southern plains. Here, we use these wetlands as model systems in a graph-theory-based approach to establish links between climatic drivers and habitat connectivity for wildlife in current and projected wetland landscapes and to discern how that capacity can vary as a function of climatic forcing. We also provide a case study of macrosystems ecology to examine how the patterns and processes that determine habitat connectivity fluctuate across landscapes, regions, and continents.

AB  - Connectivity is a vital component of metapopulation and landscape ecology, influencing fundamental processes such as population dynamics, evolution, and community responses to climate change. Here, we review ongoing developments in connectivity science, providing perspectives on recent advances in identifying, quantifying, modelling and analysing connectivity, and highlight new applications for conservation. We also address ongoing challenges for connectivity research, explore opportunities for addressing them and highlight potential linkages with other fields of research. Continued development of connectivity science will provide insights into key aspects of ecology and the evolution of species, and will also contribute significantly towards achieving more effective conservation outcomes.

TI  - Assessing the Data Requirements of Spatially Explicit Dispersal Models
PY  - 1997
AB  - We evaluated the consequences of parameter errors for predictions of spatially explicit population models. We examined a simple model for organisms dispersing in a fragmented landscape and assessed how errors in three model input parameters propagate into errors in model predictions: (1) misclassification of habitat suitability (landscape error); (2) incorrect estimation of how far a disperser can travel (mobility error); and (3) incorrect estimation of the mortality rate of dispersers (dispersal-mortality error). The two-dimensional landscape through which organisms dispersed was filled with patches of various shapes (square, linear, and elbow) and sizes (4, 9, and 16 cells), and we allowed the overall proportion of suitable habitat in the landscape (2, 8, 16, and 24%) to vary among runs. A single run consisted of 400 individuals dispersing through the landscape until they found suitable habitat patches, and the output was a frequency distribution of the number of steps taken before a patch was found (n = 400 individuals). In the error-free model, dispersal success increased with the percentage of the landscape that was composed of suitable habitat and was greater in landscapes filled with more small patches than in those with fewer large patches. Errors in dispersal-mortality parameters resulted in the greatest prediction errors (25–90%), followed by mobility errors (2–60%) and landscape errors (<1–17%). In general, prediction errors were higher in landscapes with a lower percentage of suitable habitat, precisely the type of habitat characterizing most species of conservation concern. Our results point to the need for better empirical estimates of errors in dispersal parameters. In addition, our results suggest that less detailed models would improve the match between the complexity of the model and the quality of available data. Valoracion de los Requerimientos de Datos para Modelos de Dispersion Espacialmente Explicita En este trabajo evaluamos las consecuencias de errores en los parametros de las predicciones de modelos poblacionales con estructura espacial explicita. Construimos un modelo poblacional en el cual los organismos se dispersan en un ambiente fragmentado y evaluamos la propagacion de errores en los parametros usados en las predicciones que resultan del modelo. Nuestras simulaciones exploran las consecuencias de tres tipos de errores: (1) clasificacion erronea del ambiente adecuado para la especie (error de “paisaje”); (2) estimacion incorrecta de la distancia que puede viajar un organismo (error de movilidad); y (3) estimacion incorrecta de la tasa de mortalidad de los organismos que se dispersan. El ambiente bi-dimensional a traves del cual los organismos se dispersan es ocupado por parches de distintas formas (cuadrados, lineales y acotados) y tamanos (4, 9 y 16 celdas); variamos ademas la proporcion total de la superficie de ambiente adecuado (2, 8, 16, y 24%). Cada corrida del modelo consistio en 400 individuos dispersandose a traves del ambiente hasta encontrar un parche adecuado. La distribucion de frecuencias del numero de pasos tomados antes de encontrar un parche apropiado (n = 400 individuos) fue evaluada para cada combinacion de valores de los parametros. El modelo libre de errores produjo simulaciones donde el exito de dispersion aumento con la proporcion de ambiente adecuado y tambien en ambientes con muchos parches chicos comparado con aquellos con pocos parches grandes. Errores en la mortalidad de los individuos que se dispersan resultaron en los mayores errores de prediccion (25–90%), seguido de errores en la movilidad de los individuos (2–60%) y errores en la calidad del habitat (1–17%) en terminos relativos. En general, los errores de prediccion fueron mayores en ambientes con bajo porcentaje de habitat adecuado, precisamente el tipo de ambiente caracteristico de la mayoria de especies que concieren a los esfuerzos de conservacion. Nuestros resultados senalan la importancia de la obtencion de medidas empiricas de los errores asociados a los parametros de dispersion y sugieren la necesidad de utilizar estrategias alternativas de modelado para predecir el destino de poblaciones que habian ambientes fragmentados.

TI  - Using forest history and spatial patterns to identify potential high conservation value forests in Romania
PY  - 2013
AB  - Naturally dynamic forests have a high proportion of biotopes with old large trees, diverse vertical and horizontal structure at multiple scales, and much dead wood. As such, they provide habitat to species and ecosystem processes that forests managed for wood production cannot provide to the same degree. Whether termed old-growth, ancient, virgin, intact, primeval or continuity forests, a major challenge and need is to map such potential high conservation value forest for subsequent inclusion in functional habitat networks for biodiversity conservation in forest landscapes. Given that the delivery time of natural forest properties is much longer than of industry wood, we explore the usefulness of using historical maps to identify forests that have been continuously present for 220 years (potential old-growth) versus 140 years (potential aging forest) in a case study in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains (see Online Resource 1). While the total forest cover increased by 35 % over the past two centuries, the area of potential aging and potential old-growth forest declined by 56 and 34 %, respectively. Spatial modelling of edge effects and patch size for virtual species with different requirements indicated an even greater decrease in the area of functional habitat networks of old-growth and ageing forest. Our analyses show that compared to simple mapping of potential high conservation forests, the area of functional habitat patches is severely overestimated, and caution is needed when estimating the area of potential high conservation value forests that form functional habitat networks, i.e. a green infrastructure. In addition, the landscape and regional scale connectivity of patches needs to be considered. We argue that the use of historical maps combined with assessment of spatial patterns is an effective tool for identifying and analyzing potential high conservation value forests in a landscape context.

TI  - A Conceptual Framework for Quantitative Text Analysis On Joining Probabilities and Substantive Inferences about Texts
PY  - 2000
AB  - Quantitative text analysis refers to the application of one or more methods for drawing statistical inferences from text populations. After briefly distinguishing quantitative text analysis from linguistics, computational linguistics, and qualitative text analysis, issues raised during the 1955 Allerton House Conference are used as a vehicle for characterizing classical text analysis as an instrumental-thematic method. Quantitative text analysis methods are then depicted according to a 2 3 conceptual framework in which texts are interpreted either instrumentally (according to the researcher's conceptual framework) or representationally (according to the texts' sources' perspectives), as well as in which variables are thematic (counts of word/phrase occurrences), se- mantic (themes within a semantic grammar), or network-related (theme- or relation-positions within a conceptual network). Common methodological errors associated with each method are discussed. The paper concludes with a delineation of the universe of substantive answers that quantitative text analysis is able to provide to social science researchers.

TI  - Quantifying landscape structure: a review of landscape indices and their application to forested landscapes
PY  - 1996
AB  - An important assumption of many environmental decisions is that some patterns or combinations of land cover are optimal or more preferable to others. Management plans fre quently seek to change the structure of a landscape to realise particular management goals, because it is recognized that the spatial arrangement of elements in a land cover mosaic control the ecological processes which operate within it. This study reviews some of the tools available to those who need to describe and understand the spatial structure of landscapes. In particular, it examines the way in which quantitative measures, or indices, can be used and what contri bution they might make to the management of forested landscapes in the UK. The paper dis cusses the way in which the different landscape indices can be used to assess the spatial impli cations of the various design guidelines that have been proposd to promote sustainable forms of forestry. It is concluded that while progress has been made in the development of a range of ...

TI  - Incorporating landscape elements into a connectivity measure: a case study for the speckled wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria L.)
PY  - 2003
AB  - In spatial studies of populations, Euclidean distance is commonly used to measure the structural connectivity between habitat patches. The role of the matrix on patch connectivity is thereby ignored. However, the importance of the matrix for (dispersal) movement is increasingly being acknowledged. Our study compared the cost-distance measure with the Euclidean distance. The cost-distance is a simple GIS-calculated connectivity measure that incorporates the resistance of the landscape matrix to movement behaviour. We used presence-absence data from a field study on the Speckled wood butterfly in two Belgian landscapes. Logistic regression revealed that the cost-distance measure had a significantly better predictive power than the Euclidean distance. This result was consistent for all the six sets of different matrix resistance values. In our study the cost-distance proves to be a better connectivity measure than the Euclidean distance.

TI  - A green infrastructure spatial planning model for evaluating ecosystem service tradeoffs and synergies across three coastal megacities
PY  - 2019
AB  - A growing number of cities are investing in green infrastructure to foster urban resilience and sustainability. While these nature-based solutions are often promoted on the basis of their multifunctionality, in practice, most studies and plans focus on a single benefit, such as stormwater management. This represents a missed opportunity to strategically site green infrastructure to leverage social and ecological co-benefits. To address this gap, this paper builds on existing modeling approaches for green infrastructure planning to create a more generalizable tool for comparing spatial tradeoffs and synergistic 'hotspots' for multiple desired benefits. I apply the model to three diverse coastal megacities: New York City, Los Angeles (United States), and Manila (Philippines), enabling cross-city comparisons for the first time. Spatial multi-criteria evaluation is used to examine how strategic areas for green infrastructure development across the cities change depending on which benefit is prioritized. GIS layers corresponding to six planning priorities (managing stormwater, reducing social vulnerability, increasing access to green space, improving air quality, reducing the urban heat island effect, and increasing landscape connectivity) are mapped and spatial tradeoffs assessed. Criteria are also weighted to reflect local stakeholders' desired outcomes as determined through surveys and stakeholder meetings and combined to identify high priority areas for green infrastructure development. To extend the model's utility as a decision-support tool, an interactive web-based application is developed that allows any user to change the criteria weights and visualize the resulting hotspots in real time. The model empirically illustrates the complexities of planning green infrastructure in different urban contexts, while also demonstrating a flexible approach for more participatory, strategic, and multifunctional planning of green infrastructure in cities around the world.

TI  - The future of urban biodiversity research: Moving beyond the ‘low-hanging fruit’
PY  - 2013
AB  - In this era of rapidly urbanising human populations, urban practitioners are under increasing pressure to create resilient and sustainable cities and towns. Urban ecologists currently have a unique opportunity to apply solid, evidence-based research to help create biodiversity-rich and sustainable cities and towns for the future. Unfortunately, there is currently a mismatch between the questions planners, designers and decision-makers are asking urban ecologists that would allow them to improve the biodiversity outcomes in urban areas, and the questions urban ecologists must ask to contribute to the development and application of the science of urban ecology. For a number of reasons, urban ecologists over the past 25 years have primarily focused on describing the patterns of biodiversity in cities and towns using broad, aggregate predictor variables (e.g., distance to city center, land-use, percent cover of impermeable surfaces and vegetation, etc.). We refer to these results as ‘low-hanging fruit’. If the discipline of urban ecology is going to provide the necessary information to inform actions to preserve and enhance urban biodiversity, we need to move beyond place-based research, and work towards the development of confirmed generalizations regarding the relationship between the structure and function of urban ecosystems and biodiversity. We propose three essential strategies for achieving this refined understanding: 1) defining the study window to place the study into a broader global context, 2) collecting and using more explicit question-driven measures of the urban condition in order to improve our understanding of urban ecological drivers, as well as recording more detailed ecological responses to provide insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying an observed response, and 3) expanding studies to include multiple cities, regions and countries. These strategies will help to expedite the ability of urban ecology to contribute to the creation of biodiversity-rich, healthy, resilient cities and towns.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analysis of landscape patterns
PY  - 1990
AB  - A variety of ecological questions now require the study of large regions and the understanding of spatial heterogeneity. Methods for spatial-temporal analyses are becoming increasingly important for ecological studies. A grid cell based spatial analysis program (SPAN) is described and results of landscape pattern analysis using SPAN are presentedd. Several ecological topics in which geographic information systems (GIS) can play an important role (landscape pattern analysis, neutral models of pattern and process, and extrapolation across spatial scales) are reviewed. To study the relationship between observed landscape patterns and ecological processes, a neutral model approach is recommended. For example, the expected pattern (i.e., neutral model) of the spread of disturbance across a landscape can be generated and then tested using actual landscape data that are stored in a GIS. Observed spatial or temporal patterns in ecological data may also be influenced by scale. Creating a spatial data base frequently requires integrating data at different scales. Spatial is shown to influence landscape pattern analyses, but extrapolation of data across spatial scales may be possible if the grain and extent of the data are specified. The continued development and testing of new methods for spatial-temporal analysis will contribute to a general understanding of landscape dynamics.

TI  - Landscape ecology of the wart-biter Decticus verrucivorus in a patchy landscape
PY  - 1996
AB  - 1. Populations of wart-biter Decticus verrucivorus living on habitat islands in an intensively exploited agricultural landscape in south-eastern Norway were studied. Auditory recordings of singing males indicated that 27 (39%) of 70 habitat islands contained populations in the first year of the study, while 2 years (one wart-biter generation) later the number was 16 (23%). Dispersing male wart-biters were also observed, and the dispersal distances measured. 2. Predictors of island occupancy were identified by applying logistic regression models to the pattern of presence/absence, probing the predictive power of both landscape variables (island size and isolation) as well as various microhabitat quality variables (vegetation, aspect and slope). The isolation of habitat islands relative to surrounding wart-biter populations was measured by two types of connectivity indices: one based on the empirical probability distribution of dispersal distances, the other on the negative-exponential dispersal function. 3. Habitat area and the connectivity indices were by far the best predictors of occupancy. The probability of occupation increased with increasing area and decreasing isolation. Of the unoccupied habitat islands, the ones with observations of single males were less isolated than the ones without. From the pattern of occupancy, the average dispersal distance was estimated to be 40m, while the observed average dispersal distance of males was 37 m. 4. In addition to the effects of area and connectivity, the probability of occupation was positively influenced by increasing slope to the south, increasing amounts of the plant Achillea millefolium, and decreasing fraction of vegetation lower than 10 cm. The probability of local population extinction increased with declining habitat area and increasing fraction of low vegetation. 5. The situation of the wart-biter in this highly fragmented study area seems to largely fit a metapopulation model: extinctions and absence of wart-biters were adequately predicted by habitat island size and isolation, and observed dispersal distances closely matched estimated dispersal distances from the model.

TI  - An empirical evaluation of the African elephant as a focal species for connectivity planning in East Africa
PY  - 2011
AB  - Aim Large, charismatic and wide-ranging animals are often employed as focal species for prioritizing landscape linkages in threatened ecosystems (i.e. ‘connectivity conservation’), but there have been few efforts to assess empirically whether focal species co-occur with other species of conservation interest within potential linkages. We evaluated whether the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), a world-recognized flagship species, would serve as an appropriate focal species for other large mammals in a potential linkage between two major protected area complexes. Location A 15,400 km2 area between the Ruaha and Selous ecosystems in central Tanzania, East Africa. Methods We used walking transects to assess habitat, human activity and co-occurrence of elephants and 48 other large mammal species (> 1 kg) at 63 sites using animal sign and direct sightings. We repeated a subset of transects to estimate species detectability using occupancy modelling. We used logistic regression and AIC model selection to characterize patterns of elephant occurrence and assessed correlation of elephant presence with richness of large mammals and subgroups. We considered other possible focal species, compared habitat-based linear regression models of large mammal richness and used circuit theory to examine potential connectivity spatially. Results Elephants were detected in many locations across the potential linkage. Elephant presence was highly positively correlated with the richness of large mammals, as well as ungulates, carnivores, large carnivores and species > 45 kg in body mass (‘megafauna’). Outside of protected areas, both mammal richness and elephant presence were negatively correlated with human population density and distance from water. Only one other potential focal species was more strongly correlated with species richness than elephants, but detectability was highest for elephants. Main conclusions Although African elephants have dispersal abilities that exceed most other terrestrial mammals, conserving elephant movement corridors may effectively preserve habitat and potential landscape linkages for other large mammal species among Tanzanian reserves.

TI  - On the usage and measurement of landscape connectivity
PY  - 2000
AB  - This paper examines the usage and measurement of “landscape connectivity” in 33 recent studies. Connectivity is defined as the degree to which a landscape facilitates or impedes movement of organisms among resource patches. However, connectivity is actually used in a variety of ways in the literature. This has led to confusion and lack of clarity related to (1) function vs structure, (2) patch isolation vs landscape connectivity and, (3) corridors vs connectivity. We suggest the term connectivity should be reserved for its original purpose. We highlight nine studies; these include modeling studies that actually measured connectivity in accordance with the definition, and empirical studies that measured key components of connectivity. We found that measurements of connectivity provide results that can be interpreted as recommending habitat fragmentation to enhance landscape connectivity. We discuss reasons for this misleading conclusion, and suggest a new way of quantifying connectivity, which avoids this problem. We also recommend a method for reducing sampling intensity in landscape-scale empirical studies of connectivity.

TI  - Integrating a landscape connectivity approach into mitigation hierarchy planning by anticipating urban dynamics
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Urbanization leads to land-use changes and landscape fragmentation, impacting natural habitats and their connectivity. In principle, many local decision-makers are obliged to adopt a mitigation hierarchy whereby development projects must be designed to avoid impacts on biodiversity, reduce, and ultimately compensate for the remaining impacts to reach the goal of no net loss (NNL) of biodiversity. In practice, however, both developers and regulators lack relevant practical tools to support their strategies to better anticipate and plan this mitigation hierarchy. More importantly, the available tools generally ignore connectivity issues and ecological constraints. Here, we propose an original methodology that anticipates future urban needs under different development scenarios and selects the most relevant strategies for biodiversity offsets (BO). We used a spatialized digital simulator (called SimUrba) to model fine-scale urban dynamics, combining it with ecological networks modelling based on graph theory to assess the environmental impacts of urbanization on a habitat connectivity index for focal species. We test the different outcomes produced by adopting two offset ratios (1:1 and 2:1) using this approach. The methodology is applied to empirical data on the future urban sprawl of a large French city up to 2040 under two realistic development scenarios currently discussed by policy-makers, and on 20 species that we grouped by type of habitat. Our results reveal that that the most highly impacted species are those associated with open and semi-open areas, and cultivated plots. Then, we identify the most promising cells for BO implementation to compensate for negative effects on habitat area, according to gains in habitat connectivity. We further show that using both private and public land can maximize habitat connectivity by including larger plots and reducing the number of plots needing long-term monitoring. Finally, we demonstrate that using standard offset ratios that ignore connectivity issues is very risky and can compromise any BO objective. Overall, we show that this framework provides decision-makers with a valuable and precise strategic tool that articulates land-use planning with ecological constraints to identify whether, how and where NNL objectives can be achieved.

TI  - Conserving Forest Biodiversity: A Comprehensive Multiscaled Approach
PY  - 2002
AB  - While most efforts at biodiversity conservation have focused primarily on protected areas and reserves, the unprotected lands surrounding those areas - the "matrix" - are equally important to preserving global biodiversity and maintaining forest health. In this volume, leading forest scientists David B. Lindenmayer and Jerry F. Franklin argue that the conservation of forest biodiversity requires a comprehensive and multiscaled approach that includes both reserve and non-reserve areas. They lay the foundations for such a strategy, bringing together the latest scientific information on landscape ecology, forestry, conservation biology, and related disciplines as they examine: the importance of the matrix in key areas of ecology such as metapopulation dynamics, habitat fragmentation, and landscape connectivity; general principles for matrix management; using natural disturbance regimes to guide human disturbance; landscape-level and stand-level elements of matrix management; the role of adaptive management and monitoring; and social dimensions and tensions in implementing matrix-based forest management.

TI  - Urban Biodiversity: Patterns and Mechanisms
PY  - 2011
AB  - The patterns of biodiversity changes in cities are now fairly well established, although diversity changes in temperate cities are much better studied than cities in other climate zones. Generally, plant species richness often increases in cities due to importation of exotic species, whereas animal species richness declines. Abundances of some groups, especially birds and arthropods, often increase in urban areas despite declines in species richness. Although several models have been proposed for biodiversity change, the processes underlying the patterns of biodiversity in cities are poorly understood. We argue that humans directly control plants but relatively few animals and microbes—the remaining biological community is determined by this plant “template” upon which natural ecological and evolutionary processes act. As a result, conserving or reconstructing natural habitats defined by vegetation within urban areas is no guarantee that other components of the biological community will follow suit. Understanding the human-controlled and natural processes that alter biodiversity is essential for conserving urban biodiversity. This urban biodiversity will comprise a growing fraction of the world's repository of biodiversity in the future.

TI  - Bushland modification and styles of urban development: their effects on birds in south-east Queensland
PY  - 1998
AB  - Variation in bird assemblages associated with forest clearing and urbanisation in the greater Brisbane area was assessed by counting birds in sites within six habitat categories: large remnants, small remnants, no- understorey remnants, canopy suburbs (original trees present), planted suburbs, and bare suburbs. Total bird abundance and species richness were generally highest in canopy suburbs. Individual species showed many significant abundance differences among the habitat types, and were classified into three major response categories: bushland species (3 in summer, 13 in winter), tolerant species (13 in summer, 13 in winter), and suburban species (12 in summer, 11 in winter). The commonly proposed notion that urbanisation results in lowered bird species richness and increases in introduced species is broadly consistent with the observed differences between bare suburbs and large remnants. However, it does not adequately describe the situation in the planted and canopy suburbs, where there was high species richness and extremely high abundance of some native species (including noisy miners, lorikeets, friarbirds, and butcherbirds) but low abundance of a majority of the species common in the original habitats (including fantails, wrens, whistlers, and other small insectivores). Retained forest remnants are essential for the latter group. Urban plantings of prolifically flowering native species do not reverse the effects of deforestation, but promote a distinctive group of common native suburban bird species. Origins of the urban bird assemblage are discussed.

TI  - Corridors and connectivity: when use and function do not equate
PY  - 2006
AB  - Connectivity, or the integration of populations into a single demographic unit, is an often desired, but largely untested aspect of wildlife corridors. Using a corridor system that was established at least 85 years prior, we investigated the extent of connectivity provided. This was undertaken using a combined ecological and genetic approach with connectivity estimated by gene flow. Vegetation within the corridor was found to be comparable in physical structure and species composition to that within the connected patches and the two target species (Melomys cervinipes and Uromys caudimaculatus) were shown to occur along the corridor but not within the surrounding matrix. These factors indicated that the corridor was suitable for use as a model system. The population structure (weights of individuals, sex ratios and the percentage of juveniles) of both species were also similar within the corridor and the connected patches suggesting that the corridor provided the resources necessary to sustain breeding populations along its length. Despite this, populations in patches linked by the corridor were found to show the same significant levels of genetic differentiation as those in isolated habitats. M. cervinipes, but not U. caudimaculatus, also showed population differentiation within the continuous habitat. Although based on only one corridor system, these results clearly demonstrate that connectivity between connected populations will not always be achieved by the construction or retention of a corridor and that connectivity cannot be inferred solely from the presence of individuals, or breeding populations, within the corridor.

TI  - Corridors affect plants, animals, and their interactions in fragmented landscapes.
PY  - 2002
AB  - Among the most popular strategies for maintaining populations of both plants and animals in fragmented landscapes is to connect isolated patches with thin strips of habitat, called corridors. Corridors are thought to increase the exchange of individuals between habitat patches, promoting genetic exchange and reducing population fluctuations. Empirical studies addressing the effects of corridors have either been small in scale or have ignored confounding effects of increased habitat area created by the presence of a corridor. These methodological difficulties, coupled with a paucity of studies examining the effects of corridors on plants and plant–animal interactions, have sparked debate over the purported value of corridors in conservation planning. We report results of a large-scale experiment that directly address this debate. In eight large-scale experimental landscapes that control for patch area and test alternative mechanisms of corridor function, we demonstrate that corridors not only increase the exchange of animals between patches, but also facilitate two key plant–animal interactions: pollination and seed dispersal. Our results show that the beneficial effects of corridors extend beyond the area they add, and suggest that increased plant and animal movement through corridors will have positive impacts on plant populations and community interactions in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation: a synthesis
PY  - 2007
AB  - Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation are key drivers of global species loss. Their effects may be understood by focusing on: (1) individual species and the processes threatening them, and (2) human-perceived landscape patterns and their correlation with species and assemblages. Individual species may decline as a result of interacting exogenous and endogenous threats, including habitat loss, habitat degradation, habitat isolation, changes in the biology, behaviour, and interactions of species, as well as additional, stochastic threats. Human-perceived landscape patterns that are frequently correlated with species assemblages include the amount and structure of native vegetation, the prevalence of anthropogenic edges, the degree of landscape connectivity, and the structure and heterogeneity of modified areas. Extinction cascades are particularly likely to occur in landscapes with low native vegetation cover, low landscape connectivity, degraded native vegetation and intensive land use in modified areas, especially if keystone species or entire functional groups of species are lost. This review (1) demonstrates that species-oriented and pattern-oriented approaches to understanding the ecology of modified landscapes are highly complementary, (2) clarifies the links between a wide range of interconnected themes, and (3) provides clear and consistent terminology. Tangible research and management priorities are outlined that are likely to benefit the conservation of native species in modified landscapes around the world.

TI  - EFFECTS OF BIODIVERSITY ON ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING: A CONSENSUS OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE
PY  - 2005
AB  - Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the re- lationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are struc- tured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain.

TI  - Ongoing accumulation of plant diversity through habitat connectivity in an 18-year experiment.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Deleterious effects of habitat fragmentation and benefits of connecting fragments could be significantly underestimated because changes in colonization and extinction rates that drive changes in biodiversity can take decades to accrue. In a large and well-replicated habitat fragmentation experiment, we find that annual colonization rates for 239 plant species in connected fragments are 5% higher and annual extinction rates 2% lower than in unconnected fragments. This has resulted in a steady, nonasymptotic increase in diversity, with nearly 14% more species in connected fragments after almost two decades. Our results show that the full biodiversity value of connectivity is much greater than previously estimated, cannot be effectively evaluated at short time scales, and can be maximized by connecting habitat sooner rather than later.

TI  - RELATIONSHIPS AMONG BREEDING BIRDS, HABITAT, AND RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN GREATER TUCSON, ARIZONA
PY  - 1998
AB  - Bird abundance trends have been correlated with habitat changes in urban developed areas but have seldom been associated with specific patterns of urban-related habitat changes. We examined breeding bird-habitat relationships in 334 random plots ranging from undisturbed natural to highly developed land in Tucson, Arizona. In each plot we quantified 19 variables describing three land cover patterns (habitat physiognomy, flo- ristics, and spatial relationships of native habitat fragments) and correlated them with abundances of 21 bird species. Abundances of 17 bird species were associated with variables describing land cover pattern. In addition, we correlated abundance, species richness, and evenness for three bird guilds (non-natives, natives, and a native indicator guild) with land cover variables. Housing density best explained the variation in species richness for both the non-native (r2 = 0.79) and the indicator guilds (r2 = -0.69), whereas area of Upland Sonoran vegetative cover (r2 = 0.56) and distance from undisturbed washes (r2 = -0.56) correlated most strongly with the native-bird group. Finally, we developed and tested re- gression models predicting species richness for each bird guild. The following variables loaded into the predictive models: house density; percentage cover of paved areas; exotic, Upland Sonoran, and undisturbed riparian vegetation; and distance from undisturbed washes. The models explained 71% of the variation in non-native bird species richness, 56% of the variation in native bird species richness, and 60% of the variation in species richness for the indicator guild of birds. The correlations and regression models can be used to predict species richness responses to future residential development in the Tucson area.

TI  - Putting the "landscape" in landscape genetics.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Landscape genetics has emerged as a new research area that integrates population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics. Researchers in this field can combine the high resolution of genetic markers with spatial data and a variety of statistical methods to evaluate the role that landscape variables play in shaping genetic diversity and population structure. While interest in this research area is growing rapidly, our ability to fully utilize landscape data, test explicit hypotheses and truly integrate these diverse disciplines has lagged behind. Part of the current challenge in the development of the field of landscape genetics is bridging the communication and knowledge gap between these highly specific and technical disciplines. The goal of this review is to help bridge this gap by exposing geneticists to terminology, sampling methods and analysis techniques widely used in landscape ecology and spatial statistics but rarely addressed in the genetics literature. We offer a definition for the term ‘landscape genetics’, provide an overview of the landscape genetics literature, give guidelines for appropriate sampling design and useful analysis techniques, and discuss future directions in the field. We hope, this review will stimulate increased dialog and enhance interdisciplinary collaborations advancing this exciting new field.

TI  - EDITOR'S CHOICE: Stepping stones are crucial for species' long‐distance dispersal and range expansion through habitat networks
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. Climate and land-use changes will require species to move large distances following shifts in their suitable habitats, which will frequently involve traversing intensively human-modified landscapes. Practitioners will therefore need to evaluate and act to enhance the degree to which habitat patches scattered throughout the landscape may function as stepping stones facilitating dispersal among otherwise isolated habitat areas. 2. We formulate a new generalized network model of habitat connectivity that accounts for the number of dispersing individuals and for long-distance dispersal processes across generations. By doing so, we bridge the gap between complex dynamic population models, which are generally too data demanding and hence difficult to apply in practical wide-scale decisionmaking, and simpler static connectivity models that only consider the amount of habitat that can be reached by a single average disperser during its life span. 3. We find that the loss of intermediate and sufficiently large stepping-stone habitat patches can cause a sharp decline in the distance that can be traversed by species (critical spatial thresholds) that cannot be effectively compensated by other factors previously regarded as crucial for long-distance dispersal (fat-tailed dispersal kernels, source population size). 4. We corroborate our findings by showing that our model largely outperforms previous connectivity models in explaining the large-scale range expansion of a forest bird species, the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius, over a 20-year period. 5. The capacity of species to exploit the opportunities created by networks of stepping-stone patches largely depends on species-specific life-history traits, suggesting that species assemblages traversing fragmented landscapes may be exposed to a spatial filtering process driving long-term changes in community composition. 6. Synthesis and applications. Previous static connectivity models seriously underestimate the importance of stepping-stone patches in sustaining rare but crucial dispersal events. We provide a conceptually broader model that shows that stepping stones (i) must be of sufficient size to be of conservation value, (ii) are particularly crucial for the spread of species (either native or invasive) or genotypes over long distances and (iii) can effectively reduce the isolation of the largest habitat blocks in reserves, therefore largely contributing to species persistence across wide spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Matrix configuration and patch isolation influences override the species–area relationship for urban butterfly communities
PY  - 2011
AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the role of urban public parks in maintaining connectivity and butterfly assemblages. Using a regression framework, we first test the relative importance of park size and isolation in predicting abundance and species richness of butterfly assemblages across a set of 24 public parks within a large metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France). Then, we focus on landscape features that affect diversity patterns of the recorded butterfly communities. In this second part, the urban landscape surrounding each park is described (within a 1 × 1 km window) according to two major components: vegetated areas (habitat patches) and impervious or built areas (matrix patches). Specifically, we aim to test whether the incorporation of this built component (matrix) in the landscape analysis provides new insights into the understanding of ecological connectivity in the urban environment. We found a significant effect of both matrix configuration (shape complexity of the built patches) and distance from regional species pool (park isolation) on diversity of butterflies that overrides park size in their contribution to variation in species richness. This result suggests that many previous studies of interactions between biodiversity and urban landscape have overlooked the influence of the built elements.

TI  - Fixed- and random-effects models in meta-analysis.
PY  - 1998
AB  - There are 2 families of statistical procedures in meta-analysis: fixed- and randomeffects procedures. They were developed for somewhat different inference goals: making inferences about the effect parameters in the studies that have been observed versus making inferences about the distribution of effect parameters in a population of studies from a random sample of studies. The authors evaluate the performance of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests when each type of statistical procedure is used for each type of inference and confirm that each procedure is best for making the kind of inference for which it was designed. Conditionally random-effects procedures (a hybrid type) are shown to have properties in between those of fixed- and random-effects procedures. The use of quantitative methods to summarize the results of several empirical research studies, or metaanalysis, is now widely used in psychology, medicine, and the social sciences. Meta-analysis usually involves describing the results of each study by means of a numerical index (an estimate of effect size, such as a correlation coefficient, a standardized mean difference, or an odds ratio) and then combining these estimates across studies to obtain a summary. Two somewhat different statistical models have been developed for inference about average effect size from a collection of studies, called the fixed-effects and random-effects models. (A third alternative, the mixedeffects model, arises in conjunction with analyses involving study-level covariates or moderator variables, which we do not consider in this article; see Hedges, 1992.) Fixed-effects models treat the effect-size parameters as fixed but unknown constants to be estimated and usually (but not necessarily) are used in conjunction with assumptions about the homogeneity of effect parameters (see, e.g., Hedges, 1982; Rosenthal & Rubin, 1982). Random-effects models treat the effectsize parameters as if they were a random sample from

TI  - World Population Prospects
PY  - 2012
AB  - The 1988 UN population revision estimates that the total population of the world in mid 1988 is 5.1 billion persons and that the annual rate of increase is 1.7% for 1987-1988. It proposes a plateau in the rate of world population at around 1.7%, starting in the late 1970s and ending around the early 1990s, with annual fluctuations. In 1985, just under 1/4 of the world population resided in the more developed regions. By 2000, the proportion is expected to decrease to 1/5 and by 2025 to 1/6. The proportion was about 1/3 in 1950. The regions that are growing most rapidly at present (1985-1990), with a rate of 2.5%, include Western Africa (3.3%), Eastern Africa (3.1%), Middle Africa (2.9%), Western Asia (2.8%), Northern Africa (2.7%), and Melanesia (2.6%). The regions that are growing most slowly, with a rate 1%, are Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Europe, the Soviet Union and Northern America. Many countries in Eastern, Middle, and Western Africa continue to have among the highest fertility rates in the world, with a total rate of 6 births/woman in 1985-1990. Africa also has the highest mortality rates, with an average life expectancy at birth of 51.9 years for 1985-1990. Of the 7 countries in the world having a life expectancy below 45 years for that period, 5 are in Africa. For the world as a whole in 1985-1990, for every 1000 infants born, 71 are expected to die before reaching their 1st birthday.

TI  - Centrality in social networks conceptual clarification
PY  - 1978
AB  - Abstract The intuitive background for measures of structural centrality in social networks is reviewed and existing measures are evaluated in terms of their consistency with intuitions and their interpretability. Three distinct intuitive conceptions of centrality are uncovered and existing measures are refined to embody these conceptions. Three measures are developed for each concept, one absolute and one relative measure of the centrality of positions in a network, and one reflecting the degree of centralization of the entire network. The implications of these measures for the experimental study of small groups is examined.

TI  - Futures of global urban expansion: uncertainties and implications for biodiversity conservation
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urbanization will place significant pressures on biodiversity across the world. However, there are large uncertainties in the amount and location of future urbanization, particularly urban land expansion. Here, we present a global analysis of urban extent circa 2000 and probabilistic forecasts of urban expansion for 2030 near protected areas and in biodiversity hotspots. We estimate that the amount of urban land within 50 km of all protected area boundaries will increase from 450 000 km2 circa 2000 to 1440 000 ± 65 000 km2 in 2030. Our analysis shows that protected areas around the world will experience significant increases in urban land within 50 km of their boundaries. China will experience the largest increase in urban land near protected areas with 304 000 ± 33 000 km2 of new urban land to be developed within 50 km of protected area boundaries. The largest urban expansion in biodiversity hotspots, over 100 000 ± 25 000 km2, is forecasted to occur in South America. Uncertainties in the forecasts of the amount and location of urban land expansion reflect uncertainties in their underlying drivers including urban population and economic growth. The forecasts point to the need to reconcile urban development and biodiversity conservation strategies.

TI  - Developing a functional connectivity indicator to detect change in fragmented landscapes
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Biodiversity indicators are increasingly used to assess progress towards conservation targets. Particular indicators are required to assess the impacts of habitat fragmentation on landscape connectivity and biodiversity value. This paper recognises that connectivity is best defined by the interaction between species and the landscape in which they occur, and proposes a functional approach to assess connectivity. The approach utilises an incidence function model (IFM) as a spatially explicit method to assess potential species-level connectivity. The standard IFM connectivity measure is modified to account for the influence of the surrounding landscape matrix on edge impacts (through a weighted internal edge buffer) and ecological isolation (through an assessment of least-cost distance to account for landscape permeability). It has been recognised that such patch-based connectivity measures can provide misleading results when used to examine change, as they only focus on between patch movements. As a result, a modified hybrid IFM, based on a combination of patch and cell-based approaches, is developed to account for both within (intra) and between (inter) patch connectivity. The resulting probability of functional connectivity (PFC) indicator was evaluated, alongside a patch-based connectivity measure, through the application to four model landscapes based on changes (2 negative and 2 positive) to a control landscape. The four model landscapes illustrate the impact of landscape change on habitat area, edge impacts and matrix permeability. The proposed PFC indicator successfully discriminated between the two negative and the two positive changes to the control landscape, whereas, the patch-based connectivity measure detected change successfully within three of the four landscapes. The PFC indicator predicted a decrease in intra and inter-patch connectivity following habitat loss and fragmentation (negative change 1), whereas patch-based connectivity measures indicate an increase in connectivity between fragmented patches. The proposed PFC indicator offers the opportunity to take the necessary species-based perspective to examine functional connectivity, incorporating habitat preference, dispersal probability, edge impacts and ecological isolation/permeability. The urgency to assess changes in connectivity and support conservation policy means that there is little time to wait for more complete data. We believe the proposed approach provides a robust balance between the data required and the biologically meaningful indicator produced.

TI  - Applying circuit theory for corridor expansion and management at regional scales: tiling, pinch points, and omnidirectional connectivity.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Connectivity models are useful tools that improve the ability of researchers and managers to plan land use for conservation and preservation. Most connectivity models function in a point-to-point or patch-to-patch fashion, limiting their use for assessing connectivity over very large areas. In large or highly fragmented systems, there may be so many habitat patches of interest that assessing connectivity among all possible combinations is prohibitive. To overcome these conceptual and practical limitations, we hypothesized that minor adaptation of the Circuitscape model can allow the creation of omnidirectional connectivity maps illustrating flow paths and variations in the ease of travel across a large study area. We tested this hypothesis in a 24,300 km2 study area centered on the Monteregie region near Montreal, Quebec. We executed the circuit model in overlapping tiles covering the study region. Current was passed across the surface of each tile in orthogonal directions, and then the tiles were reassembled to create directional and omnidirectional maps of connectivity. The resulting mosaics provide a continuous view of connectivity in the entire study area at the full original resolution. We quantified differences between mosaics created using different tile and buffer sizes and developed a measure of the prominence of seams in mosaics formed with this approach. The mosaics clearly show variations in current flow driven by subtle aspects of landscape composition and configuration. Shown prominently in mosaics are pinch points, narrow corridors where organisms appear to be required to traverse when moving through the landscape. Using modest computational resources, these continuous, fine-scale maps of nearly unlimited size allow the identification of movement paths and barriers that affect connectivity. This effort develops a powerful new application of circuit models by pinpointing areas of importance for conservation, broadening the potential for addressing intriguing questions about resource use, animal distribution, and movement.

TI  - Relations between Urban Bird and Plant Communities and Human Well‐Being and Connection to Nature
PY  - 2011
AB  - By 2050, 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas. In many cases urbanization reduces the richness and abundance of native species. Living in highly modified environments with fewer opportunities to interact directly with a diversity of native species may adversely affect residents' personal well-being and emotional connection to nature. We assessed the personal well-being, neighborhood well-being (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their neighborhood), and level of connection to nature of over 1000 residents in 36 residential neighborhoods in southeastern Australia. We modeled these response variables as a function of natural features of each neighborhood (e.g., species richness and abundance of birds, density of plants, and amount of vegetation cover) and demographic characteristics of surveyed residents. Vegetation cover had the strongest positive relations with personal well-being, whereas residents' level of connection to nature was weakly related to variation in species richness and abundance of birds and density of plants. Demographic characteristics such as age and level of activity explained the greatest proportion of variance in well-being and connection to nature. Nevertheless, when controlling for variation in demographic characteristics (examples were provided above), neighborhood well-being was positively related to a range of natural features, including species richness and abundance of birds, and vegetation cover. Demographic characteristics and how well-being was quantified strongly influenced our results, and we suggest demography and metrics of well-being must be considered when attempting to determine relations between the urban environment and human well-being.

TI  - Identifying functionally connected habitat compartments with a novel regionalization technique
PY  - 2013
AB  - Landscape ecologists have increasingly turned to the use of landscape graphs in which a landscape is represented as a set of nodes (habitat patches) connected by links representing inter-patch-dispersal. This study explores the use of a graph-based regionalization method, Graph-based REgionalization with Clustering And Partitioning (GraphRECAP), to detect structural groups of habitat patches (compartments) in a landscape graph such that the connections (i.e. the movement of individual organisms) within the groups are greater than those across groups. Specifically, we mapped compartments using habitat and dispersal data for ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) in an agricultural landscape in southern Madagascar using both GraphRECAP and the widely-used Girvan and Newman method. Model performance was evaluated by comparing compartment characteristics and three measures of network connectivity and traversability: the connection strength of habitat patches in the compartments (modularity), the potential ease of individual organism movements (Harary index), and the degree of alternative route presence (Alpha index). Compartments identified by GraphRECAP had stronger within-compartment connections, greater traversability, more alternative routes, and a larger minimum number of habitat patches within compartments, all of which are more desirable traits for ecological networks. Our method could thus facilitate the study of ecosystem resilience and the design of nature reserves and landscape networks to promote the landscape-scale dispersal of species in the fragmented habitats.

TI  - A global analysis of the impacts of urbanization on bird and plant diversity reveals key anthropogenic drivers
PY  - 2014
AB  - Urbanization contributes to the loss of the world's biodiversity and the homogenization of its biota. However, comparative studies of urban biodiversity leading to robust generalities of the status and drivers of biodiversity in cities at the global scale are lacking. Here, we compiled the largest global dataset to date of two diverse taxa in cities: birds (54 cities) and plants (110 cities). We found that the majority of urban bird and plant species are native in the world's cities. Few plants and birds are cosmopolitan, the most common being Columba livia and Poa annua. The density of bird and plant species (the number of species per km2) has declined substantially: only 8% of native bird and 25% of native plant species are currently present compared with estimates of non-urban density of species. The current density of species in cities and the loss in density of species was best explained by anthropogenic features (landcover, city age) rather than by non-anthropogenic factors (geography, climate, topography). As urbanization continues to expand, efforts directed towards the conservation of intact vegetation within urban landscapes could support higher concentrations of both bird and plant species. Despite declines in the density of species, cities still retain endemic native species, thus providing opportunities for regional and global biodiversity conservation, restoration and education.

TI  - Effects of urbanization on the ecology and evolution of arthropods
PY  - 2011
AB  - The role of the ‘little things that run the world’ ( Wilson 1987 ) is challenged by the human enterprise in urban areas. High-density human habitation is associated with loss, fragmentation, isolation, and pollution of natural habitats, introduction and spread of exotic species, accumulation of waste products, and changes in climatic, edaphic, and hydrological processes ( Frankie & Ehler 1978 ; McIntyre et al . 2001 ). All of these impacts affect arthropod communities and their contributions to ecosystem function. On the other hand, this diversity of human actions also creates opportunities for arthropods to thrive in cities. Because they fi ll important functional roles in ecosystems, including decomposition, pollination, nutrient cycling, foodweb interactions, and biological control, arthropod communities refl ect urban environmental quality. Their short generation times and rapid responses to environmental change make arthropods especially well-suited for studying the biotic effects of urbanization. In addition, many arthropods have educational and aesthetic values to urban residents (Andersson et al . 2007) that increasingly balance negative perceptions of arthropods as pests in well-educated societies. Frankie and Ehler ( 1978 ) called for the establishment of ‘urban entomology’ as an independent discipline, but the fi eld has remained incompletely developed ( McIntyre 2000 ), although its importance is recognized, for example for urban pest management ( Robinson 1996 ). Nonetheless, urbanization reduces biodiversity ( Davis 1978 ; Connor et al . 2002 ) and thus has major implications for ecosystem function and the provision of ecological services, including a sense of human well-being. In hoping to stimulate research on non-pestiferous urban arthropods through this chapter, we review how urban arthropods are affected by: 1) habitat fragmentation, 2) habitat changes along the urban–rural gradient, 3) uniquely urban environments (such as domestic gardens, ruderal land, etc.), and 4) natural selection in urban environments. Based on this review, we consider major issues relevant to conservation of urban arthropods. Because of our collective experience with ground beetles, we draw extensively on that literature for examples, using studies of other arthropod species to amplify the generality of conclusions.

TI  - Focal species and landscape “naturalness” corridor models offer complementary approaches for connectivity conservation planning
PY  - 2015
AB  - The dual threats of habitat fragmentation and climate change have led to a proliferation of approaches for connectivity conservation planning. Corridor analyses have traditionally taken a focal species approach, but the landscape “naturalness” approach of modeling connectivity among areas of low human modification has gained popularity as a less analytically intensive alternative. We compared focal species and naturalness-based corridor networks to ask whether they identify similar areas, whether a naturalness-based approach is in fact more analytically efficient, and whether agreement between the two approaches varies with focal species vagility. We compared focal-species and naturalness-based connectivity models at two nested spatial extents: greater Washington State, USA, and, within it, the Columbia Plateau ecoregion. We assessed complementarity between the two approaches by examining the spatial overlap of predicted corridors, and regressing organism traits against the amount of modeled corridor overlap. A single naturalness-based corridor network represented connectivity for a large (>10) number of focal species as effectively as a group of between 3 and 4 randomly selected focal species. The naturalness-based approach showed only moderate spatial agreement with composite corridor networks for large numbers of focal species, and better agreed with corridor networks of large-bodied, far-dispersing species in the larger scale analysis. Naturalness-based corridor models may offer an efficient proxy for focal species models, but a multi-focal species approach may better represent the movement needs of diverse taxa. Consideration of trade-offs between the two approaches may enhance the effectiveness of their application to connectivity conservation planning.

AB  - The vascular plant species richness of upland urban forest patches in St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, was found to be positively related to their size. There was no significant relationship between species richness and the distance of these patches to other patches. Mowing and trampling reduced species richness of patches, whereas planting increased richness. Landscape richness can be maintained at a relatively high level by leaving even small unmown forested patches within a more disturbed matrix. However, maximizing landscape diversity would require leaving large forest stands unmown. It is suggested that cultivation be deliberately used as a mechanism for increasing native species richness in urban forests.

TI  - Model‐based estimators of density and connectivity to inform conservation of spatially structured populations
PY  - 2017
AB  - Conservation and management of spatially structured populations is challenging because solutions must consider where individuals are located, but also differential individual space use as a result of landscape heterogeneity. A recent extension of spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models, the ecological distance model, uses spatial encounter histories of individuals (e.g., a record of where individuals are detected across space, often sequenced over multiple sampling occasions), to estimate the relationship between space use and characteristics of a landscape, allowing simultaneous estimation of both local densities of individuals across space and connectivity at the scale of individual movement. We developed two model-based estimators derived from the SCR ecological distance model to quantify connectivity over a continuous surface: (1) potential connectivity—a metric of the connectivity of areas based on resistance to individual movement; and (2) density-weighted connectivity (DWC)—potential connectivity weighted by estimated density. Estimates of potential connectivity and DWC can provide spatial representations of areas that are most important for the conservation of threatened species, or management of abundant populations (i.e., areas with high density and landscape connectivity), and thus generate predictions that have great potential to inform conservation and management actions. We used a simulation study with a stationary trap design across a range of landscape resistance scenarios to evaluate how well our model estimates resistance, potential connectivity, and DWC. Correlation between true and estimated potential connectivity was high, and there was positive correlation and high spatial accuracy between estimated DWC and true DWC. We applied our approach to data collected from a population of black bears in New York, and found that forested areas represented low levels of resistance for black bears. We demonstrate that formal inference about measures of landscape connectivity can be achieved from standard methods of studying animal populations which yield individual encounter history data such as camera trapping. Resulting biological parameters including resistance, potential connectivity, and DWC estimate the spatial distribution and connectivity of the population within a statistical framework, and we outline applications to many possible conservation and management problems.

TI  - Characterizing the importance of habitat patches and corridors in maintaining the landscape connectivity of a Pholidoptera transsylvanica (Orthoptera) metapopulation
PY  - 2003
AB  - Since the fragmentation of natural habitats is one of the most serious problems for many endangered species, it is highly interesting to study the properties of fragmented landscapes. As a basic property, landscape connectivity and its effects on various ecological processes are frequently in focus. First, we discuss the relevance of some graph properties in quantifying connectivity. Then, we propose a method how to quantify the relative importance of habitat patches and corridors in maintaining landscape connectivity. Our combined index explicitly considers pure topological properties and topographical measures, like the quality of both patches (local population size) and corridors (permeability). Finally, for illustration, we analyze the landscape graph of the endangered, brachypterous bush-cricket Pholidoptera transsylvanica. The landscape contains 11 patches and 13 corridors and is situated on the Aggtelek Karst, NE-Hungary. We characterize the importance of each node and link of the graph by local and global network indices. We show how different measures of connectivity may suggest different conservation preferences. We conclude, accordingly to our present index, by identifying one specific habitat patch and one specific corridor being in the most critical positions in maintaining connectivity.

TI  - Promoting dragonfly diversity in cities: major determinants and implications for urban pond design
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urbanisation is increasing and it is essential to integrate biodiversity into the spatial planning of urban areas. This requires deeper understanding of biodiversity patterns in cities. We investigated which habitat variables are major determinants of dragonfly diversity and species assemblage structure in the municipal area of Dortmund (Germany). We sampled dragonfly larvae in 33 ponds situated in city parks, commercial, residential and agricultural areas. We recorded 30 autochthonous dragonfly species with species richness ranging from zero to 17. Additionally, we surveyed a set of environmental variables including habitat size, water level, pond structures and vegetation as well as surrounding landscape and potential disturbances like waterfowl and fish. Multivariate methods were used to identify the major determinants of dragonfly diversity, abundance and assemblage structure. Analysis indicated that diversity of aquatic and terrestrial vegetation affected dragonfly diversity positively. City park ponds had low diversity, but Ischnura elegans was obviously promoted by the specific park pond conditions, including high waterfowl density. We found five assemblages mostly determined by generalistic species which were related to different pond types. Moderately disturbed ruderal and pioneer ponds in residential and agricultural areas also contained increased numbers of rare species. Our results indicate that urban ponds may have a great value for maintaining biodiversity, but various disturbances have negative impact. To promote urban biodiversity we suggest a natural design of well-vegetated ponds as well as a high diversity of different pond types and particularly a more-natural redesign of city park ponds.

TI  - Investigating environmental variation and landscape characteristics of an urban–rural gradient using woodland carabid assemblages
PY  - 2006
AB  - Aim To investigate environmental variation and associated assemblage changes of carabid beetles along an urban–rural gradient. Location ‘Quercus–Acer’ (oak–sycamore) woodlands in the city of Birmingham, UK. Methods We collected carabid data using pitfall traps on 12 sites in the city. The traps were run from April–September in 2000, and we collected environmental data on 24 individual variables associated with the individual sites and their landscape context. Changes in carabid assemblages were analysed using repeat measures anova and the environment–species relationships with a Redundancy Analyses (RDA) and Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM). Results We found that: (1) species richness and diversity were lower in the urban and suburban zone and higher in the rural zone; (2) Berger Parker dominance index was higher in the urban and suburban zones; (3) the number of woodland and woodland associated species was significantly higher at the rural end of the gradient; (4) the number of short-winged (brachypterous) species was highest in the rural zone and decreased towards the urban woodlands, whereas the long-winged species were more abundant in suburban woodlands; (5) the median weight length (WML) of the assemblage declined along the gradient from the rural to the urban zone, as did the number of large species; and (6) five of the 24 environmental variables showed a significant relationship with variation in the carabid assemblage. At site level the carabid assemblages were related to the level of site disturbance and soil penetrability, whereas site size and amount of woodland and urban land within 5 km of the site were important at a larger landscape scale. Main conclusions The results suggest that urbanization has a deleterious impact on carabid assemblages, causing a reduction in species richness from the rural fringe to the centre of the city. Changes in assemblage structure were related to woodland fragmentation, which led to variations in woodland size, woodland location and site disturbance due to trampling. Large, flightless and specialist woodland species are more susceptible to changes associated with urbanization, presumably due to their longer life spans, lower reproductive rates, more specialized niches and more limited dispersal potential.

TI  - Exotic invasive species in urban wetlands: environmental correlates and implications for wetland management
PY  - 2008
AB  - Summary 1. Wetlands in urban regions are subjected to a wide variety of anthropogenic disturbances, many of which may promote invasions of exotic plant species. In order to devise management strategies, the influence of different aspects of the urban and natural environments on invasion and community structure must be understood. 2. The roles of soil variables, anthropogenic effects adjacent to and within the wetlands, and vegetation structure on exotic species occurrence within 21 forested wetlands in north-eastern New Jersey, USA, were compared. The hypotheses were tested that different vegetation strata and different invasive species respond similarly to environmental factors, and that invasion increases with increasing direct human impact, hydrologic disturbance, adjacent residential land use and decreasing wetland area. Canonical correspondence analyses, correlation and logistic regression analyses were used to examine invasion by individual species and overall site invasion, as measured by the absolute and relative number of exotic species in the site flora. 3. Within each stratum, different sets of environmental factors separated exotic and native species. Nutrients, soil clay content and pH, adjacent land use and canopy composition were the most frequently identified factors affecting species, but individual species showed highly individualistic responses to the sets of environmental variables, often responding in opposite ways to the same factor. 4. Overall invasion increased with decreasing area but only when sites > 100 ha were included. Unexpectedly, invasion decreased with increasing proportions of industrial/commercial adjacent land use. 5. The hypotheses were only partially supported; invasion does not increase in a simple way with increasing human presence and disturbance. 6. Synthesis and applications . The results suggest that a suite of environmental conditions can be identified that are associated with invasion into urban wetlands, which can be widely used for assessment and management. However, a comprehensive ecosystem approach is needed that places the remediation of physical alterations from urbanization within a landscape context. Specifically, sediment, inputs and hydrologic changes need to be related to adjoining urban land use and to the overlapping requirements of individual native and exotic species.

TI  - Psychological benefits of greenspace increase with biodiversity
PY  - 2007
AB  - The world's human population is becoming concentrated into cities, giving rise to concerns that it is becoming increasingly isolated from nature. Urban public greenspaces form the arena of many people's daily contact with nature and such contact has measurable physical and psychological benefits. Here we show that these psychological benefits increase with the species richness of urban greenspaces. Moreover, we demonstrate that greenspace users can more or less accurately perceive species richness depending on the taxonomic group in question. These results indicate that successful management of urban greenspaces should emphasize biological complexity to enhance human well-being in addition to biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Regulation of the immune system by biodiversity from the natural environment: An ecosystem service essential to health
PY  - 2013
AB  - Epidemiological studies suggest that living close to the natural environment is associated with long-term health benefits including reduced death rates, reduced cardiovascular disease, and reduced psychiatric problems. This is often attributed to psychological mechanisms, boosted by exercise, social interactions, and sunlight. Compared with urban environments, exposure to green spaces does indeed trigger rapid psychological, physiological, and endocrinological effects. However, there is little evidence that these rapid transient effects cause long-term health benefits or even that they are a specific property of natural environments. Meanwhile, the illnesses that are increasing in high-income countries are associated with failing immunoregulation and poorly regulated inflammatory responses, manifested as chronically raised C-reactive protein and proinflammatory cytokines. This failure of immunoregulation is partly attributable to a lack of exposure to organisms (“Old Friends”) from mankind’s evolutionary past that needed to be tolerated and therefore evolved roles in driving immunoregulatory mechanisms. Some Old Friends (such as helminths and infections picked up at birth that established carrier states) are almost eliminated from the urban environment. This increases our dependence on Old Friends derived from our mothers, other people, animals, and the environment. It is suggested that the requirement for microbial input from the environment to drive immunoregulation is a major component of the beneficial effect of green space, and a neglected ecosystem service that is essential for our well-being. This insight will allow green spaces to be designed to optimize health benefits and will provide impetus from health systems for the preservation of ecosystem biodiversity.

TI  - Forest Fragment and Breeding Habitat Characteristics Explain Frog Diversity and Abundance in Singapore
PY  - 2009
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can have severe negative and irreversible effects on biodiversity. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on frog diversity in Singapore because of its high rates of deforestation and the demonstration that frogs are some of the most sensitive species to habitat degradation. We surveyed frog species in 12 forest fragments varying from 11 to 935 ha. We compared differences in species richness, abundance, and Shannon’s index in relation to forest fragment size, connectivity (distance between fragments), and breeding habitat heterogeneity. A total of 20 species from 12 genera and five families were encountered in 12 fragments. Larger fragments and those closer to larger fragments had higher species richness. Abundance, however, was not correlated with forest area or connectivity, but we found fewer individual frogs in the larger fragments. We also found that breeding habitat heterogeneity best explained frog species diversity and abundance in forest fragments. Fragments with a high diversity of breeding habitats had more species. We found no evidence to suggest that abundance and diversity are strongly correlated, particularly in disturbed areas, but that breeding habitat heterogeneity is an under-appreciated factor that should be considered when prioritizing areas for anuran conservation. Enriching breeding habitat heterogeneity, creating corridors between fragments, and reforesting degraded areas are some of the most beneficial strategies for preserving urban frog biodiversity.

TI  - Roles of scale, matrix, and native habitat in supporting a diverse suburban pollinator assemblage
PY  - 2012
AB  - Wild pollinators provide important services to both wild and human-dominated ecosystems, yet this group may be threatened by widespread anthropogenic landscape change. Suburban sprawl is one of the fastest growing types of land use change in North America, and it has certain characteristics, such as abundant floral resources, that may be beneficial for many pollinators. We examined the effects of sprawl on the wild bee assemblage of the shortgrass steppe on the Front Range of Colorado, USA. Diversity, abundance, and community composition of bees in remnant grassland fragments surrounded by suburban residential land use were compared with those in extensive, continuous grassland. No overall effect of suburbanization on bee abundance was observed, and abundance was extremely variable even within study sites. Bee species richness was positively but nonlinearly related to grassland habitat area. Bee species density was higher and more variable in suburban sites. Suburban sites and smaller habitat area were bo...

TI  - A Practical Model of Metapopulation Dynamics
PY  - 1994
AB  - This paper describes a novel approach to modelling of metapopulation dynamics. The model is constructed as a generalized incidence function, which describes how the fraction of occupied habitat patches depends on patch areas and isolations. The model may be fitted to presence/absence data from a metapopulation at a dynamic equilibrium between extinctions and colonizations. Using the estimated parameter values, transient dynamics and the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches in any system of habitat patches can be predicted. The significance of particular habitat patches for the long-term persistence of the metapopulation, for example, can also be evaluated

TI  - The devil is in the dispersers: predictions of landscape connectivity change with demography
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary 1. Concern about the effects of habitat fragmentation has led to increasing interest in dispersal and connectivity modelling. Most modern techniques for connectivity modelling have resistance surfaces as their foundation. However, resistance surfaces for animal movement are frequently estimated without considering dispersal, despite being the principal natural mechanism by which organisms move between populations. 2. We collected Global Positioning System data over 10 years from 50 African lions Panthera leo (11 male natal dispersers, 20 adult males and 19 adult females) and used a path level analysis to parameterize demographic-specific resistance surfaces for the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA) in Southern Africa. 3. Lion path selection varied according to demographic grouping: adult females were most averse to risky landscapes such as agro-pastoral lands, towns, areas of high human density and highways. Male natal dispersers were the least-risk averse suggesting they are potentially the most prone demographic to human–lion conflict. Adults of both sexes selected bushed grassland and shrubland habitats and avoided woodland. Male natal dispersers displayed the opposite trend suggesting con-specific avoidance and/or suboptimal habitat use. 4. We used the resistance surfaces to calculate factorial least-cost path networks for each demographic-specific resistance surface and present results that show substantial differences between predicted patterns of connectivity for male natal dispersers, adult females and adult males. 5. Synthesis and applications. Resistance surfaces are widely used to create connectivity models, which are promoted for use by conservation managers. Our results suggest that the demographic category used to parameterize resistance surfaces may lead to radically different conclusions about connectivity. Failure to include dispersing individuals when parameterizing resistance surfaces intended for connectivity modelling may lead to erroneous conclusions about connectivity and potentially unsound management strategies.

TI  - Response variables for evaluation of the effectiveness of conservation corridors.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Many studies have evaluated effectiveness of corridors by measuring species presence in and movement through small structural corridors. However, few studies have assessed whether these response variables are adequate for assessing whether the conservation goals of the corridors have been achieved or considered the costs or lag times involved in measuring the response variables. We examined 4 response variables-presence of the focal species in the corridor, interpatch movement via the corridor, gene flow, and patch occupancy--with respect to 3 criteria--relevance to conservation goals, lag time (fewest generations at which a positive response to the corridor might be evident with a particular variable), and the cost of a study when applying a particular variable. The presence variable had the least relevance to conservation goals, no lag time advantage compared with interpatch movement, and only a moderate cost advantage over interpatch movement or gene flow. Movement of individual animals between patches was the most appropriate response variable for a corridor intended to provide seasonal migration, but it was not an appropriate response variable for corridor dwellers, and for passage species it was only moderately relevant to the goals of gene flow, demographic rescue, and recolonization. Response variables related to gene flow provided a good trade-off among cost, relevance to conservation goals, and lag time. Nonetheless, the lag time of 10-20 generations means that evaluation of conservation corridors cannot occur until a few decades after a corridor has been established. Response variables related to occupancy were most relevant to conservation goals, but the lag time and costs to detect corridor effects on occupancy were much greater than the lag time and costs to detect corridor effects on gene flow.

TI  - A Meta-Analysis of Global Urban Land Expansion
PY  - 2011
AB  - The conversion of Earth's land surface to urban uses is one of the most irreversible human impacts on the global biosphere. It drives the loss of farmland, affects local climate, fragments habitats, and threatens biodiversity. Here we present a meta-analysis of 326 studies that have used remotely sensed images to map urban land conversion. We report a worldwide observed increase in urban land area of 58,000 km2 from 1970 to 2000. India, China, and Africa have experienced the highest rates of urban land expansion, and the largest change in total urban extent has occurred in North America. Across all regions and for all three decades, urban land expansion rates are higher than or equal to urban population growth rates, suggesting that urban growth is becoming more expansive than compact. Annual growth in GDP per capita drives approximately half of the observed urban land expansion in China but only moderately affects urban expansion in India and Africa, where urban land expansion is driven more by urban population growth. In high income countries, rates of urban land expansion are slower and increasingly related to GDP growth. However, in North America, population growth contributes more to urban expansion than it does in Europe. Much of the observed variation in urban expansion was not captured by either population, GDP, or other variables in the model. This suggests that contemporary urban expansion is related to a variety of factors difficult to observe comprehensively at the global level, including international capital flows, the informal economy, land use policy, and generalized transport costs. Using the results from the global model, we develop forecasts for new urban land cover using SRES Scenarios. Our results show that by 2030, global urban land cover will increase between 430,000 km2 and 12,568,000 km2, with an estimate of 1,527,000 km2 more likely.

TI  - Effectiveness of a regional corridor in connecting two Florida black bear populations
PY  - 2006
AB  - Corridors may mitigate the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation by restoring or maintaining connectivity between disjunct populations. The efficacy of corridors for large carnivores, however, has rarely been evaluated objectively. We used noninvasive sampling, microsatellite analysis, and population assignment tests to evaluate the effectiveness of a regional corridor in connecting two Florida black bear ( Ursus americanus floridanus) populations (Osceola and Ocala). Bear movement was predominantly unidirectional, with a limited mixing of individuals from the two populations in one area of the corridor. We also documented bears in Osceola that were genetically assigned to Ocala and bears in Osceola that may be offspring from an Osceola- Ocala mating. Our results indicate that the Osceola-Ocala corridor is functional and provides a conduit for gene flow between these populations. Human development, however, may hinder the use of the Osceola-Ocala corridor by bears. The noninvasive sampling and genetic methods we used provide a means of evaluating corridor effectiveness that can help identify linkages necessary for maintaining metapopulation structure and population viability.

TI  - Informing Strategic Efforts to Expand and Connect Protected Areas Using a Model of Ecological Flow, with Application to the Western United States
PY  - 2016
AB  - Under rapid landscape change, there is a significant need to expand and connect protected areas (PAs) to prevent further loss of biodiversity and preserve ecological functions across broad geographies. We used a model of landscape resistance and electronic circuit theory to estimate patterns of ecological flow among existing PAs in the western United States. We applied these results to areas previously identified as having high conservation value to distinguish those best positioned to maintain and enhance ecological connectivity and integrity. We found that current flow centrality was highest and effective resistance lowest in areas that spanned the border between southern Oregon and Idaho, and in northern Arizona and central Utah. Compared to other federal jurisdictions, Bureau of Land Management lands contributed most to ecological connectivity, forming “connective tissue” among existing PAs. Our models and maps can inform new conservation strategies and critical land allocation decisions, within or among jurisdictions.

TI  - Protected areas in the world's ecoregions: how well connected are they?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are the main instrument for biodiversity conservation, which has triggered the development of numerous indicators and assessments on their coverage, performance and efficiency. The connectivity of the PA networks at a global scale has however been much less explored; previous studies have either focused on particular regions of the world or have only considered some types of PAs. Here we present, and globally assess, ProtConn, an indicator of PA connectivity that (i) quantifies the percentage of a study region covered by protected connected lands, (ii) can be partitioned in several components depicting different categories of land (unprotected, protected or transboundary) through which movement between protected locations may occur, (iii) is easy to communicate, to compare with PA coverage and to use in the assessment of global targets for PA systems. We apply ProtConn to evaluate the connectivity of the PA networks in all terrestrial ecoregions of the world as of June 2016, considering a range of median dispersal distances (1–100 km) encompassing the dispersal abilities of the large majority of terrestrial vertebrates. We found that 9.3% of the world is covered by protected connected lands (average for all the world’s ecoregions) for a reference dispersal distance of 10 km, increasing up to 11.7% for the largest dispersal distance considered of 100 km. These percentages are considerably smaller than the global PA coverage of 14.7%, indicating that the spatial arrangement of PAs is only partially successful in ensuring connectivity of protected lands. The connectivity of PAs largely differed across ecoregions. Only about a third of the world’s ecoregions currently meet the Aichi Target of having 17% of the terrestrial realm covered by well-connected systems of PAs. Finally, our findings suggest that PAs with less strict management objectives (allowing the sustainable use of resources) may play a fundamental role in upholding the connectivity of the PA systems. Our analyses and indicator make it possible to identify where on the globe additional efforts are most needed in expanding or reinforcing the connectivity of PA systems, and can be also used to assess whether newly designated sites provide effective connectivity gains in the PA system by acting as corridors or stepping stones between other PAs. The results of the ProtConn indicator are available, together with a suite of other global PA indicators, in the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.

TI  - Habitat fragmentation and vertebrate species richness in an urban environment
PY  - 1987
AB  - (1) Species of terrestrial mammals, reptiles and amphibians were surveyed in patches of semi-natural and disturbed vegetation within the City of Oxford. The patches were delimited by roads, walls or other artificial barriers, and ranged from 0 16 ha to 20 ha. (2) A total of twenty species of mammals was recorded, two to seventeen species occurring per patch. Mammalian species richness (the number of species) within patches decreased with increasing percentage of barren ground per patch, with proximity to buildings, and with patchiness in the total vegetation cover, but increased with increasing density of vegetation in the layer 21-50 cm above ground. (3) Five species of amphibians and four species of reptiles were recorded, zero to seven species occurring per patch. The richness of these taxa within patches increased with patch area, but declined away from sources of permanent water. (4) More species of mammals, amphibians and reptiles were retained in two small habitat patches than in one large patch equal to their combined area. (5) For mammals, excluding large species such as deer, species richness in the urban environment can be preserved by maintaining a system of small (>0 65 ha) patches of undisturbed woodland throughout the city area. The richness of reptiles and amphibians can probably be preserved by maintaining patches of )0 55 ha that provide permanent water.

TI  - Urbanization promotes non-native woody species and diverse plant assemblages in the New York metropolitan region
PY  - 2014
AB  - The rapid urbanization of the world has significant ecological consequences that shape global biodiversity patterns. The plant communities now common in urban centers may represent new habitats with unique dynamics and the potential for highly modified ecological services. This study, joining extensive spatial and floristic data sets, examined current distribution patterns of non-native and native woody plant species in the New York metropolitan region, USA. We joined the New York Metropolitan Flora (NYMF) database of woody species with GIS data of urban land cover for 297 5 km by 5 km landscape blocks. We tested the relationship between urbanization and native and non-native species richness patterns, the extent of non-native species presence in the urban area, and the change in beta diversity across a gradient of urban land cover. We found that across the urban–rural gradient, native plant species richness decreased and non-native species richness increased with increasing urban land cover. Total richness does not change across the urban–rural gradient. Our analyses show that these patterns are highly correlated with urbanization, but vary across the New Jersey landscape. We also found an increase in beta diversity with urbanization; urban areas are not homogenized in plant species composition compared to rural areas. Here we show a species-rich flora dominated by non-native species which are differentiating the urban flora. These results can help guide appropriate conservation decisions for the maintenance of plant biodiversity in cities.

TI  - Potential Negative Ecological Effects of Corridors
PY  - 2014
AB  - Despite many studies showing that landscape corridors increase dispersal and species richness for disparate taxa, concerns persist that corridors can have unintended negative effects. In particular, some of the same mechanisms that underlie positive effects of corridors on species of conservation interest may also increase the spread and impact of antagonistic species (e.g., predators and pathogens), foster negative effects of edges, increase invasion by exotic species, increase the spread of unwanted disturbances such as fire, or increase population synchrony and thus reduce persistence. We conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of each of these negative effects. We found no evidence that corridors increase unwanted disturbance or non-native species invasion; however, these have not been well-studied concerns (1 and 6 studies, respectively). Other effects of corridors were more often studied and yielded inconsistent results; mean effect sizes were indistinguishable from zero. The effect of edges on abundances of target species was as likely to be positive as negative. Corridors were as likely to have no effect on antagonists or population synchrony as they were to increase those negative effects. We found 3 deficiencies in the literature. First, despite studies on how corridors affect predators, there are few studies of related consequences for prey population size and persistence. Second, properly designed studies of negative corridor effects are needed in natural corridors at scales larger than those achievable in experimental systems. Third, studies are needed to test more targeted hypotheses about when corridor-mediated effects on invasive species or disturbance may be negative for species of management concern. Overall, we found no overarching support for concerns that construction and maintenance of habitat corridors may result in unintended negative consequences. Negative edge effects may be mitigated by widening corridors or softening edges between corridors and the matrix. Other negative effects are relatively small and manageable compared with the large positive effects of facilitating dispersal and increasing diversity of native species.

TI  - Empirical assessment of effect of publication bias on meta-analyses.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess the effect of publication bias on the results and conclusions of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Design: Analysis of published meta-analyses by trim and fill method. Studies: 48 reviews in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews that considered a binary endpoint and contained 10 or more individual studies. Main outcome measures: Number of reviews with missing studies and effect on conclusions of meta-analyses. Results: The trim and fill fixed effects analysis method estimated that 26 (54%) of reviews had missing studies and in 10 the number missing was significant. The corresponding figures with a random effects model were 23 (48%) and eight. In four cases, statistical inferences regarding the effect of the intervention were changed after the overall estimate for publication bias was adjusted for. Conclusions: Publication or related biases were common within the sample of meta-analyses assessed. In most cases these biases did not affect the conclusions. Nevertheless, researchers should check routinely whether conclusions of systematic reviews are robust to possible non-random selection mechanisms.

TI  - AN EQUILIBRIUM THEORY OF INSULAR ZOOGEOGRAPHY
PY  - 1963
AB  - As the area of sampling A increases in an ecologically uniform area, the number of plant and animal species s increases in an approximately logarithmic manner, or s = bAk, (1) where k < 1, as shown most recently in in the detailed analysis of Preston (1962). The same relationship holds for islands, where, as one of us has noted (Wilson, 1961), the parameters b and k vary among taxa. Thus, in the ponerine ants of Melanesia and the Moluccas, k (which might be called the faunal coefficient) is approximately 0.5 where area is measured in square miles; in the Carabidae and herpetofauna of the Greater Antilles and associated islands, 0.3; in the land and freshwater birds of Indonesia, 0.4; and in the islands of the Sahul Shelf (New Guinea and environs), 0.5.

TI  - The influence of urban park characteristics on ant (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) communities
PY  - 2008
AB  - As rapid urbanization continues, existing natural areas within urban zones will play a critical role in safeguarding remaining biodiversity. Ants are an integral part of almost every terrestrial ecosystem, including urban environments, and understanding which environmental characteristics influence their persistence is critical. In this study, 24 protected natural areas within urban parks including mosaic, scrub, herbaceous and forest habitats were surveyed for ants with 563 pitfall traps. The data provide insights into the distribution and abundance of ant fauna in San Francisco natural areas, as well as which characteristics of parks have the most influence on ant community composition. A total of 2,068 ant individuals representing 15 species were collected. A regression analysis revealed that urban forests reduced ant richness and abundance and that there was little or no impact of the Argentine ant on native ants. Natural area size and shape were not important in explaining variations in overall ant species richness and abundance, with many smaller natural areas harboring ant populations that are just as diverse and robust as larger areas.

TI  - What controls who is where in freshwater fish communities the roles of biotic, abiotic, and spatial factors
PY  - 2001
AB  - We examine evidence for the structuring of fish communities from stream and lake systems and the roles of biotic, abiotic, and spatial factors in determining the species composition. Piscivory by fish is a dominant factor in both stream and lake systems whereas evidence for the importance of competition appears less convincing. Within small streams or lakes, the impact of predation may exclude other species, thereby leading to mutually exclusive distributions and strong differences in community composition. Within a geographic region, abiotic effects frequently dictate the relative importance of piscivory, thereby indirectly influencing the composition of prey species present. The spatial scale of studies influences our perceived importance of biotic versus abiotic factors, with small-scale studies indicating a greater importance of competition and large-scale studies emphasizing abiotic controls. The scale of the individual sites considered is critical because smaller systems have higher variability and ...

TI  - Biodiversity, cultural pathways, and human health: a framework
PY  - 2014
AB  - Direct contact with biodiversity is culturally important in a range of contexts. Many people even join conservation organisations to protect biodiversity that they will never encounter first-hand. Despite this, we have little idea how biodiversity affects people's well-being and health through these cultural pathways. Human health is sensitive to apparently trivial psychological stimuli, negatively affected by the risk of environmental degradation, and positively affected by contact with natural spaces. This suggests that well-being and health should be affected by biodiversity change, but few studies have begun to explore these relationships. Here, we develop a framework for linking biodiversity change with human cultural values, well-being, and health. We argue that better understanding these relations might be profoundly important for biodiversity conservation and public health.

TI  - Landscape division, splitting index, and effective mesh size: new measures of landscape fragmentation
PY  - 2000
AB  - Anthropogenic fragmentation of landscapes is known as a major reason for the loss of species in industrialized countries. Landscape fragmentation caused by roads, railway lines, extension of settlement areas, etc., further enhances the dispersion of pollutants and acoustic emissions and affects local climatic conditions, water balance, scenery, and land use. In this study, three new measures of fragmentation are introduced: degree of landscape division (D), splitting index (S), and effective mesh size (m). They characterize the anthropogenic penetration of landscapes from a geometric point of view and are calculated from the distribution function of the remaining patch sizes. First, D, S, and m are defined, their mathematical properties are discussed, and their reactions to the six fragmentation phases of perforation, incision, dissection, dissipation, shrinkage, and attrition are analysed. Then they are compared with five other known fragmentation indices with respect to nine suitability criteria such as intuitive interpretation, low sensivity to very small patches, monotonous reaction to different fragmentation phases, and detection of structural differences. Their ability to distinguish spatial patterns is illustrated by means of two series of model patterns. In particular, the effective mesh size (m), representing an intensive and area-proportionately additive measure, proves to be well suited for comparing the fragmentation of regions with differing total size.

TI  - Levels of organization in biology: on the nature and nomenclature of ecology's fourth level.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Viewing the universe as being composed of hierarchically arranged systems is widely accepted as a useful model of reality. In ecology, three levels of organization are generally recognized: organisms, populations, and communities (biocoenoses). For half a century increasing numbers of ecologists have concluded that recognition of a fourth level would facilitate increased understanding of ecological phenomena. Sometimes the word "ecosystem" is used for this level, but this is arguably inappropriate. Since 1986, I and others have argued that the term "landscape" would be a suitable term for a level of organization defined as an ecological system containing more than one community type. However, "landscape" and "landscape level" continue to be used extensively by ecologists in the popular sense of a large expanse of space. I therefore now propose that the term "ecoscape" be used instead for this fourth level of organization. A clearly defined fourth level for ecology would focus attention on the emergent properties of this level, and maintain the spatial and temporal scale-free nature inherent in this hierarchy of organizational levels for living entities.

TI  - Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on Biodiversity
PY  - 2003
AB  - ■ Abstract The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term “fragmentation” should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.

TI  - Domesticated Nature: Shaping Landscapes and Ecosystems for Human Welfare
PY  - 2007
AB  - Like all species, humans have exercised their impulse to perpetuate and propagate themselves. In doing so, we have domesticated landscapes and ecosystems in ways that enhance our food supplies, reduce exposure to predators and natural dangers, and promote commerce. On average, the net benefits to humankind of domesticated nature have been positive. We have, of course, made mistakes, causing unforeseen changes in ecosystem attributes, while leaving few, if any, truly wild places on Earth. Going into the future, scientists can help humanity to domesticate nature more wisely by quantifying the tradeoffs among ecosystem services, such as how increasing the provision of one service may decrease ecosystem resilience and the provision of other services.

TI  - Importance of Reserve Size and Landscape Context to Urban Bird Conservation
PY  - 2004
AB  - We tested whether reserve size, landscape surrounding the reserve, and their interaction affect forest songbirds in the metropolitan area of Seattle, Washington (U.S.A.), by studying 29 reserves of varying size (small, medium, large) and surrounding urbanization intensity (urban, suburban, exurban). Larger reserves contained richer and less even bird communities than smaller reserves. These size effects disappeared when we removed the positive correlation of shrub diversity with reserve size, suggesting that greater habitat diversity in large reserves supported additional species, some of which were rare. Standardizing the number of individuals detected among all reserve size classes reversed the effect of size on richness in exurban landscapes and reduced the magnitude of the effect in suburban or urban landscapes. The latter change suggested that richness increased with reserve size in most landscapes because larger areas also supported larger samples from the regional bird species pool. Most bird species associated with native forest habitat (native forest species) and with human activity (synanthropic species) were present in reserves larger than 42 ha and surrounded by >40% urban land cover, respectively. Thus, we recommend these thresholds as means for conserving the composition of native bird communities in this mostly forested region. Native forest species were least abundant and synanthropic species most abundant in urban landscapes, where exotic ground and shrub vegetation was most common. Therefore, control of exotic vegetation may benefit native songbird populations. Bird nests in shrubs were most dense in medium (suburban) and large reserves (urban) and tended to be most successful in medium (suburban) and large reserves (exurban), potentially supplying another mechanism by which reserve size increased retention of native forest species.

TI  - Comments on Some Designs Proposed for Experiments on the Biological Importance of Corridors
PY  - 1992
AB  - Natural remnant corridors of habitat are often considered to be a useful (if not essential) component of management of landscapes because they provide connections among patches of habitat. Therefore, the argument goes, migration between and recolonization of patches will be enhanced, assisting the maintenance of populations and biotic diversity in a region (Noss 1987; Simberloff & Cox 1987). Until recently, however, debate over the usefulness of corridors for the conservation of species in fragmented habitats has been largely theoretical. There have been relatively few empirical tests of the value of corridors to threatened species that have not confounded connectivity of the fragments with other variables (Simberloff & Cox 1987). Nevertheless, there is considerable interest in the use of corridors for management. This is evidenced by a recent conference and volume dedicated entirely to this subject (Saunders & Hobbs 1991). In that volume, Nicholls and Margules (1991) stressed the need for controlled field experi-

TI  - An evaluation of patch connectivity measures
PY  - 2009
AB  - Measuring connectivity is critical to the study of fragmented populations. The three most commonly used types of patch connectivity measures differ substantially in how they are calculated, but the performance of these measures has not been broadly assessed. Here I compare the ability of nearest neighbor (NN), buffer, and incidence function model (IFM) measures to predict the patch occupancy and colonization patterns of 24 invertebrate, reptile, and amphibian metapopulations. I predicted that NN measures, which have been criticized as being overly simplistic, would be the worst predictors of species occupancy and colonization. I also predicted that buffer measures, which sum the amount of habitat in a radius surrounding the focal patch, would have intermediate performance, and IFM measures, which take into account the areas and distances to all potential source patches, would perform best. As expected, the simplest NN measure (distance to the nearest habitat patch, NHi) was the poorest predictor of patch occupancy and colonization. Contrary to expectations, however, the next-simplest NN measure (distance to the nearest occupied [source] patch, NSi) was as good a predictor of occupancy and colonization as the best-performing buffer measure and the general IFM measure Si. In contrast to previous studies suggesting that area-based connectivity measures perform better than distance-based ones, my results indicate that the exclusion of vacant habitat patches from calculations is the key to improved measure performance. I highlight several problems with the parameterization and use of IFM measures and suggest that models based on NSi are equally powerful and more practical for many conservation applications.

The composition of habitat types in a landscape and the physiognomic or spatial arrangement of those habitats are the two essential features that are required to describe any landscape. As such, these two features affect four basic ecological processes that can influence population dynamics or community structure. The first two of these processes, landscape complementation and landscape supplementation, occur when individuals move between patches in the landscape to make use of nonsubstitutable and substitutable resources, respectively

TI  - Prediction of species richness of breeding birds by landscape-level factors of urban woods in Osaka Prefecture, Japan
PY  - 1999
AB  - We examined some models to predict the species richness of forest birds by the landscape-level factors at urban woods in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The environmental factors examined were area (A) and elongation (E) of woodlands, the distance to mountain (D), distance to the nearest woods (> 10ha) (D 10), and the proportion of woods (Pw) and field (Pf) within 25 km2 outside the parks. The species–area relationship at 28 parks was better fitted by the power function (r2=0.704) and by the logistic function (r2=0.696) than by the exponential function (r2=0.637). A woods that was planted 7 years ago had extremely few species, but there was no significant difference in species richness between woods < 50 years old and those older. We built Principal Component Regression (PCR) models to predict the species richness, because collinearity was detected between D and Pw. PCR, log[S/(43−S)] = −1.820 + 0.224logA − 0.0113 D + 0.133 logPw − 0.0588E (R2 = 0.939, n = 27) was estimated. The species–area relationship was caused by difference in the occurrence pattern of bird species. This was attributable to the differences in feeding habit or micro-habitat use. We estimated that birds living between the forest interior and the edge, such as Dendrocopos kizuki, required at least 20 ha of woodland.

TI  - The scaling of green space coverage in European cities
PY  - 2009
AB  - Most people on the planet live in dense aggregations, and policy directives emphasize green areas within cities to ameliorate some of the problems of urban living. Benefits of urban green spaces range from physical and psychological health to social cohesion, ecosystem service provision and biodiversity conservation. Green space coverage differs enormously among cities, yet little is known about the correlates or geography of this variation. This is important because urbanization is accelerating and the consequences for green space are unclear. Here, we use standardized major axis regression to explore the relationships between urban green space coverage, city area and population size across 386 European cities. We show that green space coverage increases more rapidly than city area, yet declines only weakly as human population density increases. Thus, green space provision within a city is primarily related to city area rather than the number of inhabitants that it serves, or a simple space-filling effect. Thus, compact cities (small size and high density) show very low per capita green space allocation. However, at high levels of urbanicity, the green space network is robust to further city compaction. As cities grow, interactions between people and nature depend increasingly on landscape quality outside formal green space networks, such as street plantings, or the size, composition and management of backyards and gardens.

TI  - Using step and path selection functions for estimating resistance to movement: pumas as a case study
PY  - 2015
AB  - GPS telemetry collars and their ability to acquire accurate and consistently frequent locations have increased the use of step selection functions (SSFs) and path selection functions (PathSFs) for studying animal movement and estimating resistance. However, previously published SSFs and PathSFs often do not accommodate multiple scales or multi-scale modeling. We present a method that allows multiple scales to be analyzed with SSF and PathSF models. We also explore the sensitivity of model results and resistance surfaces to whether SSFs or PathSFs are used, scale, prediction framework, and GPS collar sampling interval. We use 5-min GPS collar data from pumas (Puma concolor) in southern California to model SSFs and PathSFs at multiple scales, to predict resistance using two prediction frameworks (paired and unpaired), and to explore potential bias from GPS collar sampling intervals. Regression coefficients were extremely sensitive to scale and pumas exhibited multiple scales of selection during movement. We found PathSFs produced stronger regression coefficients, larger resistance values, and superior model performance than SSFs. We observed more heterogeneous surfaces when resistance was predicted in a paired framework compared with an unpaired framework. Lastly, we observed bias in habitat use and resistance results when using a GPS collar sampling interval longer than 5 min. The methods presented provide a novel way to model multi-scale habitat selection and resistance from movement data. Due to the sensitivity of resistance surfaces to method, scale, and GPS schedule, care should be used when modeling corridors for conservation purposes using these methods.

TI  - Effects of habitat fragmentation on birds and mammals in landscapes with different proportions of suitable habitat: a review
PY  - 1994
AB  - Habitat fragmentation implies a loss of habitat, reduced patch size and an increasing distance between patches, but also an increase of new habitat. Simulations of patterns and geometry of landscapes with decreasing proportion of the suitable habitat give rise to the prediction that the effect of habitat fragmentation on e.g. population size of a species would be primarily through habitat loss in landscape with a high proportion of suitable habitat. However, ast the proportion of suitable habitat

TI  - Changing Bee and Hoverfly Pollinator Assemblages along an Urban-Rural Gradient
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background The potential for reduced pollination ecosystem service due to global declines of bees and other pollinators is cause for considerable concern. Habitat degradation, destruction and fragmentation due to agricultural intensification have historically been the main causes of this pollinator decline. However, despite increasing and accelerating levels of global urbanization, very little research has investigated the effects of urbanization on pollinator assemblages. We assessed changes in the diversity, abundance and species composition of bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban, suburban, and rural sites across a UK city. Methodology/Principal Findings Bees and hoverflies were trapped and netted at 24 sites of similar habitat character (churchyards and cemeteries) that varied in position along a gradient of urbanization. Local habitat quality (altitude, shelter from wind, diversity and abundance of flowers), and the broader-scale degree of urbanization (e.g. percentage of built landscape and gardens within 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, and 2.5 km of the site) were assessed for each study site. The diversity and abundance of pollinators were both significantly negatively associated with higher levels of urbanization. Assemblage composition changed along the urbanization gradient with some species positively associated with urban and suburban land-use, but more species negatively so. Pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good site habitat quality, in particular the availability of flowering plants. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that urban areas can support diverse pollinator assemblages, but that this capacity is strongly affected by local habitat quality. Nonetheless, in both urban and suburban areas of the city the assemblages had fewer individuals and lower diversity than similar rural habitats. The unique development histories of different urban areas, and the difficulty of assessing mobile pollinator assemblages in just part of their range, mean that complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are required to discover if these findings are more widely applicable.

TI  - The Red Queen and the Court Jester: Species Diversity and the Role of Biotic and Abiotic Factors Through Time
PY  - 2009
AB  - Evolution may be dominated by biotic factors, as in the Red Queen model, or abiotic factors, as in the Court Jester model, or a mixture of both. The two models appear to operate predominantly over different geographic and temporal scales: Competition, predation, and other biotic factors shape ecosystems locally and over short time spans, but extrinsic factors such as climate and oceanographic and tectonic events shape larger-scale patterns regionally and globally, and through thousands and millions of years. Paleobiological studies suggest that species diversity is driven largely by abiotic factors such as climate, landscape, or food supply, and comparative phylogenetic approaches offer new insights into clade dynamics.

TI  - Using Widely Available Geospatial Data Sets to Assess the Influence of Roads and Buffers on Habitat Core Areas and Connectivity
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Land development pressures that threaten habitat core areas and connectivity are intensifying across the nation and extending beyond urbanized areas in the form of rural residential development. This is particularly true in the temperate forests of the northeastern United States. We used a suite of nationally available data sets derived from satellite imagery to identify core habitat areas of the northeastern United States, including impervious cover (urbanized and developed areas) and forest cover (canopy density). These were augmented with road network extent and density. We analyzed the influence of different types of unimproved roads and amount of forest cover on identification of the extent and configuration of roadless areas, and then assessed these core habitat areas in terms of land ownership (public, private) and management (parks, refuges, multi-use). We also derived patch connectivity metrics using a graph theory approach, making use of cost surfaces that accounted for the above variab...

TI  - Evaluating the Effectiveness of Corridors: a Genetic Approach
PY  - 2001
AB  - : The effectiveness of corridors in maintaining dispersal in fragmented landscapes is a question of considerable conservation and ecological importance. We tested the efficacy of corridors as residual landscape structures in maintaining population structure in the red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi), a closed-canopy specialist, and the deer mouse ( Peromyscus maniculatus), a habitat generalist. In coniferous forests managed for timber production in northeastern Washington, we sampled pairs of populations in three landscape classes: (1) contiguous landscapes, in which sites were located completely within a matrix of closed-canopy forest; (2) corridor landscapes, in which sites were connected by a corridor of closed-canopy forest; and (3) isolated landscapes, in which sites were separated from one another by clearcut or young regeneration stands. For each species, we used four microsatellite loci to quantify genetic distance between population pairs. Nei's genetic distance ( Ds ) increased from smallest to largest in the order of contiguous, corridor, and isolated landscapes for C. gapperi. For P. maniculatus, genetic distances across landscape configurations were not significantly different. The differences between the two species indicate that they respond differently to the presence of forest corridors. In managed forests, corridors between unlogged habitats appear to maintain higher population connectivity for C. gapperi than landscapes without corridors. Resumen: La efectividad de los corredores para mantener la dispersion en paisajes fragmentados es una situacion de considerable importancia ecologica y de conservacion. Evaluamos la efectividad de los corredores como estructuras residuales del paisaje en el mantenimiento de la estructura poblacional del raton de campo de dorso cafe (Clethrionomys gapperi), un especialista de dosel cerrado, y del raton ciervo ( Peromyscus maniculatus) un generalista de habitats. Hicimos un muestreo en pares de poblaciones en bosques de coniferas manejados para la produccion maderera en tres clases de paisaje de Washington nororiental: (1) contiguo, sitios localizados completamente dentro de una matriz de bosque con dosel cerrado; (2) corredor, sitios conectados por un corredor de bosque con dosel cerrado; y (3) aislado, sitios separados uno del otro por talas o por rodales de regeneracion joven. Para cada especie, usamos cuatro loci microsatelite para cuantificar la distancia genica entre pares de poblaciones. Para C. gapperi, las distancias geneticas de Nei ( Ds ) se incrementaron en los paisajes en el siguiente orden: contiguo, corredor, y aislado. Para P. maniculatus, las distancias geneticas a lo largo de configuraciones del paisaje no fueron significativamente diferentes. Las diferencias entre estas dos especies indican que responden de diferente manera a la presencia de corredores forestales. En bosques manejados, los corredores entre habitats sin talar aparentemente mantienen una conectividad poblacional mayor para C. gapperi que los paisajes sin corredores.

TI  - How should we grow cities to minimize their biodiversity impacts
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urbanization causes severe environmental degradation and continues to increase in scale and intensity around the world, but little is known about how we should design cities to minimize their ecological impact. With a sprawling style of urban development, low intensity impact is spread across a wide area, and with a compact form of development intense impact is concentrated over a small area; it remains unclear which of these development styles has a lower overall ecological impact. Here, we compare the consequences of compact and sprawling urban growth patterns on bird distributions across the city of Brisbane, Australia. We predicted the impact on bird populations of adding 84,642 houses to the city in either a compact or sprawling design using statistical models of bird distributions. We show that urban growth of any type reduces bird distributions overall, but compact development substantially slows these reductions at the city scale. Urban-sensitive species particularly benefited from compact development at the city scale because large green spaces were left intact, whereas the distributions of nonnative species expanded as a result of sprawling development. As well as minimizing ecological disruption, compact urban development maintains human access to public green spaces. However, backyards are smaller, which impacts opportunities for people to experience nature close to home. Our results suggest that cities built to minimize per capita ecological impact are characterized by high residential density, with large interstitial green spaces and small backyards, and that there are important trade-offs between maintaining city-wide species diversity and people's access to biodiversity in their own backyard.

TI  - A general model to quantify ecological integrity for landscape assessments and US application
PY  - 2013
AB  - Increasingly, natural resources agencies and organizations are using measures of ecological integrity to monitor and evaluate the status and condition of their landscapes, and numerous methods have been developed to map the pattern of human activities. In this paper I apply formal methods from decision theory to develop a transparent ecological indicator of landscape integrity. I developed a parsimonious set of stressors using an existing framework to minimize redundancy and overlap, mapping each variable as an individual data layer with values from 0 to 1.0, and then combined them using an “increasive” function called fuzzy sum. A novel detailed land use dataset is used to generate empirical measures of the degree of human modification to map important stressors such as land use, land cover, and presence, use, and distance from roads. I applied this general framework to the US and found that the overall average degree of human modification was 0.375. Regional variation was fairly predictable, but aggregation of these raw values into terrestrial or watershed units resulted in large differences at local to regional scales. I discuss three uses of these data by land managers to manage protected areas within a dynamic landscape context. This approach generates an internally-valid model that has a direct, empirical, and physical basis to estimate the degree of human modification.

TI  - Microbats in a ‘leafy’ urban landscape: are they persisting, and what factors influence their presence?
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urbanization is an extreme form of habitat modification, but retention of native vegetation in bushland reserves may improve the ecological sustainability of cities. We focused on bats (Microchiroptera) and investigated the use of the urban matrix and surrounding bushland in a region of Sydney, Australia, where remnant bushland persists and gardens often support large trees. Ultrasonic surveys were conducted at 40 sites over one summer season in the backyard matrix, bushland remnants and surrounding National Parks to determine which species were present, and the influence of landscape elements and habitat characteristics on activity, species richness and presence of individual species. In total, 15 of the 17 microbat species known from the Sydney region were recorded in the study area. Yet only three of these species, Chalinolobus gouldii, Mormopterus species 2 and Miniopterus schreibersii were present in more than 40% of sites. Bat activity was significantly higher in remnant bushland on shale soils and in backyards, compared with sandstone gully and ridge remnants, or reference sites in nearby National Parks. Furthermore, species assemblages in urban areas were different from assemblages in reference sites. Of all the habitat characteristics examined, the amount of bushland within 0.5–3 km surrounding a site and tree density were the most common predictors of individual species presence, particularly rare species. Area of bushland, hollow abundance and average tree diameter were positively correlated with species richness, while tree diameter was the strongest predictor of total microbat activity. The proximity of large areas of bushland and the many trees remaining in residential areas of the northern ‘leafy’ suburbs of Sydney allowed the persistence of a range of bat species. The higher bat activity on fertile shale soils indicated that bushland remnants embedded within cities can have high conservation value for bats. Surveys in more urbanized areas of Sydney are needed to test predictions of the models derived in this study.

TI  - Spider, bee, and bird communities in cities are shaped by environmental control and high stochasticity.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Spatially organized distribution patterns of species and communities are shaped by both autogenic processes (neutral mechanism theory) and exogenous processes (niche theory). In the latter, environmental variables that are themselves spatially organized induce spatial structure in the response variables. The relative importance of these processes has not yet been investigated in urban habitats. We compared the variance explained by purely spatial, spatially structured environmental, and purely environmental components for the community composition of spiders (Araneae), bees (Apidae), and birds (Aves) at 96 locations in three Swiss cities. Environmental variables (topography, climate, land cover, urban green management) were measured on four different radii around sampling points (,10 m, 50 m, 250 m, 1000 m), while Moran's eigenvector maps (MEMs) acted as spatial variables. All three taxonomic groups showed weak spatial structure. Spider communities reacted to very fine- scaled environmental changes of lawn and meadow management and climate. Bird community composition was determined by woody plants as well as solar radiation at all radii, the scale of the influence varying among species. Bee communities were weakly explained by isolated variables only. Our results suggest that the anthropogenic structuring of urban areas has disrupted the spatial organization of environmental variables and inhibited the development of biotic spatial processes. The near absence of spatial structure may therefore be a feature typical of urban species assemblages, resulting in urban community composition mainly influenced by local environmental variables. Urban environments represent a close-knit mosaic of habitats that are regularly disturbed. Species communities in urban areas are far from equilibrium. Our analysis also suggests that urban communities need to be considered as being in constant change to adapt to disturbances and changes imposed by human activities.

TI  - Ecological connectivity for a changing climate.
PY  - 2010
AB  - A frequently proposed strategy to reduce the negative effects of climate change on biological diversity is to increase ecological connectivity (Heller & Zavaleta 2009)— the flow of organisms and ecological processes across landscapes (Taylor et al. 1993). Traditionally, conservation professionals have sought to maintain or restore connectivity to ensure gene flow among isolated populations and promote recolonization of vacant patches (Hanski 1998). Given the rapid emergence of connectivity enhancement as a climate-change adaptation strategy, we considered whether connectivity should be emphasized in conservation strategies as global or regional temperatures increase and what principles for connectivity enhancement could be applied to maximize the usefulness of the strategy. The best historical analogue for the ongoing rise in global temperatures occurred 55 million years ago at the Paleocene and Eocene boundary, when the average global temperature rose 5–6 ◦C in 10,000–20,000 years (Wing et al. 2005). At that time, species’ ranges shifted and subtropical cypress swamps, complete with alligators, existed on Ellesmere Island in the Arctic (Estes & Hutchison 1980). A similar rise in temperature has been projected within the next 100–200 years (IPCC 2007), two orders of magnitude faster than previous warming events. Movements of some species, however, are now restricted by human-caused fragmentation and other barriers. The primary rationale for increasing connectivity is that if the effects of land-cover fragmentation can be mitigated, this should enhance the ability of species to move into new regions as climate changes (Fig. 1), thereby decreasing the probability of extirpation or extinction. Here, increasing connectivity refers to management actions that facilitate dispersal of species among natural areas, for example, through the establishment of landscape corridors or stepping-stone reserves or through actions that increase matrix permeability.

TI  - Relative importance of management vs. design for implementation of large-scale ecological networks
PY  - 2010
AB  - Ecological networks (ENs) are used to mitigate landscape-scale habitat loss, and are managed and designed to conserve regional biodiversity. In our study region in southern Africa, ENs of isolated grassland remnants are specifically set aside and managed for conservation, and are complemented by corridor-like power line servitudes which are maintained by regular mowing. Using grasshoppers, a sensitive and reliable bioindicator taxon, we determine whether ENs effectively conserve biodiversity. We used cluster analysis and variation partitioning to select the best subset of environmental variables which explained the patterns of species composition. We then compared the relative importance of environmental variables grouped by the scale of their influence: local-scale variables affected by management practices vs. landscape-scale variables affected by design of ENs. Management was consistently and significantly 2–5 times more influential than design in determining grasshopper assemblages within ENs and servitudes. Servitudes had a higher proportion of bare ground, lower proportion of tall grasses and higher abundance of grasshoppers relative to ENs. Three grasshopper species were strongly associated with servitudes and exhibited traits consistent with early colonizers. As management actions are primarily responsible for vegetation succession, the use of ENs for conservation efforts should first focus on appropriate management strategies, such as fire regime and grass height management before altering the landscape structure (e.g. increasing connectivity or enlarging patches). The conservation implications of these results are that, if ENs are managed and designed for heterogeneity and to simulate multiple successional stages, they may be beneficial for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Urban summer heat load: meteorological data as a proxy for metropolitan biodiversity
PY  - 2012
AB  - Regional climate models forecast that the incidence of extreme heat waves will increase in Central Europe, and the associated intensification of urban heat islands causes concerns about human health and biodiversity. We investigated species diversity of terrestrial gastropods across an urban gradient in a metropolitan area. We considered 34 sites of different degrees of urbanization and of different thermal stress classes (TSC) that were derived from a classification of urban heat load based on the physiological equivalent temperature (PET). A total of 31 species were recorded with 0–21 species per site (mean: 4.4 ± 5.2 species per site). Alpha diversity was best explained by TSC, bush cover and perennial vegetation cover, and it decreased with increasing thermal stress. Overall, thermal stress predicted snail and slug species richness better than urban cover (ANOVA(analysis of variance); TSC: F = 10.0, p < 0.001; urbanization: F = 3.9, p = 0.018), and the proportional loss in species richness was higher for native species than for introduced species. The results indicate that climatic stress contributes to the impoverishment of biodiversity in urban areas. We propose that TSC and/or PET are useful indicators for environmental stress levels in biodiversity studies in natural and anthropogenically transformed landscapes.

TI  - Urban domestic gardens (XII): The richness and composition of the flora in five UK cities
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Question: What floras are typically associated with domestic gardens in cities? Location: The urban areas of the cities of Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leicester and Oxford, UK. Methods: The composition and diversity of plant species in 267 urban domestic gardens in the five cities was recorded by complete census and quadrat sampling. Results: The entire garden flora consisted of 1056 species, of which 30% were native and 70% alien. 34% of the 50 most frequently recorded species in gardens were native, a number of them being weeds. Although plant species richness in individual gardens varied with garden area, the above breakdowns held true when the cities were considered individually. The only exception was Belfast where, overall, plant species richness was slightly lower than in any of the other cities. Comparing quadrat samples, species richness was found to be greater in the garden habitats of each of the cities than in a number of other habitats, with species accumulation curves showing no si...

TI  - Urban biogeography : City parks as islands for Diptera and Coleoptera.
PY  - 1978
AB  - Species richness and abundance of Diptera and Coleoptera were assessed in nine city parks in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Species richness for each park was related to the area of the park in a manner predicted by island biogeography theory. The z values for the Diptera and Coleoptera were 0.235 and 0.222 respectively. These values are somewhat higher than expected for continental islands and suggest that the Diptera and Coleoptera in these parks are as isolated as many species which occur on true oceanic islands.A stepwise multiple regression was conducted, regressing species richness against several aspects of habitat diversity in the parks. It was found that area alone was the best predictor of species richness. This result, coupled with data on population sizes, suggests that increased area acts primarily to reduce extinction rates rather than to provide new habitats for specialized species.

TI  - A Comparison of Richness Hotspots, Rarity Hotspots, and Complementary Areas for Conserving Diversity of British Birds
PY  - 1996
AB  - Biodiversity conservation requires efficient methods for choosing priority areas for in situ conservation management. We compared three quantitative methods for choosing 5% (an arbitrary figure) of all the 10 × 10 km grid cells in Britain to represent the diversity of breeding birds: (1) hotspots of richness, which selects the areas richest in species; (2) hotspots of range-size rarity (narrow endemism), which selects areas richest in those species with the most restricted ranges; and (3) sets of complementary areas, which selects areas with the greatest combined species richness. Our results show that richness hotspots contained the highest number of species-in-grid-cell records (with many representations of the more widespread species), whereas the method of complementary areas obtained the lowest number. However, whereas richness hotspots included representation of 89% of British species of breeding birds, and rarity hotspots included 98%, the areas chosen using complementarity represented all the species, where possible, at least six times over. The method of complementary areas was also well suited to supplementing the existing conservation network. For example, starting with grid cells with over 50% area cover by existing “Sites of Special Scientific Interest,” we searched for a set of areas that could complete the representation of all the most threatened birds in Britain, the Red Data species. The method of complementary areas distinguishes between irreplaceable and flexible areas, which helps planners by providing alternatives for negotiation. This method can also show which particular species justify the choice of each area. Yet the complementary areas method will not be fully able to select the best areas for conservation management until we achieve integration of some of the more important factors affecting viability, threat, and cost.

TI  - Can a large metropolis sustain complex herpetofauna communities? An analysis of the suitability of green space fragments in Rome
PY  - 2009
AB  - Urban areas are primary causes of species’ range fragmentation and reduction. However, relatively few studies have attempted to describe the habitat variables influencing the diversity and conservation of amphibians and reptiles, particularly in Mediterranean Europe and in large metropolitan areas. We explored this broad conservation ecology problem by studying the richness and diversity patterns in relation to a suite of six independent habitat variables in Rome, one of the most ancient cities of the world. We considered all the green remnant areas (n = 62) of Rome, ranging 1 to 41000 ha in size, which are interspersed within a sea of urbanized matrix. A total of 10 amphibian and 15 reptile species were studied. Their presence/absence patterns were assessed and the effects of the various habitat variables on each species were predicted by a logistic regression model. A total of 1261 presence records (404 amphibians and 857 reptiles) were analysed. Fragment size and wood size within each fragment did correlate significantly with the species richness of both amphibians and reptiles, and there was a clear threshold effect after 50 ha of wooded surface. The presence of water bodies positively affected the species distribution. One amphibian and three reptiles inhabited exclusively fragments 450 ha. The distance from the centre did not affect fragment species richness. The presence of most species of both amphibians and reptiles was positively influenced by the irregular versus circular shape of the wooded area. The legal protection of a given area did not influence the observed patterns but the total number of sheltered species. Overall, our study suggests that, in order to maintain the current diversity and population viability, it is necessary, in addition to water bodies’ maintenance, to (1) preserve the wooded landscapes over 50 ha; (2) promote irregularly shaped increases in the wood surface; (3) maintain ecotonal boundaries.

TI  - Ecology and urban planning
PY  - 1999
AB  - Urban areas harbour diverse nature ranging from semi-natural habitats to wastelands, parks and other highly human-influenced biotopes with their associated species assemblages. Maintenance of this urban biodiversity for the residents and for its intrinsic value in the face of increasing population and expanding cities requires that ecological knowledge should be better integrated into urban planning. To achieve this goal understanding of ecological patterns and processes in urban ecosystems is needed. The first step in the necessary urban ecological research is to find out what kind of nature exists in cities. Second, knowledge about ecological processes important in urban nature is required. Although ecological processes in cities are the same as in rural areas, some of them, such as invasion by alien species, are more prevalent in urban than in rural conditions. Third, based on ecological knowledge, management schemes maintaining the diversity of urban nature should be designed. These procedures should also include protection of urban nature, e.g. in urban national parks. Finally, as ecology alone cannot provide the complex information about human influence on urban ecosystems, interdisciplinary research involving natural and social sciences is imperative for a holistic approach to integrating ecology into the process of urban planning.

TI  - EFFECT OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ON THE EXTINCTION THRESHOLD: A SYNTHESIS*
PY  - 2002
AB  - I reviewed and reconciled predictions of four models on the effect of habitat fragmentation on the population extinction threshold, and I compared these predictions to results from empirical studies. All four models predict that habitat fragmentation can, under some conditions, increase the extinction threshold such that, in more fragmented landscapes, more habitat is required for population persistence. However, empirical studies have shown both positive and negative effects of habitat fragmentation on population abundance and distribution with about equal frequency, suggesting that the models lack some important process(es). The two colonization–extinction (CE) models predict that fragmentation can increase the extinction threshold by up to 60–80%; i.e., the amount of habitat required for persistence can shift from 80% of the landscape, with a shift from completely clumped to completely fragmented habitat. The other two models (birth–immigration–death–emigration, or BIDE models)...

TI  - Dispersal of juvenile cougars in fragmented habitat
PY  - 1995
AB  - There is little information on the spatiotemporal pattern of dispersal of juvenile cougars (Felis concolor) and no data on disperser use of habitat corridors. I investigated dispersal of radio-tagged juvenile cougars (8 M, 1 F) in a California landscape containing 3 corridors (1.5, 4.0, and 6.0 km long) and several habitat peninsulas created by urban growth. Dispersal was usually initiated by the mother abandoning the cub near an edge of her home range. The cub stayed within 300 m of that site for 13-19 days and then dispersed in the direction opposite that taken by the mother. Mean age at dispersal was 18 months (range 13-21 months). Each disperser traveled from its natal range to the farthest part of the urban-wildland edge, Dispersing males occupied a series of small (<30% the area used by ad M in the same time span), temporary (10-298 days) home ranges, usually near the urban-wildland interface, and often with its longest border along that edge. Each of the 3 corridors was used by 1-3 dispersers, 5 of the 9 dispersers found and successfully used corridors, and 2 dispersers entered but failed to traverse corridors. Dispersing cougars will use corridors that are located along natural travel routes, have ample windy cover, include an underpass integrated with roadside fencing at high-speed road crossings, lack artificial outdoor lighting, and have <1 dwelling unit/ 16 ha

TI  - Bird diversity in a subtropical South-American City: effects of noise levels, arborisation and human population density
PY  - 2011
AB  - Cities are highly modified environments in which the only areas that resemble natural landscapes are urban parks with low human population density. Attempts are frequently made to maintain high bird diversity in cities for aesthetic or educational reasons. However, it remains unclear whether local site characteristics are important in determining bird assemblage composition or whether simplification of the assemblage is an inevitable consequence of the changes associated with human population density. From May 1998 to December 1999, we undertook bird counts at 521 points in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Our main goal was to understand the pattern of distribution of the bird species richness and density within the city and determine which variables most affect species assemblages. We recorded 132 species belonging to 43 families that are common in Rio Grande do Sul and obtained quantitative data on 121 species in survey sites. The two most abundant species (House Sparrow, Passer domesticus and Rock dove, Columba livia) were exotics. Analysis based on a reduced subset of 134 points surveyed in spring/early summer suggested that there was a North–south gradient in assemblage structure. Variation in assemblage structure was also affected by the number of trees, urban noise and human population density. However, human population density had a much smaller effect on richness and assemblage structure than variables subject to management, such as tree density and noise levels. These results suggest that complex communities may be maintained in densely populated urban areas of sub-tropical South-America given adequate urban planning.

TI  - Meta‐analysis reveals the importance of matrix composition for animals in fragmented habitat
PY  - 2010
AB  - Aim Connectivity is a key determinant of the distribution and abundance of organisms and is greatly influenced by anthropogenic landscape modification, yet we lack a synthetic perspective on the magnitude and extent of matrix effects on connectivity. We synthesize results from published studies to understand the importance of matrix effects on fragmented animal populations. Location Global. Methods We conduct a meta-analysis of 283 fragmented populations representing 184 terrestrial animal taxa to determine the strength of matrix composition effects on the occurrence and abundance of animals in fragmented habitat. Results Studies that use data on matrix composition report greater effects on abundance and occupancy of fragmented populations than studies that define connectivity without regard to the surrounding matrix (i.e. ‘binary’ studies that describe only characteristics of patch habitat). Main conclusions Our findings underscore that conservation strategies must consider the importance of matrix habitat, have important implications for metapopulation and metacommunity paradigms, and provide direct large-scale, multi-taxa evidence that matrix habitat is an important driver of ecological dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Efficacy of land-cover models in predicting isolation of marbled salamander populations in a fragmented landscape.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Amphibians worldwide are facing rapid declines due to habitat loss and fragmentation, disease, and other causes. Where habitat alteration is implicated, there is a need for spatially explicit conservation plans. Models built with geographic information systems (GIS) are frequently used to inform such planning. We explored the potential for using GIS models of functional landscape connectivity as a reliable proxy for genetically derived measures of population isolation. We used genetic assignment tests to characterize isolation of marbled salamander populations and evaluated whether the relative amount of modified habitat around breeding ponds was a reliable indicator of population isolation. Using a resampling analysis, we determined whether certain land-cover variables consistently described population isolation. We randomly drew half the data for model building and tested the performance of the best models on the other half 100 times. Deciduous forest was consistently associated with lower levels of population isolation, whereas salamander populations in regions of agriculture and anthropogenic development were more isolated. Models that included these variables and pond size explained 65-70% of variation in genetically inferred isolation across sites. The resampling analysis confirmed that these habitat variables were consistently good predictors of isolation. Used judiciously, simple GIS models with key land-cover variables can be used to estimate population isolation if field sampling and genetic analysis are not possible.

TI  - Desperately seeking stable 50-year-old landscapes with patches and long, wide corridors.
PY  - 2012
AB  - gene flow and demographic movement among plants and animals connected by the corridors as intended. Nonetheless, it’s clear that swaths of land much smaller than conservation corridors and embedded in a matrix that is not intensely modified by human activities do support presence and movement of plants and animals [7,9]. These results suggest that corridors may be a useful conservation intervention. However, evidence that such movements occur often enough to promote genetic connectivity and patch occupancy across longer distances in human-dominated landscapes is generally lacking (but see [10]). Evidence is lacking primarily because most corridor studies have been conducted in landscapes that are vastly smaller and different than the landscapes conservation corridors are designed for and have measured species response variables weakly related to corridor utility. That’s why we’re issuing a call for help to identify appropriate sites to test the effectiveness of conservation corridors on a global scale.

TI  - Environmental heterogeneity as a universal driver of species richness across taxa, biomes and spatial scales
PY  - 2014
AB  - Environmental heterogeneity is regarded as one of the most important factors governing species richness gradients. An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification. However, the extent and generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships are still debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity–richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity–richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity–richness research.

TI  - Detecting Critical Scales in Fragmented Landscapes
PY  - 1997
AB  - We develop methods for quantifying habitat connectivity at multiple scales and assigning conservation priority to habitat patches based on their contribution to connectivity. By representing the habitat mosaic as a mathematical "graph," we show that percolation theory can be used to quantify connectivity at multiple scales from empirical landscape data. Our results indicate that connectivity of landscapes is highly scale dependent, exhibiting a marked transition at a characteristic distance and varying significantly for organisms with different dispersal behavior. More importantly, we show that the sensitivity and importance of landscape pattern is also scale dependent, peaking at scales associated with the percolation transition. In addition, the sensitivity analysis allows us to identify critical "stepping stone" patches that, when removed from the landscape, cause large changes in connectivity.

TI  - Quantifying the network connectivity of landscape mosaics: a graph-theoretical approach
PY  - 2000
AB  - Connectivity determines a large number of ecological functions of the landscape, including seed and animal dispersal, gene flow and disturbance propagation, and is therefore a key to understanding fluxes of matter and energy within land mosaics. Several approaches to quantifying landscape connectivity are possible. Among these, graph theory may be used to represent a landscape as a series of interconnected patches, where flows occur as a result of structural and/or functional patch connectivity. Within this context, we propose the use of a graph-theoretic index (i.e., the Harary index) as a measure of landscape connectivity. Results derived from the analysis of the vegetation map of Palmarola (central Italy) show that, from a statistical and ecological viewpoint, the Harary index may be a better measure of landscape connectivity than more traditional indices derived from transportation geography.

TI  - A meta-analysis of fauna and flora species richness and abundance in plantations and pasture lands
PY  - 2010
AB  - We conducted a systematic global review of differences between timber plantations and pasture lands in terms of animal and plant species richness and abundance, and assessed the results using meta-analysis techniques. Our principal aim was to test the hypothesis that plantations contain higher species richness or abundance than pasture. Of the 1967 studies of potential relevance, 66 provided biological monitoring information and 36 met the requirements for meta-analyses. Sufficient data were available for meta-analyses to be conducted comparing the species richness and abundance of plantations and pasture lands for five taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, reptiles/amphibians, mammals, and birds. Within each taxon there was considerable variation in the difference between species richness and abundance between plantations and pasture lands. Birds and reptile/amphibians exhibited significantly higher species richness, and mammals exhibited significantly higher abundance, in plantations than in pasture lands which lacked remnant vegetation. Reptile/amphibian species richness was significantly higher in plantations in general. No significant differences in species richness were found for mammals, plants, or invertebrates, and no significant differences in abundance were found for birds, reptiles/amphibians, invertebrates, or plants. It is only within the presence of taxonomic caveats (i.e. reptiles/amphibians), or specific landscape features (i.e. absence of remnant vegetation within pasture), that it can be concluded that plantations support higher species richness or abundance than pasture land. We emphasize that caution is warranted when making general statements about the inherent biodiversity value of diverse and broadly-defined land-uses.

TI  - Landscape effects on birds in urban woodlands: an analysis of 34 Swedish cities
PY  - 2010
AB  - Aim To compare bird abundances in woodlands along gradients from the city centre to the peri-urban area. To evaluate the importance of the proportion of woodland within the city and in the peri-urban landscape to forest bird communities breeding in urban woodlands. To test whether fragmentation effects on birds were linked to the type of peri-urban matrix. Location A total of 34 Swedish cities with > 10,000 inhabitants in south-central Sweden. The study area covered 105,000 km2, in which 84% of the Swedish population of 9.1 million lives. Methods Repeated point count surveys were conducted in 2004 in a total of 474 woodlands. General linear models were used to test for possible differences in abundance along urban to peri-urban gradients, and to regress bird abundances in local urban woodlands on: (1) total woodland cover in the city, (2) total woodland cover in the peri-urban landscape, (3) the interaction between woodland cover in the city and in the peri-urban area, (4) region, and (5) human density. Results More than 12,000 individuals of 100 forest bird species were recorded. Of the 34 most common species detected, 13 bird species had higher abundances in urban than in peri-urban woodlands, and seven species showed the opposite trend. The bird community of urban woodlands was characterized by species associated with deciduous forests and tree nesters, whereas the bird community of peri-urban woodlands was characterized by species associated with coniferous woodland and ground nesters. Twelve species were significantly linearly associated with the proportion of urban woodland and/or the proportion of peri-urban woodland, and a further eight species were associated with the interaction between these two factors. Local breeding bird abundances of four species were significantly positively associated with the proportion of urban woodland only in farmland-dominated landscapes. Main conclusions Fragmentation effects on some urban birds are linked to the type of peri-urban matrix. In farmland landscapes, peri-urban woodlands may have been too scarce to act as a source of bird immigrants to fragmented urban woodlands. To maintain populations of specialized forest birds within cities in landscapes dominated by agriculture, it is of paramount importance to conserve any remaining urban woodlands.

TI  - Only ten percent of the global terrestrial protected area network is connected via intact land
PY  - 2020
AB  - Land free of direct anthropogenic disturbance is considered essential for achieving biodiversity conservation outcomes but is rapidly eroding. In response, many nations are increasing their protected area estates but little consideration is given to the context of the surrounding landscape. This is despite the fact that connectivity between protected areas is critical in a changing climate and mandated in international protected area targets. By utilizing the latest human pressure assessment, which shows that ~40% of the terrestrial planet is still intact, and a connectivity method, we found just 9.7% of Earth9s terrestrial protected network can be considered 9connected9. On average, 11% of each nation9s protected area estate is connected via intact land. As the global community commits to bolder action on abating biodiversity loss, only an increased focus on landscape-scale habitat retention and restoration efforts will ensure those critical areas safeguarded for conservation outcomes will remain (or become) connected.

PY  - 2007
AB  - Characteristics of urban natural areas and surrounding landscapes were identified that best explain winter bird use for 28 urban natural areas in southern Ontario, Canada. The research confirms for winter birds the importance of area (size) and natural vegetation, rather than managed, horticultural parkland, within urban natural areas as well as percent urban land use and natural habitat in surrounding landscapes. Alien bird density and percent ground feeding species increased with percent surrounding urban land use. Higher percent forest cover was associated with higher percentages of forest, bark feeding, small ( 20 ha start to support some area-sensitive species. Areas similar to rural forests had >25% insectivores, >25% forest interior species, >25% small species, and <5% alien species. Indicator species separated urban natural areas from rural habitats and ordination placed urban natural areas along a gradient between urban development and undisturbed, rural forests. More attention is needed on issues of winter bird conservation in urban landscapes.

TI  - Decline in the diversity of willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) as a result of urban expansion in Beijing, China
PY  - 2010
AB  - Beijing, the capital and second largest city of China, expanded in a typical concentric pattern. The urbanized area consists of five concentric zones, which are based on the city’s ring road system. Willow trees (Salix spp.) are commonly planted and abundant in the city. In this study, we determined the effects of urbanization on willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) in a 3-year survey. Our results indicated that species richness and abundance decreased from outskirts to the urban center. It was estimated that within a 30-km limit, species richness and abundance might be reduced by 0.9 species and 59.3% of individuals per 5 km toward urban center. Landscape variables (e.g., the proportion of impervious surface and distance to urban center) explained 59.4% of species richness and 43.9% of species abundance. Local variables (e.g., plant resources and site size) explained only 4.9% of species richness and 4.7% of species abundance. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between urban expansion and weevil diversity. There are several ways in which such detrimental effects on biodiversity could be mitigated: (1) Optimization of urban landscape structures, as well as vegetation planting; (2) increasing connectivity between urban remnants and natural landscapes in the outskirts of the city; and (3) limiting the proportion of impervious surface in inner urban zones.

TI  - Fragments are not islands: patch vs landscape perspectives on songbird presence and abundance in a harvested boreal forest
PY  - 2000
AB  - The boreal mixed-wood forest of northern Alberta. Canada is characterized by a mosaic of deciduous and coniferous forest patches. Recently, the deciduous portion of the forest was allocated for industrial logging. Widespread habitat loss and fragmentation may negatively affect birds and other wildlife. Most research on the effects of habitat loss on bird abundance has focussed on the forest as a patch or island in a matrix of non-habitat, but some species of songbird may use both the forest patch and the matrix. We hypothesized that some species of songbird might be able to compensate for a loss of deciduous forest by moving into other habitat types (termed “habitat compensation”). We report on a replicated field investigation in which we assessed the response of songbirds to commercial timber harvest by first examining their abundance within deciduous forest only, and then adding the clearcuts and coniferous forest in the surrounding areas to the analysis for a broader, landscape view of the system. Bird communities in deciduous and coniferous habitats had significant overlap in species composition: there was less overlap between forest and clearcuts. The shift from patch-centred to landscape sampling altered our interpretation of over half of the most common species' responses to logging in at least one year, suggesting that habitat compensation may have been occurring. However, significant variation in responses of species was observed between the two study areas. Our past reliance on island biogeographic and other single habitat approaches may be inappropriate for this system, and we stress that a broad, landscape view is required to properly assess and interpret species' responses to habitat loss and fragmentation.

TI  - A GIS methodology for assessing ecological connectivity: application to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract We developed a new methodology for the assessment of landscape and ecological connectivity at regional scale. This method has been entirely formalized using mathematical language, is supported by a topological analysis of a 1:25,000 scale land use map, and has been developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The method allows the elaboration of a diagnose of the connectivity of terrestrial landscape ecosystems, on the basis of a previously defined set of ecological functional areas, and a computational cost-distance model which includes the barrier effect. This last component takes into consideration the type of barrier, the distance impact, and the adjacent land use and vegetation type. We defined two new compound indices: one for ecological connectivity and another for the barrier effect. The practical interest of our model is that it not only allows a cost-effective assessment of the current situation, but it has predictive capabilities, allowing the quantitative assessment and comparison of the impacts resulting from different planning scenarios or different infrastructure alternatives on the landscape and ecological connectivity. The application of this model to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA), 16% of which is currently classified as urban, showed that 65% of the BMA area is currently occupied by functional ecological areas, and that 18% is covered by artificial barriers, although they have a direct negative impact on 56.5% of the area. The model also allowed the identification of vulnerable spots, including 1.7% of the BMA that has a critical importance for ecological connectivity, as well as the network of landscape linkages and ecological corridors that offer a high restoration potential. Further applications of this methodology assessing the impacts of regional and urban plans on ecological connectivity, suggest than it could easily be extrapolated to other regions.

TI  - Ecological Responses to Habitat Edges: Mechanisms, Models, and Variability Explained
PY  - 2004
AB  - ▪ Abstract Edge effects have been studied for decades because they are a key component to understanding how landscape structure influences habitat quality. However, making sense of the diverse patterns and extensive variability reported in the literature has been difficult because there has been no unifying conceptual framework to guide research. In this review, we identify four fundamental mechanisms that cause edge responses: ecological flows, access to spatially separated resources, resource mapping, and species interactions. We present a conceptual framework that identifies the pathways through which these four mechanisms can influence distributions, ultimately leading to new ecological communities near habitat edges. Next, we examine a predictive model of edge responses and show how it can explain much of the variation reported in the literature. Using this model, we show that, when observed, edge responses are largely predictable and consistent. When edge responses are variable for the same species ...

TI  - Protected area connectivity: Shortfalls in global targets and country-level priorities.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Connectivity of protected areas (PAs) is crucial for meeting their conservation goals. We provide the first global evaluation of countries' progress towards Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity that is to have at least 17% of the land covered by well-connected PA systems by 2020. We quantify how well the terrestrial PA systems of countries are designed to promote connectivity, using the Protected Connected (ProtConn) indicator. We refine ProtConn to focus on the part of PA connectivity that is in the power of a country to influence, i.e. not penalizing countries for PA isolation due to the sea and to foreign lands. We found that globally only 7.5% of the area of the countries is covered by protected connected lands, which is about half of the global PA coverage of 14.7%, and that only 30% of the countries currently meet the Aichi Target 11 connectivity element. These findings suggest the need for considerable efforts to improve PA connectivity globally. We further identify the main priorities for improving or sustaining PA connectivity in each country: general increase of PA coverage, targeted designation of PAs in strategic locations for connectivity, ensuring permeability of the unprotected landscapes between PAs, coordinated management of neighbouring PAs within the country, and/or transnational coordination with PAs in other countries. Our assessment provides a key contribution to evaluate progress towards global PA connectivity targets and to highlight important strengths and weaknesses of the design of PA systems for connectivity in the world's countries and regions.

TI  - Biodiversity, Urban Areas, and Agriculture: Locating Priority Ecoregions for Conservation
PY  - 2003
AB  - Urbanization and agriculture are two of the most important threats to biodiversity worldwide. The intensities of these land-use phenomena, however, as well as levels of biodiversity itself, differ widely among regions. Thus, there is a need to develop a quick but rigorous method of identifying where high levels of human threats and biodiversity coincide. These areas are clear priorities for biodiversity conservation. In this study, we combine distribution data for eight major plant and animal taxa (comprising over 20,000 species) with remotely sensed measures of urban and agricultural land use to assess conservation priorities among 76 terrestrial ecoregions in North America. We combine the species data into overall indices of richness and endemism. We then plot each of these indices against the percent cover of urban and agricultural land in each ecoregion, resulting in four separate comparisons. For each comparison, ecoregions that fall above the 66th quantile on both axes are identified as priorities for conservation. These analyses yield four "priority sets" of 6-16 ecoregions (8-21% of the total number) where high levels of biodiversity and human land use coincide. These ecoregions tend to be concentrated in the southeastern United States, California, and, to a lesser extent, the Atlantic coast, southern Texas, and the U.S. Midwest. Importantly, several ecoregions are members of more than one priority set and two ecoregions are members of all four sets. Across all 76 ecoregions, urban cover is positively correlated with both species richness and endemism. Conservation efforts in densely populated areas therefore may be equally important (if not more so) as preserving remote parks in relatively pristine regions.

AB  - Urban areas harbour diverse nature ranging from semi-natural habitats to wastelands, parks and other highly human-in uenced biotopes with their associated species assemblages. Maintenance of this urban biodiversity for the residents and for its intrinsic value in the face of increasing population and expanding cities requires that ecological knowledge should be better integrated into urban planning. To achieve this goal understanding of ecological patterns and processes in urban ecosystems is needed. The ®rst step in the necessary urban ecological research is to ®nd out what kind of nature exists in cities. Second, knowledge about ecological processes important in urban nature is required. Although ecological processes in cities are the same as in rural areas, some of them, such as invasion by alien species, are more prevalent in urban than in rural conditions. Third, based on ecological knowledge, management schemes maintaining the diversity of urban nature should be designed. These procedures should also include protection of urban nature, e.g. in urban national parks. Finally, as ecology alone cannot provide the complex information about human in uence on urban ecosystems, interdisciplinary research involving natural and social sciences is imperative for a holistic approach to integrating ecology into the process of urban planning.

TI  - Effects of urbanization on species richness: A review of plants and animals
PY  - 2008
AB  - Many studies have described the effects of urbanization on species richness. These studies indicate that urbanization can increase or decrease species richness, depending on several variables. Some of these variables include: taxonomic group, spatial scale of analysis, and intensity of urbanization. Recent reviews of birds (the most-studied group) indicate that species richness decreases with increasing urbanization in most cases but produces no change or even increases richness in some studies. Here I expand beyond the bird studies by reviewing 105 studies on the effects of urbanization on the species richness of non-avian species: mammals, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates and plants. For all groups, species richness tends to be reduced in areas with extreme urbanization (i.e., central urban core areas). However, the effects of moderate levels of urbanization (i.e., suburban areas) vary significantly among groups. Most of the plant studies (about 65%) indicate increasing species richness with moderate urbanization whereas only a minority of invertebrate studies (about 30%) and a very small minority of non-avian vertebrate studies (about 12%) show increasing species richness. Possible explanations for these results are discussed, including the importance of nonnative species importation, spatial heterogeneity, intermediate disturbance and scale as major factors influencing species richness.

TI  - New concepts, models, and assessments of climate-wise connectivity
PY  - 2018
AB  - Author(s): Keeley, Annika T H; Ackerly, David D; Cameron, D Richard; Heller, Nicole E; Huber, Patrick R; Schloss, Carrie A; Thorne, James H; Merenlender, Adina M | Abstract: Empirical studies and habitat suitability modeling project significant shifts in species distributions in response to climate change. Because habitat fragmentation can impede species range shifts, wildlife corridors may have increasing importance in enhancing climate resilience for species persistence. While habitat connectivity has been studied for over four decades, the design of connectivity specifically to facilitate species movement in response to climate change is a relatively new challenge. We conducted a systematic review of 116 relevant papers from 1996–2017. Research focused on assessing the utility of habitat connectivity for climate change adaptation by species (N = 29) and modeling and mapping climate-wise connectivity for planning purposes (N = 55). Others addressed fundamental questions of connectivity related to climate adaptation (N = 31). Based on empirical data and computer simulations examining species range shifts in response to climate change at leading edges of current distributions; it is clear that large protected areas connected through linkages, and stepping stones embedded in a permeable matrix promote population persistence and facilitate range expansion. We identified 13 approaches to modeling climate-wise connectivity based on either focal species or landscape structure. When prioritizing areas for connectivity conservation, approaches include focusing on connecting areas of low climate velocity, refugia, climate analogs, or linking current to future suitable habitats. Riparian corridors should be considered in connectivity plans because of their importance as natural movement corridors, climate gradients, and refugia. Guidance is provided on selecting the best methods for connectivity design depending on the objectives, available data, and landscape context. Future research needs to evaluate the functionality of climate-wise connectivity models for facilitating range shifts and compare connectivity outcomes across modeling approaches.

TI  - A meta-analysis of the effects of urbanization on ground beetle communities
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urbanization is one of the most disruptive forms of land use, and its effects on ecological communities are likely to increase as the human population continues to shift from rural to urban living. Whether the myriad changes encompassed by urbanization (e.g., habitat fragmentation, the urban heat island effect, disturbance) affect biological communities in predictable ways remains unresolved. In this study, we employed meta-analysis to quantify the overall effects of urbanization on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), an ecologically diverse and important group that has been relatively well-studied in cities. We calculated effect sizes for carabid species richness, the total abundance of beetles at a site (assemblage abundance), and the abundances of individual species at urban compared to rural forested sites. We found that the number of carabid species in cities was only 77.6% that of corresponding rural sites, whereas assemblage abundance was relatively consistent between rural and urban sites. Such assemblage-level patterns resulted from the loss of certain species from urban sites and the increase in abundance of others. We hypothesized that differences among species would be largely attributable to their ecological traits (body size, habitat affinity, dispersal ability, trophic position). Through model selection based on information theoretic measures, we found support for the importance of the simple and interactive effects of beetle size, habitat affinity, and trophic position, with the most negative effect sizes for large, forest-specialist beetles that were predatory or omnivorous. Although species traits were key to understanding variation in species abundance effect sizes, several remaining sources of variation in carabid beetle responses to urbanization remain. Specifically, although many species exhibited consistent responses across the studies in which they were sampled and might therefore be considered urban avoiders or urban exploiters, many others were either relatively insensitive to the urbanization gradients or exhibited widely disparate responses across studies. Furthermore, we were unable to attribute variation in species richness and assemblage abundance effect sizes to available measures such as city size and study duration. Instead, additional mechanistic studies across the urbanization gradient will be necessary to understand such variation among studies and for species exhibiting variable responses.
