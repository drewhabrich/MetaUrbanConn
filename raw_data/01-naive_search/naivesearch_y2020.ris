AB  - Urban grasslands are usually managed as short-cut lawns and have limited biodiversity. Urban grasslands with low-intensity management are species rich and can perform numerous ecosystem services, but they are not accepted by citizens everywhere. Further, increasing and/or maintaining a relatively high level of plant species richness in an urban environment is limited by restricted plant dispersal. In this study, we examined the connectivity of urban grasslands and prioritized the grassland patches with regard to their role in connectivity in an urban landscape. We used high-resolution data from a land use system to map grassland patches in Wroclaw city, Silesia, southwest Poland, Central Europe, and applied a graph theory approach to assess their connectivity and prioritization. We next constructed a model for several dispersal distance thresholds (2, 20, 44, 100, and 1000 m), reflecting plants with differing dispersal potential. Our results revealed low connectivity of urban grassland patches, especially for plants with low dispersal ability (2-20 m). The priority of patches was correlated with their area for all dispersal distance thresholds. Most of the large patches important to overall connectivity were located in urban peripheries, while in the city center, connectivity was more restricted and grassland area per capita was the lowest. The presence of a river created a corridor, allowing plants to migrate along watercourse, but it also created a barrier dividing the system. The results suggest that increasing the plant species richness in urban grasslands in the city center requires seed addition.

AB  - In the context of increasing urbanization, preserving urban biodiversity has become a priority because biodiversity appears to be a key element when evaluating the well-being of urban residents. Recently, urban management has relied on a 'renaturing' strategy to improve biodiversity, but the benefits of these policies remain debated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of urban land use and green corridors on (1) urban avian biodiversity, and (2) the presence of the most common (top 70%) and least common (bottom 30%) bird species. We surveyed bird diversity at 102 sites during the Spring in a small French city, and performed a PCA on several habitat structures (e.g. roads, houses, grassy areas) to determine the level of urbanization of each site. Then, we tested with GLMMs the effects of land use (PC1), distance to the edge of the city, and distance to the corridor on bird diversity. We found a positive effect of green infrastructures on bird species richness, and this effect was reinforced by the proximity to the green corridor. Thus, bird species richness and the presence of common species were positively impacted by the presence of green areas, the proximity to the city edge and the proximity to the green corridor. The presence of the green corridor contributed significantly to the presence of rare species, which emphasizes its role in promoting avian biodiversity. Green corridors are a key element of the urban landscape because they allow less common species to colonize cities, and thus enhance urban biodiversity.

AB  - Community assembly is the process by which local communities are organized and maintained from the regional species pool. Understanding processes of insect assembly are of interest in "shrinking" cities where vacant land has become abundant as a result of protracted economic decline and population loss. Vacant land represents a viable conservation space for insects such as beetles that contribute to ecosystem services including pest suppression, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. However, the inherent heterogeneity of cities may pose challenges for beetle dispersal from source populations, while quality of the urban environment may constrain establishment. The objective of this study was to investigate the constraints to ground-dwelling beetle community assembly in vacant lots and pocket prairies of Cleveland, Ohio using a functional trait-based approach. Functional traits with a strong predictive capacity for ecological functions were measured on beetle species collected via pitfall traps. Assembly of beetle communities was primarily constrained by dispersal limitations to colonization. Over 93% of species found within treatments were capable of flight, and functional diversity of beetle communities was higher across all treatments than expected by chance. Once beetles colonized, successful establishment was influenced by heavy metal contamination and mowing frequency, with these disturbances shaping communities based on body size, antennae length, and origin. Colonization of dispersal-limited species could be facilitated by increasing connectivity among greenspaces in cities, while establishment could be enhanced by managing local environmental conditions. Understanding how insect communities are structured in urban ecosystems provides context for observed patterns of biodiversity, advances conservation efforts, and fosters ecosystem services.

AB  - While cities are known as important habitats for wild bees, a conceptual understanding of how assemblages of wild bee species are shaped by urban environments is limited. We applied a functional approach to test how taxonomic and functional diversity within wild bee communities of urban grasslands, and traits of bee species, related to local habitat features (e.g., management, species richness, flower coverage) and characteristics of the surrounding urban matrix (e.g., urbanisation, isolation). Surprisingly, urbanisation was not related to any diversity measure. Yet, taxonomic and functional diversity in bee communities, and proportion of endangered bee species, responded negatively to the isolation of grasslands within the urban matrix-but positively to flower coverage. Urbanisation, previous restoration efforts and site type filtered the functional composition of bee communities in terms of species traits related to diet and nesting. Results substantiate the role of urban habitats for functionally diverse bee communities, including Red-Listed species, and indicate pathways towards enhancing habitat functions of urban grasslands for wild bees by (i) improving the connectivity of urban grassland patches within the urban matrix, and (ii) more locally by adjusting management to maintain flower coverage in grasslands. These approaches can support efforts to develop pollinator-friendly greenspaces within the urban green infrastructure.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most intensive forms of landscape and habitat transformation, resulting in species loss, and taxonomic and functional homogenization of different communities. Whilst green infrastructure (the network of natural and semi-natural areas in cities) has been studied extensively in terms of specific features that promote biodiversity, there have been no studies that have assessed how species richness in different types of green space (GS) varies with increasing levels of urbanization in the surrounding matrix. We studied the effects of different types of GS and urbanization in the surrounding matrix on bird communities in the mid-sized city of Gottingen, Germany. We used the point-count method for bird observations in allotments and parks. To determine the level of urbanization, we calculated percentage of impervious surfaces around GSs. Increasing levels of urbanization around GSs had no effect on the species richness, functional traits or the community composition of birds. Nevertheless, we found that species richness and functional traits varied according to GS type. Parks had a greater species richness and were found to have more ground nesting and tropical migrant birds compared to allotments. We found more cavity nesting and resident birds in allotments. As different types of GS can contribute to the presence of different species and functional trait variations, their positive effect on bird species richness can be enhanced when they are present together in urban landscapes. Our findings suggest that green spaces with a high variety of local characteristics should be incorporated into urban planning designs in order to ensure diverse bird communities in cities.

AB  - Context With the expansion in urbanization, understanding how biodiversity responds to the altered landscape becomes a major concern. Most studies focus on habitat effects on biodiversity, yet much less attention has been paid to surrounding landscape matrices and their joint effects. Objective We investigated how habitat and landscape matrices affect waterbird diversity across scales in the Yangtze River Floodplain, a typical area with high biodiversity and severe human-wildlife conflict. Methods The compositional and structural features of the landscape were calculated at fine and coarse scales. The ordinary least squares regression model was adopted, following a test showing no significant spatial autocorrelation in the spatial lag and spatial error models, to estimate the relationship between landscape metrics and waterbird diversity. Results Well-connected grassland and shrub surrounded by isolated and regular-shaped developed area maintained higher waterbird diversity at fine scales. Regular-shaped developed area and cropland, irregular-shaped forest, and aggregated distribution of wetland and shrub positively affected waterbird diversity at coarse scales. Conclusions Habitat and landscape matrices jointly affected waterbird diversity. Regular-shaped developed area facilitated higher waterbird diversity and showed the most pronounced effect at coarse scales. The conservation efforts should not only focus on habitat quality and capacity, but also habitat connectivity and complexity when formulating development plans. We suggest planners minimize the expansion of the developed area into critical habitats and leave buffers to maintain habitat connectivity and shape complexity to reduce the disturbance to birds. Our findings provide important insights and practical measures to protect biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Urbanisation is associated with the loss and fragmentation of natural land, the disruption of ecosystem functioning and services, and the loss of biodiversity. Cape Town is situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, with high rates of endemism, but both agricultural and housing demands are increasing pressure on remaining patches of natural land and consequently the biodiversity they support. The aims of this study were to use a standardised camera trap survey to determine which native medium and large mammal species still survive in 12 City of Cape Town (CCT) municipal reserves (range 32-8400 ha), and to understand how reserve size, area-perimeter ratio, connectivity, habitat heterogeneity and presence of permanent freshwater aquatic habitat might influence medium and large mammal (>0.5 kg) community composition. Cameras were placed at 151 locations across all reserves using a stratified placement protocol that resulted in 13,360 independent trigger events by targeted taxa. Nineteen native species (11 carnivores, 7 herbivores, 1 omnivore) were recorded, which is 49% of the 39 species believed to have been present historically. Species richness varied from 1 to 12 species (mean +/- SD = 7 +/- 3.6) across reserves, and linear models showed that higher species richness and the presence of large carnivores was best explained by improved connectivity to large amounts of natural habitat. It is recommended that maintaining biodiversity in urban reserves will be best achieved by preserving and establishing corridors of suitable habitat that allow for the movement of animals to and from other patches.

AB  - In urban landscapes, humans are the most significant factor determining belowground diversity, including earthworms. Within the framework of the Global Urban Soil Ecology and Education Network (GLUSEEN), a multi-city comparison was carried out to assess the effects of soil disturbance on earthworms. In each of five cities (Baltimore, USA; Budapest, Hungary; Helsinki and Lahti, Finland; Potchefstroom, South Africa), covering four climatic and biogeographical regions, four habitat types (ruderal, turf/lawn, remnant and reference) were sampled. The survey resulted in 19 species belonging to 9 genera and 4 families. The highest total species richness was recorded in Baltimore (16), while Budapest and the Finnish cities had relatively low (5-6) species numbers. Remnant forests and lawns supported the highest earthworm biomass. Soil properties (i.e. pH and organic matter content) explained neither earthworm community composition nor abundance. Evaluating all cities together, earthworm communities were significantly structured by habitat type. Communities in the two adjacent cities, Helsinki and Lahti were very similar, but Budapest clearly separated from the Finnish cities. Earthworm community structure in Baltimore overlapped with that of the other cities. Despite differences in climate, soils and biogeography among the cities, earthworm communities were highly similar within the urban habitat types. This indicates that human-mediated dispersal is an important factor shaping the urban fauna, both at local and regional scales.

AB  - Residential communities are the primary living spaces for people in China. Their associated greenspaces are important elements of the urban ecosystem, providing neighborhood ecosystem services and hosting bird populations of differing community structures compared with other urban green areas. This study analyzes avian community characteristics within residential communities and their differences compared with urban parks in Beijing. Furthermore, we assess the key environmental factors determining species composition and population sizes and the spatial scales at which these factors are most significant. We randomly selected 27 residential communities to assess the habitat structure and landscape characteristics that underpin residential avian assemblages across multiple spatial scales. Independent sample t-test and model selection methods based on AICc were used for data analysis. Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) (hereafter ETS) alone accounted for 91.0% of total individuals. Compared with urban parks, more migrants and omnivores were found in residential communities. Within-site forest patch connectivity simultaneously decided resident species diversity and individual abundance, with the exception of ETS. Tree species richness and coverage are key predictors for resident species richness and ETS numbers, respectively. Even in the most urbanized species, ETS retained ecological attributes found in "wilder" settings. Residential communities skewed toward avian communities with dominant numbers of ETS. In these low-quality habitats, our results suggest that landscape configuration is more important than local habitat structure. Within-site habitat connectivity and the number of surrounding forest patches with shorter between-patch distances deserve more attention in future landscape design for residential communities.

AB  - Anthropogenic land use has led to the loss and fragmentation of native habitats and disruption to ecosystem processes, resulting in a decline in landscape connectivity and biodiversity. Here, in order to find the potentials of improvements in ecological connectivity, we provide a spatial analysis to present differences in ecological connectivity based on land cover maps and urban habitat maps in Suwon city, Republic of Korea. We generated two permeability maps for use in a network analysis, one being land cover and the other urban habitat, including a 5-km buffer area from the city boundary. We then determined the current-flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) for each map. Our results indicate that forests are typically the most highly connected areas in both maps. However, in the land cover map results, nearly all high-priority areas were in the mountainous region (CFBC value: 0.0100 +/- 0.0028), but the urban habitat indicated that grasslands and rivers within the city also significantly contribute to connectivity (CFBC value: 0.0071 +/- 0.0022). The CFBC maps developed here could be used as a reference when introducing green infrastructure in cities. Before establishing ecological networks for urban areas, future work should integrate the land use and ecological data of different administrative districts with continuous ecological connection.

AB  - Green roofs could mitigate the negative effects of urbanization by providing habitats for arthropods. However, more studies are necessary to understand if these new ecosystems can harbor similar numbers of species and levels of ecological processes than habitats at the ground-level. In 15 houses of 1-2 floors with extensive green roofs from a semi-rural area in Cordoba (central Argentina), we analyzed the species richness and abundance of arthropods on green roofs and their neighboring ground-level habitats and evaluated the influence of landscape composition (proportion of buildings, grasslands, and streets). We focus on feeding groups (herbivores, predators, omnivores, detritivores, parasitoids, and pollinators) and two ecological processes (herbivory and predation). Moreover, we tested two factors that may drive the communities on ground-level habitats and green roofs: habitat area and plant species richness. Species richness and abundance of arthropods (total and by feeding groups), and predation rates were significantly higher in ground-level habitats than on green roofs. Nevertheless, arthropod diversity on living roofs was striking, with almost 400 species from different feeding groups. Street cover in the landscape negatively affected total richness and several feeding groups. On ground-level habitats, herbivory increased with street cover and predation with grassland cover. The main factor driving arthropods in both green roofs and ground-level habitats was habitat area, whereas plant richness had a positive effect only in predators, detritivores, and omnivores. Our results reinforce the role of green roofs as habitat for arthropod species in semi-rural areas of Latin-American countries, where the evidence was so far lacking.

AB  - The loss and fragmentation of natural habitats is a major threat to biodiversity globally. In fragmented landscapes, species are not only affected by patch-level attributes but also by the influence of the whole mosaic of landscape elements surrounding habitat patches. Therefore, it is important to understand the simultaneous effects of local and landscape-level attributes on biodiversity. In this study, we determined the influence of landscape context on species richness of forest mammals in an urban-forest mosaic of the EThekwini Municipality Area, Durban, South Africa. We determined presence/absence of mammals in 28 patches using remote-triggered camera traps over two sampling periods. We applied generalised linear modelling within an information-theoretic framework to quantify the effects of within-patch, isolation, matrix, and landscape level attributes on species richness. The results showed the importance of landscape context for occurrence patterns of mammals in fragmented landscapes. In particular, they showed that patch size, shape complexity, habitat amount in the immediate environment, habitat proximity and road density were the most important factors influencing mammalian richness patterns. Overall, the results stressed the importance of habitat area (patch size, habitat amount in the immediate environment, and habitat proximity) and its spatial configuration to faunal preservation and suggest that management efforts in this landscape should be aimed at protecting fragments from further loss and disturbance and matrix improvement to increase landscape connectivity.

AB  - Local native species that decline in response to urbanisation are often classified as 'urban avoiders'. Their decline drives the biotic homogenisation seen in cities but the characterisation of these species as urban avoiders may discourage efforts to conserve them in urban landscapes. We used gradient analysis and species distribution modelling to examine habitat availability and fragmentation along an entire urban-forest gradient for a representative urban avoider - the Eastern Yellow Robin (Eopsaltria australis). Gradient analysis had utility in quantifying threats for this species but species distribution modelling better highlighted conservation opportunities in the landscape. The amount of suitable habitat declined with increasing urbanisation whilst fragmentation increased. Towards the city centre, habitat clustered around major waterways. Riparian networks showed clear potential to facilitate the restoration of connectivity between urban and fringing habitat and we identify 'missing links' in this network - key opportunities for habitat restoration. Riparian vegetation escapes development, is the preferred habitat for many species, including humans, and can serve as the logical architecture on which to focus conservation efforts. Restoring habitat along riparian networks in cities can build comprehensive and fully connected biotic infrastructure that facilitates human-nature connections and conserves local native species diversity.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities are the main cause of habitat loss and fragmentation, which directly affects biodiversity. Disruption in landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization, one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species, which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits, including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of ecosystems functions. Thus, urbanization plans should consider the proportion and distribution of green areas within cities, coupling human and ecosystem wellbeing.

AB  - Global wildlife populations are in decline, in part, due to habitat loss resulting from urbanization. Urban green roofs may mitigate such habitat loss by providing supplemental habitat for wildlife, including bats, which are more active over urban green roofs than nearby traditional roofs. To better understand bat activity over urban green roofs, we surveyed bats and arthropods on a 27,316-m(2) green roof planted with Sedum spp. in New York City from June to August 2017. We found that Lasiurus borealis (Eastern Red Bat), a species with a diet consisting mainly of moths, accounted for 88% of identified bat calls. We collected over 15,000 arthropods of 16 taxa and found that moth abundance, while a relatively small proportion of green roof arthropods, correlated positively with bat activity. Our findings suggest that urban green roofs provide useable habitat for moths and other arthropods and, consequently, bats may forage on green roofs when prey are available.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are under threat from habitat loss, partly due to urban expansion. However, some elements of urban freshwaters are already integral parts of the urban landscape and so are more resilient to loss, representing opportunities for the enhancement of freshwater resources within cities. This study investigated the biodiversity value of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal in Leeds, UK, in relation to its landscape context. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (i) biodiversity value is lowest nearest to the urban core, and (ii) the pattern of canal locks structured ecological communities. Nutrients, metals and dissolved carbon all existed at relatively low concentrations, contrary to what is often seen in urban water bodies, although concentrations were higher in the urban core. This gradient of chemical stress was associated with a decline in macroinvertebrate diversity towards the city centre, which manifested as pollution-sensitive taxa being excluded from this area. Community structures were found to vary between groups of sampling sites separated by locks, suggesting that locks may act as barriers for aquatic invertebrates by restricting dispersal. The results in this study indicate that canals in urban areas can be high-quality habitats, despite the associated anthropogenic stressors, and locks may represent a unique model for researching relationships between connectivity and community structure.

AB  - 1. Rich pollinator assemblages are documented in some cities despite habitat fragmentation and degradation, suggesting that urban areas have potential as pollinator refuges. To inform urban bee conservation, we assessed local- and landscape-scale drivers of bee community composition and foraging within vacant lots of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Cleveland is a shrinking city, a type of urban area that has an over-abundance of vacated greenspaces as a result of population loss and subsequent demolition of abandoned infrastructure. As such, Cleveland represents over 350 post-industrial cities worldwide that are all promising locations for bee conservation.
   2. Across a network of 56 residential vacant lots (each similar to 30 m x 12 m), we established seven unique habitats, including seeded native prairies, to investigate how vegetation management and landscape context at a 1,500 m radius influenced urban bee communities. We assessed the distribution of several bee functional traits, diversity and abundance with pan and malaise traps. Foraging frequency was determined with plant-pollinator interaction networks derived from vacuum collections of bees at flowers.
   3. We observed higher bee richness and increased abundance of smaller sized bees as the size of surrounding greenspace patches increased within a 1,500 m radius landscape buffer. Within habitats, seeded treatments had no effect on bees but greater plant biomass and shorter vegetation were correlated with increased bee richness and abundance. Plant-pollinator interaction networks were dominated by spontaneous non-native vegetation, illustrating that this forage supports urban bees.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that proximity to larger greenspaces within an urban landscape promotes overall bee richness and increased occurrence of smaller bee species within residential vacant lots. While we did not observe our seeded native plants enhancing the bee community, native wildflowers were still establishing during the study and may have a greater influence when blooming at higher densities. Importantly, spontaneous non-native vegetation provided the majority of urban bee's forage. Thus, vacant land that is minimally managed and vegetated with what many consider undesirable 'weeds' provides valuable habitat for bee conservation in cities.

AB  - The promotion of urban biodiversity mainly relies on all kinds of urban green land, especially the green land affiliated with fragmentation and smaller dimensions that receives less attention. Based on small-scale connected urban green spaces, the construction of habitat networks is very important for biodiversity protection. Considering the importance of the habitat networks constructed by the affiliated green land with smaller dimensions to biodiversity protection, this research attempted to apply a new technique to construct a habitat network and an urban block unit structure for ecological restoration and green space biodiversity at the city-block scale. By analyzing the related ecological principles, this research extracted four design approaches: the green land habitat patch-companion method; the corresponding shape and function method; the newly increased and protective patch location method; the bunching patch substitution method; and the approaches for designing campus habitat galleries, such as the 3D greening method of narrow and long campus galleries, the method of designing a campus main road green belt, the method of designing a relaxed campus landscape green belt, the method of designing a core campus landscape green belt, the method of connecting the habitat patch node, and the method of covering habitat diversity. By comparing the network pattern indexes, determining the key habitat patches, constructing the habitat network frameworks, and improving the habitat aggregation quality, this research constructed three ideal network models for urban university campus habitats and explained the butterfly biodiversity model graphic representation, application conditions, and features. The "crosswise radiation" network was effective for ecological restoration, and the "dendritic zoning" network significantly enhanced butterfly biodiversity.

AB  - Aim Cities worldwide are characterized by unique human stressors that filter species based on their traits, potentially leading to biodiversity loss. The knowledge of which species are filtered and at which scale is important to gain a more mechanistic understanding of urban community assembly and to develop strategies to manage human impact on urban ecosystems. We investigate the ecological mechanisms shaping urban community assembly, taking into account changes across scales, taxa and urban green space types. Location City of Zurich, Switzerland. Taxon Carabid beetles and wild bees. Methods We use a large species occurrence and trait dataset with a high spatial resolution to assess the filtering effect of a medium-sized city on a regional pool of potential colonists. We then assess the filtering from the urban pool to five widely distributed types of urban green spaces. Results We found that our model city selects for functionally similar but taxonomically diverse bee and carabid beetle species from the regional species pool. Within the city, community assembly processes vary among green space types and taxa resulting in important changes in community taxonomic and functional composition. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that urban community assembly is a multi-scale process dominated by the strong environmental filtering from a regional to an urban species pool. This leads to the selection of species pre-adapted to urban conditions. Spatial habitat heterogeneity within and among UGS types can maintain an important taxonomic diversity within cities. However, increasing urban functional diversity would require stronger management efforts that consider regional ecological processes.

AB  - In recent decades, the City of Stockholm, Sweden, has grown substantially and is now the largest city in Scandinavia. Recent urban growth is placing pressure on green areas within and around the city. In order to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services, green infrastructure is part of Stockholm municipal planning. This research quantifies land-cover change in the City of Stockholm between 2003 and 2018 and examines what impact urban growth has had on its green infrastructure. Two 2018 WorldView-2 images and three 2003 QuickBird-2 images were used to produce classifications of 11 land-cover types using object-based image analysis and a support vector machine algorithm with spectral, geometric and texture features. The classification accuracies reached over 90% and the results were used in calculations and comparisons to determine the impact of urban growth in Stockholm between 2003 and 2018, including the generation of land-cover change statistics in relation to administrative boundaries and green infrastructure. For components of the green infrastructure, i.e., habitat networks for selected sensitive species, habitat network analysis for the European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus) and common toad (Bufo bufo) was performed. Between 2003 and 2018, urban areas increased by approximately 4% while green areas decreased by 2% in comparison with their 2003 areal amounts. The most significant urban growth occurred through expansion of the transport network, paved surfaces and construction areas which increased by 12%, mainly at the expense of grassland and coniferous forest. Examination of urban growth within the green infrastructure indicated that most land area was lost in dispersal zones (28 ha) while the highest percent change was within habitat for species of conservation concern (14%). The habitat network analysis revealed that overall connectivity decreased slightly through patch fragmentation and areal loss mainly caused by road expansion on the outskirts of the city. The habitat network analysis also revealed which habitat areas are well-connected and which are most vulnerable. These results can assist policymakers and planners in their efforts to ensure sustainable urban development including sustaining biodiversity in the City of Stockholm.

AB  - Freshwater communities and especially pond-breeding amphibians are extremely vulnerable to land-use change, alien species introductions and the use of pesticides or other toxic chemicals, as reflected in their worldwide decline. Effective conservation and management of ponds requires a better understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors that shape diversity patterns and species distribution, especially in cases of habitat loss
   The present study aimed to reveal and classify which pond and landscape characteristics are the most important determinants for the occurrence patterns of amphibian species as well as for the overall amphibian species richness in an urban pond network. To achieve this aim, 17 biotic and abiotic variables were measured for 61 ponds and the dataset was analysed by means of a machine-learning approach, suitability indices and co-occurrence modelling
   The highest probability of Triturus macedonicus occurrence was found at fishless artificial and semi-natural ponds. The persistence of Lissotriton graecus in ponds was predicted by high pond connectivity and the absence of fish reflecting the species dispersive potential. Pelophylax kurtmuelleri showed a higher probability of occurrence with increased pond connectivity and macrophyte cover.
   Amphibian species richness was higher in fishless ponds with well-oxygenated waters located in sites with a low to intermediate road density network. Ponds categorized as 'average' in terms of newt suitability were more frequently inhabited by fish than Triturus macedonicus. Alien fish species showed negative associations with both newt species, while both newt species showed a positive association between them.
   The results support the view that conserving a greater number of water bodies with increased landscape connectivity and without any fish presence could provide amphibian species with alternative habitat choices, especially in sites with human pressure where pond stability is at stake owing to continuous landscape changes.

AB  - Connectivity of social-ecological systems promotes resilience across urban landscapes. Community gardens are social-ecological systems that support food production, social interactions, and biodiversity conservation. We investigate how these hubs of ecosystem services facilitate socio-ecological connectivity and service flows as a network across complex urban landscapes. In three US cities (Baltimore, Chicago, New York City), we use community garden networks as a model system to demonstrate how biophysical and social features of urban landscapes control the pattern and magnitude of ecosystem service flows through these systems. We show that community gardens within a city are connected through biological and social mechanisms, and connectivity levels and spatial arrangement differ across cities. We found that biophysical connectivity was higher than social connectivity in one case study, while they were nearly equal in the other two. This higher social connectivity can be attributed to clustered distributions of gardens within neighborhoods (network modularity), which promotes neighborhood-scale connectivity hotspots, but produces landscape-scale connectivity coldspots. The particular patterns illustrate how urban form and social amenities largely shape ecosystem service flows among garden networks. Such socio-ecological analyses can be applied to enhance and stabilize landscape connectedness to improve life and resilience in cities.

AB  - Urban insect communities are structured by hierarchical filters including regional processes, human facilitation, and species interactions. We sought to inform future urban conservation endeavors by identifying how landscape composition and configuration as well as the management of vacant lot greenspaces affect native lady beetle (Coccinellidae) community structure within the city of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. We found no effect of habitat treatment on native lady beetle abundance when comparing vacant lots seeded with native wildflowers and those with naturally occurring weedy vegetation mown monthly or annually. Nonetheless, establishing conservation plantings that vary in plant height, biomass, and bloom abundance could aid in supporting a greater richness of coccinellid species, as these variables had differential effects on the abundance of fungivorous and aphidophagous feeding guilds. Further, we found that vacant lots embedded within landscapes with increased impervious surface and a high degree of greenspace isolation contained fewer aphidophagous native and exotic lady beetles. Our findings suggest that landscape context is a critical consideration when aiming to utilize vacant land as conservation habitat for coccinellids. Given their large holdings of vacant land, shrinking cities offer a unique opportunity to incorporate landscape-scale planning into future sustainable development initiatives. For instance, with over 27,000 vacant lots, the city of Cleveland could aid lady beetle conservation by electing to maintain vacant lots that promote greenspace connectivity while targeting isolated lots within intact neighborhoods for new residential development.

AB  - Urban sprawl is one of the greatest global changes with major negative impacts on biodiversity. Recent policies have acknowledged the value of urban green areas in counterbalancing such impacts. However, these policies are largely focused on public green areas, ignoring the role and potential of private green areas for urban ecological value. This paper aims at evaluating the importance of private gardens for habitat availability and connectivity in Paris, France, using the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) as model species. We hypothesize that public green areas contribute more to habitat availability than private gardens because of their large area, and that private gardens contribute more to connectivity than public green areas because of their scattered locations in the city. Using data on common pipistrelle activity and information on vegetation and building height, we quantify the respective contribution of public green areas and private gardens in the bat habitat availability and connectivity. Our results show that despite the low proportion of private green areas in Paris (36% of the total green areas), they still contributed up to 47.9% of bat habitat availability and decrease the resistance of the city matrix by 57%. The distribution in the city matrix and vegetation composition of those areas appeared especially beneficial for bat habitat availability and connectivity. The study demonstrates the importance of private gardens in the ecological value of cities in complementing public green areas. Our results confirm the need to develop more inclusive urban conservation strategies that include both public and private stakeholders.

AB  - Green-blue space loss and fragmentation are particularly acute in Chinese cities due to rapid urbanization, large ring-road system and the following city compartments. Therefore, connecting urban green-blue spaces has been recently advocated by central government. This paper revised and applied the recently developed urban green network approach to the case of Xi'an city, China, a city which has been rarely studied before from this perspective. The focus was on connecting fragments of urban green-blue spaces to compact green-blue networks, integrating both social and ecological functions into a fully functioning entity. Landscape metric analysis was added to identify that the main city outside the city core should be a planning priority zone. The Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) and humans at leisure were selected as three focal species to meet the emerged socio-ecological benefits. Sociotope and biotope maps were drawn up to identify patches with high human recreation and wildlife shelter values and providing crucial network structures. Least-cost-path model was used for identifying potential linkages between patches. This model was based on network structures and cost surface, which measures the theoretical energy cost of travelling between landscape elements. By integrating the potential paths for the selected organisms with density analysis, the updated framework generated three improvement maps for species indicators, and 10 network corridors for establishing green-blue networks at city scale. At neighbourhood scale, one site with habitat and linkage examples illustrated specific measures that could be taken in local practice.

AB  - Globally, cities are growing rapidly in size and density and this has caused profound impacts on urban forest ecosystems. Urbanization requiring deforestation reduces ecosystem services that benefit both city dwellers and biodiversity. Understanding spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation changes associated with urbanization is thus a vital component of future sustainable urban development. We used Landsat time series data for three decades from 1988 to 2018 to characterize changes in vegetation cover and habitat connectivity in the Perth Metropolitan Area, in a rapidly urbanising Australian biodiversity hotspot, as a case study to understand the impacts of urbanization on urban forests. Moreover, as golf courses are a major component in urban areas, we assessed the role of golf courses in maintaining vegetation cover and creating habitat connectivity. To do this we employed (1) land use classification with post-classification change detection, and (2) Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA). Over 17,000 ha of vegetation were cleared and the area of vegetation contributing to biodiversity connectivity was reduced significantly over the three decades. The spatial patterns of vegetation loss and gain were different in each of the three decades (1988-2018) reflecting the implementation of urban planning. Furthermore, MSPA analysis showed that the reduction in vegetation cover led to habitat fragmentation with a significant decrease in the core and bridge classes and an increase in isolated patches in the urban landscape. Golf courses played a useful role in maintaining vegetation cover and contributing to connectivity in a regional biodiversity hotspot. Our findings suggest that for future urban expansion, urban planning needs to more carefully consider the impacts of deforestation on connectivity in the landscape. Moreover, there is a need to take into consideration opportunities for off-reserve conservation in smaller habitat fragments such as in golf courses in sustainable urban management.

AB  - Urbanization results in major changes in stream morphology, hydrology, and water quality; the consequences on fish assemblage of Neotropical urban streams remain poorly understood. Due to the importance of better understanding fish assemblage responses towards urbanization in biodiversity hotspots, we evaluated the factors structuring the fish assemblages in a Neotropical mediumsized city. Additionally, we evaluated possible differences in fish diversity and biotic homogenization between the urban and control streams. To do so, fish were sampled along with physical habitat and water quality parameters in 16 urban streams in southern Brazil. Multiple regression and distance-based linear models (DistLM) were used to assess the importance of predictor variables in determining species richness and fish assemblage composition, respectively. The fish abundance rank curves were plotted to evaluate graphic differences in fish diversity between urban and control streams, while the relationship between distance and similarity (Bray-Curtis index) was used to evaluate biotic homogenization. The results revealed the importance of variables linking habitat diversity and basin connectivity to fish assemblage richness and structure. In addition, riparian vegetation was the main driver of fish assemblages, explaining 78% of abundance variation. We identified lower diversity and higher biotic homogenization in urban streams, with higher dominance of the non-native species Poecilia reticulata. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the physical and biotic variables of streams outside of water pollution levels alone. Finally, it is necessary to support urban planning practices that recover riparian vegetation, avoid canalization, and promote connectivity along stream networks as well as the removal of artificial structures in urban basins.

AB  - Reductions in genetic diversity and genetic connectivity have been documented in some predatory bird species in response to anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. The Southern Boobook (Ninox boobook) is the most common and widely-distributed owl in Australia but declines in abundance have been observed across its range. We used polymorphic microsatellite loci to investigate landscape-scale patterns of genetic variation and spatial genetic structure in boobooks from a variety of fragmented landscape types and relatively undisturbed landscape types across Western Australia. The maximum distance between collection locations of genetic samples was 1391 km. Indirect estimates of connectivity inferred from these genetic data were complemented by direct estimates of post-breeding dispersal of juvenile boobooks gathered from banding data resulting from this and other studies across Australia. We found high genetic diversity in microsatellite markers, weak spatial genetic structuring and no evidence of genetic erosion associated with inbreeding in heavily fragmented landscapes. Bayesian modelling, spatial autocorrelation analysis and principal coordinates analysis suggested a single large panmictic population across all areas sampled. Within the heavily fragmented landscape of an extensive urban area, band re-sightings and recoveries substantiate the considerable capacity of juvenile boobooks to disperse across areas far greater than the distance between patches. We hypothesise that the genetic homogeneity observed in this species is a consequence of long-distance dispersal capacity in addition to their ability as habitat and dietary generalists to make use of highly altered habitats.

AB  - Natural landscape heterogeneity and barriers resulting from urbanization can reduce genetic connectivity between populations. The evolutionary, demographic, and ecological effects of reduced connectivity may lead to population isolation and ultimately extinction. Alteration to the terrestrial and aquatic environment caused by urban influence can affect gene flow, specifically for stream salamanders who depend on both landscapes for survival and reproduction. To examine how urbanization affects a relatively common stream salamander species, we compared genetic connectivity ofEurycea bislineata(northern two-lined salamander) populations within and between streams in an urban, suburban, and rural habitat around the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. We report reduced genetic connectivity between streams within the urban landscape found to correspond with potential barriers to gene flow, that is, areas with more dense urbanization (roadways, industrial buildings, and residential housing). The suburban populations also exhibited areas of reduced connectivity correlated with areas of greater human land use and greater connectivity within a preserve protected from development. Connectivity was relatively high among neighboring rural streams, but a major roadway corresponded with genetic breaks even though the habitat contained more connected green space overall. Despite greater human disturbance across the landscape, urban and suburban salamander populations maintained comparable levels of genetic diversity to their rural counterparts. Yet small effective population size in the urban habitats yielded a high probability of loss of heterozygosity due to genetic drift in the future. In conclusion, urbanization impacted connectivity among stream salamander populations where its continual influence may eventually hinder population persistence for this native species in urban habitats.

AB  - Urbanisation threatens biodiversity globally, yet some animal populations persist within urban landscapes. Conservation of urban wildlife has prioritised parks and remnant bushland as critical habitat and neglected the role that residential gardens offer for conservation. We explored the potential for residential gardens to assist the conservation of mammals using an online questionnaire administered to residents of two case study cities in Australia to identify how widespread mammals in cities can be, which garden features promote mammal presence, and if the features varied among species with different habitat requirements. From 649 responses we found that three mammal species with different habitat requirements occurred in residential gardens throughout the city landscape. Garden features promoting mammal presence were consistent with broad ecological and habitat requirements of each species, but differed among both species and regions. Our study demonstrates that residential gardens offer a valuable habitat for mammals, and that garden features could be manipulated to promote use of gardens by these species. By considering gardens in urban planning and management actions aimed at conserving urban wildlife, residential gardens offer additional habitat to parks, roadside vegetation and urban bushland, and can play a significant role in biodiversity conservation.

AB  - A functional ecological understanding of urban wild bee communities is of growing importance especially in regard to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service maintenance and effective conservation programmes. In this paper, we review and summarize the published literature aiming to inform future research investigations in the growing field of wild bee functional ecology. Specifically, we: (1) review which functional trait-based analyses have been carried out on wild bees in cities thus far; (2) summarize which wild bee species traits have been considered; (3) evaluate any consistent wild bee trait-environment relationships (i.e. urbanization) across studies; and (4) synthesize findings and limitations to inform future research recommendations. We reviewed 48 studies based on a systematic Web of Knowledge search. We found consistent trait characteristics for 'nesting type', 'diet', 'body size', 'sociality' and 'phenology' across studies. More than one third of the studies were descriptive and the majority of studies were located in urban gardens in temperate Europe and North America, calling for more research from underrepresented geographic regions and from the entire spectrum of urban habitat types. Of these studies, only five analyzed functional diversity indices and three studies applied statistics to relate urban wild bee traits to urbanization factors. Future studies should consider trait-based statistics, and could incorporate functional trait-based ecological networks to examine network shifts across urbanization gradients. Our review suggests that we lack generalizable information about wild bee trait and urbanization relationships yet, making conservation recommendations challenging. Therefore, we propose more research that considers methodological recommendations to develop a comparable and comprehensive understanding of how urbanization affects the functional ecology of urban wild bees to link with specific urban conservation measures.

AB  - One of the major planning tools to respond to urban landscape fragmentation is the development of ecological corridors, that is, interconnected networks of urban green and blue spaces. Least-cost paths (LCP) appear to be an easy and appropriate resistance-based modelling method to respond to urban planners' needs. However, the ecological validation of urban corridors using LCP is rarely performed and needs to be generalized to different species, habitats and cities.
   We developed an experimental design to test the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts that facilitate individual movements compared to movements in less connecting landscape contexts. We deliberately assigned LCP analysis parameters based on the scientific literature and expert knowledge to test a method potentially easy to use for urban stakeholders. To extend the validation, we applied our LCP model to two biological taxa with different habitat requirements: grassland-dwelling moths and forest-dwelling passerines, and to two medium-sized cities.
   We used mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods for moths and playback recall protocols for passerines to compare the patterns of individual movement between two contrasted connectivity contexts determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. MRR protocol estimated movement rates between herbaceous patches and the two contrasted connectivity contexts. Playback recall protocol consisted in attracting individuals from wooded patches to the two contrasted connectivity contexts. A movement was considered facilitated, when displacement was rapidly engaged and individuals moved a long distance from their wooded patch.
   Moth and passerine movement patterns differed between the two connectivity contexts: moth recapture rates were higher in highly connecting contexts than in less connecting contexts. For passerine birds, responses to playback recalls were faster and movement distance longer in highly connecting contexts. All results support the hypothesis that both taxa were more prone to move in corridors modelled by LCP.
   Synthesis and applications. The convergence of the results for different biological models and across cities strengthens the relevance of LCP analysis for planning urban greenways and provides guidelines for landscape planners in the development of these corridors to favour the movement and survival of multiple urban species.

AB  - Estuaries are focal points for coastal cities worldwide, their habitats frequently transformed into engineered shorelines abutting waters with elevated nutrients in an urbanised landscape. Here we test for relationships between shoreline armouring and nutrients on the diversity and trophic composition of fish assemblages across 22 estuaries in eastern Australia. Urbanisation was associated with fish diversity and abundance, but there were differences in the effects of shoreline armouring and nutrient level on the trophic composition of fish assemblages. Fish diversity and the abundance of most trophic groups, particularly omnivores, zoobenthivores and detritivores, was greatest in highly urban estuaries. We show that estuarine fish assemblages are associated with urbanisation in more nuanced ways than simple habitat transformation would suggest, but this depends on the broader environmental context. Our findings have wider implications for estuarine conservation and restoration, emphasizing that ecological benefits of habitat measures may depend on both landscape attributes and water quality in urban settings.

AB  - As the rate of urbanization continues to increase globally, a growing body of research is emerging that investigates how urbanization shapes the movement-and consequent gene flow-of species in cities. Of particular interest are native species that persist in cities, either as small relict populations or as larger populations of synanthropic species that thrive alongside humans in new urban environments. In this study, we used genomic sequence data (SNPs) and spatially explicit individual-based analyses to directly compare the genetic structure and patterns of gene flow in two small mammals with different dispersal abilities that occupy the same urbanized landscape to evaluate how mobility impacts genetic connectivity. We collected 215 white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and 380 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) across an urban-to-rural gradient within the Providence, Rhode Island (U.S.A.) metropolitan area (population =1,600,000 people). We found that mice and bats exhibit clear differences in their spatial genetic structure that are consistent with their dispersal abilities, with urbanization having a stronger effect on Peromyscus mice. There were sharp breaks in the genetic structure of mice within the Providence urban core, as well as reduced rates of migration and an increase in inbreeding with more urbanization. In contrast, bats showed very weak genetic structuring across the entire study area, suggesting a near-panmictic gene pool likely due to the ability to disperse by flight. Genetic diversity remained stable for both species across the study region. Mice also exhibited a stronger reduction in gene flow between island and mainland populations than bats. This study represents one of the first to directly compare multiple species within the same urban-to-rural landscape gradient, an important gap to fill for urban ecology and evolution. Moreover, here we document the impacts of dispersal capacity on connectivity for native species that have persisted as the urban landscape matrix expands.

AB  - Street trees provide several ecosystem services in urban areas, including food for fauna. Tree species richness, composition and the relative abundance of native vs. non-native species can affect the populations of pollinators and dispersers. This work aims to evaluate the potential availability of food resources provided by street trees, in space and time, considering different pollination and seed dispersal syndromes at Santo Andre city (Southeastern Brazil). The georeferenced data for all catalogued tree individuals in the Urban Macrozone constituted our sampling domain. The species were categorized according to its geographical origin, pollination and seed dispersal syndromes, flowering and fruiting season. We divided the study area into cells and calculated: number of individuals, species richness, species diversity; richness and diversity of potentially flowering and fruiting individuals in each season of the year. 38,379 trees were catalogued, representing 578 trees/km(2), totalizing 230 species. Most individuals (73%) were non-native. The number of individuals, species richness and diversity varied spatially. The pollination syndrome with higher potential resources availability was melittophily (pollination by bees and wasps) has during spring whereas ornithochory (seed dispersal by birds) was the dispersal syndrome with higher potential resources availability which occurred in summer. Despite the dominance of exotic individuals, the most common syndromes are in accordance with what is expected for tropical Atlantic rainforest regions. However, some pollination and dispersal syndromes presented very low potential resource availability in different seasons and no availability in some regions. These results should be taken into account by stakeholders for a better planning of planting efforts, considering the distribution, in space and time, of the potential availability of resources provided by street trees to fauna in order to improve connectivity.

AB  - Urban areas may contain a wide range of potential habitats and environmental gradients and, given the many benefits to human health and well-being, there is a growing interest in maximizing their biodiversity potential. However, the ecological patterns and processes in urban areas are poorly understood. Using a widely applicable ecological survey method, we sampled epiphytic lichen communities, important bioindicators of atmospheric pollution, on host Quercus trees in urban parks of London, UK, to test if common patterns relating to lichen diversity are mirrored in urban green spaces. We found lichen diversity to be dependent on host species identity, and negatively related to local tree crowding. In addition, we found a strong negative effect of tree size on lichen diversity, leaving large trees as unexploited niches. A novel network analysis revealed the presence of only pioneer communities, showing the lichen communities are being held in successional stasis, likely due to the heritage effects of SO2 emissions and current nitrogen pollution and particulate emissions. Our study highlights that jointly assessing species richness, community structure and the successional stage can be key to understanding diversity patterns in urban ecosystems. Subsequently, this may help best determine the optimum conditions that will facilitate biodiversity increase within cities.

AB  - In an increasingly urbanized world, habitat fragmentation and lack of corridors among the fragmented habitats in urbanized ecosystems have compromised the survival of many species both at regional and global scale. Green corridors that connect isolated remnant habitat patches (e.g. parks) can increase connectivity and provide ecosystem services in cities. In the current study, we introduce an open-source ArcGIS toolset, the Gravity model toolbox, a programmed ArcGIS tool to map and prioritize the potential green corridors. The new toolset is based on the least-cost modelling and the improved gravity model, comprising of two script tools, the gravity model tool, and the network analysis tool. The gravity model tool can produce a spatially-explicit map of potential corridors for urban green space, as well as prioritize these corridors considering the opportunity cost. The network analysis tool is aimed at offering multiple scenarios of corridor networks based on the demands of users. To elucidate how the toolbox could be used by the urban planners and ecology researchers, a case study of the toolbox was conducted in the Tongzhou District, Beijing, China. This study presents a novel approach to assess urban connectivity and a systematic methodology for planning greening networks that connects landscape ecology with practical planning and designing considerations to maximize social and ecological functions of urban green space.

AB  - Urban areas are often considered to be a hostile environment for wildlife as they are highly fragmented and frequently disturbed. However, these same habitats can contain abundant resources, while lacking many common competitors and predators. The urban environment can have a direct impact on the species living there but can also have indirect effects on their parasites and pathogens. To date, relatively few studies have measured how fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within urban landscapes can affect parasite transmission and persistence.
   Here, we surveyed 237 greenspaces across the urban environment of Edinburgh (UK) to investigate how fine-scale variation in socio-economic and ecological variables can affect red fox (Vulpes vulpes) marking behavior, gastrointestinal (GI) parasite prevalence, and parasite community diversity.
   We found that the presence and abundance of red fox fecal markings were nonuniformly distributed across greenspaces and instead were dependent on the ecological characteristics of a site. Specifically, common foraging areas were left largely unmarked, which indicates that suitable resting and denning sites may be limiting factor in urban environments. In addition, the amount of greenspace around each site was positively correlated with overall GI parasite prevalence, species richness, and diversity, highlighting the importance of greenspace (a commonly used measure of landscape connectivity) in determining the composition of the parasite community in urban areas.
   Our results suggest that fine-scale variation within urban environments can be important for understanding the ecology of infectious diseases in urban wildlife and could have wider implication for the management of urban carnivores.

AB  - Urbanization leads to land-use changes and landscape fragmentation, impacting natural habitats and their connectivity. In principle, many local decision-makers are obliged to adopt a mitigation hierarchy whereby development projects must be designed to avoid impacts on biodiversity, reduce, and ultimately compensate for the remaining impacts to reach the goal of no net loss (NNL) of biodiversity. In practice, however, both developers and regulators lack relevant practical tools to support their strategies to better anticipate and plan this mitigation hierarchy. More importantly, the available tools generally ignore connectivity issues and ecological constraints. Here, we propose an original methodology that anticipates future urban needs under different development scenarios and selects the most relevant strategies for biodiversity offsets (BO). We used a spatialized digital simulator (called SimUrba) to model fine-scale urban dynamics, combining it with ecological networks modelling based on graph theory to assess the environmental impacts of urbanization on a habitat connectivity index for focal species. We test the different outcomes produced by adopting two offset ratios (1:1 and 2:1) using this approach. The methodology is applied to empirical data on the future urban sprawl of a large French city up to 2040 under two realistic development scenarios currently discussed by policy-makers, and on 20 species that we grouped by type of habitat. Our results reveal that that the most highly impacted species are those associated with open and semi-open areas, and cultivated plots. Then, we identify the most promising cells for BO implementation to compensate for negative effects on habitat area, according to gains in habitat connectivity. We further show that using both private and public land can maximize habitat connectivity by including larger plots and reducing the number of plots needing long-term monitoring. Finally, we demonstrate that using standard offset ratios that ignore connectivity issues is very risky and can compromise any BO objective. Overall, we show that this framework provides decision-makers with a valuable and precise strategic tool that articulates land-use planning with ecological constraints to identify whether, how and where NNL objectives can be achieved.

AB  - Urban expansion is creating environmental stressors through land use change, habitat fragmentation, and habitat loss. These stressors, along with a host of others, are driving precipitous declines in vertebrate taxa around the world. Amphibians, often requiring a narrow range of environmental conditions, can be especially susceptible to the stressors of environmental change. Despite habitat loss and degradation, some amphibian species continue to persist in altered urban landscapes. The red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one such- species and in this study, we assess how habitat patch size affects population density and genetic diversity of salamander populations in and around an urban center in Ohio, United States. Further, we examined patterns of genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity to understand gene flow between populations and tested for historic demographic bottleneck effects. Populations were sampled from 9 urban forest patches ranging in size from less than 1 ha to approximately 250 ha. There was no apparent effect of contiguous habitat patch size on salamander density nor genetic diversity, but we did observe significant genetic differentiation between 97% of pairwise population comparisons. The differentiation observed was not a result of overland distance or effective distance due to landscape resistance. There was evidence of historic bottlenecks at every site. These results suggest that density is driven by within-patch heterogeneity and that genetic diversity is affected by drivers other than patch size or contemporary population density. Our study demonstrates that red-backed salamanders can persist in wooded, urban parks, but that genetic diversity remains susceptible to demographic changes.

AB  - Ecological networks can provide insight into how biodiversity loss and changes in species interactions impact the delivery of ecosystem services. In agroecosystems that vary in management practices, quantifying changes in ecological network structure across gradients of local and landscape composition can inform both the ecology and function of productive agroecosystems. In this study, we examined natural-enemy-herbivore co-occurrence networks associated withBrassica oleracea(cole crops), a common crop in urban agricultural systems. Specifically, we investigated how local management characteristics of urban community gardens and the landscape composition around them affect (1) the abundance ofB. oleraceaherbivores and their natural enemies, (2) the natural-enemy : herbivore ratio, and (3) natural-enemy-herbivore co-occurrence network metrics. We sampled herbivores and natural enemies inB. oleraceaplants in 24 vegetable gardens in the California, USA central coast region. We also collected information on garden characteristics and land-use cover of the surrounding landscape (2 km radius). We found that increased floral richness andB. oleraceaabundance were associated with increased parasitoid abundance, non-aphid herbivore abundance, and increased network vulnerability; increased vegetation complexity suppressed parasitoid abundance, but still boosted network vulnerability. High agricultural land-use cover in the landscape surrounding urban gardens was associated with lower predator, parasitoid, and non-aphid herbivore abundance, lower natural-enemy : herbivore ratios, lower interaction richness, and higher trophic complementarity. While we did not directly measure pest control, higher interaction richness, higher vulnerability, and lower trophic complementarity are associated with higher pest control services in other agroecosystems. Thus, if gardens function similarly to other agroecosystems, our results indicate that increasing vegetation complexity, including trees, shrubs, and plant richness, especially within gardens located in intensively farmed landscapes, could potentially enhance the biodiversity and abundance of natural enemies, supporting ecological networks associated with higher pest control services.

AB  - Vacant spaces, such as unplanted, unmanaged, or infrequently accessed green roofs, may play a critical role in sustaining biodiversity in cities. Initial plant composition of these spaces likely is contingent on seed dispersal and growing medium, yet no studies have directly characterized the effects of location or growing medium depth on plant diversity of unplanted green roofs. To address this gap, we studied first-year community composition of five unplanted green roofs in New York City (NY, USA). On each roof, 12 plots were established with media depths ranging from 5 to 13 cm. Four months after installation, all plants were harvested. We observed 29 species across locations; five species were found on all five roofs, while 13 species each were observed on a single roof. Introduced species accounted for 14 of the 29 species found across roofs. Species richness and composition differed among roofs, while functional richness varied within, but not among, roofs. About 80% of the variation in species richness was accounted for by total green space in the neighborhoods within 100 to 200 m of each roof. Functional richness and plant cover increased with increased growing medium depth, as did the relative abundance of annual and forb species. Our results suggest both location and growing medium depth will affect initial community composition of unmanaged green roofs, but with differential effects on community assembly. These results also highlight the potential role of unmanaged vacant roofs as reservoirs of plant diversity, both native and invasive, in urban spaces.

AB  - The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River are imposing barriers for wildlife, and the additive effect of urban and agricultural development that dominates the lower Great Lakes region likely further reduces functional connectivity for many terrestrial species. As the climate warms, species will need to track climate across these barriers. It is important therefore to investigate land cover and bioclimatic hypotheses that may explain the northward expansion of species through the Great Lakes. We investigated the functional connectivity of a vagile generalist, the bobcat, as a representative generalist forest species common to the region. We genotyped tissue samples collected across the region at 14 microsatellite loci and compared different landscape hypotheses that might explain the observed gene flow or functional connectivity. We found that the Great Lakes and the additive influence of forest stands with either low or high canopy cover and deep lake-effect snow have disrupted gene flow, whereas intermediate forest cover has facilitated gene flow. Functional connectivity in southern Ontario is relatively low and was limited in part by the low amount of forest cover. Pathways across the Great Lakes were through the Niagara region and through the Lower Peninsula of Michigan over the Straits of Mackinac and the St. Marys River. These pathways are important routes for bobcat range expansion north of the Great Lakes and are also likely pathways that many other mobile habitat generalists must navigate to track the changing climate. The extent to which species can navigate these routes will be important for determining the future biodiversity of areas north of the Great Lakes.

AB  - Urban trails and greenspaces have become ubiquitous features in cities, in part due to their ability to provide ecological benefits to the built-up environment. A major factor in their popularity is their potential to enhance habitat connectivity by bridging the gaps between remnant patches across urbanized areas, however, information on the structure and function of greenways themselves is limited. In this study we examined how greenways serve as distinct habitats in their own right by characterizing the vegetative structure of the Capital Area Greenway (CAG) in Raleigh, NC. We conducted a systematic vegetation survey of woody vegetation along 39 km of trails (354 random plots) in 2016 and identified environmental variables related to site conditions (percent canopy cover, stream proximity, flood zones), management efforts (designated conservation areas), and local anthropogenic activities (percent impervious surface, street proximity). We preformed three types of multivariate analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS), multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP), and indicator species analysis (ISA)) to distinguish potential influences on species distribution and community structure. We observed highly diverse riparian, upland mesic, and xeric forest communities within the CAG. Results from NMS and MRPP suggested that vegetation patterns can be differentiated based on local environmental variables. Sites located in conservation areas and floodplains, for instance, were typically found at further distances from streets and were characterized by greater basal area, canopy cover, and higher non-native species richness. Individual study sites were highly diverse and varied even within similar local environments. Our findings indicate that the CAG serves as established natural habitat for native vegetation, supporting the idea that greenways can be used to enhance environmental quality in cities as ecological corridors.

AB  - Private gardens make up large parts of urban green space. In contrast to public green spaces, planning and management is usually uncoordinated and independent of municipal planning and management strategies. Therefore, the potential for private gardens to provide ecosystem services and habitat and to function as corridors for wildlife is not fully utilized. In order to improve public knowledge on gardens, as well as provide individual gardeners with information on what they can contribute to enhance ecosystem services provision, we developed a GIS-based web application for the city of Braunschweig (Germany): the 'GartenApp' (garden app). Users of the app have to outline their garden on a web map and provide information on biodiversity related features and management practices. Finally, they are asked about observations of well recognizable species in their gardens. As an output, the gardeners are provided with an estimate of the ecosystem services their garden provides, with an evaluation of the biodiversity friendliness, customized advice on improving ecosystem services provision, and results from connectivity models that show gardeners the role of their garden in the green network of the city. In this paper, we describe the app architecture and show the first results from its application. We finish with a discussion on the potential of GIS-based web applications for urban sustainability, planning and conservation.

AB  - Context The rapid urban expansion in southern coastal regions of China can endanger the quality and connectivity of bird habits and thus challenge our capacity for protecting bird species in urban areas. Identifying the ecological corridors that allow migratory birds to and from urban green landscapes is therefore essential for conserving biodiversity in urban areas. Objectives This study aimed to explore how urban expansion in vertical direction affects the flying paths of migratory birds and seek measurements to enhance bird migration to and from urban areas. Methods The ecological security pattern (ESP) for migratory birds in a coastal region near the Shenzhen city of China was determined based on three-dimensional landscape data and results were evaluated against historical eBird record abundance data. Results The positive agreement with historical bird abundance demonstrated that the consideration of three-dimensional landscape in parameterizing the resistance for ESPs can help identify the flight corridors for migratory birds in urban areas and the consequent sixteen key flight corridors with a total length of 454.78 km were identified in and around the Shenzhen city. Conclusions The three-dimensional landscape data are essential for identifying flight corridors for migratory birds to and from urban landscapes. The extracted flight corridors in and around the Shenzhen city connected natural reserves with urban parks, thereby enlarging bird habitats and its conservation inside the Shenzhen city.

AB  - Studies have suggested that the heterogeneity and arrangement of landscape structures are influential to the faunal biodiversity of environments. How does the landscape structure in agricultural landscape arrangements improve the functions of the natural ecosystem? Previous research has uncovered a great amount of information on the relationships between landscape structure and wildlife; however, for landscape designers and planners, such information is site-specific and has limited utilization. Hence, this study aimed to organize and categorize the relationships between environments and biodiversity and transfer this information into design principles in agricultural landscapes. This study attempted to integrate aspects of previous research into a systematic framework. The current study searched literature between 2007 and 2016 from the following journals: Landscape Ecology, Landscape and Urban Planning, and Journal of Applied Ecology. In all, this study collected 58 empirical studies of agricultural environments similar to that of Taiwan and revealed the valuable relationship between wildlife and agricultural environments. The outcomes reviewed from the literature were categorized by semi-natural elements and divided into six sub-categories: forests, hedgerows, grasslands, flowers, water, and heterogeneity of the natural landscape. The landscape attributes that were frequently discussed included patch number, patch area, connectivity, species richness, edge area, distance from semi-natural elements, and complexity. The landscape attributes formed by these elements were organized into a table as a checklist for designers' convenience. The checklist will help landscape planners and designers to create agricultural landscapes with integral ecosystems.

AB  - Wetlands are one of the world's most important, economically valuable, and diverse ecosystems. A major proportion of wetland biodiversity is composed of aquatic invertebrates, which are essential for secondary production in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Urban areas have intensified the challenges wetlands encounter by increasing the area of impermeable surfaces and the levels of nutrient and pollutant overflows. We investigated how urban infrastructure affects the aquatic invertebrate fauna of urban wetlands in metropolitan Helsinki, southern Finland. We measured riparian canopy cover, emergent vegetation coverage, and various land cover and road variables. Recreation area, forests, and open natural areas were the most important landscape features positively influencing aquatic invertebrate family richness, whereas buildings and roads had a negative effect on family richness and abundances of many taxa. Recreation area and the various forest types also positively affected the alpha-diversity indices of wetlands. On the other hand, fish assemblage did not affect either family richness or abundances of the studied taxa. Furthermore, trees growing on the shoreline negatively affected the diversity of aquatic invertebrate families. Invertebrate family diversity was greatest at well-connected wetlands, as these areas added to the regional species pool by over 33%. Our results show that connectivity and green areas near wetlands increase aquatic invertebrate family diversity, and our results could be utilized in urban planning.

AB  - The structure of interconnected ecological network in cities includes corridors and large green spots continuity which provides ecosystem services, e.g. biodiversity conservation. From a functional perspective, green infrastructure would be one of the most adapted ways of solving environmental issues caused by restricted vegetation in intensive urban areas with high density of gray infrastructures. In this study, green infrastructures of Hamadan with an area of about 74.22 km(2)across 75 districts, (including agricultural lands, Parks, gardens and vacant lands) were classified as Service Providing Units (SPUs). Gardens and parks classes with dense tree cover as well as high ecosystem standards, were selected as green habitat patches, including 205 patches in the study area. Considering the highest quality of habitats, 14 patches were chosen as habitat cores based on having the highest level of COHESION metric, and the area of more than 12 ha. We performed the Least Cost Path (LCP) method through QGIS software at the study area to see core habitats connectivity; using a simple algorithm to calculate the cumulative cost of moving through landscape. Results show that a total of 91 potential corridors were identified connecting the main cores. Optimal corridor selection was based on two scenarios, the shortest and the least costly route. Therefore 23 and 54 corridors were selected. By combination of two scenarios and considering the overlap of some routes, the final corridors were also identified. To keep up network connectivity, in the case of Corridor 6-9 with high costs over threshold, stepping-stones have been defined to reduce costs and distance.

AB  - Civilization built around rivers directly affects riparian corridor structure and ecology. Degradation, pollution, and deterioration along riparian corridors in urban landscapes change species composition and biodiversity. Birds are one of the most vulnerable taxa to ecological changes. The main objective of our study was to spatially compare bird species richness, abundance, and community structure along the Asar River, an urban riparian corridor in Duzce, Turkey. We identified 63 bird species, comprising 6722 individuals, and classified them into one of three groups: generalist species (11 species), woodland species (40 species), and waterbird species (12 species). Bird species richness was positively related to vegetative cover and negatively to urbanization. Richness was low in the winter and was higher during spring and summer. Riparian Quality Index (RQI) scores (mean = 54.8 +/- 33.7; max. = 97 and min. = 5) were relatively low for all sampling plots and was reduced by human activities (e.g., roads, farmland, settlement). The number of woodland bird species changed positively (r = 0.71) with RQI. The generalist bird species, adapted to urbanization, were more common around settlements and open areas. Human population and settlement around Asar River increased one-third and farmland and natural habitat decreased onefifth during the last decade. The area has high potential for growth and increased urbanization, thus increasing the pressure on the natural areas. Activities that diminish the amount of tree cover in the riparian corridor should be avoided. Habitat restoration and rehabilitation will increase RQI values, which can be used as indicators for bird richness in urban landscapes and benefit avian diversity along the riparian corridor. The existing riparian corridor and any enhancements to the corridor will help conserve Duzce's biodiversity in the future.

AB  - By the end of 2020, 75% of the Swiss population will live in cities. The urban densification will result in habitat and biodiversity loss. One solution to mitigate this loss in urban environments is the implementation of green roofs that are now recognised as a tool for the maintenance of epigeal and aerial arthropods. Green roofs can provide various services such as pollination and food supply for insects and various arthropods (e.g. arachnids) and animals (e.g. birds). The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of pollinating insects emerging from urban green roofs. Wild bees (Hymenoptera) and hoverflies (Diptera) were sampled using emergence traps on six extensive green roofs in the urban area of Geneva (Switzerland), from March to August 2017. Five species of wild bees and two species of hoverflies were identified: Lasioglossum morio (Halictidae) and Sphaerophoria scripta (Syrphidae) are the only two species considered as emerging from green roofs in our study. Ecological traits of these two species indicated generalists, well adapted to xero-thermophilic conditions.

AB  - Over 50% of the world's human population lives in cities, and the rate of urbanisation continues to increase globally. Consequences of urbanisation, such as noise pollution and land use change, impact bird communities and movement dynamics. Furthermore, cities are fragmented and heterogeneous, so it is pertinent to assess how birds respond to urbanisation at different scales. We quantified avian community composition in relation to environmental variables at 1) a city scale across an urbanisation gradient, and 2) a smaller spatial scale, within urban forest fragments. In the gradient study, species richness was highest in the peri-urban zone and declined with urbanisation. Bird density peaked at a moderate level of urbanisation, with medium housing density. Native species were more likely to be recorded where there were more shrubs and trees, less noise pollution and fewer impermeable surfaces. Within urban forest fragments, bird communities were less likely to be dominated by a few introduced species, and had high native species richness relative to counts in the urban matrix. Increased native bird richness and abundance within fragments were primarily associated with less noise and lower neighbouring human density. Differences in bird composition between the urban matrix and urban fragments suggest the matrix can be improved to facilitate the dominance of native bird species by reducing noise and adding vegetation. Understanding how birds use urban environments not only allows us to measure changes as a result of urban intensification but also allows for management of cities to improve the status of urban bird communities.

AB  - Roanoke bass (Ambloplites cavifrons) persist in five river basins in the eastern US, where they are threatened by invasive species, habitat loss and degradation, and hydrologic fragmentation. We conducted the first conservation genetic study of A. cavifrons, analyzing variation at 19 nuclear microsatellite DNA loci and the cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA gene to estimate population structure and demography, genetic relationships among populations, and the role of landscape features in regulating genetic diversity and differentiation. Most streams harbored genetically distinguishable populations, with high connectivity among reaches within streams but no contemporary dispersal among streams. In contrast, mitochondrial divergence within and among basins was weak, suggesting historically higher range-wide connectivity. Most populations exhibited small effective population sizes and evidence of past population bottlenecks. Genetic diversity correlated positively with patch size but negatively with watershed urban and agricultural development, suggesting that habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation have acted in concert to reduce population viability. Mitigating these impacts may require a combination of tactics, including restoring habitat, limiting the spread of invasive competitors, and reestablishing historical connectivity.

AB  - Seminatural habitats are declining throughout the world; thus, the role of small anthropogenic habitats in the preservation of plants is becoming increasingly appreciated. Here, we surveyed the orchid flora of roadside verges in five Central European countries (Austria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia) and tested how the surrounding landscape matrix affects the overall number of species and individuals, and also different functional groups of orchids. We found more than 2,000 individuals of 27 orchid species during our surveys. According to our results, the increasing coverage of agricultural and urban areas negatively affects both the number of orchid species and individuals on roadsides. Our study further suggests that differences in the surrounding habitats affect which species are found on roadsides, since the increasing coverage of grasslands or forested areas around orchid occurrences had a significant positive effect on the number of grassland or forest-dwelling species and individuals, respectively. Most variance in orchid numerosity and diversity was explained by the cover of the suitable habitat types of the respective taxa in the surrounding landscape of the sampling points. This highlights the importance of roadsides acting as refugia for numerous species and valuable plant communities as well as in supporting biodiversity in general.

AB  - The conversion of natural lands in urban areas is exponentially increasing worldwide, causing a major decline in biodiversity. Environmental alterations caused by urbanization, such as land conversion and isolation of natural patches, favour tolerant and generalist species, causing both species loss and replacement. In addition, selective pressure is exerted on particular functionaltraits, driving a functional homogenization or turnover of biotic communities. We sampled ground arthropods within the municipality of Turin (NW-Italy), wherein an isolated and a connected control subplot were repeatedly sampled at 15 stations distributed along a gradient of increasing urbanization. Such a nested sampling design allowed us to investigate the taxonomic and the functional responses of carabids and spiders to both the urbanization level and patch isolation. First, we highlighted the dominant role played by species homogenization (nestedness) in explaining both taxonomic and functional variation in both groups of arthropods. Secondly, we showed that urbanization causes simultaneously functional homogenization and replacement in both carabid and spider assemblages, whereas patch isolation influences carabid species composition and homogenizes and shifts spider taxonomic and functional composition. Lastly, by relating community-weighted means of body length, dispersal capacity and trophic strategy to the urbanization and isolation gradients, we demonstrated that urbanization alters the trophic structure of both taxonomic groups and increases the average dispersal capacity of spiders. On the other hand, patch isolation affected the functional composition of spiders only, reducing the body size and increasing dispersal capacity and the proportion of web-builder species. Our results demonstrate that both urbanization and patch isolation alter species composition by causing functional and taxonomic homogenization. In addition, they exert a strong filtering effect on community functional traits, increasing the proportion of phytophagous species in carabids, and increasing dispersal capacity and web-builders occurrence in spiders, while reducing spider body size.

AB  - Urbanization affects pollinator diversity and plant-pollinator networks by changing resource availability locally and in the surrounding landscape. We experimentally established (N = 12) standardized plant communities in farmland, villages, and cities to identify the relative role of local and landscape effects on plant-pollinator communities along this urbanization gradient. We found that the number of flower visits by solitary bees, but not bumblebees, was highest in cities and lowest in farmland, with villages being intermediate, whereas syrphid flies exhibited lowest numbers in cities. Villages supported the richest pollinator communities, as they appeared to benefit from both farmland and city communities. Plant-pollinator network metrics such as robustness, interaction evenness, and interaction diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, although local plant richness increased toward urban areas. In conclusion, pollinator communities were most diverse and stable in farmland and village sites, despite the high plant richness in cities. The different composition of pollinator communities along the urbanization gradient suggests considering all three landscape types for conservation schemes.

AB  - Green infrastructure in cities is considered to serve as a refuge for insect pollinators, especially in the light of an ongoing global decline of insects in agricultural landscapes. The design and maintenance of urban green spaces as key components of green infrastructure play a crucial role in case of nesting opportunities and for foraging insects. However, only few research has explored the impact of urban green space design on flower visitor communities, plant-pollinator interaction and the provision of the ecosystem service of pollination in cities. We investigated the abundance and diversity of pollinator communities in different urban park types in designed, standardized vegetation units, linked the visitation rates to the structural composition of the park types and derived indices for implemented pollination performances. The study was performed in two different structural park elements, flower beds and insect-pollinating trees. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between plants and pollinators, we calculated a plant-pollinator network of the recorded community in the investigation area. Visitation rates at different park types clearly showed, that the urban community gardens in comparison to other urban park types had a significantly higher abundance of pollinator groups, comparable to results found on a rural reference site. Tilia trees contributed significantly to the ecosystem service of pollination in investigated green spaces with a high supply of nectar and pollen during their flowering period. Calculations of pollination performances showed that recreational parks had comparably low visitation rates of pollinators and a high potential to improve conditions for the ecosystem service of pollination. The results indicated the strong potential of cities to provide a habitat for different groups of pollinators. In order to access this refuge, it is necessary to rely on near-natural concepts in design and maintenance, to create a wide range of flower diversity and to use even small green patches. Based on the findings, we encourage an integrated management of urban free spaces to consider parks as key habitats for pollinators in anthropogenic dominated, urban environments.

AB  - Urbanization is a complex process associated with environmental changes affecting many biotic and abiotic ecosystem components, which cause the alteration of biological communities, habitat features, connectivity and stability. In particular, the urbanization process is usually associated with a decrease in species richness that parallels a general increase in the overall abundance of individuals, mostly due to generalist and tolerant species taking advantage of the altered environmental conditions and outcompeting and excluding native species. We here adopted a hierarchically nested sampling design to investigate the response of ground arthropods to the combined effects of multiple facets of urbanization, namely increased impervious surface cover, temperature and patch isolation, measured at small, intermediate and large spatial scale. We studied 15 plots of 150 m in diameter located in the city of Turin (NW-Italy), along an urbanization-cover gradient ranging from suburbia to the city center. For each plot we considered the level of urbanization at three different scales (circular buffers with a 100, 400 and 1600 m radius). Within each plot, we identified a control and an isolated subplot, and in each subplot, we measured ground temperature using dataloggers and we sampled ground arthropods with pitfall traps. Firstly, by relating ground temperature and urbanization cover, we showed that temperature values reflected an Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which indicates increasing values of temperature along the urbanization gradient. This trend was particularly evident at large scale regarding daily and diurnal temperature, and at small scale regarding nocturnal temperature. Secondly, we demonstrated that different groups of ground arthropods respond differently to urbanization cover, with major effects at the largest spatial scale. Finally, we extrapolated the differential contribution of urbanization cover, UHI-effect and patch isolation to the observed activity density of the investigated taxonomic groups: Coleoptera and Hemiptera were influenced by temperature, whereas Hymenoptera, Collembola, Acari and Araneae were mainly influenced by urbanization, especially in control subplots. Our results emphasize how a multitaxonomic approach can help unravel patterns of community assembly in urban areas.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape changes resulting in habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation might decrease connectivity and effective sizes of wild populations, threatening local biodiversity. Assumed large distributions of both species and habitats have probably discouraged studies correlating altered landscapes' structure and composition to patterns of genetic diversity in the Neotropics. Yet, considering the increasingly high rates of deforestation and habitat conversion in Amazonia, investigating local and regional-scale effects of habitat conversion on Amazonian mammals is of paramount importance. Here, we use widespread, non-threatened, phyllostomid bats to understand how current forest dynamics are influencing genetic diversity patterns and functional connectivity of eastern Amazonian volant mammals. Four frugivorous species, Carollia perspicillata, Rhinophylla pumilio, Dermanura gnoma and Artibeus obscurus, were sampled across a heterogeneously fragmented region. Twelve more or less isolated rainforest remnants surrounded by urban areas, pastures, crops, secondary forests and other land uses comprise the studied landscapes, and are compared using a landscape genetics approach applied to mitochondrial DNA loci. Here, we report species-specific consequences of habitat fragmentation. Although the overall levels of genetic diversity were high, our data show that (i) population structure is heterogeneous across the altered landscapes; (ii) landscapes with higher habitat availability harbour populations with higher genetic diversity; and (iii) the populations assessed might be demographically declining.

AB  - The research of European urban flora is still based on the study of Western and Central European settlements, while relatively few data are available from the southern and eastern parts of Europe. This paper presents the first grid-based approach that surveyed the spontaneous and sub-spontaneous flora and its temporal changes of a Hungarian city located in this latter region of Europe. The changes during 70 years in the flora of a Hungarian county seat, Pecs were investigated. The contemporary city areas were used as two different study areas in the analyses. Changes in species richness, proportions of dispersal types, life form traits and alien statuses were examined during the mentioned period. With 1641 vascular plant species found at 232.88 km(2)in the last 70 years, the flora of Pecs represents a diversity hotspot within Europe. In contrast with other European cities we found significant (19.37%) increase in the number of species over the last 70 years. As a result of temporal changes in the city flora, differnces were found only in the case of neophytes' life forms regardless of the spatial approach. Similar to the other cities globally the number of woody species neophytes and short-lived alien plants increased.

AB  - 'Wildlife-friendly' gardening is a dominant theme in the media that readily engages public attention. However, there is little empirical evidence of the ecological benefits of increased habitat quality of individual domestic gardens. This study uses light-trapping to examine the response of moth assemblages to domestic gardens that are assessed in terms of their habitat complexity (simple and complex) both within the garden and extending out to a 30 m radius that includes surrounding habitats. The results clearly show that moth assemblages were influenced by complex habitats (particularly increasing levels of the variable shrubs and decreasing levels of artificial surfaces), but only at a scale that extended beyond the garden boundary to include the surrounding area. In other words, neither the complexity of the habitat within the garden or the size of the garden had any influence on the abundance or diversity of the moth assemblage. These results have implications for both garden management and landscape planning - if domestic gardens are to be a useful component of strategies to reduce biodiversity loss within the urban environment then they should provide good habitat quality and be managed as a network of interconnected patches rather than as individual units.

AB  - Under the background of urban expansion, ecological protection cannot be delayed. The construction of ecological networks is of considerable significance to ecosystem services. However, in the process of constructing a corridor network, there is no uniform standard for the selection of ecological sources and the determination of cost factors. The InVEST model is an effective complement to ecosystem service assessment for sensitively measuring external threats and their threat intensity. Therefore, taking Wuhan as an example, we combined InVEST and the least cost path model (LCP) to construct a multi-target corridor network with comprehensive cost factors for birds and small terrestrial mammals. The results showed that: (1) The InVEST model provided a reliable basis for ecological source screening by demonstrating the distribution of habitat quality. (2) The corridor with a length of 12-25 km presented a "U" shape, and the impact of urbanization on small terrestrial mammals was more significant than that of birds. (3) The integrated network pattern proposed by the "point-line-plane" principle would provide a reference for urban ecological construction and sustainable development.

AB  - In recent years, the high-speed urbanization process and human activities have led to the fragmentation and the connectivity reduction of natural landscape patches, resulting in the degradation of urban ecological services and biodiversity. The construction of ecological network and the optimization of landscape pattern are significantly important to improve the urban ecological environment and urban ecological security. In this paper, a case study of Haikou, an island city of China is performed, the selection of ecological source areas is optimized by granularity reverse method and principal component analysis. The minimum cumulative resistance model (MCRM) is used to construct the ecological resistance surface, and ecological corridors and ecological nodes are obtained, so as to optimize the urban ecological network and the connectivity of landscape patches. The results show that the 1400m granularity landscape component is the optimal landscape component structure for Haikou. There are 38 ecological source areas in Haikou, and 14 ecological landscape patches need to be added. The distribution of ecological source areas is mainly affected by topography and geomorphology. The northwest has huge and scattered ecological source areas, while the southeast has small and concentrated ecological source areas. In the areas around Meilan airport and Hongcheng lake, there is an ecological trap with significant difference between dominant and recessive ecological resistance separately. Haikou ecological network consists of 81 ecological corridors and 76 ecological nodes. Affected by the main urban area in the north, Haikou ecological network has the high density in the middle and southern areas. The construction of ecological network has significantly improved the overall connectivity of the ecosystem in the study region. This research provides a scientific basis for the future urban ecological environment planning of Haikou.

AB  - We introduce a conceptual model of the urban forest patch as a complex social-ecological system, incorporating cross-scale interactions. We developed this model through an interdisciplinary process engaging social and ecological scientists and urban land management decision makers, with a focus on temperate forest social-ecological systems. In this paper, we place the production and management of urban forest patches in historical perspective, present a conceptual model of urban forest patches within a broader regional context, and identify a series of research questions to highlight future directions for research on urban forest patches. This conceptual model identifies how spatial and temporal social-ecological drivers interact with patch-level conditions at multiple scales. Our integrative approach can provide insights into the role of social-ecological drivers in shaping forest health, biodiversity, and benefits forest patches provide to people in urban and urbanizing regions, with direct implications for decision-making to improve management outcomes.

AB  - The increasing scale of urbanization and human activities has resulted in the fragmentation of natural habitats, leading to the reduction of ecological landscape connectivity and biodiversity. Taking Nanping as the study area, the core areas with good connectivity were extracted as ecological sources using a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and landscape connectivity index. Then the ecosystem service functions of the ecological sources were evaluated based on the InVEST model. Finally, we extracted the potential ecological corridor based on the land type, elevation and ecosystem service functions. The results showed that the ecological source with higher landscape connectivity is distributed in the north and there are clear landscape connectivity faults in the northern and southern regions. Moreover, the areas with high habitat quality, soil retention and water production are mainly distributed in the northern ecological source areas. The 15 potential ecological corridors extracted were distributed unevenly. Among them, the important ecological corridors formed a triangle network, while the general ecological corridors were concentrated in the northwest. Therefore, it is suggested that the important core patches in the north be protected, and the effective connection between the north and south be improved. These results can provide a scientific basis for ecological construction and hierarchical management of the ecological networks.

AB  - While for most of a landscape, urbanization leads to a significant habitat loss, rivers in urban areas are usually maintained or developed for their drainage function. Rivers are often the most important biophysical and ecological connection of cities with their surrounding ecosystems, although usually heavily altered due to urban impacts. For the conservation of urban rivers as ecological corridors, it is important to assess the impact of typical urban threats on habitat quality. In this study, we used the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Trade-offs) habitat quality model to assess the individual and combined impacts of built-up areas, first- and second-order road and water pollution from urban drainage, and wastewater discharge on habitat quality within a 200 m wide river corridor. The Pochote River in Leon, Nicaragua, was used as a case study. Our results show the spatial distribution and magnitude of the individual threat impacts, as well as the respective contribution of each threat to the overall impact of urbanization on the habitat quality within the river corridor. While close to the city center, all threats almost equally contributed to severe habitat degradation, while further downstream, an individual threat influence became more distinct with only water pollution having a consistent negative impact. We concluded that the InVEST habitat quality model can be used to assess the impact of typical urban threats on habitat quality in river corridors at a high spatial resolution. The results can help to improve urban planning and development to improve habitat conservation along urban rivers.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the agents that contribute most to habitat fragmentation and is therefore a threat to biodiversity conservation. Connectivity improvement is the adaptation strategy most often cited to address species conservation in a changing environment.
   Many studies of protection at local and regional level zones usually show separate portions of habitat, defining the protected area, but they do not provide guidance on where and how to act to preserve the habitat quality and connectivity of the populations, on a consistent scale with planning units.
   In this paper, the analysis of fragmentation-connectivity focuses on cereal steppes of the Jarama and Henares rivers (Spain) to study the habitat and connectivity of steppic birds populations into protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, quantifying the effect on this protected area and on the species of interest caused by the massive development of infrastructure and urbanization due to the expansion of Madrid metropolitan area. In this sense, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) was used as a bioindicator, due to its high demand for habitat quality.
   The proposed methodology only needs to be based on data from wildlife sightings and land use. Once the variables (density, biophysics and urbanization) were defined, it was possible to determine the values of influence, applying them to generate the map of areas of probability of presence and movement of the Great Bustard. This can be used to support conservation plans based on habitat connectivity.

AB  - Animal movement can be significantly altered in human-dominated landscapes such as urban and peri-urban areas, where habitat is often fragmented and/or linear. Knowledge regarding how wildlife respond to anthropogenic change is vital for informing conservation efforts in such landscapes, including the design of nature reserves and wildlife corridors. To better understand how threatened species persist and behave within human-dominated landscapes, we examined the home range and space use of the nationally endangered southern brown bandicootIsoodon obesulus obesulusin peri-urban Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city. Specifically, we examined whether: (1) bandicoots were confined to linear strips of remnant vegetation or also made use of the broader highly modified landscape matrix; (2) the configuration of the linear vegetated strips affected home range shape; and (3) home range area differed between bandicoots living in linear strips and those in larger remnant habitat patches. We found that: (1) 71% of adult males and 33% of adult females used the matrix, but non-dispersing juveniles were entirely confined to the linear strips; males also travelled greater distances into the matrix (away from the vegetated strips) than females; (2) bandicoots had longer home ranges in narrower strips and males had longer home ranges than females; and (3) home range area for both sexes was smaller in linear strips than has been recorded in other studies in larger remnant habitats. Our study highlights the importance of retaining narrow, fragmented and modified vegetation to accommodate threatened biodiversity within human-dominated landscapes, but suggests the surrounding matrix may also offer important resources for adaptable species, such as bandicoots. Supporting off-reserve conservation of biodiversity in novel ecosystems is increasingly pertinent in our rapidly urbanizing world.

AB  - The importance of large reserves has been long maintained in the scientific literature, often leading to dismissal of the conservation potential of small reserves. However, over half the global protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are <100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50%) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be included in conservation planning.

AB  - Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla) populations have persisted despite urban and rural development throughout the species' range; yet it is possible thatP. regilla, like other anurans with which it historically co-occurred, will become extirpated from cities and suburbs if urbanization intensifies as predicted. An improved understanding of the conditions that enable this species to persist in developed landscapes is needed to identify and conserve suitable habitats. We investigated species-habitat relationships forP. regillain a mixed urban-rural landscape in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to identify potential criteria for habitat suitability. We conducted repeat auditory surveys of chorusing males at 52 potential breeding wetlands and modeled occupancy at 26 of these sites using local and landscape variables representing competing hypotheses and spatial scales of influence. The models that best explainedP. regillaoccupancy included a combination of terrestrial habitat and connectivity factors and the presence of non-native predators. We found that the proportion of impervious cover within 250 m of a wetland had the strongest negative impact on occupancy. Our findings suggest that availability of terrestrial habitat adjacent to breeding sites is the primary driver of species presence in the developed landscape. Conservation efforts should seek to limit impervious cover to less than 20% within a 250-m buffer around breeding wetlands. Further, restored and created wetlands in urban and rural areas may be more likely to supportP. regillaif they are designed with a seasonal hydroperiod that excludes non-native aquatic predators and are placed in an area of high pond density.

AB  - The increasing expansion of the urban environment has been considered one of the causes of biodiversity loss. Due to the decrease of the quantity and quality of habitats, this process causes the restriction of organisms to sometimes-specific microhabitats. The patterns of variation of the biodiversity along the environmental gradients, however, are still poorly understood. This study evaluated how urban gradients affect the diversity, specific composition and frequency of guild of the community of butterflies. Butterflies were collected in three transects continuously traversing the urban, rural and preserved habitats using baited traps and by active sampling. We found that the urban gradient acts as an environmental filter in the butterfly communities, reducing the richness and frequency of guilds of frugivorous butterflies, structuring the community through turnover, but without effects in the abundance. This study shows the importance of the urban gradients approach in the butterfly community and its applicability in the management of urban areas in order to include native vegetation along the gradients, aiming at increasing environmental heterogeneity, to preserve butterflies and maintain the ecosystem services and network interactions in altered landscapes.

AB  - Context Ecological communities in urban ecosystems are assembled through ecological processes, such as species interactions, dispersal, and environmental filtering, but also through human factors that create and modify the landscape. These complex interactions make it difficult to untangle the relationships between social-ecological dynamics and urban biodiversity.
   Objectives As a result, there has been a call for research to address how human activities influence the processes by which ecological communities are structured in urban ecosystems. We address this research challenge using core concepts from landscape ecology to develop a framework that links social-ecological dynamics to ecological communities using the metacommunity perspective.
   Methods The metacommunity perspective is a useful framework to explore the assembly of novel communities because it distinguishes between the effects of local environmental heterogeneity and regional spatial processes in structuring ecological communities. Both are shaped by social-ecological dynamics in urban ecosystems. Results In this paper, we define social, environmental, and spatial processes that structure metacommunities, and ultimately biodiversity, in cities. We then address how our framework could be applied in urban ecosystem research to understand multi-scalar biodiversity patterns.
   Conclusions Our framework provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for transdisciplinary research to examine how social-ecological dynamics mediate the assembly of novel communities in urban ecosystems.

AB  - Urban ecosystems can host a considerable amount of biodiversity because of the varying habitats created during urban development processes. Spontaneous vegetation is a neglected element of urban biodiversity, and the roles of a city's natural floristic resources, geomorphic features, and topographic characteristics in shaping spontaneous plant diversity patterns have not been fully clarified. We explored the impact of urban growth and elevation and slope on the diversity patterns of urban spontaneous plant communities in a mountainous city in southwest China. We recorded 279 species belonging to 210 genera and 70 families, with native species accounting for about 85% of the urban spontaneous plants. The magnitude of urban growth and elevation were the most important drivers and they were positively correlated with the gamma-diversity patterns in Chongqing. Thus, both urban forms and the city's natural conditions are important in affecting the urban biodiversity patterns. Furthermore, urban spontaneous plant communities in Chongqing metropolis were mainly dominated by a few widespread, cosmopolitan species, with nearly 50% of the 279 species we recorded being narrowly distributed and rarely occurring species. The distribution of the rare, spontaneous species may be highly dependent on chance dispersal, the legacies of earlier land-use, and the availability of specific habitats. We propose that urban construction and landscape design should maintain appropriate configurations for the habitat type to preserve rarely occurring plant species to increase biodiversity in urban landscapes.

AB  - Urbanization is changing Earth's ecosystems by altering the interactions and feedbacks between the fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes that maintain life. Humans in cities alter the eco-evolutionary play by simultaneously changing both the actors and the stage on which the eco-evolutionary play takes place. Urbanization modifies land surfaces, microclimates, habitat connectivity, ecological networks, food webs, species diversity, and species composition. These environmental changes can lead to changes in phenotypic, genetic, and cultural makeup of wild populations that have important consequences for ecosystem function and the essential services that nature provides to human society, such as nutrient cycling, pollination, seed dispersal, food production, and water and air purification. Understanding and monitoring urbanization-induced evolutionary changes is important to inform strategies to achieve sustainability. In the present article, we propose that understanding these dynamics requires rigorous characterization of urbanizing regions as rapidly evolving, tightly coupled human-natural systems. We explore how the emergent properties of urbanization affect eco-evolutionary dynamics across space and time. We identify five key urban drivers of change-habitat modification, connectivity, heterogeneity, novel disturbances, and biotic interactions-and highlight the direct consequences of urbanization-driven eco-evolutionary change for nature's contributions to people. Then, we explore five emerging complexities-landscape complexity, urban discontinuities, socio-ecological heterogeneity, cross-scale interactions, legacies and time lags-that need to be tackled in future research. We propose that the evolving metacommunity concept provides a powerful framework to study urban eco-evolutionary dynamics.

AB  - The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is declining in large parts of Europe but populations in some German cities remained so far unaffected by this decline. The question arises of how urbanization affects patterns of population genetic variation and differentiation in German rabbit populations, as urban habitat fragmentation may result in altered meta-population dynamics. To address this question, we used microsatellite markers to genotype rabbit populations occurring along a rural-to-urban gradient in and around the city of Frankfurt, Germany. We found no effect of urbanization on allelic richness. However, the observed heterozygosity was significantly higher in urban than rural populations and also the inbreeding coefficients were lower, most likely reflecting the small population sizes and possibly on-going loss of genetic diversity in structurally impoverished rural areas. Global FST and G(ST)'-values suggest moderate but significant differentiation between populations. Multiple matrix regression with randomization ascribed this differentiation to isolation-by-environment rather than isolation-by-distance. Analyses of migration rates revealed asymmetrical gene flow, which was higher from rural into urban populations than vice versa and may again reflect intensified agricultural land-use practices in rural areas. We discuss that populations inhabiting urban areas will likely play an important role in the future distribution of European rabbits.

AB  - Understanding the contribution of cities to nature conservation is gaining increasing importance with a globally accelerating urbanization and requires insights into the mechanisms that underlie urban distribution patterns. While a considerable number of endangered plant species have been reported for cities, the spatial dependence of populations of these species on natural remnants versus anthropogenic ecosystems is critically understudied due to deficiencies in population distribution data. To which extent endangered species in anthropogenic ecosystems spatially rely on natural remnants is thus an open question. We used a unique dataset of 1,742 precisely mapped populations of 213 endangered plant species in the city of Berlin and related these point data to habitat patches that had been assigned to natural remnants, hybrid ecosystems and novel ecosystems according to the novel ecosystem approach. By applying point pattern analyses (Ripley's K function, cross K function, cross pair correlation function) we unraveled the spatial dependence of the populations toward the different ecosystem types. Moreover, we tested how plant traits related to plant strategy and dispersal filter for species occurrence across ecosystems. Differentiating populations on anthropogenic sites revealed that populations in hybrid ecosystems spatially depended on natural remnants, but populations in novel ecosystems (i.e. more than a third of all populations) surprisingly didn't. A conditional inference tree showed that endangered plant species in novel ecosystems are filtered for ruderal strategy type and wind dispersal syndrome, while competitive and stress-tolerant species were mainly confined to natural remnants. Our results highlight the importance of conserving natural remnants as habitats and seed sources of endangered plants. Yet novel urban ecosystems can support many populations of endangered plant species beyond the adjacency to natural remnants, with hybrid ecosystems likely acting as stepping stones. This indicates a specific contribution of urban ecosystems to biodiversity conservation. Since different filters modulate the species pools of different ecosystem types, novel urban ecosystems are not supposed to substitute fully the habitat functions of natural remnants. Our study thus highlights promising opportunities for involving the total range of urban ecosystem types into urban conservation approaches.

AB  - Green areas drawn on a city plan represent open spaces that have different meanings for humans and wildlife. Diverse kinds of green may influence species viability in urban environments. It is necessary to understand what those areas mean for wildlife populations and how land-use changes affect habitats and movements for making scientifically defensible planning and design decisions. My objective was to demonstrate how open space and urban development patterns affect the viability of wildlife populations in urbanizing landscapes from a movements perspective. Eight scenarios for 2060 for an urbanizing area near Portland, Oregon combined four open space (none, corridors, parks, and network) with two urban development patterns (compact and dispersed). Dispersal model HexSim simulated three target species - Red-legged frog (Rana aurora aurora), Western meadowlark (Sturnella neclecta) and Douglas squirrel (Tamasciurus douglasii) - movements on those scenarios to compare and contrast sustained populations to the ca. 2010 baseline landscape. Network scenarios presented the largest number of frog breeders. Greenway scenarios showed the largest populations of squirrels. Park and network scenarios sustained viable populations of meadowlarks, but park scenarios performed best. Compact development scenarios performed best for most indicators, while dispersed development scenarios performed better for meadowlarks. Network scenarios performed best when considering the collective of species. Networks presented more diverse habitats, sustaining higher diversity of species. For plans to sustain more species, more comprehensive and diverse habitats must be promoted, otherwise trade-offs should be expected - like the extinction of meadowlarks in greenway scenarios.

AB  - Species with high mobility may have low genetic differentiation among populations due to historical long-distance dispersal, but recent studies show that bat dispersal may be affected by habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we analyze the effects of landscape contemporary changes and dynamics in paleodistribution during the Quaternary on genetic diversity and differentiation in the Pallas' long-tongued bat, Glossophaga soricina. We sampled 18 populations in landscapes with different land cover, and used nine microsatellite loci and the sequence of a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (CYB) to obtain genetic data. We performed ecological niche modelling and used general linear mixed models and optimization of multiple resistance surfaces to analyze how landscape structure and climatic suitability affect genetic diversity and differentiation. Our results show that the conversion of natural vegetation, such as forests and savannas, to agriculture, pastures or urban matrices (unsuitable habitats) decreases genetic diversity and increases inbreeding, but has no effect on genetic differentiation among populations, that was likely affected by spatial distance. Our findings point to the importance of maintenance of large areas of natural vegetation remnants to conserve genetic diversity of G. soricina, an important bat pollinator in the Neotropics.

Anthropogenic activities in urban areas can strongly affect aquatic biodiversity by modifying aquatic landscape and reduce habitat heterogeneity. As one of the key components in reservoir ecosystems, zooplankton is sensitive to such habitat changes. Within the metacommunity framework, we predict that in an urbanized landscape: (1) species sorting becomes the most important process in determining the variation of zooplankton communities; (2) urbanization will result in low beta-diversity and biotic homogenization of zooplankton communities and such homogenization will not significantly vary across time. To test these predictions, we investigated twenty five permanent reservoirs over three hydrological seasons in a well-developed and rapidly expanding city in tropical China. The reservoirs were grouped into two location classes and three storage size classes. Our results suggested that the structure of zooplankton communities were strongly homogenized in the studied urban reservoirs as being reflected in the low beta-diversity between the two location classes. However, high beta-diversity was found within each storage size class, mainly derived from species turnover (beta(sim)). The high beta-diversity indicated that the variation of zooplankton community is a consequence of environmental heterogeneity within each storage size class. Variation partitioning revealed a weak spatial structure for zooplankton communities at the large scale, while only Chla as an indicator of food supply significantly explained high community variation among reservoirs in the dry season, but not in wet and transition seasons despite apparent species seasonal succession.

AB  - Urbanization may restrict, facilitate, or have no effect on gene flow, depending on the organism and extent of urbanization. In human commensals, with high dispersal ability, urbanization can facilitate gene flow by providing continuous suitable habitat across a wide range. Additionally, suburban or rural areas with lower human population density may act as a barrier to gene flow for these human commensals. Spatial population genetic approaches provide a means to understand genetic connectivity across geographically expansive areas that encompass multiple metropolitan areas. Here, we examined the spatial genetic patterns of feral pigeons (Columba livia) living in cities in the eastern United States. We focused our sampling on the Northeastern megacity, which is a region covering six large cities (Boston, Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC). We performed ddRAD-Seqon 473 samples, recovered 35,200 SNPs, and then used multiple evolutionary clustering analyses to investigate population structuring. These analyses revealed that pigeons formed two genetic clusters-a northern cluster containing samples from Boston and Providence and a southern cluster containing all other samples. This substructuring is possibly due to reduced urbanization across coastal Connecticut that separates Boston and Providence from New York and mid-Atlantic cities. We found that pairs of pigeons within 25 km are highly related (Mantel r = 0.217, p = .001) and that beyond 50 km, pigeons are no more related than they would be at random. Our analysis detected higher-than-expected gene flow under an isolation by distance model within each city. We conclude that the extreme urbanization characteristic of the Northeastern megacity is likely facilitating gene flow in feral pigeons.

AB  - Tropical Pacific island countries, many of which are less-developed, are experiencing invasions of alien plant species at rates faster than areas of comparable size elsewhere. In this paper we examine the relationship between the presence, abundance, and richness of 14 invasive woody plant (IWP) species and level of urbanization and road type in the Greater Suva Urban Area (GSUA), Fiji. One hundred and fifty-four sample locations within a 29 km transect traversing urban, peri-urban and rural land sectors on local, collector and arterial roads were surveyed. We analyzed the 14 species for frequency of occurrence across the urban-rural gradient and found spatial patterns of IWP presence differed by species. We analyzed the abundance of seven species using multi-variable regression and found abundance was more often influenced by urban-rural sector than road type, though road type had a significant effect for some species. We conclude by offering plausible explanations for differences attributed to modes of dispersal, introduction history and human activities. We include supplementary material providing detailed characterization of biology, ecology, and history of the 14 target species. These findings are expected to help inform risk assessments and management of IWP in other tropical urban-rural gradients, and especially small island developing states.

AB  - Mitigating the impact of invasive species is a global conservation challenge, which requires an understanding of the factors that drive the distribution, abundance, and ecological interactions of invaders. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are a widespread and abundant invasive omnivore in Australia. They are common in dunes and coastal areas that abut marine shorelines, which provide abundant food resources in the form of carrion. They are considered a key threatening process to Australia's biodiversity. The global literature posits that foxes use a broad mix of habitats, leading to an expectation of few consistent associations of foxes with landscape attributes and human uses of beaches and coastal dunes - this is the fundamental hypothesis tested here.
   Fox distribution was comprehensively mapped in Eastern Australia (108 km of shoreline, 192 sites, 6900 h of wildlife camera footage) and related (general additive models) to a range of potential drivers (e.g. topographic features, habitat types, urbanisation, connectivity, dogs, fox removal) on ocean beaches.
   Notwithstanding the catholic nature of red foxes elsewhere, here we show that habitat use by red foxes along ocean beaches is not indiscriminate: more foxes occur on beaches backed by high dunes and large expanses of natural vegetation. Conversely, significantly fewer foxes occur where natural dune habitats have been lost to urban areas. Fox removal did not affect fox distributions.
   Foxes are functionally important carnivores in coastal landscapes, and their disjunct distribution demonstrated by us suggests a spatially heterogeneous functional signal in coastal food-webs. More broadly, sandy beach ecosystems, interspersed by urban development, dominate many coasts, offering a rich bio-geographic tapestry to test how models of fox habitat choice articulate into invasive species management and food-web interactions.

AB  - The biodiversity loss resulting from rising levels of human impacts on ecosystems has been extensively discussed over the last years. The expansion of urban areas promotes drastic ecological changes, especially through fragmentation of natural areas. Natural grassland remnants surrounded by an urban matrix are more likely to undergo disturbance events. Since grassland ecosystems are closely related to disturbances such as fire and grazing, grassland plant communities, pollinators, and their interaction networks may be especially sensitive to urban expansion, because it promotes habitat fragmentation and modifies disturbance regimes. This work evaluated the effect of the level of urbanization and recent history of fire disturbance on grassland plants communities and plant-floral visitor mutualistic networks. We sampled plant communities and floral visitors in 12 grassland sites with different levels of urbanization and time since the last fire event. Sites with higher levels of urbanization showed higher values for plant species richness, floral visitor richness, and network asymmetry. All sampled networks were significantly nested (with one exception), asymmetric, and specialized. In addition, all networks presented more modules than expected by chance. The frequency of fire disturbance events increased with the level of urbanization. Since grassland ecosystems depend on disturbances to maintain their structure and diversity, we inferred that the history of fire disturbance was the mechanism behind the relationship between urbanization and our biological descriptors. Our findings highlight the importance of small and isolated grassland remnants as conservation assets within urban areas, and that the disturbance events that such sites are submitted to may in fact be what maintains their diversity on multiple levels.

AB  - Vegetated green infrastructure (GI) is used as a sustainable complement to traditional stormwater infrastructure in many cities and is reported to provide additional benefits such as heat island mediation, crime reduction, increased property values, improved air quality, improved human well-being, improved aesthetics, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. However, we hypothesize that the simultaneous provisioning of multiple benefits - multifunctionality - is not guaranteed yet may be achieved by planning two critical components of GI: the spatial placement of GI within a city and the traits of the plant species used to vegetate GI. We propose the Green Infrastructure Space and Traits (GIST) model, a new planning tool for evaluating and maximizing GI multifunctionality based on optimizing both site selection and plant traits in GI design to promote urban planning with higher sustainability and benefits to humans. GIST involves identifying priority areas for GI placement and using plant species with traits that maximize benefits and multifunctionality in priority areas. As a case study, we apply GIST to Philadelphia, USA, and identify new locations for GI and plant traits that would increase multifunctionally across the city. For the nine benefits we examined, GIST indicates high potential for multifunctionality for the Philadelphia GI system. An assessment of the GI planning in Philadelphia to date indicates that the actualization of this multifunctionality has not been fully realized and could be improved with strategic GI placement and plant species selection. Further, we identified a cluster of correlated benefits which may be a common pathway for multifunctionality across cities. Overall, our work supports the hypothesis that multifunctional GI is possible when proper planning tools that integrate spatial placement and plant traits are used.

AB  - The rapid expansion of urban land across the globe presents new and numerous opportunities for invasive species to spread and flourish. Ecologists historically rejected urban ecosystems as important environments for ecology and evolution research but are beginning to recognize the importance of these systems in shaping the biology of invasion. Urbanization can aid the introduction, establishment, and spread of invaders, and these processes have substantial consequences on native species and ecosystems. Therefore, it is valuable to understand how urban areas influence populations at all stages in the invasion process. Population genetic tools are essential to explore the driving forces of invasive species dispersal, connectivity, and adaptation within cities. In this review, we synthesize current research about the influence of urban landscapes on invasion genetics dynamics. We conclude that urban areas are not only points of entry for many invasive species, they also facilitate population establishment, are pools for genetic diversity, and provide corridors for further spread both within and out of cities. We recommend the continued use of genetic studies to inform invasive species management and to understand the underlying ecological and evolutionary processes governing successful invasion.

AB  - Fundamental ideas concerning urbanization are primarily based on studies performed in large cities. It is of interest to study whether or not similar phenomena take place in smaller cities. Small cities are an inherent component of urbanization, and in the future, the majority of globalization is expected to occur in small and mid-sized cities. Understanding the effects of small cities on landscape structures is, therefore, an essential component in planning city land expansion. Accordingly, this study focused on six towns of the Oromia Special Zone Surrounding Finfinnee, Ethiopia, which is broadly known to be experiencing dramatic growth. Time-series Landsat images from 1987 to 2019 with an integrated method, landscape metrics, and built-up density analysis were employed to characterize and compare the dynamics of landscape structures, urban expansion patterns, process, and overall growth status in the towns. The results highlight that all the towns experienced accelerated growth in the built-up areas and highly scattered nature in spatial growth. Landscape ecology analysis confirmed a highly fragmented urban landscape, a significant loss of natural land covers, and disconnected and complicated agro-vegetation patches in all towns, suggesting a lack of rigorous implementation of the master plan. Results also indicated that the Oromia Special Zone surrounding Finfinnee has failed to control urban sprawl to surrounding ecological sensitive areas. The study results, more broadly, highlight that the small cities would have a limited physical and demographic footprint and relatively less contribution to the national economic agglomeration; nonetheless, they can have a notable and important impact in terms of their ecological and environmental influence. Hence, the study suggests policies for monitoring such dynamics and protecting agro-environmental connectivity with particular focus on the small cities.

AB  - Could past land uses, and the land cover changes carried out, affect the current landscape capacity to maintain biodiversity? If so, knowledge of historical landscapes and their socio-ecological transitions would be useful for sustainable land use planning. We constructed a GIS dataset in 10 x 10 km UTM cells of the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) for 1956 and 2009 with the changing levels of farming disturbance exerted through the human appropriation of photosynthetic net primary production (HANPP), and a set of landscape ecology metrics to assess the impacts of the corresponding land-use changes. Then, we correlated them with the spatial distribution of total species richness (including vascular plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals). The results allow us to characterize the main trends in changing landscape patterns and processes, and explore whether a land-use legacy of many complex agroforest mosaics maintained by the intermediate farming disturbance managed in 1956 could still exist, despite the decrease or disappearance of those mosaics before 2009 due to the combined impacts of agroindustrial intensification (meaning higher HANPP levels), forest transition (meaning lower HANPP levels) and urban sprawl. Statistical analysis reveals a positive impact of the number of larger, less disturbed forest patches, where many protected natural sites have been created in 1956-2009. However, it also confirms that this result has not only been driven by conservation policies and that the distribution of species richness is currently correlated with the maintenance of intermediate levels of HANPP. This suggests that both land-sharing and land-sparing approaches to biodiversity conservation may have played a synergistic role owing to the legacy of complex land cover mosaics of former agricultural landscapes that are now under a serious threat.

AB  - Urban areas are increasing globally causing fragmentation and loss of habitats for many forest dwelling species. At the same time new habitats are created, which may be exploited by species with a broad ecological tolerance. Bats form the largest mammal group living in cities in Central Europe. Species diversity might be higher in some cities compared to rural areas. Yet, habitat-specialists struggle with rapid landscape change and urban development. The Bechstein's bat Myotis bechsteinii is dependent on old growth deciduous forests that supply tree cavities to roost in. The use of small home ranges requires high prey abundance around roosts. Despite their habitat specialization we identified two Bechstein's maternity colonies within the metropolitan area of Frankfurt/Main (Germany). The colonies numbered 25 and 31 adult females respectively. We radio tracked individuals from both colonies (n = 14) and compared their habitat use to that of females (n = 79) of 11 colonies from rural woodlands. We identified a total of 29 roosts used by the two maternity colonies during summer. Roost choice of the urban forest colonies was similar to the rural forest colonies with a preference for oak trees with woodpecker holes. The distances between roosts were similar between urban and rural colonies. Habitat selection was strongly towards old forest patches. We emphasize the importance of the persistence of old forest islands within urban areas to support remaining bat colonies with a network of bat areas, similar to the important bird areas (IBAs). Specialized species that fail to adapt to the rapid changes may survive within the urban environment relying on old forest patches.

AB  - The structure of terrestrial landscapes is commonly viewed as a problem of statistical description defined by the number, size and distance between habitat patches. Yet, for organisms living in that landscape, structure may be perceived very differently depending on the dispersal capacity of the organism of concern-large animals may perceive a highly fragmented forest as a single patch if adjacent forest patches are sufficiently close, while small animals may be less likely to disperse across degraded habitat and therefore experience a much different patch structure. This is particularly relevant for fragmented landscapes like cities. Urban gardens are reputed to support a diversity of native and non-native urban species found in urban landscapes. Yet we know little about the long-term persistence of organisms associated with urban gardens. Here we utilize Taylor's law, a universal scaling law denoting a power law relationship between population size and variance to indicate the synchrony of arthropod populations sampled across time in a fragmented urban landscape. Our results indicate that the utility of urban gardens as habitat is strongly dependent on sampling month, spatial scale and taxon. Constrained dispersal across the landscape may limit the potential of urban gardens to conserve natural enemies including ladybird beetles and parasitoid wasps. In contrast, aphid pests are moving much more freely in the landscape as exhibited through synchrony in abundances sampled across local and landscape scales. We find that regardless of the fragmentation pattern existing in the landscape, short-ranged arthropods are isolated to small, independent garden habitat patches (metapopulation-like) with abundances that oscillate out of sync, while long-ranged species traverse greater distances, synchronizing abundances across large, shared spaces (source sink-like). These results suggest an inherent link between Taylor's temporal law and metapopulation theory, providing a potential mechanism to explain species-specific slopes of Taylor's law as arising from the ability of organisms to differentially experience fragmented space along the continuum between metapopulation and source-sink.

AB  - Reptiles are rarely included in urban freshwater biodiversity monitoring and conservation. We explored the global persistence of freshwater dependent turtles, lizards, crocodilians and snakes in cities with a population greater than 100,000 using species occurrence data in online databases from a five-year period (2013-2018). We then used ecological niche models to help identify the locations of suitable habitats for three freshwater reptile species in Sydney, Australia. Our Global analysis showed that sightings of a majority of known species of crocodilians and freshwater turtles were recorded in databases within this 5-year period in contrast to about one in three freshwater lizard species and one in ten freshwater snake species and that freshwater reptiles were observed within 50 km of the center of 40% of the 3525 cities. While global databases hold substantial recent species occurrence records for some regions, they contain very little data for large parts of the world. Modelling showed that potential suitable habitat for the three freshwater species in Sydney was distributed across areas with different levels of urban development. The persistence of populations of freshwater reptiles in and around a large proportion of the world's cities show that this group can play an important role in urban biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Context Conservation for the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), a federally endangered species in the United States of America, is typically focused on local maternity sites; however, the species is a regional migrant, interacting with the environment at multiple spatial scales. Hierarchical levels of management may be necessary, but we have limited knowledge of landscape-level ecology, distribution, and connectivity of suitable areas in complex landscapes. Objectives We sought to (1) identify factors influencingM. sodalismaternity colony distribution in a mosaic landscape, (2) map suitable maternity habitat, and (3) quantify connectivity importance of patches to direct conservation action. Methods Using 3 decades of occurrence data, we testeda priori, hypothesis-driven habitat suitability models. We mapped suitable areas and quantified connectivity importance of habitat patches with probabilistic habitat availability metrics. Results Factors improving landscape-scale suitability included limited agriculture, more forest cover, forest edge, proximity to medium-sized water bodies, lower elevations, and limited urban development. Areas closer to hibernacula and rivers were suitable. Binary maps showed that 30% of the study area was suitable forM. sodalisand 29% was important for connectivity. Most suitable patches were important for intra-patch connectivity and far fewer contributed to inter-patch connectivity. Conclusions While simple models may be effective for small, homogenous landscapes, complex models are needed to explain habitat suitability in large, mixed landscapes. Suitability modeling identified factors that made sites attractive as maternity areas. Connectivity analysis improved our understanding of important areas for bats and prioritized areas to target for restoration.

AB  - Considering that urban sprawl and the increase in anthropogenic activities lead to natural habitats loss and fragmentation, threatening biodiversity, the conservation of urban forest remnants is extremely important for the persistence of native fauna and flora species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the landscape structure of an urbanized area in the Atlantic Forest biome, using geoprocessing techniques and fundamentals of Landscape Ecology, in order to provide subsidies for forest conservation in the urban landscape. A land use/land cover map was used to quantify forest cover and to evaluate the landscape structure. Landscape metrics quantified the area, shape and proximity of the forest remnants, providing indicators of the landscape structure. Forest covers 22.9% of the study area, with only 3.6% of the fragments larger than 50 ha. The majority of the fragments (83%) has an area of less than 10 ha. Only three remnants are larger than 500 ha, the largest of them is located in Ipanema National Forest. Most forest fragments (80%) are located in particular properties. The landscape was diagnosed as highly anthropized and fragmented, but with remnants close to each other (NEAR < 50m) potentiating the movement of species in the anthropic matrix. Scenarios of exclusion of small fragments demonstrated the fragility of the matrix without their support, since the small remnants contribute to the connection between the larger ones. The anthropic grassland is the second largest land use class in the study area (20.4%), behind only the urbanized area (25%). Actions to maintain biodiversity in anthropized landscapes such as the study area should prioritize the restoration of anthropic grasslands, incentives for forest conservation in private properties and the maintenance of small fragments in the landscape, in order to promote the connection between large forest areas. Urban and environmental planning of cities should be aligned and based on scientific studies on the spatialization of the vegetation in urban areas.

AB  - Plant species distributions are determined by various factors (including the dispersal modes and the complex physical environment) across multiple spatial scales, in which the dispersal distance of different dispersal modes and the external environment (including local characteristics and landscape patterns) are closely related. Therefore, understanding the response mechanism of plant species with different dispersal abilities to environmental factors is critical for developing effective landscape management strategies and prioritizing biodiversity conservation efforts at the appropriate scale. In this study, we aimed to explore: (1) the spatial distribution of plant species richness; (2) the spatial scale at which plant species have the strongest response to environment variables (scale of effect); and (3) to identify the key factors that affect the plant species at local and six landscape scales (a 0.5 km, 1 km, 1.5 km, 2 km, 3 km and 4 km-radius circle) considering multiple dispersal traits. We conducted vegetation surveys at 53 sites and classified plant species into three dispersal modes, including biotic dispersal (BD), abiotic dispersal (AD) and autochorous (AT), based on the respective dispersal vector of the seed. We classified land use types into 15 categories and clipped 6 specified radii around each sampling site using ENVI 5.1 and ArcGIS 10.3 software. We applied linear mixed effects models (LMM) to analyze the local and the surrounding landscape variables in predicting plant species richness in Qingshui town of Beijing, China. Our results revealed that the response traits of species to environment factors varied across different scales, proving the existence of scale effect in our study area. The biotically-dispersed (BD) and abiotically-dispersed (AD) species favored structurally complex habitats with greater tree height and cover of herb at the local scale. The area-weighted mean of shape metric (SHAPE_MN) of shrubbery and the euclidean nearest neighbor distance distribution (ENN_AM) of bare land play a major role in determining BD and AD species at large spatial extents, which suggest that the patterns and ecological attributes of patches of these two land use types hinder the migration and colonization ability of species and thus affect the species richness. These results suggest that a multi-scale approach should be encouraged to help guide effective landscape managements in conserving biodiversity for different response traits.

AB  - Cities are fully functioning ecosystems and are home to no-analogue communities of species that interact with each other and which are subject to novel urban stressors. As such, biodiversity can evolve in response to these new urban conditions, making urban species a moving target for conservation and management efforts. An evolving urban biodiversity necessitates integrating evolutionary insights into management for these efforts to be successful in a dynamic urban milieu. Here we present a framework for categorizing urban biodiversity from a management perspective. We then discuss a suite of example management tools and their potential evolutionary implications-both their opportunities for and potential consequence to management. Urban ecosystems are proliferating but, far from being ecological lost causes, they may provide unique insights and opportunities for biodiversity conservation. Determining how to achieve urban biodiversity priorities while managing pest species requires evolutionary thinking.
   Urbanization can cause rapid evolutionary responses among city-dwelling species but evolution is rarely accounted for in urban conservation efforts. Here, the authors outline a framework for integrating evolutionary principles into the management of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Ecological corridors are effective to prevent ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss through promoting the connection among discrete habitat patches. Identifying ecological corridors is of great importance for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning. Previous studies mainly focused on the directions of ecological corridors among habitat patches and the boundaries of ecological corridors were usually subjectively identified. In this study a new approach integrating spatial continuous wavelet transform and kernel density estimation was proposed to objectively identify the width thresholds of ecological corridors in the megacity of Beijing City, with the application of InVEST model to extract core habitat patches, and constructing the ecological resistance surface based on natural conditions and human activities. The restoration coefficient was also defined and applied to determine the key restoration areas. The results showed that the total area of core habitat patches in Beijing City was 3652.75 km(2), with 1414.67 km(2) for ecological corridors, mainly distributed in the western and northern mountainous areas. 36 key restoration areas were also extracted, mainly located in the narrow areas with large resistance. Identifying the range and key restoration areas of ecological corridors can provide spatial guidelines for ecological conservation and restoration, thus ensuring regional ecological security in megacities.

AB  - Urbanization fragments landscapes and can impede the movement of organisms through their environment, which can decrease population connectivity. Reduction in connectivity influences gene flow and allele frequencies, and can lead to a reduction in genetic diversity and the fixation of certain alleles, with potential negative effects for populations. Previous studies have detected effects of urbanization on genetic diversity and structure in terrestrial animals living in landscapes that vary in their degree of urbanization, even over very short distances. We investigated the effects of low-intensity urbanization on genetic diversity and genetic structure in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We captured 208 Song Sparrows at seven sites along a gradient of urbanization in and around Blacksburg, VA, USA, then genotyped them using a panel of fifteen polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found that genetic diversity was comparable among the seven study sites, and there was no evidence of genetic structuring among sites. These findings suggest that over a gradient of urbanization characterized by low density urban development, Song Sparrows likely exist in a single panmictic population.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of how urbanization influences the evolution of native species is vital for urban wildlife ecology and conservation in the Anthropocene. With thousands of years of agriculture-dominated historical urbanization followed by 40 years of intensive and rapid urbanization, Shanghai provides an ideal environment to study how the two-stage urbanization process influences the evolution of indigenous wildlife, especially of anuran species. Therefore, in this study, we used mitochondrial Cyt-b gene, microsatellite (SSR), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to evaluate the demographic history and genetic structure of the eastern golden frog (Pelophylax plancyi), by sampling 407 individuals from 15 local populations across Shanghai, China. All local populations experienced bottlenecks during historical urbanization, while the local populations in urban areas maintained comparable contemporary effective population sizes (N-e) and genetic diversity with suburban and rural populations. Nevertheless, the rapid modern urbanization has already imposed significant negative effects to the integrity of populations. The 15 local populations were differentiated into eight genetic clusters, showing a spatial distribution pattern consistent with the current urbanization gradient and island-mainland geography. Although moderate gene flow still occurred from the rural peripheral cluster to urban and suburban clusters, population fragmentation was more serious in the urban and suburban populations, where higher urbanization levels within 2-km radius areas showed significant negative relationships to the N-e and genetic diversity of local populations. Therefore, to protect urban wildlife with limited dispersal ability, improving conditions in fragmented habitat remnants might be most essential for local populations living in more urbanized areas. Meanwhile, we highlight the need to preserve large unfragmented rural habitats and to construct corridor networks to connect discrete urban habitat remnants for the long-term wildlife conservation in intensively urbanizing environments.

AB  - Remnant forests in urban areas are hotspots of urban biodiversity. However, the survival and integrity of many remnant forests are currently at risk. Better knowledge of the interactions between remnant forests and urban environments is urgently needed for guiding the conservation effort. In this study, we intend to answer the question: how do patch attributes and landscape patterns of surrounding environments affect the taxonomic diversity of woody plants in urban forest remnants? We surveyed the woody plant species in 240 sample plots in 54 remnant forest patches in Guiyang City, China. We analyzed the taxonomic diversity of woody plants and the effects of influencing factors using multi-level taxonomic diversity indicators and the generalized dissimilarity modeling. The results showed that shrubs had higher within-patch alpha-diversity than that of trees. However, adult trees had higher among-group beta-diversity than those of shrubs and saplings/seedlings. The vegetation type of the patch had more influence than other factors on the compositional dissimilarity of adult trees and sapling/seedling among patches. The patch size had the highest impact on the compositional dissimilarity of shrubs. Besides, small patches had a higher rate of compositional turnover in all woody plants. The percentage of impervious surfaces in surrounding areas and the spatial distance from each other were the main influencing factors for adult trees and saplings/seedlings, respectively. Based on our results, we recommend that more attention should be paid to preserve the small remnant forest patches and protect sampling/seedlings to maintain the taxonomic diversity of urban remnant forests.

AB  - As elements of green infrastructure, railway embankments are important corridors in urban environments connecting otherwise isolated habitat fragments. They are interrupted when railways cross major roads. It is not known whether dispersing animals use railway bridges to cross roads. We examined the function of a set-aside iron-steel railway bridge crossing a 12 m wide road with high traffic density in Basel (Switzerland) for dispersing animals. We installed drift fences with traps on a single-track, 32 m long and 6 m wide railway bridge with a simple gravel bed, and collected animals daily for 9 months. We captured more than 1200 animals crossing the bridge: small mammals, reptiles and amphibians as well as numerous invertebrates including snails, woodlice, spiders, harvestmen, millipedes, carabids, rove beetles and ants. For some animals it is likely that the gravel bed, at least temporarily, serves as a habitat. Many animals, however, were apparently dispersing, using the bridge to cross the busy road. We found season- and daytime -dependent differences in the frequency the bridge was used. Our findings indicate an important function of a set-aside railway bridges for connecting urban habitats. As most animal dispersal was recorded during the night, railway bridges with no (or little) traffic during the night may also contribute to animal dispersal. As important elements of green infrastructure, set-aside railway bridges should be considered in future urban planning.

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental alterations such as urbanization can threaten native populations as well as create novel environments that allow human pests and pathogens to thrive. As the number and size of urban environments increase globally, it is more important than ever to understand the dispersal dynamics of hosts, vectors and pathogens of zoonotic disease systems. For example, a protozoan parasite and the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans, Trypanosoma cruzi, recently colonized and spread through the city of Arequipa, Peru. We used population genomic and phylogenomic tools to analyze whole genomes of 123 T. cruzi isolates derived from vectors and non-human mammals throughout Arequipa to determine patterns of T. cruzi dispersal. The data show significant population genetic structure within city blocks-parasites in the same block tend to be very closely related-but no population structure among blocks within districts-parasites in neighboring blocks are no more closely related to one another than to parasites in distant districts. These data suggest that T. cruzi dispersal within a block occurs regularly and that occasional long-range dispersal events allow the establishment of new T. cruzi populations in distant blocks. Movement of domestic animals may be the primary mechanism of inter-block and inter-district T. cruzi dispersal.
   Author summary
   Urbanization creates environments that are ideal for some human pests and pathogens. As the number and size of urban environments increases globally, it is becoming vital to understand how human disease-causing pathogens, their vectors, and their non-human hosts disperse through urban landscapes. Here we study a population of Trypanosoma cruzi-the protozoan parasite and causative agent of Chagas disease in humans-that recently colonized the city of Arequipa, Peru. We use population genomic and phylogenomic tools to understand how this parasite population dispersed through the city to achieve its current distribution and abundance. We show that T. cruzi collected from the same city block tend to be very closely related, while those from neighboring blocks are often as distantly related as those from blocks in distant districts. The data suggest that vectors facilitate frequent within-block dispersal of the parasite, while domestic animal movement may facilitate the relatively infrequent inter-block and inter-district dispersal.

AB  - The high urbanization rate of Istanbul in response to rapid population decreased the size and amount of green spaces. Thereby, every green space types are of vital importance in terms of conservation of urban biodiversity. In this study, it was aimed to compare woody species composition of main green space types consist of artificial and natural sites. Botanical gardens had the highest diversity followed by gardens. Residential areas showed to be important in terms of shrub (52%) and evergreen species (58%), which are mostly exotics (71%). The ratio of the invasive plants in the composition was higher in parks, which contain highway greenings and public gardens. Since the most tree species used in public green areas of Istanbul were mostly same with the species used in European cities, all of the green space categories having varied composition must be considered as interconnected habitat patches in urban planning.

AB  - Cities are among the best examples of complex systems. The adaptive components of a city, such as its people, firms, institutions, and physical structures, form intricate and often non-intuitive interdependencies with one another. These interdependencies can be quantified and represented as links of a network that give visibility to otherwise cryptic structural elements of urban systems. Here, we use aspects of information theory to elucidate the interdependence network among labor skills, illuminating parts of the hidden economic structure of cities. Using pairwise interdependencies we compute an aggregate, skills-based measure of system "tightness" of a city's labor force, capturing the degree of integration or internal connectedness of a city's economy. We find that urban economies with higher tightness tend to be more productive in terms of higher GDP per capita. However, related work has shown that cities with higher system tightness are also more negatively affected by shocks. Thus, our skills-based metric may offer additional insights into a city's resilience. Finally, we demonstrate how viewing the web of interdependent skills as a weighted network can lead to additional insights about cities and their economies.

AB  - Question We ask whether 11-year mowing patterns and presence of fencing influence plant community diversity and functional assemblage in urban vacant lots.
   Location This study took place in 34 vacant lots on the south and west sides of Chicago, IL, USA. Urban vacant lots are an excellent study system in which to investigate the effects of management in cities: they are ubiquitous in many cities and they experience a range of management, particularly mowing and fencing.
   Methods We used municipal data to classify infrequent and intensive mowing regimes and assessed presence or absence of fencing in situ. In our sites, these management strategies are independent. We used individual permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) models to assess the effects of these management strategies on plant community composition. We then assessed species richness of plants with various traits using six individual two-way ANOVA models with interaction terms. Our predictor variables included management strategies (mowing intensity and fencing) and three plant traits (growth form [graminoid, forb, or woody], life duration (annual, biennial, or perennial), and biogeographic origin [native or introduced]).
   Results We found 120 plant species in the vacant lots. Most of these species were perennial, introduced forbs. We found no discernable effects of mowing intensity on plant community composition or richness of plants in the three functional groups. However, when we compared the species found along fences to those in lot interiors, we found significantly different plant communities. Fence line communities had significantly more native and woody species than lot interiors.
   Conclusions Plant communities differ at very fine spatial scales within an individual vacant lot, and this pattern is related to the presence of fences. Overall, vacant lots support diverse plant communities which can differentially contribute to wildlife habitat depending on management strategy.

AB  - Hedge density, structure, and function vary with primary production and slope gradient and are subject to other diverse factors. Hedgerows are emerging ecosystems with both above- and belowground components. Functions of hedges can be categorized as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ecosystem services; these functions include food production, noncrop food and wood production, firewood production, pollination, pest control, soil conservation and quality improvement, mitigation of water flux and availability, carbon sequestration, landscape connectivity and character maintenance, and contributions to biodiversity. Urban hedges provide a relatively equitable microclimate and critical connections between green spaces and enhance human health and well-being through contact with biodiversity. Soil and water conservation are well researched in tropical hedges but less is known about their contribution to pollination, pest control, and biodiversity. Establishing a minimum hedge width and longer intervals between cutting of temperate hedges would enhance biosecurity and promote carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Hedges have a global role in mitigating biodiversity loss and climate change, which restoration should maximize, notwithstanding regional character.

AB  - The federally-threatened Preble's meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius preblei) occurs in riparian zones located along the foothills and plains in the Front Range of Colorado and Wyoming. Anthropogenic and natural disturbances have extensively modified Front Range riparian ecosystems affecting the location, quality, and connectivity ofZ. h. prebleipopulations and habitat. Previous studies suggest that specific microhabitat conditions influenceZ. h. prebleioccurrence but no landscape-scale assessments have been conducted. To support conservation and management, we assessedZ. h. prebleihabitat in Boulder County, Colorado by mapping riparian land cover composition, creating species distribution models (SDM), and evaluating connectivity between suitable habitat and knownZ. h. prebleipopulations. The SDM identified 5381 ha of suitableZ. h. prebleihabitat, compared with 252 ha of knownZ. h. prebleioccupied habitat. We found limited connections betweenZ. h. prebleipopulations in different watersheds, as urban development and large expanses of agricultural land disrupt connectivity. Our modeling approach yielded outcomes that are broadly relevant to understanding the distribution and management of geographically restricted species impacted by habitat loss and has provided insight intoZ. h. prebleihabitat and connectivity that cannot be gathered from field work alone.

AB  - The analysis of gene flow patterns can provide important insights into population dynamics in the context of landscape ecology. In lizards, this approach has been used to evaluate patterns related to climate change, habitat fragmentation, and taxonomic uncertainties. Tropidurus hispidus is an ecologically plastic species, which presents some evidence of population structuring. In the present study, we investigated the potential structuring of T. hispidus populations across a gradient of tropical biomes, including the Amazon and Atlantic rainforests, the Caatinga dry forest, the Caatinga-Atlantic Forest transition zone (Agreste), coastal Restinga, and urban environments. Nuclear ISSR markers were obtained by PCR/electrophoresis, and a number of population parameters were estimated and analyzed. Despite the extreme environmental discontinuities found across the vast study area, the results revealed a high degree of genetic connectivity among the different demes. This pattern indicates that the species can be considered to be a single evolutionary taxon with gene flow among all populations, despite the marked environmental discontinuities. Tropidurus hispidus clearly has a marked capacity for dispersal, which may be favored by its intrinsic genetic diversity.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has engendered increased fragmentation of urban green spaces combined with declining green space connectivity. This situation is significant in urban fringe areas wherein rural areas transition to urban spaces. Therefore, it is important to understand how to scientifically and rationally construct green space ecological networks, connect fragmented habitats, and protect biodiversity and regional ecological security. Here, we used geographic information system and remote sensing technology to address the ecological sources via morphological spatial pattern analysis and ecological connectivity index analysis methods. The minimum cost distance method was used to generate a potential corridor. The green space ecological network system of the study area was constructed based on its green space landscape pattern. Qualitative and quantitative analysis provided targeted recommendations for green space ecological network optimization in the study area. The results showed that in the study area, the level of the fragmentation was high. Although the number of urban green space patches was significant, the area of the patches was small. Despite the potential corridor not covering the study area evenly, the optimized green space corridor increased the secondary ecological source area. The network system for green space corridors comprised water corridors, road corridors, and ecological restoration sites. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most important causes of ecological changes and biodiversity loss worldwide, and forests in Latin America provide valuable scenarios to understand the ecological effects of this human-driven phenomenon due to its high urbanization rate. Our aim was to investigate how urbanization shapes species richness (SR) and composition of anuran communities in NW Argentina, and to determine which suite of life history traits are related to anuran tolerance to urban development. We classified anuran species in Functional Groups (FG) based on a series of ecological traits and recognized them as urban-tolerant or urban-avoiders. We constructed an urbanization composite index (UI) through an exploratory factor analysis based on measures of artificial light intensity, noise pollution, land use types, and mean values of LTS, NDMI, and NDVI. We tested the response of SR, FG and species occurrence to UI with Generalized Linear Models and a variation partitioning analysis. Our results showed the negative influence of urbanization on anuran diversity and suggested that the loss of anuran species is not random, pointing to the presence of environmental filters. Only terrestrial frogs that build aquatic foam nests were not affected by an increase in urbanization, so they may be considered as urban--tolerant. Further, our results highlighted the important role of dispersal capacity in structuring the urban anuran assemblages. As ecologists working in urban habitats, we emphasize the need of a more comprehensive and generalized understanding of ecological and life history traits associated with urban tolerant anurans.

AB  - Urban forests are basic elements in the ecological structure of cities. The dendroflora and herb species of oak-hornbeam forests in a medium-sized city type was studied and compared with nature reserves located outside the city, based on phytosociological analysis using the Braun-Blanquet percentage-of-cover scale. More inconsistent trees and shrubs occurred in the urban forests and some tree species showed poor renewal. The herb plant species have become more frequent in nature reserves, but we were not able to detect significant differences regarding species inconsistent with the habitat. Herb plants in urban forests preferred more light and fertile habitats. Myrmecochory was the most common seed dispersal. Nowadays, the conservation of urban biota is of great importance and more sustainable approaches towards management of nature are needed. To implement such approaches, results of studies focused on ecology of urban forests may serve as an important tool.

AB  - Along with environmental pollution, urban planning has been connected to public health. The research indicates that the quality of built environments plays an important role in reducing mental disorders and overall health. The structure and shape of the city are considered as one of the factors influencing happiness and health in urban communities and the type of the daily activities of citizens. The aim of this study was to promote physical activity in the main structure of the city via urban design in a way that the main form and morphology of the city can encourage citizens to move around and have physical activity within the city. Functional, physical, cultural-social, and perceptual-visual features are regarded as the most important and effective criteria in increasing physical activities in urban spaces, based on literature review. The environmental quality of urban spaces and their role in the physical activities of citizens in urban spaces were assessed by using the questionnaire tool and analytical network process (ANP) of structural equation modeling. Further, the space syntax method was utilized to evaluate the role of the spatial integration of urban spaces on improving physical activities. Based on the results, consideration of functional diversity, spatial flexibility and integration, security, and the aesthetic and visual quality of urban spaces plays an important role in improving the physical health of citizens in urban spaces. Further, more physical activities, including motivation for walking and the sense of public health and happiness, were observed in the streets having higher linkage and space syntax indexes with their surrounding texture.

AB  - The Amazonian ecosystems of Madre de Dios (MDD) region, considered Peru's "capital of biodiversity" due to its impressive species richness, are threatened by the rapid expansion of infrastructure. The paving of the Interoceanic Highway in 2010 has brought rapid population growth and environmental degradation, threatening large-scale conservation efforts such as the Vilcabamba-Amboro Conservation Corridor (VACC). To quantify the impacts of development processes and to identify critical areas where further conservation efforts should be focused, we analyzed 20 years of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics, drivers, and fragmentation patterns in MDD. We mapped LULC in 1993, 2003, and 2013 using Landsat imagery and modeled the proximate drivers of change related to deforestation, forest regrowth, gold mining, agriculture, and urban expansion in two time periods (1993-2003 and 2003-2013). We characterized habitat fragmentation patterns in four regional target areas. Our results show accelerated deforestation triggered by the road network spreading, mining and agriculture expansion, and population growth. LULC changes produced two contrasting spatial landscape patterns: numerous small forest fragments in the north due to agricultural expansion along the Interoceanic Highway and large continuous forest losses caused by gold mining expansion in the south. Current unplanned development in this region is threatening its outstanding biodiversity. We suggest that further conservation efforts should focus on strengthening the legal framework of the VACC, implementing a sustainable management plan for MDD, promoting agroforestry strategies along the Interoceanic Highway, and preserving smaller corridors for animal movement.

AB  - Environmental features impacting the spread of invasive species after introduction can be assessed using population genetic structure as a quantitative estimation of effective dispersal at the landscape scale. However, in the case of an ongoing biological invasion, deciphering whether genetic structure represents landscape connectivity or founder effects is particularly challenging. We examined the modes of dispersal (natural and human-aided) and the factors (landscape or founders history) shaping genetic structure in range edge invasive populations of the Asian tiger mosquito,Aedes albopictus, in the region of Grenoble (Southeast France). Based on detailed occupancy-detection data and environmental variables (climatic, topographic and land-cover), we modelledA. albopictuspotential suitable area and its expansion history since first introduction. The relative role of dispersal modes was estimated using biological dispersal capabilities and landscape genetics approaches using genome-wide SNP dataset. We demonstrate that both natural and human-aided dispersal have promoted the expansion of populations. Populations in diffuse urban areas, representing highly suitable habitat forA. albopictus, tend to disperse less, while roads facilitate long-distance dispersal. Yet, demographic bottlenecks during introduction played a major role in shaping the genetic variability of these range edge populations. The present study is one of the few investigating the role of founder effects and ongoing expansion processes in shaping spatial patterns of genetic variation in an invasive species at the landscape scale. The combination of several dispersal modes and large proportions of continuous suitable habitats forA. albopictuspromoted range filling of almost its entire potential distribution in the region of Grenoble only few years after introduction.

AB  - Urbanization has negative consequences for the integrity of ecosystems and services they provide, by reducing their extent and quality in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Few studies have explored how urban infrastructure expansion affects the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems by provoking their fragmentation and loss. Here we explore changes in the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems due to urbanization, analyzing ecosystem extent and concatenation with urban infrastructures (shared perimeter) in four bays of the Coquimbo region of northern Chile (from 29 degrees S to 32 degrees S) as model systems. Increase in natural-to-urban concatenation patterns were observed in most urbanized bays; sandy beaches and wetlands were the habitats most connected with urban infrastructures like roads and coastal artificial defenses. Availability of ecosystem services is compromised by progressive loss of natural connectivity and poor governance structure, which seems to confer high vulnerability to urbanized bays with future urban expansion. Complementary actions are proposed to reduce the vulnerability of coastal urban systems, considering 1) investment in nature-based infrastructures for coastal defenses, 2) restoration-rehabilitation of natural (remnant) urban ecosystems and eco-engineering of current artificial infrastructures, focusing on reestablishment of biodiversity patterns and habitat connectivity, and 3) limitation of coastal town and village expansion. Management strategies can improve coastal adaptation to natural hazards, stabilizing changes in the natural-urban concatenation mosaic present in coastal urban systems like bays.

AB  - Compared to rural environments, cities are known to be extraordinarily rich in plant species. In particular, the proportion of alien plant species is higher in urban areas. This is attributed to specific urban conditions, which provide a large variety of habitats due to high geological heterogeneity. It can also be attributed to the role of cities as centres for plant introductions and the consequential increased propagule pressure. Neophytes, alien plant species introduced after the discovery of the Americas, appear to contribute especially strongly to the increased proportion of alien plants in cities. To investigate whether the plant traits of neophytes can be explained by environmental variables, we modelled the composition of their pollination types and growth forms as well as their diaspore weight and the onset of flowering in response to a selection of climatic, geological, land cover and traffic network variables with data from Germany. To test for a specific urban effect, we included their interactions with the area of urban land use.
   In general, we found that climatic variables were the most important predictors for all traits. However, when considering interactions with urbanisation, non-climatic variables, which often were not significant as the main effect, remained in the final models. This points to an existing 'urban effect'. However, it is much smaller compared to the purely climatic effects. We conclude that interferences and alterations mainly related to urbanisation and human activity in general are responsible for the different ecological processes found in cities compared to rural areas. In addition, we argue that considering functional traits is an appropriate way to identify the ecological mechanisms related to urbanisation.

AB  - With the expansion of urban areas, promoting urban biodiversity is now a priority. Many municipalities are implementing greening strategies to improve and increase green space within city boundaries. The effectiveness of these strategies, while rarely assessed, likely depends on the landscape and on relevant species intrinsic traits such as dispersal ability. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we evaluated the effect of the urban landscape on the projected distribution of three butterfly species with contrasting dispersal abilities, and assessed the effectiveness of the Barcelona greening strategy as a case study. Species distribution (in terms of patch occupancy) and effectiveness (in terms of population size and number of occupied gardens) were analysed using generalised linear models. The percentage of (semi) natural source area around each urban green space (garden hereafter) was the most important variable for the distribution of all three types of species, followed by the percentage of neighbouring gardens and by the garden carrying capacity, although the effect of neighbouring gardens was negative in the early phase of colonisation. The planned Barcelona greening strategy increased the number of gardens occupied by high and medium, but not by low dispersive species. Increasing the carrying capacity of the gardens improved colonisation for all three species types. While the best strategies can be context dependent, our results indicated that increasing garden area might be more effective in the long term but it can be overridden by garden capacity in the short term, especially if there are constraints to increasing garden area.

AB  - Urban environments offer substantial opportunities for wildlife conservation as they commonly overlap the distribution of native species and comprise structurally complex and diverse habitats. Conservation strategies within urban environments currently focus on enhancing or maintaining natural remnant vegetation despite the variety of smaller greenspaces that are known to support wildlife. Residential gardens in particular comprise a major component of the total greenspace in urban areas and offer numerous resources that can be used by multiple taxa, and may therefore represent an important, yet unrealised opportunity for conservation. In this study we aimed to further the understanding of the potential value of gardens for biodiversity conservation by comparing the diversity, presence, abundance and reproductive activity of mammals in gardens to natural urban bushland remnants. We demonstrate that gardens support a similar diversity of native mammals as urban bushland and that the presence, abundance and reproductive activity for most native mammals was similar in both bushland and gardens. With the exception of domestic pets, the presence and abundance of introduced species was not higher in gardens compared to urban bushland. Our study highlights that the potential role of residential gardens for biodiversity conservation should not be overlooked. Given that novel urban ecosystems will continue to expand, inclusion of gardens in wildlife conservation and management actions is likely to greatly increase our ability to conserve wildlife in urban habitats.

AB  - Urbanization can affect arthropod abundance in different ways. While species with narrow habitat range and low dispersal ability often respond negatively to urban environments, many habitat generalist species with good dispersal ability reach high densities in city centers. This filtering effect of urban habitats can strongly influence predator-prey-mutualist interactions and may therefore affect the abundance of predatory and phytophagous species both directly and indirectly. Here, we assessed the effect of urbanization on aphids, predatory arthropods, and ants on field maple (Acer campestre) trees in and around the city of Budapest, Hungary. We used the percentage of impervious surfaces within a 500 m radius of each site as an index of the degree of urbanization. We found that the abundance of aphids increased with increasing level of urbanization. However, abundance of predatory arthropods and occurrence of poorly dispersing species within the predator community were negatively related to urbanization, and we identified these two independent factors as significant predictors of aphid abundances. The abundance of ants decreased with urbanization, and contrary to our expectations, did not affect the abundance pattern of aphids. Our results suggest that urbanization, by altering the abundance and composition of predator communities, can disrupt biological control of aphid populations, and thus may contribute to the aphid outbreaks on urban trees.

AB  - Individual responses of wild birds to fragmented habitat have rarely been studied, despite large-scale habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss resulting from widespread urbanisation. We investigated the spatial ecology of the Short-toed Treecreeper Certhia brachydactyla, a tiny, resident, woodland passerine that has recently colonised city parks at the northern extent of its range. High resolution spatiotemporal movements of this obligate treeliving species were determined using radio telemetry within the urbanized matrix of city parks in Copenhagen, Denmark. We identified regular edge crossing behaviour, novel in woodland birds. While low numbers of individuals precluded a comprehensive characterisation of home range for this population, we were able to describe a consistent behaviour which has consequences for our understanding of animal movement in urban ecosystems. We report that treecreepers move freely, and apparently do so regularly, between isolated habitat patches. This behaviour is a possible driver of the range expansion in this species and may contribute to rapid dispersal capabilities in certain avian species, including Short-toed Treecreepers, into northern Europe. Alternatively, these behaviours might be common and/or provide an adaptive advantage for birds utilising matrix habitats, for example within urban ecosystems.

AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) effect is an important ecological consequence of rapid urbanization. Although the spatio-temporal evolution of urban heat islands (UHIs) and their driving forces have been discussed in previous studies, the accurate identification of the spatial morphology and connectivity of UHIs is currently lacking. Taking Beijing City as an example, the radius approach (RA) was applied to identify the thresholds of UHIs, and multiple indexes were calculated to analyze the changing connectivity of UHIs from 2000 to 2015. The results showed that the UHIs in Beijing City formed archipelagos, which composed of single main heat island that occupied >79.85% of the total area, and small heat islands scattered in the centers of surrounding districts. In 15 years, the total area occupied by UHIs increased by 30.04%, indicating that the UHI effect became worse. As for landscape patterns of UHIs, aggregation index (AI) increased by 1.6%, landscape shape index (LSI) decreased by 4.1%, and probability of connectivity (PC) increased by 69.1%, all indicating that the distribution of UHIs became more compact, and the connectivity between islands increased. Different expansion types had different influences on the landscape patterns of UHIs: the edge-expansion reduced the fragmentation of UHIs and increased connectivity between islands, the infilling expansion made the boundaries of UHIs regular, and the leapfrog expansion made the AI slight decrease. Based on the radius approach, identifying the range of multi-center UHIs and their spatial expansion type can provide an effective planning guideline for mitigating the negative UHI effect.

AB  - Background: Aquatic ecosystems are greatly altered by urban development, including the complete loss of natural habitat due to water diversions or channel burial. However, novel freshwater habitats also are created in cities, such as effluent-dependent streams that rely on treated wastewater for flow. It is unclear how diverse these novel ecosystems are, or how quickly aquatic species are able to colonize them. In this study, we (1) quantify odonate (Insecta, Odonata) colonization of a novel effluent-dependent river reach, (2) examine how drying events affect odonates in these novel habitats, and (3) explore whether effluent-dependent streams can support diverse odonate assemblages.
   Methods: We conducted monthly odonate surveys at three sites along the Santa Cruz River (Tucson, AZ, USA) between June 2019 and May 2020. One site was in a long-established effluent-dependent reach (flowing since the 1970s) that served as a reference site and two sites were in a newly-established reach that began flowing on June 24, 2019 (it was previously dry). We compared odonate species richness, assemblage composition, and colonization patterns across these reaches, and examined how these factors responded to flow cessation events in the new reach.
   Results: Seven odonate species were observed at the study sites in the new reach within hours of flow initiation, and species rapidly continued to arrive thereafter. Within 3 months, species richness and assemblage composition of adult odonates were indistinguishable in the new and reference reaches. However, drying events resulted in short-term and chronic reductions in species richness at one of the sites. Across all three sites, we found over 50 odonate species, which represent nearly 40% of species known from the state of Arizona.
   Discussion: Odonates were surprisingly diverse in the effluent-dependent Santa Cruz River and rapidly colonized a newly established reach. Richness levels remained high at study sites that did not experience drying events. These results suggest that consistent discharge of high-quality effluent into dry streambeds can be an important tool for promoting urban biodiversity. However, it remains to be seen how quickly and effectively less vagile taxa (e.g., mayflies, caddisflies) can colonize novel reaches. Effluent-dependent urban streams will always be highly managed systems, but collaboration between ecologists and urban planners could help to maximize aquatic biodiversity while still achieving goals of public safety and urban development.

AB  - High Andean forests are biodiversity hotspots that also play key roles in the provisioning of vital ecosystem services for neighboring cities. In past centuries, the hinterland of Andean fast-growing cities often experienced a dramatic decline in forested areas, but there are reports that forest cover has been recovering recently. We analyzed aerial imagery spanning the years 1940 to 2007 from nine administrative localities in the Eastern Andean Cordillera of Colombia in order to elucidate precise patterns of forest vegetation change. To this aim, we performed image object-based classification by means of texture analysis and image segmentation. We then derived connectivity metrics to investigate whether forest cover trajectories showed an increase or decrease in fragmentation and landscape degradation. We observed a forest cover recovery in all the examined localities, except one. In general, forest recovery was accompanied by an increase in core habitat areas. The time scale of the positive trends identified partially coincides with the creation of protected areas in the region, which very likely furthered the recovery of forest patches. This study unveils the long-term dynamics of peri-urban high Andean forest cover, providing valuable information on historical vegetation changes in a highly dynamic landscape.

AB  - Background
   For residents of East-Southeast Asia's megacities, interactions with "nature" may be largely limited to interactions taking place in urban parks. Urban parks provide refuges for ecologically-important biodiversity, such as insect pollinators. While residents may be unlikely to notice small insects, butterflies are more likely to be noticed and to provide positive human-"nature" interactions. Engaging residents and city planners in promoting habitat for butterflies is valid conservation practice and has well-understood educational and well-being benefits. Surveying and monitoring is an essential activity to corroborate, improve and communicate the outcomes of conservation practices amongst city governments, scientists and other stakeholders. Here we present the data from a survey of butterflies in urban parks in the megacity of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region as part of the "Urban biodiversity and human well-being in East-Southeast Asia's megacities" project organised by the "Urban Butterflies in Asia Research Network".
   New information
   We recorded 51 species of butterflies from ten urban parks in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. This was more than double the 25 species reported in Bangkok's City Biodiversity Index application. However, this was lower than that recorded in other megacities in Southeast Asia, such as Kuala Lumpur at 60 species. Most of the butterflies recorded were common and widespread species. DNA barcodes are provided for most of the butterflies sampled.

AB  - This paper examines the topic of changes in central parts of large cities in Poland that have occurred in the post-war period, which can be divided into two stages with different factors shaping urban space. The rebuilding of cities in Poland following destruction brought by WWII was one of the elements of building the socialist city. This process was frequently planned, often steered, unlike the dynamic processes initiated along with the political and socio-economic transformation of the 1990s, which took place already under market economy conditions. Three categories of city centres were distinguished according to the scope of rebuilding and the direction of post-war morphological changes: cities where changes were slight (Lodz, Krakow), partly reconstructed cities (Wroclaw, Poznan), rebuilt and completely reconstructed cities (Gdansk, Szczecin, Warszawa). In the post-war period, the city centres in question were characterized by diverse forms and scope of rebuilding of war damage, scale of expansion of the transport network, decline of the industrial function, development of large commercial complexes in the direct neighbourhood of the old centre, expansion of the office function and buildings and revitalization and revalorization of historical fabric.

AB  - Metropolitan road axes are spaces of urban centrality and opportunity to promote a greater connectivity between different parts of the urban continuum. In this sense, the functional characterization of six representative axes in Madrid. Barcelona, Paris. London. New York and Mexico City allows obtaining a current analysis of the density and diversity of economic and urban activities to identify key aspects over which to influence to improve their functional and social structure. For this, a method is proposed that adopts the geolocation data from Google Places social network as a main source of information. From the research, important similarities in the functional character of the axes are deduced, among other the predominance of activities related to services and shopping or the greater diversity of economic and urban activities in more central spaces. But differences are also identified, such as the specialization of certain activities characteristic in each metropolitan axis or the differential relationship between population density and the number of activities both in terms of density and linear quantification. All in all, the method proposed opens new possibilities for the strategic planning of economic and urban activities in metropolitan areas.

AB  - The article analyses the transformations and the internal diversity of the oldest urban structures of central Lodz, one of the biggest Polish cities. 19th-century Lodz was one of the greatest centres of the textile industry in Europe. Currently, the city faces major challenges, including a dramatic population decrease, population ageing as well as a vast revitalisation of urban structures aimed at reinforcing the new idea of the city's inward development. The research on the layout of Lodz is based on the modern image of the city as well as four images preserved in historical plans. The subsequent, chronological models are analysed in terms of topological features with the use of space syntax methods. The conducted research made it possible to identify the internal, configurational diversity of the historic urban core of Lodz. A seemingly monotonous, orthogonal urban layout is, from a topological perspective, highly diversified. Due to the actions undertaken in Lodz and aimed at restoring urban structures in the broad sense, the study not only has a cognitive goal, but it also carries a practical context.

AB  - Starting from the identification of marginal areas, this work presents a possible physical-mathematical approach as a support to landscape planning, based on the pragmatic determination of the predictable environmental effects connected to land use changes (LUC) and related to objective and quantitative ecological indicators for environmental impact assessment.
   "Fringe areas", which are more suitable to change in a medium-short time frame, were determined through a spatial multicriteria decision analysis (S-MCDA) process. Three land use changes scenarios were identified and analysed, namely: the current situation, energy crop cultivation in marginal lands, and the possible abandonment of lands such as these. Energy crop cultivation in marginal lands is widely considered to be a useful opportunity for farmers, against the progressive risk of under-utilization or abandonment; nevertheless, the large areas needed can cause important environmental side-effects. In order to assess the possible variations in environmental components in the ex-ante planning phase, scenarios were assessed in terms of habitat and biodiversity ecosystems services (using both monetary and indexes approach), focusing also on possible environmental fragmentation analysis by means of landscape metrics, which are simple measures used to deepen landscape configuration and structure.
   The S-MCDA process allowed about 10% of the study area with less favourable environmental conditions to be defined, where land use change is desirable in a medium-short time frame. For the energy crops scenario, the ecosystem services (ESs) approach highlights positive repercussions in terms of habitat quality and biodiversity value. Similar trends are highlighted by different ESs assessment methods adopted (monetary and indexes), confirming themselves. Also, landscape pattern analysis confirmed positive habitat connectivity trends: the delineation of fringe areas has preserved, in energy crops scenario, natural and semi-natural classes, reducing the risk of disturbance with respect to the biodiversity and habitat. This condition assumes that adopted S-MCDA method can contribute positively and significantly to the definition of LUC scenarios and land management.
   In conclusion, marginal lands can become an opportunity to improve socio-economic conditions and to enhance land image, while respecting the environment. LUC scenarios building, and their assessment by means of ecological indicators become a dynamic and structured tool in the land use planning/management process to support decision maker choices and to re-calibrate interventions, with the aim of contributing to sustainable policies of land management (ecological corridors, compensation and / or mitigation measures, etc.), emphasizing land sustainable management benefits (such as climate change adaptation or disaster risk reduction).

AB  - Vegetated roofs are hoped to benefit urban wildlife, yet there are few empirical results regarding the conservation potential of such roofs. In this paper, we focus on arthropods on vegetated roofs. We vacuum sampled 17 succulent, meadow or succulent-meadow roofs, in Helsinki, Finland, and used order to species level information together with trait data to describe the communities. We evaluated the importance of biophysical roof characteristics on shaping arthropod assemblages to provide information concerning roof designs that promote rich arthropod fauna. Arthropod communities differed between the three roof types and the influence of roof variables varied between and within arthropod orders. The main local drivers of arthropod abundance across the individually analysed taxa were roof height and vegetation, with mainly positive effects of height (up to 11 m) and litter cover, and mainly negative effects of grass cover. Based on trait data from true bugs, spiders and ants, the roofs consisted mainly of common dispersive species that are generalist feeders and associated with dry open habitats or have wide habitat tolerance. We found one true bug species new to the country and assume that it arrived with imported vegetation. Based on these findings, vegetated roofs of varying height and size benefit common generalists and fauna of open dry habitats, but seem to lack rare native specialists and may introduce non-natives if imported plant material is used. Because the responses to vegetation characteristics are taxon-specific, high diversity of roof vegetation types would benefit arthropod conservation.

AB  - Urban areas represent a spatially small impact in relation to other land-uses such as livestock and agriculture, but they undergo rapid changes. Such changes involve their size, shape, interconnectivity, and composition of natural patches. Habitat loss generated by urbanization affects the diversity and abundance of bees and other flower visitors in many sites. In general, the presence of urban areas represents a strict boundary to flower visitors and restricts their movement between natural and suburban habitat patches. The aim of this work is to evaluate how the flower visitor assemblage change along an urban-natural gradient in northwest Argentina. We established five areas in the Yungas ecoregion and sampled three sites with different degrees of urbanization (urban, suburban, and natural), at each area, reaching 15 sites. At each site, we sampled flower visitors during 5-min observation periods done over flowering plants. We found 197 morphospecies of flower-visiting insects along the gradient and an invariant richness, abundance, and Shannon diversity. The assemblage presented the same taxonomic group distributions in the three categories established. However, in urban sites, solitary bees and bees with soil borrowing nesting type predominate, while eusocial and cavity nesting bees were the main flower visitors in suburban sites. Our results suggest that the cities of northwestern Argentina are not a strict boundary for flower visitors; however, urbanization seems to be selecting and favoring certain flower-visitor species traits.

AB  - Urbanization is increasing at a rapid pace with negative consequences for native biodiversity. While it is well-known that urbanization can lead to biotic homogenization (dominance of a few competitive species), effects of urbanization on ecological functions that rely on the frequency and efficiency of species interactions are less understood. Seed dispersal success depends on seed disperser feeding rate and diversity, which can affect the probability of fruit removal (i.e. seed dispersal) and germination rates. However, how these factors are affected by urbanization is unknown. In this study, we evaluate the effects of urbanization on factors that contribute to seed dispersal success (seed disperser diversity, frequency, probability of fruit removal and germination rate using Toxicodendron radicans and its seed disperser community as a model system. We found that urban sites had three times more disperser species and two times higher feeding rate compared to natural sites. However, the probability of individual fruit removal did not differ between natural and urban sites. Moreover, germination rate after dispersal was 20% lower in urban sites, leading to overall negative effects of urbanization on T. radicans seed dispersal. We propose differences in seed germination rate are driven by changes in seed disperser species composition and their differences in seed gut transit time. This in turn affects disperser species' ability to successfully scarify seeds. Overall, our results highlight the need to evaluate urbanization's effects on functional ecological processes, in addition to biotic homogenization effects, in order better understand and mitigate its negative impacts on biodiversity.

AB  - In the last 50-60 years, agricultural intensification and later urban development have threatened the rare and valuable gully landscape formed on marine clay. We studied landscape changes in eastern Akershus county in south-east Norway, which has one of the world's largest concentrations of marine gullies. Interpretation of aerial photos showed that about 25% of the gully area has been lost. Only 39.5% of the remaining area is original gullies, and 60.5% of the area has been affected by landscape change. The largest loss of gully area was between 1955 and 1991, mainly through land levelling and transformation to intensively managed agricultural landscape. The most densely populated areas also lost gullies to residential areas and industry. Gullies support high plant and animal diversity, and future management should be based on landscape ecological principles. Gully fragments should also be preserved to maintain connectivity between the many different habitats belonging to the gullies.

AB  - While there has been no shortage of discussion of urban big data, smart cities, and cities as complex systems, there has been less discussion of the implications of big data as a source of individual data for planning and social science research. This study takes advantage of increasingly available land parcel and business establishment data to analyze how the measurement of proximity to urban services or amenities performed in many fields can be impacted by using these data-which can be considered "individual" when compared to aggregated origins or destinations. We use business establishment data across five distinctive US cities: Long Beach, Irvine, and Moreno Valley in California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and the New York borough of Staten Island. In these case studies, we show how aggregation error, a previously recognized concern in using census-type data, can be minimized through careful choice of distance measures. Informed by these regions, we provide recommendations for researchers evaluating the potential risks of a measurement strategy that differs from the "gold standard" of network distance from individually measured, point-based origins and destinations. We find limited support for previous hypotheses regarding measurement error based on the abundance or clustering of urban services or amenities, though further research is merited. Importantly, these new data sources reveal vast differences across cities, underscoring how accurate proximity measurement necessitates a critical understanding of the nuances of the urban landscape under investigation as measures appear heavily influenced by a city's street layouts and historical development trajectories.

AB  - The new urban order in the territorialization of cities, in general, is based on the principles of an ever more fragmented and dispersed growth across the territory. However, the growth of the urban area of Maringa diverges from this new order, retaining its compact form. In this study, the urban area of Maringa is composed of the cities of Maringa, Sarandi and Paicandu in the State of Parana, Brazil. The objectives of this article are to define the urban form of Maringa considering the variables compact city, fragmented city and disperse city and to identify the periods of urban expansion for each variable. The timeline of this study begins with the implantation of the cities in the 1940s and continues until the year 2016, since the urban area been mapped in a decennial diachronic series. Originally compact, the urban area fragments as it expands, in a movement that continues until the 2000s. After that, the occupation of its center predominates, making it compact again. Given these points, the beginning of a new cycle or new model of urban expansion is evident for Maringa.

AB  - Urbanisation is increasing throughout the range of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and has contributed to the decline of koala populations in many areas. In urban landscapes where koalas may need to travel considerable distances to access resources, they face increased risks of predation by domestic dogs and vehicular collision. Understanding how koalas navigate this risky landscape is key to developing effective conservation strategies. We used GPS data collected from 20 koalas to examine koala habitat use and movements in an urbanised area of the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia. Koala home ranges were large (males = 9.1 ha, females = 4.3 ha) and covered up to 153 properties. Analysis of GPS tracks showed that koalas moved frequently (median number of different locations per week: 14 [males], 8 [females]), usually over short distances (median distance: 69 m [males], 50 m [females]), and often crossed roads (average crossings per week: 9.4 [males], 2.7 [females]). Despite this movement behaviour placing koalas at risk of vehicular collision and predation by dogs, we recorded only three deaths during the one-year study period; two were due to old age and one of unknown cause. Our low mortality rate may be due to movements occurring at night when risks may be lower, and high awareness in the community about koalas that mitigates threats. Our results suggest that effective conservation of urban populations of koalas requires a landscape-scale approach with participation by the community and public land managers to maintain and establish koala habitat and connectivity, and to encourage koala-friendly driving behaviour.

AB  - In 2018, extensive field studies of diversity and prevalence of helminth infection in synanthropic rodents and non-rodent small mammals from public parks and citified areas in the Bangkok Metropolitan were conducted.Rattus rattuscomplex was the dominant small mammal in public parks. Of the 197 animals, 147 individuals were infected with one or more species of helminths, yielding an infection prevalence of 74.6%. Twenty-five species of helminths were recovered during necropsy.Pterygodermatites taniwas the most prevalent (36.2%); other encountered species includedRaillietina celebensis,Hydatigera taeniaformis(metacestode in liver tissue),Gongylonema neoplasticumandHymenolepis diminuta. Different helminth assemblages infected three different host taxa, i.e. synanthropicRattusspp.,Tupaia belangeri(Northern treeshrew) andSuncus murinus(Asian house shrew). Nine species of possible zoonotic helminths were identified. The focus on synanthropic rats influenced the findings of helminth diversity by either host intrinsic or extrinsic factors. A significant positive correlation was found between host body mass and helminth species richness. Greater helminth species richness was found in rats from public parks compared with animals from citified areas (e.g. inside buildings or offices). Also, helminth species richness was negatively correlated with the proportion of post-flooding/rain-fed land. These results provide essential information for assessing the incidence of potential zoonotic health threats in Bangkok and updating research in parasite ecology.

AB  - Frugivory networks exhibit a set of properties characterized by a number of network theory-derived metrics. Their structures often form deterministic patterns that can be explained by the functional roles of interacting species. Although we know lots about how these networks are organized when ecosystems are in a complete, functional condition, we know much less about how incomplete and simplified networks (such as those found in urban and periurban parks) are organized, which features are maintained, which ones are not, and why. In this paper, we examine the properties of a network between frugivorous birds and plants in a small Neotropical periurban park. We found a frugivory network composed of 29 species of birds and 23 of plants. The main roles in this network are played by four species of generalist birds (three resident, one migratory:Myiozetetes similis,Turdus grayi,Chlorospingus flavopectus, andDumetella carolinensis) and three species of plants (one exotic, two early successional:Phoenix canariensis,Phoradendronsp., andWitheringia stramoniifolia). When compared to reference data from other locations in the Neotropics, species richness is low, one important network-level metric is maintained (modularity) whereas another one is not (nestedness). Nestedness, a metric associated with network specialists, is a feature this network lacks. Species-level metrics such as degree, species strength, and module roles, are not maintained. Our work supports modularity as the most pervasive network-level metric of altered habitats. From a successional point of view, our results suggest that properties revealed by species-level indices may be developed at a later time, lagging the acquisition of structural elements.

AB  - Urban ecosystems provide green landscapes that are important to global biodiversity conservation. In tropical urban ecosystems, exotic plants are widely used in landscaping and this can have several negative effects on the native plant and pollinator communities. Here, we aimed to investigate the origin (native or exotic to Brazil, and native or exotic to the phytogeographic dominium where the urban space is inserted), sexual and reproductive systems and fruiting of tree species occurring in 17 urban green spaces in the city of Recife, Pernambuco, located in the northeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest. A total of 114 tree species were registered in the urban green spaces, 78 out of them were observed for fruiting. Overall, 49.1 % of the species are native to Brazil and 50.9 % are exotic, while 86 % do not occur naturally in the northeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest. In terms of abundance of individuals, these values were 37 % native, 63 % exotic and 80.5 % not occurring in the northeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest. Most of the species, native or exotic, are hermaphrodite and self-incompatible (i.e. obligatory cross-pollinated). From the 78 species observed for fruiting, 77 set fruits, 43.7 % had sub-annual pattern; all exotic species (43 spp.) set fruits, even the 13 exotic species that are self-incompatible. Our results reveal that factors such as the high use of exotic species that successfully set fruits in tropical urban green spaces may indicate risks for plant-animal interactions (e.g. pollination; dispersion), threaten the reproductive success of native plant species, increase the risk of biological invasion, and consequently impair the maintenance of biodiversity. We suggest that decision makers pay attention and consider the impacts of using exotic plant species in the dynamic of tropical urban ecosystems.

AB  - Disentangling the mechanisms that determine community assembly in urban environments is a prerequisite for understanding the impacts of urbanization on the biota and for developing more effective rehabilitation strategies. Community structure in urban stream ecosystems is the sum of multiple processes, including local environmental and catchment level effects. However, the degree to which dispersal from the regional species pool influences urban stream communities still has not been rigorously examined. We studied the importance of the degree of urbanization, the local stream environment and the regional species pool on the assembly of stream fishes in the Pannon Biogeographic Region, Hungary. Correlation analyses between urbanization variables (human population size and a recently developed urbanization index) and local stream and riparian environmental variables did not show significant relationships, indicating that the examined 29 streams reacted to the degree of urbanization in a strongly individual manner. Variance partitioning in both linear regression and redundancy analyses showed that the downstream species pool was the most important determinant of fish species richness, community composition and abundance at urban stream sites. The effect of the local stream environment proved to be moderate, while purely urbanization variables explained only a very small proportion of variance in the data. The relative importance of shared fractions depended on the examined fish assemblage variable, but, in general, was also low or moderate. Additional principal component analyses indicated that community similarity between urban and associated non-urban "reference sites" varied widely, and that the sites did not separate to urban and reference fish community types. Overall, the results highlight that the degree of urbanization is not a strong determinant of local stream habitat and fish community characteristics in this region. Rather, historical species pool and stream characteristics shape fish communities with urbanization playing a rather individual role in some streams. Thus, rehabilitation of urban streams should not only focus on local habitat improvements, but rather consider how dispersal mechanisms from non- urban segments influence community organization at the urban sites.

AB  - The study focused on the attractiveness of mulches (consisting of the addition of a layer material to the soil surface) and their efficiency to promote recolonization by pedofauna of isolated and degraded areas. The experimental study was set up in the former coal mining area of Northern France. This area is particularly disturbed and fragmented by land-use change, urbanization, industry, intensive agriculture and metal pollution. To examine the movements of pedofauna, four kinds of mulches were applied: (i) Ramial Chipped Wood (RCW), (ii) chopped Miscanthus, (iii) dead leaves and (iv) wheat straw as well as plastic sheeting, a material often used in green spaces. A negative control consisted in soil without mulch addition. The experimental set-up consisted of a set of 18 bands of mulch (6 m long x 0.5 m width x 8 cm thick, i.e. a volume of 0.04 m(3) per band) installed on three adjacent plots on a surface area which stretch on 4400 m(2): (i) plot F1, a mixed plantation, (ii) plot M consisted of three rows of maples (both considered to be the reservoir of biodiversity) and (iii) plot BF, an ash plantation (with lower biodiversity). Faunistic communities of soil present within the mulches were monitoring using pitfall traps for four months (April to July), at a rate of eight surveys for each of the 90 traps installed, i.e. 720 samples. Different life traits and indices of diversity were studied, more specifically on carabid beetles. The main objective of the study was first to check whether mulches could or not reconnect different planted plots in a peri-urban landscape highly modified by human activities. The second aim was to find which type of mulch had the best efficiency in the recovery of the connectivity between plots. The last questions were which type of zoological groups could be favoured by the use of mulches and which benefits for ecosystem functioning. The main hypotheses of this study were: (i) Organic mulches would act as dispersal corridors and refuge zones to the soil organisms; (ii) organic mulches would be attractive to many organisms with various ecological needs.
   This study highlighted the potential benefits of using the mulching technique to support ecological connectivity in disturbed environment since this method highlighted the presence of individuals with different diets (saprophagous, predators, phytophagous and so forth), small and large size species which do not have the same dispersal capacities as well as species that are more dependent on forest environments and others that depend on Ymore open environments. The study concluded that organic mulches are more favourable to pedofauna than soil without mulch or plastic sheeting. With regard to organic mulches, no difference was noted, either in terms of cumulative abundance or monthly monitoring. However, for carabids, it should be noted that dead leaves and wheat straw have higher specific richness than Miscanthus and RCW.

AB  - As one of the most dominant ecosystems of urban green space, turfgrasses provide a wide range of ecosystem services. However, little is known about the interactions of microbial communities in turfgrass soils and how these interactions respond to expanding development of impervious surfaces during watershed urbanization. In this study, we analyzed bacterial communities and their co-occurrence patterns in turfgrass soils along an urbanization gradient as measured by the proportion of impervious surfaces in Jiulong River watershed in Fujian, China. Results show that the diversity and network size of bacterial communities negatively associated with impervious surfaces. The bacterial communities showed non-random co-occurrence patterns, with more intra-module connections observed for urbanized networks. The co-occurrence network with distinct modules of soil samples with contrasting land cover imperviousness suggested different functional organizations with altered microbial nitrogen processes. Structural equation modelling revealed that watershed impervious surfaces had indirect impacts on microbial connectivity by altering soil properties, including pH, temperature, moisture, C/N and nitrate (NO3-). Moreover, impervious surfaces affected microbial connectivity far more than human population density. Our study highlights the significance of human disturbances in affecting microbial interactions and assemblies in turfgrass ecosystems through impervious surfaces and provides benefits for sustainable urban planning and management at a watershed scale.

AB  - Interest in the green infrastructure of cities has rapidly increased in recent years. The reasons are several but generally relate to the great increase of research and policy on sustainable urban development. Of particular importance here is the more recent shift in this field towards greater emphasis on biodiversity and urban ecosystems and not only climate change and environmental engineering. This shift brings new demands for a deeper understanding of the morphology of green infrastructures in cities, understood as ecological environments and not only as areas for human use, as has been the general case in urban morphology. In an earlier paper (Marcus et al., 2019), we discussed how descriptions of landscape patterns of both urban and natural kinds, as developed in urban morphology and landscape ecology respectively, could be integrated into a joint socio-ecological spatial morphology. That paper outlined a framework for such a morphology where green (and blue) as well as built-up areas in cities can be jointly described as configurations of patches. However, the discussion in that paper does not address how to capture the relation between such configurations and the processes that they structure, or how such processes over time may alter such configurations, which is the aim of the present paper. It does so by extending the theory of generic function (Hillier, 1996) to other species than humans, and by applying the theory of affordances (Gibson, 1986) as a means to develop distance measures specific for different species. The origin of the discussion in both papers is the need for progress in sustainable urban development for which this relation is vital, since if we are to address the function of both urban and ecological systems through spatial form, we need to develop an understanding of how such patterns underpin and structure urban and ecological systems.

AB  - Knowledge about urban forests in Poland is still limited, as it is primarily based on aggregate, formal data relating to the general area, ignoring the spatial dimension and informal green areas. This article describes and analyses spatio-temporal changes in the actual urban forest resources in Wroclaw in 1944-2017, which covers the first period of the city's rebuilding after its destruction during World War II and its development during the nationalised, centrally-planned socialist economy, as well as the second period of intensive and only partly controlled growth under conditions of market economy. The study is based on current and historical orthophotomaps, which were confronted with cartographic data, as well as planning documents. We found that between 1944 and 2017, the percentage contribution of informal woodlands increased tenfold (from 0.5 to 4.9% of the present total area of the city). The area occupied by such forests has grown particularly during the most recent years of the city's intensive development. However, the forests have been increasingly fragmented. During the first period, new forest areas were also created in the immediate vicinity of the city centre, while during the second one, only in its peripheral sections. The post-war plans regarding the urban green spaces (UGS), including the current plan, are very conservative in nature. On the one hand, this means no interference with the oldest, biggest, and most valuable forest complexes, but on the other hand, insufficient consideration of the intensive built-up area expansion on former agriculture areas. Only to a limited extent did the above-mentioned plans take into account the informal woodlands, which provide an opportunity for strengthening the functional connectivity of landscape.

AB  - The study of beta diversity patterns, as well as their underlying mechanisms, is fundamental for the understanding of community structure in aquatic ecosystems. Here, we aimed to investigate patterns of beta diversity in cladoceran, copepod, and rotifer assemblages in the Parnaiba and Poti rivers, along the urban perimeter of the city of Teresina (Piaui, Brazil) and to evaluate the effect of environmental, spatial, and temporal factors on beta diversity in the zooplankton assemblages. We used the Simplex analysis to represent the relative importance of replacement and abundance difference to beta diversity. The decomposition of beta diversity into its components was performed using the Ruzicka dissimilarity index, for abundance data. Distance-based Redundancy Analyses and variation partitioning were used to explore the relations between explanatory variables and beta diversity and its components. We found that beta diversity was high both spatially and temporally, and the abundance difference component showed greater relative importance than the replacement component. Environmental factors showed a greater contribution to the total explained variability in beta diversity and abundance difference, while replacement received most importance of temporal and spatial variables. Our study provides new insights on how environmental, spatial, and temporal factors shape beta diversity patterns in zooplankton assemblages in impacted aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Stream bacterioplankton communities, a crucial component of aquatic ecosystems and surface water quality, are shaped by environmental selection (i.e., changes in taxa abundance associated with more or less favorable abiotic conditions) and passive dispersal (i.e., organisms' abundance and distribution is a function of the movement of the water). These processes are a function of hydrologic conditions such as residence time and water chemistry, which are mediated by human infrastructure. To quantify the role of environmental conditions, dispersal, and human infrastructure (dams) on stream bacterioplankton, we measured bacterioplankton community composition in rivers from sub-alpine to urban environments in three watersheds (Utah, United States) across three seasons. Of the 53 environmental parameters measured (including physicochemical parameters, solute concentrations, and catchment characteristics), trace element concentrations explained the most variability in bacterioplankton community composition using Redundancy Analysis ordination. Trace elements may correlate with bacterioplankton due to the commonality in source of water and microorganisms, and/or environmental selection creating more or less favorable conditions for bacteria. Bacterioplankton community diversity decreased downstream along parts of the stream continuum but was disrupted where large reservoirs increased water residence time by orders of magnitude, potentially indicating a shift in the relative importance of environmental selection and dispersal at these sites. Reservoirs also had substantial effects on community composition, dissimilarity (Bray-Curtis distance) and species interactions as indicated by co-occurrence networks. Communities downstream of reservoirs were enriched with anaerobic Sporichthyaceae, methanotrophic Methylococcaceae, and iron-transforming Acidimicrobiales, suggesting alternative metabolic pathways became active in the hypolimnion of large reservoirs. Our results identify that human activity affects river microbial communities, with potential impacts on water quality through modified biogeochemical cycling.

AB  - Populations of the western spadefoot (Spea hammondii) in southern California occur in one of the most urbanized and fragmented landscapes on the planet and have lost up to 80% of their native habitat. Orange County is one of the last strongholds for this pond-breeding amphibian in the region, and ongoing restoration efforts targeting S. hammondii have involved habitat protection and the construction of artificial breeding ponds. These efforts have successfully increased breeding activity, but genetic characterization of the populations, including estimates of effective population size and admixture between the gene pools of constructed artificial and natural ponds, has never been undertaken. Using thousands of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we characterized the population structure, genetic diversity, and genetic connectivity of spadefoots in Orange County to guide ongoing and future management efforts. We identified at least 2, and possibly 3 major genetic clusters, with additional substructure within clusters indicating that individual ponds are often genetically distinct. Estimates of landscape resistance suggest that ponds on either side of the Los Angeles Basin were likely interconnected historically, but intense urban development has rendered them essentially isolated, and the resulting risk of interruption to natural metapopulation dynamics appears to be high. Resistance surfaces show that the existing artificial ponds were well-placed and connected to natural populations by low-resistance corridors. Toad samples from all ponds (natural and artificial) returned extremely low estimates of effective population size, possibly due to a bottleneck caused by a recent multi-year drought. Management efforts should focus on maintaining gene flow among natural and artificial ponds by both assisted migration and construction of new ponds to bolster the existing pond network in the region.

AB  - The traditional theory about the right to the city resulted an absence of debate about women and gender in the use and belonging to cities, erasing the different ways of experiencing the city between men and women. From this blank, we debated the right to the city in a feminist and intersectional perspective, arguing about the different experiences of women in urban spaces from race, class and generation. Then, thinking about public acts of the feminist movement, such as the March of Sluts, we discussed the different positions and forms of political action within feminism based on social markers of difference, taking the generational issue as a central point. Thus we ask ourselves how do young women fight in and for cities? To answer this question, we analyze interviews with young women who participated in the secondary and secondary occupation movement in 2015 and 2016, discussing their role in the movement, in addition to other issues such as subjectivation processes triggered in the struggle for cities.

AB  - Establishing forest protection standards is essential for biodiversity conservation and for ensuring the public water supply. This study evaluated whether compliance with environmental legislation aimed at protecting the Atlantic Forest is sufficient to minimize the negative effects of urban pressure on the conservation of biodiversity in the water source area of the Billings reservoir in the municipality of Diadema. To assess the effectiveness of environmental legislation, we created a current land use and land cover map as well as maps for an expected legal scenario and evaluated both using landscape metrics. Our findings indicate that forest resource availability in the area is critical but can be improved by compliance with legal obligations, which have complementary effects and the potential to promote less fragmented landscapes. On the other hand, they do not prevent the tendency of fragmentation caused by the surrounding urban matrix, which can reduce the positive effect of the legal compliance on forest conservation in cases of consolidated urban areas.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation results in the loss of seed dispersers and subsequently leads to low regeneration and functional decline of forests. However, very few studies on disperser decline and seedling regeneration have been conducted in urban forest systems. In three isolated forest patches in Wuhan, central China, acorn dispersers, acorn dispersal, acorn deposition patterns in soil seed banks and seedling recruitment of the dominant animal-dispersed tree species (Quercus chenii) were investigated over four consecutive years (2014 to 2017). The hypothesis tested was that the loss of acorn dispersers caused by forest fragmentation leads to low regeneration and functional degradation of the urban forest system. As predicted by the hypothesis, very few acorn dispersers (only a few Chinese white-bellied rats, Niviventer confucianus, and Eurasian jays, Garrulus glandarius, were observed) existed in the forest patches; thus, almost all of the acorns were left on the soil surface under the mother trees, where conditions are not favorable for germination and establishment. Large acorns had higher probabilities of germination and seedling establishment than did small acorns when they were buried in the soil. These results suggest that regeneration of fragmented urban forests is increasingly hampered by sharp reduction in seed disperser abundance. Planting large seeds in the soil may compensate for the low regeneration caused by disperser loss in fragmented urban forests.

AB  - The surrounding landscape of ancient Pergamon is characterized by several mountain ranges, the Bakircay Valley and River and the Aegean coastline. The accessibility of this region was vital for the city since it provided food and resources as well as trade, communication and military movements, all facilitated by a well-developed route network. Despite the importance of roads for the development and prosperity of the city, the ancient route network is still widely unexplored and archeological evidence of roads is extremely rare. This study therefore aims to reconstruct the ancient route network in the surroundings of Pergamon by combining historical and archeological sources with modern computer-aided least-cost path analyses, while also considering changes in the landscape that have occurred since antiquity. Based on these detailed results, conclusions may be drawn about the characteristics and functional diversity of the routes. Although the investigation of the route network in the surroundings of Pergamon cannot be considered complete, the results of this study already offer a valuable basis for further research, analyses, modeling and field work.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most influential land use changes globally and continues to affect wetland ecosystems and their biota. Freshwater turtles, which rely on both terrestrial and aquatic habitats to complete their life cycles, are one of the most endangered vertebrate groups, with approximately 60% of species threatened. Although habitat alteration caused by urbanization is recognized as one of the main threats to freshwater turtles, there is a paucity of studies quantifying the effects of terrestrial habitat change on turtle populations.
   The aim of this study was to determine how terrestrial land use change, associated with urbanization, influences the viability of freshwater turtle populations. Thirty-three wetlands were sampled for the southwestern snake-necked turtle (Chelodina colliei Gray, 1856) (Chelidae) between October 2016 and February 2017 within a region of continuing urban intensification. Land use and habitat types were classified at the aquatic-terrestrial interface and within a 300-m band around each wetland. Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify the land use variables that best explained the relative abundance of C. colliei.
   Turtle abundance and population structure varied widely among wetlands. The percentage of residential land use, and the presence and accessibility of fringing native vegetation, was positively associated with the relative abundance of C. colliei. The association with residential land use may be an artefact of historical land use, whereas the association with native vegetation is probably because adjacent vegetation provides connectivity with suitable nesting sites, and thus facilitates increased recruitment.
   This study shows how the modification of terrestrial habitat around wetlands may directly influence the population viability of freshwater turtles. Protection and restoration of native vegetation fringing urban wetlands is crucial to support the viability of remnant freshwater turtle populations.

AB  - Optimization of the urban landscape composition and configuration through initiative planning is important to sustainable development of the drylands of northern China (DNC). Taking the agro-pastoral transitional zone of northern China (APTZNC) as an example, this paper developed an approach of sustainable urban landscape planning (SULP) under the stress of climate change in the DNC. First, we quantify the amount of water resources under the future climate change impacts (CCI). Then, we adjust the urban land area based on water resources carrying capacity constraints. Finally, we use the LUSD-urban (Land Use Scenario Dynamics-urban) model to adjust the configuration of the urban landscape to avoid occupying important natural habitats and corridors, prime croplands, and floodplains. We find that the SULP can effectively mitigate the comprehensive effects of regional urban landscape dynamics on water resources, food security, ecological security, and flood risks. By performing the SULP, prime croplands, floodplains, and important natural habitats and corridors occupied by urban land will decrease by 2,187 km(2), 750 km(2), and 130 km(2), respectively, during the period of 2015-2050 in the APTZNC. We also find that the proposed approach can effectively manage the impacts of climate change on water resource capacity and reduce water stress of the entire APTZNC and its sub-regions. Thus, the proposed SULP approach and the experiences from the case study in the APTZNC are helpful for guiding urban landscape planning to achieve sustainable development of cities in the DNC and even in the drylands around the world.

AB  - The rapid economic growth of Saudi cities after the discovery of oil in 1960 had some disadvantages, the most significant of which was the rapid search for alternatives to urban development and the acceleration of urban growth in its major cities and villages. That contributed to the implementation of certain planning policies based on the heavy use of large-scale vehicles. These policies have been instrumental in increasing horizontal expansion, which has been linked to the increased need to rely on cars as a means of movement and not to adopt public transport such as metro and railways. In this research, one of the main cities in the Asir region, which is the administrative capital of Abha, which has been evaluated and analyzed. Space syntax is an informative theory that stands on the structure of urban graphs. Utilizing syntactic analysis, the impact of highways and arterial roads on the integration and connectivity orientation in the urban structure of the city is analyzed, and the constraints and opportunities for development in the building use map are identified. Resulting in isolated parts of districts with no pedestrian routes to connect them, this methodology allows us to determine the main points in the structure of the city where pedestrian accessibility can be added in order to provide the remedy to overcome the shortage in the city's network system (i.e., crossovers, tunnels, etc.). In addition, the impact on the human dimension of the living community, the diversity of land use, and real estate financial classifications were discussed, while the principles of sustainable planning were used to enhance the integration of walkability in the built environment, which was the goal of this study.

AB  - Water monitors (Varanus salvator macromaculatus) are large lizards that inhabit wetlands. However, populations seem to be declining due to habitat fragmentation resulting from urban development. To develop an effective strategic conservation plan, the genetic diversity and population structure of water monitors at Bang Kachao Peninsula, a rich urban ecosystem in Bangkok, were analyzed using mitochondrial (mt) D-loop II sequences and microsatellite genotyping. Both genetic markers indicated a high degree of population-level genetic diversity. The consistency of the star-shaped haplotype network and results of neutrality tests strongly suggest the occurrence of a recent expansion in the population, possibly driven by anthropogenic urbanization. Subpopulations at Bang Kachao Peninsula are unlikely but gene flow between water monitors has occurred, which is suggestive of female-based dispersal. The large population of water monitors at Bang Kachao Peninsula creates conflict with local residents. Long-term population management through translocation has been conducted by captive management at Varanus Farm Kamphaeng Saen. The results of genetic monitoring indicate that the captive research population was soundly established. Comparison of allelic profiles between the two populations is necessary before translocation of water monitor groups from Bang Kachao Peninsula to Varanus Farm Kamphaeng Saen to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This work is the first step toward establishment of long-term ecological monitoring and an in situ/ex-situ conservation program, which are part of attempts to promote biodiversity in Thailand, following scientific principles.

AB  - Conversion and fragmentation of wildlife habitat often leads to smaller and isolated populations and can reduce a species' ability to disperse across the landscape. As a consequence, genetic drift can quickly lower genetic variation and increase vulnerability to extirpation. For species of conservation concern, quantification of population size and connectivity can clarify the influence of genetic drift in local populations and provides important information for conservation management and recovery strategies. Here, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and capture-mark-recapture methods to evaluate the genetic diversity and demography within seven focal sites of the endangered San Francisco gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia), a species affected by alteration and isolation of wetland habitats throughout its distribution. The primary goals were to determine the population structure and degree of genetic isolation among T. s. tetrataenia populations and estimate effective size and population abundance within sites to better understand the present and future importance of genetic drift. We also used temporally sampled datasets to examine the magnitude of genetic change over time. We found moderate population genetic structure throughout the San Francisco Peninsula that partitions sites into northern and southern regional clusters. Point estimates of both effective size and population abundance were generally small (<= 100) for a majority of the sites, and estimates were particularly low in the northern populations. Genetic analyses of temporal datasets indicated an increase in genetic differentiation, especially for the most geographically isolated sites, and decreased genetic diversity over time in at least one site (Pacifica). Our results suggest that drift-mediated processes as a functiyon of small population size and reduced connectivity from neighboring populations may decrease diversity and increase differentiation. Improving genetic diversity and connectivity among T. s. tetrataenia populations could promote persistence of this endangered snake.

AB  - Unexpected disruptions in an urban transportation system may severely damage its structure and functionality. The resilience of urban transportation networks, i.e. the ability to recover from destroyed conditions, is thus significant for the mobility of passengers and freight in cities. However, its definition and measurement have been confused with robustness. This research advances a trackable assessment framework for the resilience of two typical urban transportation modes, i.e. road system and metro system, considering the characteristics of their structure and functionality. Individual vertex-based and edge-based failure models are established for the two transportation systems based on their network models. The proposed measurement approach is applied to an inner-city road freight system and the metro system in Hangzhou, China, to analyse their resilience, considering different combinations of vertex-based and edge-based failures. The proposed approach is compared with an efficiency-based resilience measurement method and outperforms in two parts. First, it has a broader application than previous related methods because it can describe disruptions occurring on one directed vertex or edge using a directed network model. Second, the new method outputs more reliable results due to considering more structural and functional characteristics of urban transportation systems than previous methods.

AB  - Urban greenways have been recognized as an important strategy to improve human-scale quality in high-density built environments. Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques.

AB  - In recent years, rapid population growth and urbanization that have grown in parallel with industrialization have caused cities to develop on natural areas. This development has brought about changes in natural areas and ecological cycle. In this study, the effects of the development of Usak urban area on natural and urban open green spaces in the fifty years between 1954-2004 were investigated. The data were obtained from aerial photographs of Usak urban area in 1954, 1971, 1994 and Ikonos satellite image of 2004. Obtaining numerical data and creating visual maps used in the study method were performed with Arc Map 9.2 geographic information system software, The gamma index was used to measure the quantitative changes of the landscape structure and connection status of the open green spaces in the urban area of Usak. In addition, the structures of open green spaces (urban open green space usage types) were analyzed and mapped. Structural evaluation within the context of connection analysis was effective to see the size and distribution and changes of open green spaces in the city. As a result of the study, it is seen that the open green areas were fragmented. shrunk and disappeared in time between 1954-2004. The maximum decrease in the connection status of urban open green spaces was observed between 1954-1971. The most significant open area loss occurred between 1971-1994. The structural quality of the open green areas, which constitute the realization of ecological cycles. lost value between 1994-2004. At the same time, the Dokuzsele River bed which provides an important connection as an ecological corridor in urban development has undergone significant changes between 1954-2004.

AB  - Human disturbance in the landscape lead to dramatic changes in the spatial structure of landscape patterns. This paper takes the Chongqing Three Gorges Reservoir area of China as case study to carry out gradient change analysis of the landscape pattern. Firstly, the coupled inflection point analysis, information loss method, and principal component analysis are used to determine the optimal grain size in a landscape gradient analysis. Secondly, the multidirectional gradient transect method is selected to analyze the law of landscape gradient change and the change of the landscape index. Finally, we analyzed various landscapes at the type level and obtained the distributions of the landscape types. The research highlights the gradient characteristics and landscape structure responses of typical transects of landscape subdivision types. The main results are as follows: (1) The optimal grain size of gradient analysis is 50 m. The patch density, patch shape complexity, and land use abundance of transects from the head to the tail of the reservoir increase. (2) At the landscape level, low mountain areas are more strongly blocked, and landscape connectivity reaches a minimum. At the type level, the landscape shape in the urban-rural interface zone is more complex. (3) Various landscape types are regularly ordered and form the gradient of "urban-agricultural-natural."

AB  - For urban planning and environmental monitoring, it is essential to understand the diversity and complexity of cities to identify urban functional regions accurately and widely. However, the existing methods developed in the literature for identifying urban functional regions have mainly been focused on single remote sensing image data or social sensing data. The multi-dimensional information which was attained from various data source and could reflect the attribute or function about the urban functional regions that could be lost in some extent. To sense urban functional regions comprehensively and accurately, we developed a multi-mode framework through the integration of spatial geographic characteristics of remote sensing images and the functional distribution characteristics of social sensing data of Point-of-Interest (POI). In this proposed framework, a deep multi-scale neural network was developed first for the functional recognition of remote sensing images in urban areas, which explored the geographic feature information implicated in remote sensing. Second, the POI function distribution was analyzed in different functional areas of the city, then the potential relationship between POI data categories and urban region functions was explored based on the distance metric. A new RPF module is further deployed to fuse the two characteristics in different dimensions and improve the identification performance of urban region functions. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can efficiently achieve the accuracy of 82.14% in the recognition of functional regions. It showed the great usability of the proposed framework in the identification of urban functional regions and the potential to be applied in a wide range of areas.

AB  - Dispersal is a key process driving local-scale community assembly and global-scale biogeography of plant symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities. A trait-based approach could improve predictions regarding how AM fungal aerial dispersal varies by species. We conducted month-long collections of aerial AM fungi for 12 consecutive months in an urban mesic environment at heights of 20 m. We measured morphological functional traits of collected spores and assessed aerial AM fungal community structure both morphologically and with high-throughput sequencing. Large numbers of AM fungal spores were present in the air over the course of 1 yr, and these spores exhibited traits that facilitate aerial dispersal. Measured aerial spores were smaller than average for Glomeromycotinan fungi. Trait-based predictions indicate that nearly one third of described species from diverse genera demonstrate the potential for aerial dispersal. Diversity of aerial AM fungi was relatively high (20 spore species and 17 virtual taxa), and both spore abundance and community structure shifted temporally. The prevalence of aerial dispersal in AM fungi is perhaps greater than previously indicated, and a hypothesized model of AM fungal aerial dispersal mechanisms is presented. Anthropogenic soil impacts may liberate AM fungal propagules initiating the dispersal of ruderal species.

AB  - Understanding where and how human land use causes ecological consequences is essential for habitat conservation. However, the assessment of the ecological disturbance caused by human land use is usually shaped by the area change in ecological land. The comprehensive evaluation of ecological disturbance based on the losses and gains of ecological patches is neglected. This paper analyzed the land use change between agricultural land, construction land, and ecological land from 1995 to 2015 in Jiangsu Province of eastern China. The ecological disturbance was quantificationally evaluated by a proposed index that considered both the changes of habitat area and fragmentation caused by the losses and gains of ecological landscape patches. The findings showed that there was a slight increase in area of ecological land in Jiangsu Province; however, ecological fragmentation was becoming severe with the growth of human land use, which, in turn, resulted in increased ecological disturbance. The losses and gains in the area and fragmentation of ecological land were comprehensively reflected using the proposed ecological disturbance index. Negative ecological disturbance was more likely to be observed at the edge of the city centers, ecologically sensitive areas, and counties with low area ratios of ecological land. Ecological governance policies should be formulated and implemented based on quantity, quality, and spatial relationships between human land use and ecological disturbance.

AB  - Protected area systems include sites preserved by various institutions and mechanisms, but the benefits to biodiversity provided by different types of sites are poorly understood. Protected areas established by local communities for various reasons may provide complementary benefits to those established by large-scale agencies and organizations. Local communities are geographically constrained, however, and it remains unclear how effectively they protect biodiversity. We explored this issue by focusing on protected areas established through direct democracy via local ballot initiatives whereby communities vote to tax themselves for open space preservation. We compared the effectiveness of local ballot-protected areas to areas protected by a large-scale conservation actor, The Nature Conservancy (TNC). We evaluated how well the two protected area types correspond with amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals and special status elements of natural diversity. Local ballot-protected areas differed from those of TNC in terms of size, location, proximity to urban areas and habitat diversity. In terms of potential habitat coverage, local ballot-protected areas outperformed TNC sites for all species groups with the exception of special status elements of natural diversity. While not necessarily targeting wildlife and habitats, we conclude that locally established protected areas can make an important contribution to biodiversity conservation.

This study aims to investigate the dynamics of urban greenness space patterns through landscape indices and to apply geographically weighted regression (GWR) to map the spatially varied impact on the indices from economic and environmental factors. Two typical landscape indices, i.e., percentage of landscape (PLAND) and aggregation index (AI), which measure the abundance and fragmentation of urban greenness coverage, respectively, were taken to map the changes in urban greenness. As a case study, the metropolis of Wuhan, China was selected, where time-series of urban greenness space were extracted at an annual step from the Landsat collections from Google Earth Engine during 2000-2018. The study shows that the urban greenness space not only decreased significantly, but also tended to be more fragmented over the years. Road network density, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), terrain elevation and slope, and precipitation were found to significantly correlate to the landscape indices. GWR modeling successfully captures the spatially varied impact from the considered factors and the results from GWR modeling provide a critical reference for making location-specific urban planning.

AB  - Establishing ecological security patterns provides new ideas for maintaining regional ecological security. Methods for establishing these patterns have been extensively investigated in several studies, but the ecological protection effects of these patterns need further examination. Nanchang is the capital city of jiangixi province and a typical representative of rapidly developing cities. With the proposal of an ecological environment protection plan for Nanchang metropolitan area, the coordinated development of ecology, economy and society has become the local development goal. This study used Nanchang City as an example for the establishment of an ecological security pattern through the circuit theory. The ecological sources of a 1068.56 km(2) location and 20 ecological corridors with a total area of 957.39 km(2) were identified. Three development scenarios in 2015-2040 were set up, namely, unrestricted development (UD), core area protection (CP) and ecological security pattern restriction (ESPR) scenarios. The UD scenario followed the land expansion rate from 2010 to 2015. The CP scenario used a nature reserve as a forbidden conversion area. Under the ESPR scenario, ecological security pattern was regarded as a prohibited conversion area. The CLUMondo model was used in simulating land use and evaluating the ecological protection effects of the scenarios. Through comparison, we determined that the ecological security indices under UD, CP and ESPR were 0.230, 0.242 and 0.249, respectively, from the perspective of the overall ecological security of the region. In the evaluation of the landscape characteristics of EL, under ESPR, the landscape connectivity was the best. The detailed analysis results showed that the ecological security pattern not only could protect the regional ecological security on the regional scale but also had an outstanding protection effect on the local scale. In summary, compared with the UD and CP scenarios, ecological security patterns had a better effect on regional ecological protection. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - River floodplains are hotspots of productivity and biodiversity and recognized to fulfil vital ecosystem functions and services. Restoration measures of the decoupled Danube floodplains east of Vienna aim to re-establish multi-functionality, that is, ensure navigation, preserve and restore unique fluvial and riparian habitats and re-establish natural processes and service provisioning. Side-channels are proposed for reconnection combined with the removal of embankments and groins. We evaluated how a programme of measures influences the diversity and quantity of specific ecosystem services (ES) and therefore, the overall multi-functionality of the floodplain compared to the current situation. Therefore, regulating ecosystem services (RES), such as nutrient retention and habitat provisioning, were modelled and predicted using multivariate regression models. Also, the potential of cultural ecosystem services (CES) was assessed based on mapping of recreational activities. The impact of proposed measures on ES quantity, that is, quantitative spatial representation, and quality, that is, biodiversity and nature experience, as well as potential synergies and trade-offs were analysed. Our results show clear synergies especially for RES (habitat for the rheotopic community and nutrient retention) and the CES of nature experience. Those services have a weak and local trade-off with the quantitative availability of opportunities for recreation. This pattern could only be detected by considering both, quantitative as well as qualitative aspects of ES. Overall, our results show that the restoration measures have a high potential to increase the multi-functionality of the floodplain system by supporting the provisioning of RES including habitat for endangered species and selected CES.

AB  - The integration of geography and machine learning can produce novel approaches in addressing a variety of problems occurring in natural and human environments. This article presents an experiment that identifies cities that are similar according to their land use data. The article presents interesting preliminary experiments with screenshots of maps from the Czech map portal. After successfully working with the map samples, the study focuses on identifying cities with similar land use structures. The Copernicus European Urban Atlas 2012 was used as a source dataset (data valid years 2015-2018). The Urban Atlas freely offers land use datasets of nearly 800 functional urban areas in Europe. To search for similar cities, a set of maps detailing land use in European cities was prepared in ArcGIS. A vector of image descriptors for each map was subsequently produced using a pre-trained neural network, known as Painters, in Orange software. As a typical data mining task, the nearest neighbor function analyzes these descriptors according to land use patterns to find look-alike cities. Example city pairs based on land use are also presented in this article. The research question is whether the existing pre-trained neural network outside cartography is applicable for categorization of some thematic maps with data mining tasks such as clustering, similarity, and finding the nearest neighbor. The article's contribution is a presentation of one possible method to find cities similar to each other according to their land use patterns, structures, and shapes. Some of the findings were surprising, and without machine learning, could not have been evident through human visual investigation alone.

AB  - Cities have been exposed to an uncontrolled change, consumption, and transformation process because of the profit-oriented planning systems with the developments dependent on technology and capital. Due to the reasons that can be detailed under major circumstances such as the increase in the private vehicle usage, the planning approaches generated for public spaces during the modernism period, the determination of regional distinctions with stable boundaries, the disconnection in the transitions of public-private spaces, and the inaccurate applications in decontamination of city centres from industry, military and massive transportation areas; caused the existence of the remnant space problematic nature. Especially in cities that are developed very fast, urban outdoor spaces cannot adapt to this process and transform into remnant spaces with generating different problems in daily life. The main theme of the study is to define these problematic urban pieces formally and conceptually in today's upper-modern city context, which is defined with extremism. In the upper-modern city, there are critical changes in public space because of globalization. All the terms and qualifications that are attached to public space; remain incapable because those changes occur in a very fast time period. To explain the upper modern urban space through the scope of anthropology; the urban fabric should produce daily identical interactions, but in upper-modern cities, urban fabric has various losses because of temporary interactions. In the scope of anthropology, the historical and contextual side of the urban space is so valuable, unique, and nominative but in an upper-modern cities, urban space is general and has connectivity problems with its context and close environment. After expanding the meaning of the upper-modern city; remnant space is defined within the interactive relation of the existing similar terms in the international literature. Lands of contempt, empty space, border vacuums, defensible space, lost space, space of uncertainty, awkward space, residual space, gapscape, modern wasteland, and liminal space are associated with the remnant terms. These associated terms helped to explain the remnant space through the emphasis of potentials as new public spaces of the upper-modern cities. The aim of the study is to evaluate the potentials of remnant spaces within the publicity, questioning their spatial offsets in the upper modern city and emphasise the necessity of regenerating these spaces through a theoretical approach that focuses on the human experience. In this context, the Low-Line Railway, which is one of the most important transportation arteries of London, has been examined as a remnant space. The Low-Line refers to the important city flows along the route in between Southwark tube station in the west, London Bridge Station in the east. The most important key approach is to evaluate a remnant space within its unique context to explore its core potential of the remnant space. For this reason, the remnant space is evaluated within its dynamic context by addressing a group of specifications that emphasise the human scale importance as a basis. Resilience; adapting to contextual changes.
   Placemaking; defining the functional requirements by understanding user needs, regeneration; supporting the remnant space with new values. Social interaction; encouraging active living and recreation. Exemplary; creating an example approach by enhancing biodiversity within the city. Green infrastructure; generating nature-based sustainable solutions for the area. Active pedestrian flow: providing opportunities to reduce the dominance of vehicles. Communication and engagement; getting involved in the user experience, residents, and businesses into the process. Through these criteria, awarded competition projects have been evaluated and potentials of the remnant space have been exposed by enhancing user experience importance.

AB  - Urbanization alters the landscape, degrades and fragments habitats, and can have a profound effect on species interactions. Plant-pollinator networks may be particularly sensitive to urbanization, because plants and their insect pollinators have been shown to respond to urbanization both positively and negatively. To better understand the relationship between urbanization, pollinator behavior, and season on pollinator-mediated plant reproduction, we created 30 experimental plant populations along an urbanization gradient in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. To test how urbanization affects plant reproduction and between-patch pollen dispersal, we created a standard hermaphroditic plant patch at each site, and a male-sterile plant patch at a subset of sites. We measured plant reproduction in the early and late summer in each of 2 years. Plants in urban sites produced significantly fewer flowers than plants in the nonurban sites, whereas seed number per plant either increased or decreased with urbanization, depending on the season. Experimental populations in urban sites also exhibited reduced pollen dispersal between patches. Pollen dispersal between patches was greatest early in the summer and declined with increased impervious surface and proximity to the city. Together, our results are likely caused by variation in environmental conditions and pollinator services across the urban gradient, resulting in pollen limitation and pollen dispersal differences among sites. Our work adds to the small but growing body of literature on urban plant-pollinator interactions and suggests that responses to urbanization are context-dependent.

AB  - River areas are undoubtedly among the most valuable territorial areas in Europe, not only in terms of their eco-landscape and use but also, culturally. However, there is currently a sharp reduction in the extension and increase of deterioration of riverbanks around the world. A substantial part of losses and deterioration are associated with the artificialization of the territories, derived mainly from a less than respectful urbanization around these landscapes. Urban and peri-urban riverbanks are landscapes in expansion due to the continuous growth of built-up spaces. Therefore, they should be areas of preferential consideration, especially in territories with a marked tendency to dryness, like the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. This article aims to contribute to our understanding of these spaces through the study of four distinct cases in the centre of the peninsula, in particular: the river Manzanares running through the city of Madrid, the river Tagus in Toledo and running through Talavera de la Reina, and the river Henares in Guadalajara. Three of the four urban water courses analyzed are zones of special interest for waterfowl: they sustain a winter population that varies between 745 and 1529 birds and they provide a home to some globally threatened species. The density of the riparian birds is also very high during winter, these values oscillating between a mean of 141.16 and 240.12 birds/10 ha. It should be noted that the diversity of this group of birds in the four regions studies is also high (H > 2.4 nats). The article also examines the interventions and the urban planning criteria applied to these urban and peri-urban river spaces, inferring the need to reassess urban planning in river areas to ensure it is compatible with their operation, values and possible uses.

AB  - Suburban metropolitan areas across the United States have become racially diverse. We examine this novel spatial demography in relation to pollution levels across census tracts within the greater Houston area for the year 2015. We integrate a multigroup measure of racial diversity (the Entropy Index) with information on pollution levels from the Toxics Release Inventory. Maps of these two variables show that racial diversity tends to be higher in the Houston suburbs where pollution levels tend to be lower. Indeed, across five different spatial regression models, we find that tract-level racial diversity is negatively correlated with pollution levels, controlling for a host of other factors, including population size and land area. We outline this finding as a human ecology approach to urban environmental inequality; specifically, we speculate that recent demographic shifts, like the "back-to-the-city" movement, are modifying the dynamics of environmental inequality in cities.

AB  - Understanding how fundamental aspects of species' ecology, such as diet, are affected in human-dominated landscapes is vital for informing management and conserving biodiversity - particularly where species influence important ecosystem functions. Digging, mycophagous ('fungus-eating') mammals play various such roles, including the dispersal of hypogeal ('truffle-like') fungi. The endangered, mycophagous southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus obesulus: Peramelidae) persists in a peri-urban landscape south-east of Melbourne, Australia, where it occupies both 'novel' habitats (linear strips of vegetation along roadsides, drains and railway lines) and 'remnant' habitats (larger blocks of native vegetation) within dedicated conservation areas. It remains unknown how bandicoot diet, including the diversity of hypogeal fungi, varies between these habitat types, yet this could have important conservation implications. Our study aimed to (i) compare the diet ofI. o. obesulusat novel and remnant sites; and (ii) attain knowledge of hypogeal fungal diversity in these different contexts. We collected 133 bandicoot scats over 23 months and examined both broad diet composition and diversity of fungi consumed. Bandicoot diet differed between site types; in particular, ants were more prominent in scats from remnant sites, while millipedes and seeds were more prominent in scats from novel sites. All scats contained fungal spores, with hypogeal taxa comprising at least 35 of the 78 'morphotypes' found at novel sites and 28 of the 59 detected at remnant sites. Fewer samples were collected at remnant sites, but they appeared to contain a greater richness of hypogeal fungi per scat. We did not detect any differences in fungal composition between site types. However, our sampling effort was insufficient to estimate true morphotype richness at either site type. Our study highlights the adaptable generalist diet of the southern brown bandicoot, as well as the likely under-appreciated diversity of hypogeal fungi that can occur in highly modified, novel ecosystems.

AB  - Urban soils are subject to anthropogenic influences and, reciprocally, provide benefits and disbenefits to human wellbeing; for example carbon storage, nutrient cycling and the regulation trace element and contaminant mobility. Collective stewardship of urban green commons provides contemporary examples of the diversity of uses and management of green space in cities and represents a growing movement in user participation in, and awareness of, the importance of urban ecological health. Exploring the range of social-ecological benefits exemplified in the urban environment has generally focused on above-ground processes, with few studies examining the potential for (dis)benefits arising from edaphic characteristics of collectively-managed spaces. An investigation into the influence of formal and informal green space management on carbon fluxes and heavy metal concentrations in urban soils was carried out in Manchester (UK) finding that carbon storage in soils of collectively managed urban green commons (7.15 +/- 1.42 kg C m(-2)) was significantly greater than at formally managed sites (for example city parks: 5.08 +/- 0.69 kg C m(-2)), though the latter exhibited reduced losses through CO2 emission. Variation in heavy metal concentrations and mobility were likewise observed, exemplified by the acidification of surface soils by leaf litter at orchard sites, and the resultant increase in the mobility of lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn). The results of this study indicate the importance of small-scale contemporary urban green space management on selected ecosystem services provided by the limited soil resource of cities. Thus, a greater consideration of the effects of horticultural and amenity activities with regards to soil quality/functionality is required to ensure available urban green commons retain or increase their ecological quality over time.

AB  - Background Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are of environmental and public health concerns and contribute to adverse skin attributes such as premature skin aging and pigmentary disorder. However, little information is available on the potential roles of chronic urban PAH pollutant exposure on the cutaneous microbiota. Given the roles of the skin microbiota have on healthy and undesirable skin phenotypes and the relationships between PAHs and skin properties, we hypothesize that exposure of PAHs may be associated with changes in the cutaneous microbiota. In this study, the skin microbiota of over two hundred Chinese individuals from two cities in China with varying exposure levels of PAHs were characterized by bacterial and fungal amplicon and shotgun metagenomics sequencing. Results Skin site and city were strong parameters in changing microbial communities and their assembly processes. Reductions of bacterial-fungal microbial network structural integrity and stability were associated with skin conditions (acne and dandruff). Multivariate analysis revealed associations between abundances ofPropionibacteriumandMalasseziawith host properties and pollutant exposure levels. Shannon diversity increase was correlated to exposure levels of PAHs in a dose-dependent manner. Shotgun metagenomics analysis of samples (n= 32) from individuals of the lowest and highest exposure levels of PAHs further highlighted associations between the PAHs quantified and decrease in abundances of skin commensals and increase in oral bacteria. Functional analysis identified associations between levels of PAHs and abundance of microbial genes of metabolic and other pathways with potential importance in host-microbe interactions as well as degradation of aromatic compounds. Conclusions The results in this study demonstrated the changes in composition and functional capacities of the cutaneous microbiota associated with chronic exposure levels of PAHs. Findings from this study will aid the development of strategies to harness the microbiota in protecting the skin against pollutants.

AB  - Restingas are lowland sandy ecosystems located between mountain ranges and the sea. For living organisms in this ecosystem, restingas can be seen as habitats formed by islands of vegetation separated by a sandy matrix. These organisms are highly influenced by the environmental conditions and physical characteristics of the landscape, including size, connectivity and environmental heterogeneity. Given the recognized effectiveness of ants as bioindicators, this study uses these organisms as a model to assess how do the physical characteristics of a landscape influence the structures of ant communities. The study was carried out in the Parque das Dunas, Salvador - Bahia, Brazil. Within this park, four categories of vegetation islands (Small, Medium, Large and Continuous) were delimited, where the ant fauna was sampled and the forms of vegetal life were analyzed, using the Raunkiaer analysis. A total of 69 ant species were collected from 31 genera and six subfamilies. We found a positive relationship between ant richness and diversity of plant life forms (Shannon index). In general, there was a significant difference in the composition of ant species between the areas of continuous vegetation and the different vegetation islands. We conclude that there is a bottom up effect mediating the ant community associated with dune vegetation, where the local richness of ant species responds to vegetation heterogeneity.

AB  - The anthropization of the landscape of the Cerrado biome that has occurred over the past few decades has fragmented its natural environments, impacting the connectivity of the plant populations and altering their gene flow. Plant species may also reduce population size in response to sub-optimal climatic and environmental conditions, and observed distribution patterns may align with theoretical schemes, such as the center-periphery model, that is, it is possible that populations on the edge have lower genetic diversity than center populations, theoretically submitted to environmental conditions closer to the optimum. In this context, we evaluate whether the genetic diversity and inbreeding coefficients of Cerrado plant species are affected by landscape features and climate characteristics, and in particular, if the distribution of the genetic diversity of these plants is consistent with the center-periphery model. To do this, we conducted a literature search for genetic studies of Cerrado plant populations using Scopus, Web of Science, and Scielo databases and the species found were used as a proxy to explore patterns throughout the biome. The data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and multiple matrix regressions (MMRRs) to evaluate the effects of landscape features and climatic variables on the observed (H-O) and expected heterozygosity (H-E), allelic richness (AR) and inbreeding (Fis) patterns of the local populations. The landscape was evaluated in terms of the percentage land cover of agriculture (AG), forestry (FO), remnant vegetation (RV), urban areas (UA), pasture (PA), and water (WA) within buffers of 1 km, 3 km, and 5 km around the study populations. We analyzed 121 populations of 31 plant species. The GLMMs showed that H-O was affected by FO regardless of buffer size, while H-E was also affected by FO, but also by WA and UA. AR was affected by WA and UA in all three buffer zones while the Fis was affected by FO and AU. The MMRRs showed that WA may affect H-O, H-E, and Fis within the 1 km buffer, while FO affects H-O and UA affects AR within the 5 km buffer. In the case of the 1 km and 3 km buffers, however, the geographic distance between populations was identified as a factor determining the genetic diversity and inbreeding indices, indicating that isolation by distance may be an important factor defining the breeding patterns of the Cerrado plant populations. The GLMMs and MMRRs also showed that the mean annual temperature (MAT) and, to a lesser extent, isothermality (ISO) can explain the variation in genetic diversity observed in the Cerrado plant populations. We also found that the center-periphery model fits the distribution pattern observed in most of the species evaluated, including Annona crassiflora, Annona coriacea, Copaifera langsdorffii, and Eugenia dysenterica. Our results indicate that changes in the climate and the landscape of Brazilian Cerrado must be considered carefully to guarantee minimizing the impacts of these processes on the genetic diversity of Cerrado plant species and ensuring the long-term conservation of these species in this biome.

AB  - Green infrastructure is a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas, including green and blue spaces and other ecosystems, designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services at various scales. Apart from the ecological functions, green infrastructure, as a planning tool, contributes to social and economic benefits, leading to the achievement of sustainable, resilient, inclusive and competitive urban areas. Despite recent developments, there is still no consensus among researchers and practitioners regarding the concept of green infrastructure as well as its implementation approaches, which makes it often difficult for urban planners and other professionals in the field to develop a robust green infrastructure in some parts of the world. To address this issue, an integrative literature review was conducted to identify which green infrastructure planning principles should be acknowledged in spatial planning practices to promote sustainability and resilience. As a result of this literature review, the most common eight green infrastructure planning principles were selected-connectivity, multifunctionality, applicability, integration, diversity, multiscale, governance, and continuity. These principles intend to promote and simplify the development and use of green infrastructure by different academic and implementation organizations and provide a more defined model for sustainable landscape management in order to help practitioners and decision makers during the conceptualization and planning of green infrastructure.

AB  - Invasive species are drivers of urban ecosystem transformation. However, their management requires cost-demanding distributional data. Here we proposed an approach using floristic surveys, land-use maps, and field observations to reveal the patterns responsible for the spread of invasive trees using open-source software. We used the tree of heaven - Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle as a model species, one of the most common invasive tree species in cities. We conducted our study in Poznan city (W Poland). Although there were no spontaneous individuals of A. altissima recorded in the 1980s, in 2015 we found it in 18 out of 242 1 km(2) grid squares. We used a random forest model to show that the probability of A. altissima natural regeneration is positively associated with high cover of medium dense urban fabric (10-50%), recreational areas, and water. It was negatively correlated with the cover of forests, dense urban fabric (50 100%), and agricultural areas. We also found that most of the naturally regenerated individuals occurred up to 20 m from parental trees, and densities of natural regeneration were five times higher in paved surfaces and ruderal vegetation compared to lawns and bare ground. Despite model limitations, these patterns are consistent with other studies, revealing a set of rules facilitating prediction of A. altissima natural regeneration occurrence. Hence, our approach can facilitate narrowing the area of fieldwork required for mapping invasive tree species in urban ecosystems, help to design effective policy and management of invasive species in urban areas, and reduce costs of monitoring.

AB  - The integration of field surveys, bibliographic research and multitemporal analysis of historical maps, aerial photographs and satellite images in a GIS environment, allowed the current and past geomorphological features of the old city of Alessandria and its surrounding areas, NW Italy, to be identified and mapped. Their analysis provided an overview of the geomorphological evolution of the city that is strictly related to the historical vicissitudes occurred since the Middle Ages. Nowadays, the most representative landforms and deposits characterizing the urban landscape result from human interventions and are associated with ancient military facilities and infrastructures, a historical man-made channel network no longer recognizable, the Tanaro riverbed channelization, and the urban sprawl occurred from the second half of the nineteenth century onwards. This study represents a useful tool for urban planning and management and for raising the citizens' awareness of the urban-landscape geomorphological features and evolution, and therefore the geo-hydrological risk.

AB  - Aim Projections of biodiversity scenarios often rely solely on climate change to inform species distribution shifts in the future. Land use projections are rarely used due to their unavailability and, when available, are often at coarse spatial and thematic resolutions, making them unsuitable to capture fine scale habitat suitability. This study aims to (a) show how coupled land use change (LUC) models of high thematic resolution (HTR) can be used in species distribution models (SDM), (b) compare the impacts of HTR and low thematic resolution (LTR) explanatory predictors on biodiversity scenarios and (c) assess the impact of species' present area of occupancy on the effect of thematic resolution in SDMs.
   Location Belgium
   Taxon Bumblebees (Bombus)
   Methods We compared species distribution models with 17 land use predictors (HTR) against models with 5 land use predictors (LTR). We modelled the distribution of 17 bumblebee species in Belgium projected until 2035. We examined how model performance, variable importance and projections of distribution change differed depending on the thematic resolution of the land use predictors.
   Results Overall, HTR models performed better than LTR models. LTR models predicted greater extent per species. HTR projected a greater percentage of range gains, and both models projected similar losses of suitable habitat. However, the percentage loss and connectivity of suitable habitats varied differently for HTR and LTR models along a gradient of rare to common species. The HTR models projected greater loss of suitable areas for rare species and less loss for common species compared to LTR models.
   Main conclusions These results illustrate the importance of using ecologically relevant explanatory variables in SDMs, particularly for rare and localized species with specific habitat requirements. The results also indicate the need for large-scale LUC projections to improve future biodiversity scenarios under climate change and to improve the ability of conservationists and policymakers to use SDM projections.

AB  - European cities may be regarded as having formed a system of well-interconnected entities over many centuries. The peculiarities of their hierarchical functional organization and territorial patterns have been extensively analysed. This study details a few contributions from the science of complex systems meant to formalize this knowledge. This includes a representation of the metropolisation process occurring within a system of cities with the help of scaling laws and network analysis. We define the metropolisation process - not at the local level of one metropolitan area but at a macro-geographical level - as the ability of larger cities to capture the activities related to innovation waves and to be the first to benefit from these in terms of population growth. A series of urban attributes are used to quantify, through exponents of scaling laws the differentiated behaviour of urban hierarchies when opening up to the global networks that characterize the most recent wave of innovation. Network analysis provides another type of formalism that helps us construct a better understanding of how globalization processes, especially the spread of multinational firms, have diffused in the Eastern part of the European urban system.

AB  - Thirty years after the widespread establishment of the concepts of environmental continuity in Europe and Italy, linked to the EU Habitat Directive and the Natura 2000 project, these have almost completely lost their impetus. After having fostered a very intense scientific and political/administrative/managerial period, these concepts have produced only a few virtuous examples of implementation. The study presented in this paper shows that today national environmental quality is almost entirely based on land use categories that are scarcely protected and not subject to sufficiently binding planning. Moreover, their functional structure and extension/quality depend on how the local and global market impact spatially complementary categories mostly affected by anthropic action, which instead undergo efficiently planned changes. From the fundamental paradigm of "ecological networks" the interests of the scientific world and local authorities have shifted to other fronts, losing that physical and conceptual cohesion inherent in "environmental continuity" as a value in itself. The availability of recent, very advanced data helps take stock of this issue and verify critical points on the national territory that have been unresolved for several decades, but still rife with potential for the application of models of international value.

AB  - The San Bernardino kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami parvus) is a federally listed endangered species endemic to Southern California and limited to three remaining populations. Its native habitat of alluvial fan sage scrub faces many anthropogenic threats, including urban and agricultural development, and the resulting flood control and fire suppression. With the loss of natural processes such as scouring or burning from floods and fires, the mosaic of seral stages across the landscape has shifted to dense vegetation, and active restoration may be necessary to provide suitable habitat for the San Bernardino kangaroo rat. Species distribution modeling using the partitioned Mahalanobis distance method on all occurrence points collected in the past 16 years revealed that alluvial scrub cover and fluvent soils were most strongly associated with San Bernardino kangaroo rat occupancy. Through surveys at 14 locations across the species' range, we identified non-native grass cover, shrub cover, bare ground and sandy soils as microhabitat features related to San Bernardino kangaroo rat abundance. We also calculated the optimal range of cover for each habitat type that was correlated with higher kangaroo rat abundance. The results of this multiple-model approach can be used by the agencies to assess the value of conserved habitat, set targets for microhabitat enhancement to facilitate population growth and expansion, or identify receiver sites should translocation be required for recovery. This work lays the foundation for more coordinated and strategic restoration efforts, given the compressed and rigid timelines of development projects that continue to impact remaining San Bernardino kangaroo rat populations.

AB  - Agroforestry is an alternative kind of land use where the native vegetation is surrounded or intercalated by crops of economic interest. This system may maintain species richness by promoting the habitat heterogeneity or serving as ecological corridors. The aim of this study was to describe the gastrointestinal helminth fauna and to analyse the parasitological parameters of the helminth communities of six sigmodontine rodents in a cocoa agroforestry system in the municipality of Ilheus, state of Bahia, Northeast Brazil. This is a novel study of helminth fauna in this kind of agroforestry. Rodents were captured in live-traps and euthanised for helminth recovery. Specimens were counted and identified to the species level whenever possible. Helminth abundance, intensity, and prevalence were calculated for each species and each host. The total abundance and prevalence of helminths were compared among localities and three attributes of the host: species, gender and age using generalised linear models. Considering all rodents, 52.14% of them were parasitised with at least one helminth species. Eight nematode species were identified and another seven morphospecies were identified to the genus level. The most abundant species were Hassalstrongylus epsilon, Stilestrongylus eta, Guerrerostrongylus zetta, and Syphacia alata. The opportunistic host species Oligoryzomys nigripes and Akodon cursor, besides the water rat Nectomys squamipes, were the most infected species for helminth parasites. Hylaeamys seuanezi was also an important host with the highest helminth species richness. This is the first report of the helminth fauna for this host. The locality most distant from the native vegetation and closest to the city had the highest helminth prevalence and mean species richness. The species richness in the helminth communities of Euryoryzomys russatus, N. squamipes and O. nigripes in these Cabruca agroforestries were within the range found in studies carried out in Atlantic Forest areas.

AB  - Increasing urbanisation and city development has raised the need for our public spaces to provide multiple benefits for the environment and communities. In this paper, we review of the literature on urban parks and report on an empirical study of a co-design process. We found from our review that discipline-specific literature tends to focus on singular park issues rather than considering parks as part of a network. There is a research-gap in addressing the inter-relationship of the many factors influencing the quality and performance of urban parks and in examining multiple parks together. There is a need for an applied framework for assessing how well parks perform in a collective network, and with respect to multiple social and environmental outcomes simultaneously. This research sought to address the gaps identified through a co-design process conducted with multi-disciplinary researchers and professionals from Local Government Authorities (LGAs) who are responsible for design and maintenance of urban parks in Melbourne, Australia. From the co-design process we found that LGAs rarely operate beyond the park by park focus but were aware of the need to understand parks as networked socio-ecological entities providing both green and social infrastructure in cities. Drawing on the LGAs applied knowledge, this research proposes a new methodology and framework for assessing parks as networks of high-quality green spaces that support human well-being and biodiversity simultaneously. Our multi-disciplinary approach, and the resulting Park Network Index, demonstrates how a broader lens could be employed in urban park research and park assessment tools.

AB  - Accelerated urbanization and population growth have resulted in the loss of ecological land and biodiversity, accompanied by the degradation of ecosystem services. Identifying and improving existing ecological security patterns are of great significance for maintaining the sustainable development of cities. In this study, Jinan, the capital of China's Shandong Province, was used as a case study area. Based on three ecosystem services, namely, soil conservation, water conservation and carbon fixation, ecological sources were determined. Furthermore, a resistance surface was constructed based on biodiversity. On these bases, the circuit theory concept of random walks was applied to simulate ecosystem processes in a heterogeneous landscape and identify ecological corridors, pinch points and barriers. A total of 25 ecological sources, 48 ecological corridors and 19 pinch points were identified, and restoration areas were delimited to three levels. These elements together constituted the ecological security patterns. Specifically, the ecological sources were mainly distributed in southern Jinan and were covered mostly with forest land. The ecological corridors were located mainly in the eastern and southwestern plains below the southern mountainous areas and were covered mostly with cropland. Furthermore, the eastern corridors were much longer than the southwestern corridors. Pinch points were distributed mostly along rivers or around large-scale construction land. Barriers were distributed mainly in Zhangqiu District and northern Licheng District. Based on these findings, hierarchical restoration areas were delimited. Differentiated development contradictions in restoration areas were discussed, and corresponding ecological protection measures were proposed. An ecological security optimization pattern of "one center, two wings, and two belts" was finally proposed to provide planning strategies for decision-makers.

AB  - Urban resilience is one of the most debated concepts that confronts environmental, socioeconomic, and political uncertainty and risk. Decision-makers cannot deploy substantial principles of resilience in urban design practice unless they have a vivid operational definition. To form a clear definition for Resilient Urban Design (RUD) in practice, this research connects the approach of urban resilience and urban design principles. This framework includes extracted attributes from urban resilience criteria through morphological, perceptual, functional, social, economic, governance, and ecological urban design dimensions. Then, 10 academic experts in urban design and planning conducted stages of screening, validation, and analysis using the Delphi technique and Shannon method. Results reveal that criteria of Good Governance, Innovation, Diversity, Adaptive Design, Redundancy, Robustness, Social Learning, Connectivity, Legibility, Identity, and Social Capital are all incorporated in the formation of the concept of RUD. These elements imply a more profound basis to make decisions, affecting resilient built environments.

AB  - Although the occurrence and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in various aquatic ecosystems are well explored, understanding of the ecological processes and mechanisms governing the composition and dynamics of bacterial ARGs still remains limited across space and time. Here, we used high-throughput approaches to detect spatial patterns of bacterial ARGs and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in an urbanizing subtropical watershed, Xiamen, southeast China over a five-year period. At watershed scale, the OTU profiles were undergoing a directional change, but the ARG profiles showed a high stability or stochastic change over time. Compared with the upstream and midstream, the richness, absolute abundance, normalized abundance and diversity of ARGs were significantly higher in the downstream waters. Our results revealed a clear rural-urban disparity in ARG and OTU profiles which were mainly governed by deterministic and stochastic assembly processes, respectively. With the increase of urban building area along the river, the ecological processes of ARG profiles shifted from stochastic to deterministic. In downstream waters, the bacterial ARG profiles were much more stable than bacterial OTUs. Further, our results indicated that both human-dominated environment (e.g., land use) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) played an important role in shaping the ARG profiles and dynamics. Overall, this was a response to spatially extensive human-landscape interactions that included urban development in the river downstream region, which were common across subtropical coastal cities of China and can alter the ARG profile dynamics along rural-urban gradient. Therefore, watershed management actions aiming at reducing threats posed by ARGs in urbanizing watershed should first consider the surrounding urbanization level and the mode and intensity of human activity. Our findings also imply that due to the decoupling of bacterial function and taxonomy, both aspects should be studied separately.

AB  - Rosario's relationship with the Parana was mediated by the port. This link began to revent in the 1990s. A chain of public spaces, wadis and avenues replaced the out-of-use ferroportuary facilities. This procedure improved the connectivity of the city with the riverbank, from a smaller scale designed for automotive transport and pedestrian traffic. The ferroportuary interface that had governed the city-rail relationship was replaced by a continuum of public spaces. A large part of the studies carried out on this great urban transformation have concentrated on the inspirations, planning, impacts of these Great Urban Projects on land use, the real estate market, the gentrification of the area and the metamorphosis of the city. However, other changes linked to the environment, habitat and occupation of the ancient inhabitants of the ravine have not been analyzed. While the public spaces grew and were partially concessioned, the small-scale fishermen observed how their habitat and sources of work were reduced. In this article, we try to understand how these subject-others experience the process of accumulation by dispossession and deterritorialization of which they are the object with the reinvention of Rosario's waterfront.

AB  - Health assessment and risk factor identification represent the premise and foundation of scientific management and ecological restoration of urban lakes. Based on in-depth understanding of the nature-society duality of urban lakes, a framework for evaluating urban lake health was constructed, including four modules, namely, establishing an index system; determining the index weight; identifying risk factors; and a comprehensive lake health evaluation. Employing this framework, we evaluated Lianshi Lake, Beijing, classifying the lake condition as "sub-healthy". Based on the evaluation data, we identified the health risk factors of the lake. We applied standard difference rate (SDR) and risk degree (Rd) (safe degree (Sd)) concepts, and classified the indices of risk areas employing the Pareto analysis method. Finally, we identified the lake residence period, landscape connectivity, and eutrophication as the major risk factors in Lianshi Lake. Three factors constitute the basis of ecosystem health and are key targets of ecological restoration: the lake residence period represents the hydrological and hydrodynamic characteristics of the lake; landscape connectivity is described from an ecological perspective, and represents the integrity of the lake ecosystem; and the eutrophication states describe the water quality characteristics and represent the availability of lake water. The results contribute to decision-making for comprehensive urban lake management.

AB  - Context A continuous increase in human activity and drastic changes in the global climate have aggravated the loss and degree of fragmentation of natural habitats, thereby forcing various species to change their habitats to acquire suitable survival spaces. Objectives To investigate the potential impacts of climate change and human activity on ecological networks. Methods By using the human footprint, and current and future temperature, we analyzed and compared the distribution of ecological sources, corridor patency and climate connectivity within the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration area under scenarios with and without corridors and various levels of warming. Results The human footprint significantly influenced the distribution of ecological sources and corridor patency in the study area. A high human footprint index was associated with a high degree of fragmentation and weak corridor patency. In general, the current distribution of ecological sources and climate corridors exhibited a significant north-south disparity. Under all climate change scenarios assessed, the number and areas of ecological sources that achieved climate connectivity by linkage migration were higher than those achieved by adjacent migration, with the numbers for the former being 1.3-2.5 times greater than those for the latter. In addition, the level of warming that can be tolerated with linkage migration is higher than that with adjacent migration (2.8 degrees C vs. 0.8 degrees C). Conclusion Climate connectivity can be better enhanced by constructing corridors than controlling warming, thereby effectively increasing the climate-wise biodiversity conservation potential. Therefore, the determination of priority conservation areas from the aspects of climate change and ecological corridor conservation is recommended.

AB  - Both the planktonic bacterial community (PBC) and benthic bacterial community (BBC) are important for biogeochemical processes in freshwater lakes. Despite their ecological significance, little is known about their seasonal co-occurrence patterns and the ecological processes that drive them. In this study, we aimed to investigate the ecological associations among bacterial taxa and assembly processes of PBC and BBC in different seasons. We used 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing of a total of 150 water and sediment samples collected from multiple lakes distributed in an urban region of China during winter and summer. Our results revealed that PBC showed stronger seasonal variations in co-occurrence patterns than BBC, suggesting that BBC had greater temporal stability than PBC. Winter PBC network was characterized by higher connectivity and complexity, and thereby the formation of a highly stable community structure; whereas lower connectivity arising from the presence of fewer predicted keystone taxa (hubs and connectors in a network) was destabilizing to summer PBC network. In addition, the phylum Firmicutes identified as a putative keystone taxon of PBC in both seasons played a non-negligible role in maintaining network structure which may result from strong functional associations with other bacterioplankton.Tempera Temperature and pH were the best explanatory factors predicting the seasonal co-occurrence patterns of PBC and BBC, respectively. Normalized stochasticity ratio based on null-model analysis indicated that deterministic processes overwhelmed stochastic processes in governing the assembly of PBC and BBC in both seasons. However, we observed a greater influence of ecological stochasticity on BBC assembly than PBC assembly in both seasons. Taken together, these findings provide insights into understanding the impacts of habitat heterogeneity and seasonal variability on microbial assemblage patterns in lake ecosystems.

AB  - Dryocopus pileatus (Pileated Woodpecker) is an endemic North American woodpecker that, following widespread declines during the mid-to-late 19th century, rebounded and has become relatively common resident throughout its range. In New York City, Pileated Woodpeckers were breeding residents until the early to mid-1800s, but were extirpated due to the city's rapid urbanization. Since the 1930s. however, the number of reports of Pileated Woodpeckers has increased dramatically in the area. Here we document the re-establishment of Pileated Woodpeckers in New York City within 2 old-growth greenspaces on Staten Island from 2015 to 2019. We further describe and validate a previously unpublished breeding attempt on Staten Island from 1989. The establishment of Pileated Woodpeckers in New York City is reflective of their ongoing colonization of urban and suburban areas throughout North America, and highlights the importance of unfragmented greenspaces within urban and suburban areas.

AB  - Roads form a vast, rapidly growing global network that has diverse, detrimental ecological impacts. However, the habitats that border roads ('road verges') form a parallel network that might help mitigate these impacts and provide additional benefits (ecosystem services; ES). We evaluate the capacity of road verges to provide ES by reviewing existing research and considering their relevant characteristics: area, connectivity, shape, and contextual ES supply and demand. We consider the present situation, and how this is likely to change based on future projections for growth in road extent, traffic densities and urban populations. Road verges not only provide a wide range of ES, including biodiversity provision, regulating services (e.g. air and water filtration) and cultural services (e.g. health and aesthetic benefits by providing access to nature) but also displace other habitats and provide ecosystem disservices (e.g. plant allergens and damage to infrastructure). Globally, road verges may currently cover 270,000 km(2) and store 0.015 Gt C/year, which will further increase with 70% projected growth in the global road network. Road verges are well placed to mitigate traffic pollution and address demand for ES in surrounding ES-impoverished landscapes, thereby improving human health and well-being in urban areas, and improving agricultural production and sustainability in farmland. Demand for ES provided by road verges will likely increase due to projected growth in traffic densities and urban populations, though traffic pollution will be reduced by technological advances (e.g. electric vehicles). Road verges form a highly connected network, which may enhance ES provision but facilitate the dispersal of invasive species and increase vehicle-wildlife collisions. Synthesis and applications. Road verges offer a significant opportunity to mitigate the negative ecological effects of roads and to address demand for ecosystem services (ES) in urban and agricultural landscapes. Their capacity to provide ES might be enhanced considerably if they were strategically designed and managed for environmental outcomes, namely by optimizing the selection, position and management of plant species and habitats. Specific opportunities include reducing mowing frequencies and planting trees in large verges. Road verge management for ES must consider safety guidelines, financial costs and ecosystem disservices, but is likely to provide long-term financial returns if environmental benefits are considered.

AB  - Cities are hotspots of invasions, and this is particularly the case for urban rivers, which are known to serve as corridors for the spread of alien plant species to floodplain forests. Here, we present a case study on woody (shrubs, trees) species invasions across a gradient from a metropolis (Vienna) to rural regions along the Danube River in eastern Austria. In total, we identified 44 native and 25 alien woody species in 75 plots. Five alien woody species occur in at least 10 plots. The most wide-spread ones were species of floodplain forests (Acer negundo, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, and Populus x canadensis), while Ailanthus altissima and Robinia pseudoacacia-which prefer dry sites-were recorded substantially less often. The average level of invasion-i.e., the relative proportion of alien to native woody species in plots-was high across all three study regions. Still, there was a moderate decline of alien woody species richness along the urban-peri-urban-rural gradient. Generalized Linear Mixed Models showed that population density and the proportion of urban habitats in the environs of the plots is significantly positively correlated with the presence of Acer negundo and Ailanthus altissima. Conversely, the occurrence of Robinia pseudoacacia is negatively correlated with surrounding population density and urban habitats. Occurrence of Acer negundo is positively correlated with urban habitats. For Fraxinus pennsylvanica, we found no significant relationships. Our results confirm that gallery forests at river banks are highly susceptible to invasions. We argue that managing alien woody species in urban and peri-urban sites is not appropriate and useful, given that re-invasion is likely in most cases (from adjacent urban green spaces). We acknowledge that this recommendation entails the implicit recognition that gallery forests along urban sections of the Danube will contain a substantial-and likely further increasing-proportion of alien woody species.

AB  - The development and evolution of an urban green space system is affected by both natural effects and human intervention. The simulation and prediction of an urban green space system can enhance the foresight of urban planning. In this study, several land use change scenarios of the main urban area of Xuchang City were simulated from 2014 to 2030 based on high-resolution land use data. The layout of each scenario was evaluated using landscape indexes. A Cellular Automata-based method (i.e., future land use simulation, FLUS) was applied to develop the urban green space system, which we combined with urban land use evolution. Using recent data, the FLUS model effectively dealt with the uncertainty and complexity of various land use types under natural and human effects and solved the dependence and error transmission of multiperiod data in the traditional land use simulation process. The root mean square error (RMSE) of probability of the suitability occurrence module and the Kappa coefficient of the overall model simulation accuracy verification index both met accuracy requirements. It was feasible to combine the evolution of the urban green space system with urban land development. Moreover, under the Baseline Scenario, the urban land use layout was relatively scattered, and the urban green space system showed a disordered development trend. The Master Plan Scenario had a compact urban land use layout, and the green space system was characterized by networking and systematization, but it did not consider the service capacity of the green space. The Planning Guidance Scenario introduced constraint conditions (i.e., a spatial development strategy, green space accessibility, and ecological sensitivity), which provided a more intensive and efficient urban space and improved the service function of the green space system layout. Managers and planners can evaluate the urban future land use development mode under different constraints. Moreover, they would be able to adjust the urban planning in the implementation process. This work has transformed the technical nature of the planning work from "static results" to a "dynamic process".

AB  - Morphological resilience to urban change is the capacity of the form of the physical city to adapt to everchanging social, economic, and technical contexts. It echoes the theory of general resilience in ecology and is not linked to catastrophic events. Complexity theory informs principles of resilient systems that can be applied to urban form. This paper shows how morphological resilience can be assessed in a wide metropolitan area using geoprocessing protocols and available geospatial information. More specifically, a two-step methodology is proposed and tested on the French Riviera. First, spatial units of analysis are identified based on the interconnectedness of the street network, which is a major morphological component in itself. Next, a set of morpho-functional quantitative indicators of resilience is computed for such spatial units, accounting for both internal structure and integration within the wider metropolitan area. Thirteen indicators are selected to describe five different proxies of morphological resilience: diversity, connectivity, redundancy, modularity and efficiency. The paper also presents the preliminary results of morphological resilience assessment in the French Riviera. Urban central areas on the coast generally show more resilient characteristics, while more contrasted patterns emerge in the hinterland.

AB  - Long-term ecological monitoring provides valuable and objective scientific information to inform management and decision-making. In this article, we analyze 22 years of herpetofauna monitoring data from the Point Loma Ecological Conservation Area (PLECA), an insular urban reserve near San Diego, CA. Our analysis showed that counts of individuals for one of the four most common terrestrial vertebrates declined, whereas counts for other common species increased or remained stable. Two species exhibited declines in adult body length, whereas biomass pooled over the five most common species increased over time and was associated with higher wet season precipitation. Although the habitat and vegetation at PLECA have remained protected and intact, we suspect that changes in arthropod communities may be driving changes in the abundance, growth, and development of insectivorous lizards. This study underscores the value of long-term monitoring for establishing quantitative baselines to assess biological changes that would otherwise go undetected.

AB  - Urbanisation is happening at an unprecedented pace, affecting ecological interactions between frugivores and plants by altering the species composition of plant communities.Cynopterus brachyotis, a bat common in cities, is known to provide important ecosystem services, such as seed dispersal. Studying its diet offers insights into how ecological roles of bats in tropical landscapes could be affected by urbanisation. We documented the diet ofC. brachyotisin Singapore, and tested the hypothesis that urbanisation decreases dietary breadth and proportion of native plants in its diet. We collected droppings ofC. brachyotisat nine sites, and used morphological and molecular methods to identify plant species they contained. We evaluated whether species richness, proportion of native species and composition of plants in diet varied according to various urbanisation metrics. We recorded 33 plant species belonging to 25 genera and 21 families. Ten are native, 17 are exotic, and six are indeterminate. Twelve have never been reported in diets ofC. brachyotisanywhere. Contrary to our hypotheses, urbanisation was not associated with reduced dietary breadth or declining reliance on native plants. Our results suggest urbanC. brachyotishave a generalist approach to foraging and can readily exploit exotic plants as food. Because urbanisation does not affect dietary breadth or the proportion of native species they eat, these bats potentially continue to play important ecological roles by dispersing seeds of native plants even in the most urbanised sites, which is important in aiding succession in degraded landscapes. However, they may equally disperse exotic species they have exploited.

AB  - The urbanization process systematically leads to the loss of biodiversity. Only certain arthropods are resilient to the urbanization process and can thrive in the novel conditions of urbanized landscapes. However, the degree to which arthropod communities survive in urban habitats depends on landscape and local effects and biological interactions (e.g., trophic interactions). In the present study, we examined the relative importance of various factors at landscape (isolation, edge density and area of surrounding greenery) and local (size of park, canopy cover, understory vegetation cover, defoliation depth, weight of dried leaves, soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH) spatial scales on the diversity of ants, beetles and spiders in urban parks. Our results indicated that park edge density was negatively correlated with diversity metrics in ants, beetles, and spiders in urban parks relative to the degree of proximity with the peri-urban forest. In other words, parks that located adjacent to the peri-urban forest may not necessarily have high biodiversity. The results suggested that man-made structures have been effective dispersal barriers that limit the spillover effects of ants and spiders but not the spillover of comparatively strong fliers, such as beetles. However, the area of surrounding greenery may have facilitated the colonization of forest-dependent taxa in distant parks. Large parks with reduced edge density supported a higher arthropod diversity because of the minimal edge effect and increased habitat heterogeneity. Vegetation structure consistently explained the variability of ants, beetles, and spiders, indicating that understory plant litter is crucial for providing shelters and hibernation, oviposition, and foraging sites for the major taxa in urban parks. Therefore, efforts should focus on the local management of ground features to maximize the conservation of biological control in urban landscapes.

AB  - The analytical evaluation of urban landscapes is a time-consuming and difficult process as it concerns a large number of components in a complex network of interactions. Studies are either very general and superficial, or unidirectional and in-depth based on certain indicators. For this reason, suitability analyses based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) create an appropriate framework for evaluating multicomponential urban landscapes systematically. The purpose of this research is to establish an important framework for sustainable landscape planning decisions by comparing it with the artificial topography, population density and biotope characteristics evaluated in the context of microclimatic occurrences in urban landscapes. For this purpose, artificial topography was analyzed by means of AHP according to slope-aspect and elevation criteria. These criteria (slope-aspect-elevation) used to evaluate the artificial topography were preferred for having the potential to represent microclimatic formations such as wind corridor, shading and runoff that affect the decisions on urban landscape planning and management significantly. Artificial topography suitability map obtained was compared to biotope types and population density in research area. In regions with high population density topography compliance is low. In appropriate areas, the building and park biotopes attract attention. These findings indicate that green roof-facade systems should be introduced in such areas and ecological balances should be considered in park design. A balanced distribution of building stock gardens influenced the quality of life positively. It was seen that suitability of topography addressed with regard to life quality and microclimatic comfort is inversely proportional to population density. It was determined by evaluating the relationship of artificial topography with urban biotopes that the predominant biotopes in the areas with high suitability of topography such as garden and grove have high ecological value. Artificial surfaces, such as roads and buildings, gain weight in the areas with high population density and unsuitable urban topography. Considering all of these findings, it was concluded that artificial urban topography is an important indicator for interpreting the relationship with habitat-population density and taking decisions on planning and management of urban landscapes which are in a rapid transformation process.

AB  - Large urban settlements are being organized in metropolitan areas, with a polarizing city influencing and shaping the landscape of the hinterland. Transport infrastructure networks are the main vectors for the permanent flux of resources, and these exchanges should be maintained undisturbed. A poor transportation network impedes the continuity of these flows, causing unsatisfaction, ultimately generating planning-based conflicts within metropolitan zones. This study aims in assessing the potential occurrence of metropolitan conflicts generated by the transportation network design. We used a quantitative approach based on a set of new proposed indexes. The methods were applied on nine metropolitan zones from Romania. The results show that each metropolitan zone has specific potential for conflict occurrence. The higher potential was recorded within the more recent established metropolitan zones. Our results raise the question on whether the Romanian metropolitan zones are fully functional and worthy of this status. The study provides a useful and usable tool in assessing the effectiveness of the transportation networks within metropolitan areas, establishing the potential conflict occurrence and it provides interesting insights about the metropolitan transportation issues, raising red flags toward local and regional decision makers and planners.

AB  - Urban green spaces are frequently presented as being important for urban quality of life and urban development in general, but more detailed interpretations and discussions are typically confined to large urban centers, the so-called first- and second-tier cities. Not enough attention has been paid to smaller urban units, the third-tier towns. The main goal of this article is to investigate the share and types of urban green spaces in five selected towns in Poland. We compare different sources of data based on satellite imagery and land-use maps with those used in public statistics, to check whether town authorities are managing all potential green spaces or only a selected part of them. We find that the predominantly used data, based on what is classified as "urban green space" for the purposes of public statistics, obscure the complexity of urban green spaces and focus on the narrowly understood formally managed public green spaces (which occupy 3.5-5.7% of town areas). Meanwhile, based on other sources, such as the national land-use map (BDOT10k), Urban Atlas, and satellite imagery (Landsat 8), what is considered to be green space turns out to cover 50-80% of the town area. The latter large numbers are associated with the predominance of arable land, grasslands, and forests, overlooked in any green space management practices based on data and definitions adopted for the purposes of public statistics. The situation found in our five case study towns resembles that identified in larger cities in Poland, and it exhibits the inadequacy of public statistics definitions and the related management practices, hindering the management of urban green spaces as an interconnected system of urban green infrastructures.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is considered as a major threat to biodiversity, especially to nocturnal species, as it reduces availability, quality and functionality of habitats. However, its effects on the way species use landscape elements such as rivers are still largely understudied, especially the effect of crossing infrastructure lighting on bridges. These elements are nevertheless key commuting and foraging habitats in heavily urbanised landscapes for several taxa such as bats that are particularly affected by ALAN. We studied the effects of the illumination of facades and undersides of bridges on the relative abundance of pipistrelle bats, on their 3D distribution and their behavioural response (i.e. flight speed) close to bridges. We set-up an innovative approach based on a microphone-array to reconstruct positions and flight trajectories in 3D. We studied the effect of lighting on bats in the close proximity of six similar bridges, mostly differentiated by the presence or absence of lighting (3 lit and 3 unlit). All bridges cross the same waterway, within a uniformly and highly urbanized agglomeration (Toulouse, France). We found that bat activity was 1.7 times lower in lit sites. Bats tended to keep a larger distance, and to fly faster close to illuminated bridges. These results suggest that bridge lighting strongly reduces habitat availability and likely connectivity for bats. In that case, results call for switching off the illumination of such bridges crossing riverine ecosystems to preserve their functionality as habitats and corridors for bats.

AB  - Landscape patterns and building functions are successfully used to provide the social sensing information of urban areas. However, previous studies treated ground objects equally, ignoring their size differences. Considering the different contributions of various types of ground objects in land-use classification, this paper measured nine area-weighted mean landscape-level metrics to describe landscape patterns based on the land-cover map, derived from remote sensing images. Additionally, the same idea was applied for identifying building functions. Impervious surfaces, which occupy the majority of urban areas, have a decisive impact on land-use classes. In terms of this, this paper proposed the impervious surface area-weighted building-based indexes from the building outline data. To better represent the physical structure of urban areas, the entire study was based on the analysis units delineated by the OpenStreetMap road network. Finally, a random forest model combining the landscape-level metrics and building-based indexes was adopted in Wuchang District of Wuhan city, China. The results showed that the proposed method was effective at describing landscape patterns and identifying building functions for accurate urban land-use classification, increasing the precision by 10.67%. In general, the contribution of landscape-level metrics to the urban land-use classification is slightly greater than that of building-based indexes. Moreover, different land-use types of analysis units express different landscape patterns. It is of great significance for improving urban form and guiding future urban design. The paper demonstrates that area-weighted landscape metrics and building-based indexes offer a better understanding of urban land use, which plays a vital role in urban planning, construction, and management.

AB  - Interaction between cities can occur in a number of ways, and their inhabitants, in seeking to meet their demands for goods and services or even in search of work, may move from one to the other. However, they may choose to migrate, especially at short distances, since cities have different functional structures, all of which ensures the existence of an urban network. In this sense, this work has the central objective of analyzing the urban network of the Mesorregiao of the Triangulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba. The choice of the Mesorregiao of the Triangulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba as a study area is due to the fact that it is a region of extreme importance, both from the state and national points of view. In addition, it has a significant development potential, both socially and economically. For this were done: bibliographic research on the subject; collecting and processing of quantitative data; division of the region into three parts, east, central and west and calculation of the Linked Lines Network. In order to understand the type of urban network in the region, the proposal of Trullen E Boix (2003) was considered, thus confirming that the Urban Network of MRTMAP is well structured compared to networks of more socially and economically depressed regions. Therefore, it was also evidenced that the Urban Network of MRTMAP, for the most part is well articulated, being polycentric-synergetic.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the greatest threats to wildlife and biodiversity. Reptiles are particularly susceptible to these threats due to high site fidelity, large home ranges, and slow movement rates. To understand behavioral responses of Eastern Milksnakes (Lampropeltis triangulum) to fragmentation, we compared home range size and movement rates between a fragmented habitat and an intact habitat. Additionally, we quantified road avoidance and habitat selection in the fragmented habitat. In 2015 and 2016, we collected 453 locations from 17 individuals from Rouge National Urban Park (RNUP), the fragmented study area, using radio-telemetry. We compared our results to a previous study with 1,001 locations from 30 individuals at Queen's University Biological Station (QUBS), our intact study area, collected from 2003 to 2004. We found that home ranges were smaller, but daily movement rate (DMD) and distance-per-move (DPM) were greater in the fragmented study area. We also observed that road crossings by snakes occurred less than expected, suggesting active avoidance of roads. Milksnakes in the fragmented habitat selected locations with a greater number of cover objects within open patches surrounded by high density vegetation, which is consistent with previous findings from the intact habitat. Our findings suggest that Eastern Milksnakes benefit from heterogeneous microhabitats and an abundance of available anthropogenic or natural cover.

AB  - Thematic planning of the blue-green infrastructure is increasingly incorporated in development plans of European cities, within which the qualitative green structure is implemented at various scales - of the county, of the populated areas and locally. European experience shows that it is important to divide several levels or scales of planning (national, regional, county, city, local level) in the planning of green structures, defining the objectives and tasks to be achieved in each level, and the hierarchy between them. The methodology for developing the concept of the greenery is based on the planning of a three-level / scale greening system, based on widely used in Europe approaches for the development of green infrastructure, green network (green grid, etc.), basic principles of ecological design and urban acupuncture (the activation of urban space with punctuated public outdoor objects, elements, territories). The aim of the paper is to present the linkage between the theory and practice in the development of the concept of greenery for small scale populated areas. It is written that the structure and elements of the landscape of the populated area of Ikskile (Latvia) and its villages have been studied and analysed as the pilot area. The levels included in the landscape study, as well as in the concept of the greenery of Ikskile municipality - city, neighbourhood or village, landscape units and object levels - form a hierarchical system in which each subsequent level details the previous one. Similarly, the study of the existing greenery structure of the populated areas is based on a multilevel study which is linked to a future planning The most significant natural and cultural historical elements of the city have been identified and analysed at the town level of Ikskile, dwelling on the cultural historical structure of the populated area, as well as the day-to-day important objects and areas designated as "nodal points" in the town. The "nodal points" and the "linking elements" at the town level are analysed in two directions - objects and territories of daily importance and important for the development of tourism. At the level of neighbourhoods and municipality villages, the elements forming the identity of the place and the existing structure of greenery are more analysed. At the level of landscape units and objects, the existing greenery elements in specific functional zones and situations of the town (street greenery, greenery of residential areas, etc.) - their diversity, typology, quality and usability, accessibility are analysed. As a result, the existing image of Ikskile, the forming elements of the identity and the existing greenery and spatial structure are obtained, as well as problematic situations at each level of the study are defined. The elaborated research serves as a basis for the development of the greenery concept of the populated area of Ikskile and its villages.

AB  - Residential yards constitute a substantive biodiverse greenspace within urban areas. This biodiversity results from a combination of native and non-native species and can contribute to biotic homogenization. Geographical climatic patterns affect the distribution of native species and may differently affect non-native species. In this study, we examined biodiversity and biotic homogenization patterns of yard-dwelling land snails across 12 towns in Oklahoma and Kansas (USA). The 3 x 4 array of towns incorporated a N-S winter temperature gradient (mean low January temperature range = -8.4 to 0.1 degrees C) and an E-W annual rainfall gradient (annual rainfall range = 113.8 to 61.3 cm/yr). Ten yards per town were surveyed. We hypothesized that mild winter temperatures and greater annual rainfall would be associated with greater snail abundance and richness, and that the presence of non-native species would contribute to biotic homogenization. Non-native snails were present and often abundant in all towns. Snail communities varied with both rainfall and cold temperature. Contrary to our prediction, snail abundance was inversely related to annual rainfall-likely because drier conditions resulted in greater yard watering that both augmented rainfall and maintained moist conditions. Sorensen similarity between towns for the entire land snail community and for only non-native species both showed distance-decay patterns, with snail composition becoming less similar with increasing distance-patterns resulting from species turnover. The biotic homogenization index also showed a distance-related pattern, such that closer towns were more likely to have biotic homogenization whereas more distant towns tended to have biotic differentiation. These results support the concept that biotic homogenization is more likely regionally and that climatic changes over distance result in species turnover and can reduce spatially broad biotic homogenization.

AB  - Urban nature is and will be the most common provider of nature interactions for humankind. The restorative benefits of nature exposure are renown and creating human habitats that simultaneously support people's wellbeing and ecological sustainability is an urgent priority. In this study, we investigate how the relationship between environmental attitudes and healthy ecosystems influences restorative experiences combining a place-based online survey with geographical data on ecosystem health in Stockholm (Sweden). Using spatial regression, we predict the 544 restorative experiences (from 325 respondents), with people's environmental attitudes, natural land covers, ecosystem health, and the statistical interactions among these variables as predictors. Our results show that restorative experiences can happen anywhere in the urban landscape, but when they occur in natural environments, the combined levels of biodiversity and ecological connectivity are better predicting factor than the mere presence of nature. That is, healthy ecosystems seem to be more important than just any nature for restorative experiences. Moreover, the statistical interaction between one's environmental attitudes and natural environments predict almost all restorative experiences better than when these variables are independent predictors. This suggests that there is synergistic compatibility between environmental attitudes and healthy ecosystems that triggers restorative processes. We call this synergy regenerative compatibility. Regenerative compatibility is an unexploited potential that emerges when people's attitudes and ecosystems are aligned in sustainability. We consider regenerative compatibility a valuable leverage point to transform towards ecologically sustainable and healthy urban systems. To this end, we encourage multifaceted policy interventions that regenerate human-nature relationships holistically rather than implement atomistic solutions.

AB  - Microculex is a subgenus of wild mosquitoes belonging to genus Culex, closely related to preserved environments. Its immature forms are generally associated with natural breeding sites, especially bromeliads. Recent years have witnessed the presence of some Microculex species in anthropic environments, including immature forms in artificial breeding sites, which may represent an adaptive tendency. This study aimed to investigate the variation in the abundance and dispersal of Microculex species in environments with different forest cover proportions. Three sites with different proportions of plant cover (60%, 70%, and 90%) were selected in an environmental protection area in the city of Sao Paulo, with varying degrees of modification and human presence. Collection was performed from March 2015 to April 2017, targeting bromeliads and artificial containers. Variations in the species' richness, composition, and abundance in different environments were analyzed. Variations in mean abundance and larval density between the different forest cover gradients were analyzed with generalized linear mixed-effects models. A total of 1,028 specimens belonging to 14 species were collected. Richness and composition were similar across the environments. Culex (Mcx.) imitator and Cx. (Mcx.) pleuristriatus were the most abundant species. The results showed a relationship between forest cover reduction and an increase in larval abundance and density for Cx. (Mcx.) pleuristriatus. Cx. (Mcx.) imitator showed a decrease in larval abundance related to a reduction in forest cover. Species from Pleuristriatus Series were found both in bromeliads and in artificial breeding sites. The findings emphasize that the Microculex Group of mosquitoes is not limited to preserved environments, but that some species such as Cx. (Mcx.) pleuristriatus appear to be well-adapted to areas impacted by human activity, colonizing artificial breeding sites, which may suggest a possible domiciliation process.

AB  - Neighbourhood green space is an important asset for the urban population, providing valuable ecosystem services such as supporting human health. Distance or access to urban green areas is well established as being important for the potential use of the area but how different demographic groups move within greenspace is still somewhat unknown.
   Previous studies have shown that there are gender as well as age differences in visual perception, audio experience and recreational activities as well as estimated well-being experienced from use of urban green space. Here we explored people's movement within their local green space in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. The results showed that movement took place over large parts of the green spaces studied, not only along paths. The data further showed that the movement pattern differed significantly between men and women as well as between young adults and old adults. Movement patterns of demographic groups could provide support to planning for sustainable urban green areas, help avoid conflict, identify areas for solitude and ensure equal access for people of different gender and age.

AB  - Unprecedented urbanisation processes characterise the Great Acceleration, urging urban researchers to make sense of data analysis in support of evidence-based and large-scale decision-making. Urban morphologists are no exception since the impact of urban form on fundamental natural and social patterns (equity, prosperity and resource consumption's efficiency) is now fully acknowledged. However, urban morphology is still far from offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for quantitative analysis. Despite remarkable progress since its emergence in the late 1950s, the discipline still exhibits significant terminological inconsistencies with regards to the definition of the fundamental components of urban form, which prevents the establishment of objective models for measuring it. In this article, we present a study of existing methods for measuring urban form, with a focus on terminological inconsistencies, and propose a systematic and comprehensive framework to classify urban form characters, where 'urban form character' stands for a characteristic (or feature) of one kind of urban form that distinguishes it from another kind. In particular, we introduce the Index of Elements that allows for a univocal and non-interpretive description of urban form characters. Based on such Index of Elements, we develop a systematic classification of urban form according to six categories (dimension, shape, spatial distribution, intensity, connectivity and diversity) and three conceptual scales (small, medium, large) based on two definitions of scale (extent and grain). This framework is then applied to identify and organise the urban form characters adopted in available literature to date. The resulting classification of urban form characters reveals clear gaps in existing research, in particular, in relation to the spatial distribution and diversity characters. The proposed framework reduces the current inconsistencies of urban morphology research, paving the way to enhanced methods of urban form systematic and quantitative analysis at a global scale.

AB  - Urbanisation radically changes habitats and alters available resources. Populations of large, highly mobile species are often extirpated at the urban-wildland interface, while species like mesocarnivores may thrive by capitalising on changes in prey abundance. We investigated the diet of the caracal (Caracal caracal), a medium-sized felid inhabiting patchy natural habitat isolated within the dense urban matrix of South Africa's second largest city, Cape Town. We systematically integrated two classic dietary methods (scat and GPS clusters) by accounting for gut transit times. As part of a larger caracal ecology study, we GPS-collared 26 individuals over a two-year period (2014-2016) to generate coarse (3-hour) and fine-scale (20-minute) GPS movement data. Using the movement data, we investigated 677 GPS-clusters for prey remains. We collected 654 scats, half of which were found at GPS-clusters and were linked with the individual sampled. By systematically correcting for a range of gut transit times, we determined whether scat at cluster sites was from the same or an earlier feeding event, thereby increasing the overall detection of feeding events by > 50%. Avian prey dominated GPS cluster findings while micromammals were overwhelmingly represented in scat. Although > 40% of feeding events occurred within 200 meters of the urban edge, caracals largely preyed on native species. Our findings have implications for understanding the ability of some species to persist in the face of rapid environmental change, human-wildlife conflict, pathogen transmission, and bioaccumulation of pesticides. Further, this approach could be incorporated into studies that estimate foraging-explicit resource selection and habitat preference.

AB  - Understanding the driving forces behind built-up land expansion is crucial in urban planning and management. Using the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration as research area, four landscape metrics were used to analyze landscape characteristics of urban expansion from 1990 to 2015. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to study the characteristics of built-up land expansion, while geographical detector was employed to identify the driving forces of urban land growth and their interactions. The results show the extent of built-up land has been increasing, the structure has become more complex, the level of fragmentation has been increasing, and the aggregation degree is in decline. The built-up landscape index shows spatial heterogeneity occurring in the core and peripheral towns of cities, as well as in the core and peripheral areas of the entire region. Also, changes in the built-up landscape index indicate increased spatial aggregation occurring in the past 25 years. Results from the geographical detector show natural, socio-economic, and transportation-related factors have substantial influence on built-up land expansion. Elevation, slope, population density, change in population density, and road network density were shown to have high influencing power. The influencing powers of slope and change in population density were also found to be different from other factors, highlighting their important role in urban development. Also, there were two types of interactions found, enhance nonlinear and enhance bivariate interactions, indicating the compounding influence of interactions between significant determinants. This study provides a new perspective and methodological approach in evaluating the driving forces behind built-up land expansion and their interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Wildlife is exposed to environmental disturbances. Some are limited to a short period and pass by, others are of a permanent nature. Often these two kinds of disturbances occur simultaneously. This makes it difficult to disentangle the specific behavioural response to each disturbance. As species may respond to different disturbances in different ways, it is important to know the species-specific and disturbance-specific responses to develop effective species conservation action. We investigated the behavioural responses of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) in Berlin to temporary disturbance (in the form of an open-air music festival) and permanent disturbance (in the form of habitat fragmentation). We show that a music festival is a major stressor that strongly influences all investigated behaviours. Urban hedgehogs in a highly fragmented area showed subtle behavioural changes compared to those in low-fragmented areas, suggesting that fragmentation was a moderate challenge which they could cope with. Thus, the temporary disturbance by a music festival had a more serious impact on hedgehog behaviour than permanent disturbance caused by fragmentation. Moreover, we show that males responded stronger to the transient disturbance and females responded stronger to habitat fragmentation.
   Anthropogenic activities can result in both transient and permanent changes in the environment. We studied spatial and temporal behavioural responses of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) to a transient (open-air music festival) and a permanent (highly fragmented area) disturbance in the city of Berlin, Germany. Activity, foraging and movement patterns were observed in two distinct areas in 2016 and 2017 using a "Before & After" and "Control & Impact" study design. Confronted with a music festival, hedgehogs substantially changed their movement behaviour and nesting patterns and decreased the rhythmic synchronization (DFC) of their activity patterns with the environment. These findings suggest that a music festival is a substantial stressor influencing the trade-off between foraging and risk avoidance. Hedgehogs in a highly fragmented area used larger home ranges and moved faster than in low-fragmented and low-disturbed areas. They also showed behaviours and high DFCs similar to individuals in low-fragmented, low disturbed environment, suggesting that fragmentation posed a moderate challenge which they could accommodate. The acute but transient disturbance of a music festival, therefore, had more substantial and severe behavioural effects than the permanent disturbance through fragmentation. Our results are relevant for the welfare and conservation measure of urban wildlife and highlight the importance of allowing wildlife to avoid urban music festivals by facilitating avoidance behaviours.

AB  - The concept of green infrastructure (GI) seeks to identify and prioritize areas of high ecological value for wildlife and people, to improve the integration of natural values in landscape planning decisions. In 2018, the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, established a roadmap for biodiversity conservation, which includes the operationalization of GI covering 30% of the territory by 2030. In this paper, we demonstrate a GI mapping framework in the canton of Geneva. Our approach is based on the combined assessment of three 'pillars', namely species' distribution, landscape structure and connectivity, and ecosystem services, to optimize the allocation of conservation actions using the spatial prioritization software, Zonation. The identified priority conservation areas closely overlap existing natural reserves. Including the three pillars in the landscape prioritization should also improve adhesion to the GI idea, without undermining the protection of threatened species. With regards to land use planning, public and private land parcels with high values for GI may require specific incentives to maintain their desirable characteristics, as they are more likely to be degraded than areas with more building restrictions. Visualizing priority conservation areas in a spatially explicit manner will support decision-makers in Geneva to optimally allocate limited resources for ecosystem preservation.

AB  - High-intensity coal mining has resulted in numerous ecological and environmental problems, and seriously threatens ecological security in China. The identification and optimization of the ecological security pattern (ESP) can facilitate sustainable development while preserving the integrity and stability of ecosystems, which is important for improving ecological security in fragile ecosystems and areas of intensive coal mining. This paper presents an integrated framework for identifying, analyzing, and optimizing ESP in consideration of the core area extracted based on morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), ecosystem services importance, and ecological risk index. The innovative method combines the model of linking different ecological source grades to multi-process minimum cumulative resistance (multi-process MCRE model) and kernel density analysis and includes the following steps: (1) ecological patches are delimited by assessing ecosystem services importance based on the contributions of water resources supply, soil conservation, gas regulation, and habitat maintenance; (2) ecological sources are identified by considering landscape connectivity along with the number and area of important ecological patches; (3) ecological resistance coefficient is determined based on the ecological risk index, which is constructed by coupling the surface drought index, landscape ecological risk index, and mine disaster risk index; (4) ecological corridors are extracted using the multi-process MCRE model, which is based on minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) theory, and the ecological potentials of ecological sources; and (5) the ESP is optimized via kernel density analysis, and regulation zones are defined based on the optimized ESP. Results demonstrate that the optimized ESP in study area included 3326 km(2) of ecological sources that primarily dominated by grassland, 58 ecological nodes, 827.92 km of group corridors and 308.21 km of landscape corridors; which distribution pattern was "three horizontal, two vertical, and two circles" to ensure continuity of ecological process within study area. The restrictive, protective and key development areas accounted for 17.36%, 59.81%, and 22.83%, respectively; and corresponding planning recommendations were raised. This study not only provides an effective framework to identify, construct, and optimize ESPs in ecologically fragile coal-mining areas, but also purposes the multi-process MCRE model and ecological sources quantification that suitable for global region to achieve the sustainability between resource exploitation, urban development, and ecological protection.

AB  - In this study, an extreme rainstorm that occurred in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in China on 19-20 July 2016 is simulated and analyzed using the Weather Research and Forecasting model, coupled with a multilayer urban canopy scheme, to reveal the impact of urbanization on the extreme precipitation process in the region. The results show that the urban heat island effect (that is, surface warming and an increased near-ground sensible heat flux, which leads to increased vertical motion and atmospheric instability layer strengthening) plays a dominant role in the urban modification of rainfall during the early stages of urbanization, resulting in an increase of 6-10 mm in average hourly precipitation in urban and downwind areas. With the further development of urbanization in the BTH region, particularly in the big cities of Beijing and Tianjin, the large-scale expansion of the urban surface reduces the surface moisture, the evaporation of surface water from the ground, and the height of the atmospheric boundary layer, leading to an urban dry island effect brought about by the lack of near-surface water vapor, which inhibits an increase in precipitation. The positive effect of the urban heat island on precipitation was offset by the urban dry island effect, so the increase in precipitation in the urban areas was not obvious, but an increased range of 8-10 mm was noted. The existence of large cities changes the position of the strong upward movement of air, and convective upward movement is more likely to occur between the suburbs. With the further expansion of the underlying surface of the adjacent cities of Beijing and Tianjin, the upward movement between the two cities coincides, leading to an obvious increase in precipitation between the two cities.

AB  - Road vehicle collisions are likely to be an important contributory factor in the decline of the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) in Britain. Here, a collaborative roadkill dataset collected from multiple projects across Britain was used to assess when, where and why hedgehog roadkill are more likely to occur. Seasonal trends were assessed using a Generalized Additive Model. There were few casualties in winter-the hibernation season for hedgehogs-with a gradual increase from February that reached a peak in July before declining thereafter. A sequential multi-level Habitat Suitability Modelling (HSM) framework was then used to identify areas showing a high probability of hedgehog roadkill occurrence throughout the entire British road network (similar to 400,000 km) based on multi-scale environmental determinants. The HSM predicted that grassland and urban habitat coverage were important in predicting the probability of roadkill at a national scale. Probabilities peaked at approximately 50% urban cover at a one km scale and increased linearly with grassland cover (improved and rough grassland). Areas predicted to experience high probabilities of hedgehog roadkill occurrence were therefore in urban and suburban environments, that is, where a mix of urban and grassland habitats occur. These areas covered 9% of the total British road network. In combination with information on the frequency with which particular locations have hedgehog road casualties, the framework can help to identify priority areas for mitigation measures.

AB  - In the discussion of designing for a healthier city, people in movement between interconnected spaces perform a non-sedentary activity enhancing sustainability and well-being. However, adverse weather conditions may create uncomfortable thermal sensations that change or ruin the experience of people walking outdoors. This paper is presenting the findings of a 3-year study on the perceptual variation of thermo-spatial conditions and comfort state for pedestrians moving between interconnected spaces. Thermal walks were organised in two European pedestrian routes of 500-m length. The structured walks were conducted with simultaneous microclimatic monitoring and field surveys of thermal perception based on 314 questionnaires, with a focus on the variation of comfort states. The findings suggest that spaces in sequence do not affect significantly microclimatic variation but have a large impact on the dynamic thermal perception of pedestrians. Interconnected spaces of high density result in a differentiation of thermal pleasantness between streets and squares. The aspect of movement along with complexity in urban morphology along a sequence enhances diversity in thermal sensation. This understanding opens possibilities in developing a multisensory-centred urbanism, where the experience of the thermal environment plays an integral role for perception-driven and healthier urban design.

AB  - The world's urban population is expected to grow fifty percent by the year 2050 and exceed six billion. The major challenges confronting cities, such as sustainability, safety, and equality, will depend on the infrastructure developed to accommodate the increase. Urban planners have long debated the consequences of vertical expansion-the concentration of residents by constructing tall buildings-over horizontal expansion- the dispersal of residents by extending urban boundaries. Yet relatively little work has predicted the vertical expansion of cities and quantified the likelihood and therefore urgency of these consequences.
   We regard tall buildings as random exceedances over a threshold and use extreme value theory to forecast the skyscrapers that will dominate the urban skyline in 2050 if present trends continue. We predict forty-one thousand skyscrapers will surpass 150 meters and 40 floors, an increase of eight percent a year, far outpacing the expected urban population growth of two percent a year. The typical tall skyscraper will not be noticeably taller, and the tallest will likely exceed one thousand meters but not one mile. If a mile-high skyscraper is constructed, it will hold fewer occupants than many of the mile-highs currently designed. We predict roughly three-quarters the number of floors of the Mile-High Tower, two-thirds of Next Tokyo's Sky Mile Tower, and half the floors of Frank Lloyd Wright's The Illinois-three prominent plans for a mile-high skyscraper. However, the relationship between floor and height will vary considerably across cities. (C) 2019 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation represents the single greatest conservation challenge of the 21st century. This problem is particularly acute for large, obligate carnivores like pumas Puma concolor which have persisted in North and South America in the face of habitat fragmentation and other anthropogenic disturbances. Shrinking habitat and reduced connectivity mean that mapping habitat is increasingly important for species conservation in multiple-use landscapes. Previous work suggests that pumas occupy habitats where sufficient stalking cover and preferred prey are present, yet the intersection of these factors has rarely been assessed. Here we used data from 68 299 camera trap nights collected from 181 sites throughout the San Francisco Bay Area over a four-year period to identify key predictors of habitat occupancy for pumas and their primary prey (mule deer Odocoileus hemionus). Our goal was to determine whether pumas occupy habitats based on relative measures of prey availability (detection frequency), or ease of predation (density of stalking cover) and whether these predictors changed between seasons. Our results indicated that pumas primarily occupied forested habitats and did not choose habitats with abundant deer. Instead, pumas preferentially occupy habitats that facilitate their stalk and ambush hunting strategy, rather than higher prey densities, per se. The best occupancy models for mule deer indicated the importance of roads and shrub cover. However, even the best deer models performed poorly compared to the puma models, likely due to the ubiquity of mule deer in the region. Although prey density is a widely accepted correlate of habitat quality for many carnivores, our results suggest that structural elements of habitat may be a more important variable in predicting habitat use by large stalk and ambush predators like pumas, which has important implications for conservation success.

AB  - Based on a comprehensive perspective of reality, this study aimed to analyze the representations that young dwellers of a Brazilian favela have about that place, focusing on the impacts on urban mobility and everyday life. Data were collected through workshops conducted with young people attending a non-governmental organization located in a favela in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The participants were seven youngsters aged 15-21 years. During the workshops, the participants constructed a "City of Youth" with the purpose of representing what they wanted for a city. They discussed whether or not there would be a favela in this city and its residents' access to other spaces in the city, especially to leisure areas. It was observed that poverty is an important social marker in the representations about Brazilian favelas, and that the stigma associated with them are incorporated and reproduced by their youth. These facts reflect the possibilities and impossibilities of urban mobility of young favela dwellers, directly affecting their everyday lives and limiting their opportunities for social participation and access to social life.

AB  - The increase in artificial light at night (ALAN) is a global concern, while the pattern of ALAN pollution inside urban areas has not yet been fully explored. To fill this gap, we developed a novel method to map fine-scale ALAN pollution patterns in urban bird habitats using high spatial resolution ALAN satellite data. First, an ALAN pollution map was derived from JL1-3B satellite images. Then, the core habitat nodes (CHNs) representing the main habitats for urban birds to inhabit were identified from the land cover map, which was produced using Gaofen2 (GF2) data, and the high probability corridors (HPCs), indicating high connectivity paths, were derived from Circuitscape software. Finally, the ALAN patterns in the CHNs and HPCs were analysed, and the mismatch index was proposed to evaluate the trade-off between human activity ALAN demands and ALAN supply for the protection of urban birds. The results demonstrated that 115 woodland patches covering 4149.0 ha were selected as CHNs, and most of the CHNs were large urban parks or scenic spots located in the urban fringe. The 2923 modelled HPCs occupying 1179.2 ha were small remaining vegetation patches and vegetated corridors along the major transport arteries. The differences in the ALAN pollution patterns between CHNs and HPCs were mainly determined by the characteristics of the green space patches and the light source types. The polluted regions in the CHNs were clustered in a few regions that suffered from concentrated and intensive ALAN, while most of the CHNs remained unaffected. In contrast, the 727 HPCs were mainly polluted by street lighting was scattered and widely distributed, resulting a more varying influence to birds than that in the CHNs. Relating patterns of the ALAN to bird habitats and connectivity provides meaningful information for comprehensive planning to alleviate the disruptive effects of ALAN pollution.

AB  - Patterns of change in neighborhoods can be discordantly different, even within the same city district. A little understood factor in how urban neighborhoods form and grow is structural inertia, which is the tendency of an urban area to resist change due to its existing physical and socio-economic fabric. This study explores how patterns of buildings, plots, blocks, and streets affect change or inertia in neighborhoods over time. We integrate Conzenian morphology and space syntax approaches within a geographic information system (GIS) framework to study two historic neighborhoods in Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C. at four points in time over a 96-year span. Aerial images, historic maps, and GIS sources help to create spatial configuration and building data for each time period. We then analyze these data to identify statistical and map-pattern morphological and syntactic relationships both in the aggregate and in detail. Our research finds that most of the independent variables of block size, plot size, building footprint, global integration, local integration, and connectivity predicted long-term change measured in building inventory in almost every occurrence. Our study also suggests design implications and possible future tools and research for measuring change and its relation to the physical characteristics of our cities.

AB  - Introduction: Latin America is a highly urbanized region, with most of its population living in cities and urban centers. While information about urban streams in Latin America is rather limited, streams are expected to experience similar environmental impacts and conservation issues as urban streams in parts of the globe, including habitat loss, channelization, sewage discharge, trash, and loss of riparian habitats. Objective: We surveyed a network of researchers from approximately 80% of the countries in Latin America to obtain information on the condition, state of knowledge, and threats to urban streams in the region. Methods: Most participants were reached via the Macrolatinos@ network (www.macrolatinos.net). Results: We obtained 104 responses from researchers in 18 of the 23 Latin American countries. Most urban streams are impacted or degraded, and inputs of contaminants and wastewater discharges were considered major drivers of stream degradation. Most respondents indicated that stream channelization is common, with some streams completely channelized or buried. Sewage and rainfall runoff management were identified as a major factor degrading streams, with most respondents suggesting that streams are a primary destination for wastewater discharge, much of which is untreated. Major limitations to urban stream conservation in Latin America are the result of limited ecological knowledge, lack of citizen interest or political will to protect them. There are isolated efforts to restore urban streams and riparian zones, but these are initial steps that need further development. Conclusions: Our research network of Latin American scientists proved to be a valuable tool to assess a large number of urban rivers in a relatively understudied region. Urban streams in Latin America face a diversity of stressors and management challenges, and we propose three areas that would benefit from further research to improve our understanding and management of these systems: (1) Studies should focus on the watershed, rather than isolated reaches, (2) researchers should strive to attain a better understanding of ecosystem function and the services provided by urban streams to justify management and restoration efforts, and (3) studies that integrate economic models where downstream users pay for upstream protection and restoration could prove beneficial for many Latin American cities in attempting to address water conservation issues.

AB  - Context. Anthropogenic landscape modification and fragmentation result in loss of species and can alter ecosystem function. Assessment of the ecological value of urban reserve networks requires baseline and continued monitoring. However, depending on the desired indicators and parameters, effective monitoring can involve extensive sampling that is often financially or logistically infeasible.
   Aims. We employed a low-intensity, mixed-detector survey design to monitor the small-mammal community across a network of 53 fragmented forest preserves (225 sites) in a highly urbanised landscape in the Chicago metropolitan area from August to October, 2009-2012.
   Methods. We used a sequential process to fit single-season occupancy and pairwise co-occurrence models for six common small mammal species to evaluate habitat associations and interspecific interactions.
   Key results. Shrew species and meadow voles occurred more often in open canopy-associated habitats, whereas occupancy was greater for eastern chipmunks, grey squirrels and white-footed mice in closed-canopy habitats. Habitat associations were complicated by negative pairwise interactions, resulting in reduced occurrence of meadow voles when predatory short-tailed shrews were present and lower occupancy rates of white-footed mouse when chipmunk competitors where present. White-footed mice co-occurred with short-tailed shrews, but detection of white-footed mice was lower when either eastern chipmunks or short-tailed shrews were present, suggesting that densities of these species could be inversely related.
   Conclusions. We found evidence for both habitat segregation and interspecific interactions among small mammal species, by using low-intensity sampling across the reserve network. Thus, our sampling and analysis approach allowed for adequate assessment of the habitat associations and species interactions within a small-mammal community.
   Implications. Our findings demonstrated the utility of this monitoring strategy and community as bioindicators for urban-reserve networks. The approach described holds promise for efficient monitoring of reserve networks in fragmented landscapes, critical as human population densities and urbanisation increase, and we discuss how adaptive sampling methods could be incorporated to further benefit conservation efforts.

AB  - The great fruit-eating bat (Artibeus lituratus) is a large-sized species that forages primarily on fruits. This species is widespread throughout the Neotropics, where it is common in natural areas and also occupies forest patches and cities. In this study, we review the composition of Artibeus lituratus diet in Brazil as well as the size of fruits and seeds, plant geographic origin, and sampling methods used in natural versus urban habitats. We show that Artibeus lituratus is able to consume a higher proportion of exotic fruits with large seeds in urban environments than in natural areas. Fruit diameter was not statistically different between environments, but both fruit and seed diameters are smaller when detected by fecal sampling than by other methods. This difference is likely due to the fact that in natural habitats studies are predominantly based on fecal samples, which hinders the detection of large unswallowed seeds. Consequently, we recommend the use of complementary sampling methods (not only the widely used technique of fecal sorting) in order to produce more accurate descriptions of frugivorous bats' diets. We suggest that the ability to exploit fruits of exotic plant species including the ones with large seeds may be a key trait for the persistence of A. lituratus in urban habitats.

AB  - Focusing on the analysis of green spaces of urban and peri-urban borders, this paper puts into practice a methodology designed for the analysis of green areas and peri-urban spaces as green infrastructures, but from a multifunctional and integrating perspective, as it is stated in the European Strategy for Green Infrastructures and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development goals. The deadline for implementing European legislation in this area means that strategic plans are being developed at local and regional level. In Spain there are municipal and regional strategies already developed and implemented but the national strategy has not yet been approved. To this end, the development of monitoring and evaluation tools such as the one presented in this article, can help not only in local decision-making, but also in the establishment of common criteria to help assess its future evolution. This research analyses the large peri-urban parks located in the southwest of the Community of Madrid (Spain). The evaluation is carried out from a local to a regional scale applying multifunctionality criteria to the planning, design, execution, maintenance and resilience phases. From the point of view of landscape structures, the findings of this study reflect a high environmental and social services delivery value, which makes it possible to understand the need to create networks to integrate the peri-urban spaces into the city and to attend to and understand the needs of all actors involved: citizens, political leaders, municipal technicians and private companies, providing them a common vision that improves the future of these spaces. This makes them core areas from which to design strategic plans for natural infrastructure and improvement of biodiversity in the urban area, being, likewise, an example that can be extrapolated and applied to large cities whose urban areas are adjoined and where peri-urban parks can be the starting point for designing supramunicipal strategies for open spaces. Based on these results we can conclude that south-west Madrid provides the ideal conditions for implementing a supra-municipal strategy for green infrastructures which, starting with its large forest parks, showcases the periurban areas which connect them with the urban green network. The Mostoles Green Network and Bosquesur are two strategic projects which, together with the forest parks, constitute a working framework based on which the Supra-municipal Strategy for Open Spaces in South-west Madrid can be devised.

AB  - Historical societies reshaped their environment in various ways; by clearing forest, cultivating crops, mining, and modifying waterways. Evidence of these activities persists in palaeoenvironmental archives, which represent comprehensive histories of human activity in a landscape. Analysis of settlement networks across landscapes is another common approach to investigating how past societies operated, but these analyses rarely incorporate palaeoenvironmental data. Here, we combine these two data sources to examine past socio-political relationships in a society that experienced disruption and transformation. Applying network analysis, and using settlement histories built from palaeoenvironmental proxies for occupation and land use, this paper reconstructs population dynamics at several key nodes (cities) within the Khmer kingdom of Southeast Asia, before and after the climate stress and political upheaval of the 14th-15th centuriesce. Our results reveal how the Khmer city network transformed across space and the nature of the relationships that existed within the network prior to its disruption.

AB  - We analyses the relationship between landscape and environmental variables estimated from high-resolution satellite images with the temporal variation of the abundance of Lutzomyia longipalpis and Migonemyia migonei, vectors of leishmaniasis, in Corrientes city. At 8 collection sites, 14 samples were conducted between March 2012 to February 2014. Proportion of land cover classes derived from high resolution satellite images as: water, bare soil, urban areas, low vegetation and high vegetation, as well as average, maximum and minimum values of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Water Index) in buffer areas of 50 m, 100 m and 150 m were used to characterize and identify suitable environmental conditions for the development of sand flies through Generalized Linear Mixed Models. The most frequently collected species during the sampling period was Lu. longipalpis and followed by Mg. migonei. The models showed that high Lu. longipalpis abundance were related to low proportion of high vegetation coverage, while a negative association was among Mg. migonei abundance and with values of Normalized Difference Water Index and with the interaction between urban areas and minimum values of Normalized Difference Water Index, and a positive association with the interaction between low vegetation and average values of Normalized Difference Water Index.

AB  - Background The contamination of the aquatic environment of urban rivers with industrial wastewater has affected the abiotic conditions and biological activities of the trophic levels of the ecosystem, particularly sediments. However, most current research about microorganism in urban aquatic environments has focused on indicator bacteria related to feces and organic pollution. Meanwhile, they ignored the interactions among microorganisms. To deeply understand the impact of industrial contamination on microbial community, we study the bacterial community structure and diversity in river sediments under the influence of different types of industrial pollution by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology and conduct a more detailed analysis of microbial community structure through co-occurrence networks. Results The overall community composition and abundance of individual bacterial groups differed between samples. In addition, redundancy analysis indicated that the structure of the bacterial community in river sediments was influenced by a variety of environmental factors. TN, TP, TOC and metals (Cu, Zn and Cd) were the most important driving factors that determined the bacterial community in urban river sediments (P < 0.01). According to PICRUSt analysis, the bacterial communities in different locations had similar overall functional profiles. It is worth noting that the 15 functional genes related to xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were the most abundant in the same location. The non-random assembly patterns of bacterial composition in different types of industrially polluted sediments were determined by a co-occurrence network. Environmental conditions resulting from different industrial pollutants may play an important role in determining their co-occurrence patterns of these bacterial taxa. Among them, the bacterial taxa involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles in module I were relatively abundant, and the bacterial taxa in module II were involved in the repair of metal pollution. Conclusions Our data indicate that long-term potential interactions between different types of industrial pollution and taxa collectively affect the structure of the bacterial community in urban river sediments.

AB  - The process of urbanization and urban land use conversion inevitably disturbs the structure and function of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem services. Integrating ecosystem services into effective policies and planning at the regional scale to achieve sustainable urban development is still a challenge. The goal of this research is to optimize spatial patterns of urban development by assessing and comparing multiple trade-off scenarios between ecological processes and urban expansion, incorporating planning and design into spatially explicit methods, and integrating ecosystem services into decision-making procedures. We develop a conceptual framework for regional urban-ecological sustainability with six steps: pattern recognition, landscape process, problem diagnosis, integrated ecological network, urbanization simulation, and decision-support. We apply this framework to a case in which planning and design have followed the rational-comprehensive approach. Results demonstrate that landscape multi-functionality and regional ecological networks are significantly improved using our integrated approach to planning and design, because it provides vital information for regional planning to cope with the urgent need for ecological protection and urban development. By comparing urban growth under three scenarios, we found that the trade-off scenario based on ecological conservation and restoration (medium security level) resolved conflict more effectively, which restricted urban expansion on land of high ecological importance by constructing regional ecological networks. In addition, using field survey and species distribution model approaches, we design plant community types with complementary tree, shrub, and herb species as part of the decision-making procedure, which can restore zonal vegetation and the hydrological cycle in rugged mountain regions. The research concludes that regional urban-ecological sustainability based on scientific assessment, planning, and design provides a rational basis for sustainable urban development and landscape management.

AB  - Since Industrial Revolution, people have rapidly enhanced the resource usage and the economic development in past decades has regional development be gradually formed in China. Along with the promotion of sustainable development and eco-city in past years, the theory of regional ecological networks and the utilisation of protophyta have been discussed to enhance the stability of regional ecological environment. Taking China as the sample, the questionnaire is distributed to the general public in China to understand the weights of factors in the construction of regional ecological network in this study. With random sampling, total 1000 copies of questionnaire are distributed, and 766 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 77%. The research results are summarised as follows: (1) 'Ecological environment' is the most emphasised dimension in Hierarchy 2, followed by 'human landscape' and 'resource use'; (2) Top five indicators, among 12 evaluation indicators, are sequenced as ecological characteristics, activity range, development impact, corridor function, and facility ratio. According to the results, suggestions are proposed, expecting to create the regional ecological network conforming to the demands for ecology, landscape, and use to greatly assist in regional ecology, environmental climate, and biodiversity.

AB  - Road-stream crossings represent a significant source of habitat fragmentation for global aquatic ecosystems, yet integrative conservation planning frameworks are lacking for most regions. We describe a connectivity conservation planning framework that draws on recent advances in the fields of surveying, modelling, and optimizing removal of crossings that block aquatic organism passage. We demonstrate this framework with a case study involving 1200 crossings surveyed in Florida, USA in which barrier severity was quantified on a continuous scale from 0 (complete barrier) to 1 (no barrier). Using field surveys, we built a boosted regression tree (BRT) model that linked barrier severity to 44 landscape variables representing natural (e.g., stream size) and anthropogenic (e.g., land use) stream conditions. We used a recently developed optimization routine to conduct two scenarios, including (1) surveyed crossings only and (2) surveyed crossings plus crossings modelled at 5545 unsurveyed locations. The BRT model explained 54% of variation in barrier severity scores and showed that the most severe barriers occurred on small, high-elevation streams draining urban and agricultural catchments. Estimates of connectivity gains following remediation were 5.3-times lower when unsurveyed locations were included in the optimization, suggesting inclusion of unsurveyed sites is critical for conservation planning. Results from this framework can be used over short (e.g., planning immediate barrier mitigation) and long (e.g., planning future field surveys) time horizons to benefit aquatic connectivity conservation. The survey protocol and modelling methods used here, combined with global datasets on stream conditions, can be applied to benefit connectivity planning in other regions.

AB  - Floodplain integrity can be defined as the ability of a floodplain to support essential geomorphic, hydrologic, and ecological functions that maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services. Humans alter floodplain functionality by changing the physical landscape of the floodplain or by altering river flow regimes and subsequent floodplain inundation dynamics. This research evaluates floodplain integrity by assessing the prevalence of anthropogenic modifications to hydrology and landscape. Specifically, the objectives of this research are to: 1) develop a methodology to assess floodplain integrity using geospatial datasets available for large spatial scales; and 2) use the methodology to evaluate spatial patterns of floodplain integrity in the state of Colorado. To accomplish these objectives, we evaluated the critical floodplain functions of attenuating floods, storing groundwater, regulating sediment, providing habitat, and regulating organics and solutes. At present, this work is the first to quantify the integrity of specific floodplain functions instead of measuring floodplain health solely by ecological integrity. We applied the index of floodplain integrity methodology in the state of Colorado to analyze the integrity of each of the five floodplain functions and the aggregated overall integrity. In Colorado, overall floodplain integrity decreased as stream order increased above third order streams. Floodplain integrity was also lower in floodplains that intersected urban areas than those that did not, which indicates the index of floodplain integrity captured the adverse relationship between development and floodplain health established in literature. By quantifying anthropogenic reductions to floodplain functionality at broad spatial scales, the index of floodplain integrity can help target restoration efforts towards the most affected functions and areas.

AB  - Impervious surfaces in modern cities can be used for revegetation. However, the ecological quality of below-ground ecosystem components and constrained soil space are crucial factors that limit habitat restoration. The long-term development of Bonsai (Penjing) trees has resulted in mature theories and techniques that suggest optimal root-canopy ratios. Considering the similarities with constrained pot landscapes, some "enlightenments", or key findings, derived from Bonsai theory can also be applied to urban special revegetation (USR). In this study, we analyzed the root-shoot correlations of the different styles of Bonsai trees and provide and assessment on the relationships between Bonsai theory and USR. Using an on-site survey and biomass experiment, nine "enlightenments" from Bonsai theory are proposed: positive root-canopy correlation, environmental stress increasing the root-shoot ratio, connectivity of the tree bark "water line", rebalancing after disruption of the root-canopy balance, precise root and canopy design, artificial auxiliary fixation of the root, control of growth, horticultural reshaping skills, and plant diversity. In particular, for the successful establishment of urban rebuilt environments, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of root-canopy correlations. Therefore, we suggest that the four main types of USR (green roofs, vertical greening, container gardening, and street trees) should follow the core principle based on the root-shoot balance to effectively design both the root and canopy.

AB  - Increasing human populations and urban development have led to losses of estuarine habitats for fish and wildlife. Where resource managers are restoring coastal wetlands, in addition to meeting goals related to hydrologic connectivity, biodiversity, and recreational opportunities, efforts are being made to provide habitat that is suitable for juvenile sportfish. An 18-month study was conducted to compare juvenile sportfish use of natural, restored, and impacted sites along Tampa Bay, Florida, shorelines. Juvenile sportfish densities at restored sites were broadly comparable to natural sites and greater than at impacted sites. However, site-specific differences in sportfish use did occur within site types. For example, one restored site had significantly higher densities of red drumSciaenops ocellatusthan any other site, while black drumPogonias cromiswere found exclusively at another restored site. To evaluate whether the restored sites are providing suitable habitat for juvenile fish, we assessed growth (estimated from counts of daily rings on otoliths) and condition (determined by lipid analyses) of juvenile common snookCentropomus undecimalis, an archetypal coastal wetland-dependent species. Growth (0.43-0.56 mm SL/day) and condition (4.6-6.1% lipid of dry weight) exhibited only site-specific differences and did not vary among natural, restored, and impacted site types. Although mortality rates of juvenile sportfish were not determined, use of a 40-m seine found that densities of potential piscine predators in these coastal wetlands were relatively low compared to published studies of open estuarine shorelines. The restoration and creation of coastal wetlands in Tampa Bay provides improved habitat for juvenile sportfish.

AB  - Determination of the factors influencing the population structure and adaptive tolerance to environmental pressures of the synanthropic hoverfly Eristalis arbustorum is of essential importance in understanding how pollinator populations could respond to climate change or ecosystem management. We addressed the issue of connectivity among conspecific populations sampled in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Twenty environmental factors, mitochondrial DNA sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI mtDNA), allele frequencies at allozyme loci and wing traits (size and shape) were compared for characterization of population structure and environmental niches. Additionally, patterns of within-individual asymmetry (fluctuating asymmetry; FA) in wing size and shape within and among conspecific populations were studied. In line with the overall similarity of the environmental factors extracted for our study sites, the results of COI mtDNA diversity and STRUCTURE allozyme data provide evidence for shallow differentiation among conspecific populations. In contrast, geo-referenced Bayesian clustering methods (BAPS and GENELAND) and population-based approaches (pairwise F-ST values and AMOVA) indicate that the dispersal potential of E. arbustorum may be limited across the study area. Along with a significant FA in wing size and shape, a consistent level of FA regardless of urban/rural sampling origin is an indication of the great potential of E. arbustorum for local adaptation, because increased FA levels can be considered to be a way of expression of phenotypic variation and, hence, may contribute to adaptive responses in populations facing changing environments. Thus, by using a combined genetic-morphological approach, we significantly contributed to the understanding of the fine-scale genetic structure of the synanthropic generalist pollinator E. arbustorum.

AB  - Nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial D-loop region were examined in three wild rodents (Apodemus argenteus, Apodemus speciosus, and Myodes smithii) on the northern slope of Mt. Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan, to elucidate the past evolutionary and present anthropogenic processes shaping their genetic diversity. Nucleotide diversity, median-joining network, and mismatch distribution analyses suggested that A. argenteus has multiple divergent lineages, possibly due to multiple previous expansion events, whereas A. speciosus and M. smithii are younger lineages that could be derived from single expansion events. These findings indicate that Mt. Fuji plays an important role as a reservoir maintaining lineages through multiple past expansion events. Artificial infrastructure also affected the genetic diversity of the two Apodemus species, as populations of these species on the two sides of the Fuji Subaru Line roadway were genetically distinct. To construct a proper conservation strategy based on genetic diversity, we suggest that the past and present contributors to genetic diversity must be clarified. Such clarification is especially important for the Mt. Fuji environment, which harbors rich biodiversity but also incurs much human impact as a national park.

AB  - Understanding habitat associations is vital for conservation of at-risk marsh-endemic wildlife species, particularly those under threat from sea level rise. We modeled environmental and habitat associations of the marsh-endemic, Federally endangered salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris, RERA) and co-occurrence with eight associated small mammal species from annual trap data, 1998-2014, in six estuarine marshes in North San Francisco Bay, California. Covariates included microhabitat metrics of elevation and vegetation species and cover; and landscape metrics of latitude-longitude, distance to anthropogenic features, and habitat patch size. The dominant cover was pickleweed (Salicornia pacifica) with 86% mean cover and 37 cm mean height, and bare ground with about 10% mean cover. We tested 38 variants of Bayesian network (BN) models to determine covariates that best account for presence of RERA and of all nine small mammal species. Best models had lowest complexity and highest classification accuracy. Among RERA presence models, three best BN models used covariates of latitude-longitude, distance to paved roads, and habitat patch size, with 0% error of false presence, 20% error of false nonpresence, and 20% overall error. The all-species presence models suggested that within the pickleweed marsh environment, RERA are mostly habitat generalists. Accounting for presence of other species did not improve prediction of RERA. Habitat attributes compared between RERA and the next most frequently captured species, California vole (Microtus californicus), suggested substantial habitat overlap, with RERA habitat being somewhat higher in marsh elevation, greater in percent cover of the dominant plant species, closer to urban areas, further from agricultural areas, and, perhaps most significant, larger in continuous size of marsh patch. Findings will inform conservation management of the marsh environment for RERA by identifying best microhabitat elements, landscape attributes, and adverse interspecific interactions.

AB  - Creative hotspots have become a key driver for urban policies to stimulate social, cultural, environmental and organisational growth of creative and knowledge-based clusters, districts and hubs. However, their functional and spatial characteristics vary due to their different evolving structure as new spaces of economic activity in different contexts. This article points to a consideration of new foci for both land use and urban economic policy through a mapping of formal and informal creative hotspots in Brisbane, Australia. The study found two distinctive development patterns: (a) earlier top-down approaches as instigated by national and international innovation policies, and; (b) recently emerging bottom-up spaces for creativity, knowledge and innovation practices. This study examines how formal creative strategies and emerging informal creative spaces shape cities and urban policies. The methodology comprises online data collection and a review of creative and knowledge strategies and implementation policies. Data was then analysed via multiple mapping techniques illustrating the spatial distribution of creative hotspots, formal and informal formations, scale and land use characteristics. The research findings consolidate our understanding of Brisbane's creative ecosystem and suggest new urban policy mechanisms to better foster the interrelationship between top-down and bottom-up approaches in cities, that is, between formally planned and large-scale interventions and small-scale organic and informal creative activities.

AB  - Simple Summary Red deer, roe deer and wild boar movements and crossings of the two highways in Lithuania were modeled. Validity of obtained models was tested by comparing the pathway predictions to the real roadkill and roadkill cluster locations in 2002-2009 (at the time the models were created) and in 2010-2017 (testing the prognostic value of these models). Across both periods and on both highways, the roe deer roadkill locations were significantly closer to the model-predicted pathways than to randomly selected points. The prediction of roadkill locations was also good for wild boar. The roe deer roadkill clusters and multi-species clusters were significantly better represented by the model than by random distribution. Thus, habitat suitability-based models of ungulate movement are recommended as an additional tool for planning wildlife-vehicle collision mitigation measures. Roads do not only have a detrimental effect on nature (fragmenting habitats, isolating populations and threatening biodiversity), but the increasing numbers of wildlife-vehicle collisions are also a direct threat to humans and property. Therefore, mitigation measures should be placed with respect to animal distribution and movements across the roads. We simulated red deer, roe deer and wild boar movements in Lithuania, focusing on the two main highways A1 and A2. Using regional habitat suitability and linkage models, we calculated movement pathways and the most probable crossing zones in 2009. The prognostic value of these models was tested by comparing the pathway predictions to the real roadkill and roadkill cluster locations in 2002-2009 and 2010-2017. Across both periods and on both highways, the roe deer roadkill locations were significantly closer to the model-predicted pathways than to randomly selected points. The prediction of roadkill locations was also good for wild boar. The roe deer roadkill clusters and multi-species clusters were significantly better represented by the model than by random distribution. On both highways, the biggest differences in distance from the predicted locations were near big cities. We recommended wildlife movement models as an additional tool for planning wildlife-vehicle collision mitigation measures and we advise measures for increasing their predicting power.

AB  - The objective of this study is to create a geological-geotechnical risk map of mass movement for an urban perimeter of Rio Piracicaba city, state of Minas Gerais, MG, Brazil, by applying the methodology proposed by the Brazilian Ministry of Cities. Four neighborhoods were evaluated through works conducted in the field and with the aid of a GIS fed with aerial images obtained from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). In these neighborhoods, 29 points were categorized as risk-points, and 14 risk areas were delimited and hierarchized. Despite being considered a subjective evaluation, the methodology used is a simple and efficient qualitative method, which can contribute significantly to the preliminary identification of areas under risk of mass movements, indicating the nature of the predisposing factors. The areas classified as high-risk present significant physical and environmental problems, mainly due to non-compliance with current legislation regarding urban planning and land use. The outcomes of these surveys are valuable tools that will facilitate the planning and management of land use and occupation in the municipality.

AB  - Improving the pedestrian traffic environment is important for the sustainable development of the city. This study goes beyond the traditional analysis of traditional traffic accident police reports by integrating them with rich geographic information system (GIS) resources to analyze a sample of 791 pedestrian crashes that occurred in the main urban area of Changsha city, China, from 2014 to 2016. The use of Baidu or Google Street View maps improves the accident reports and facilitates the detailed description of the characteristics that are related to pedestrian crashes. The focus of the analysis is to use GIS to visualize the distribution of pedestrian crashes in cities to explore the relationships between pedestrian crashes and the population, road network, land use and social services and activities and to analyze the impacts of the building environment and road characteristics on the severity of pedestrian crashes by combining the binary logistic regression and tree-based models. The results demonstrate that there are several clusters of pedestrian crashes in urban areas, which are related to the population, road network, regional functional zoning and social and economic characteristics. However, the severity of pedestrian casualties has strong relationships with darkness, lighting conditions, road isolation facilities and pedestrian age and behavior. Casualties are more severe at night than during the day, and school-age children and elderly pedestrians tend to suffer more. This study identifies the important influencing factors of urban pedestrian safety and of the risk awareness of pedestrians and other road users and proposes solutions from the perspectives of behavior and infrastructure.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the process of peri-urbanization to a great extent includes irregular land occupation highly linked to environmental degradation. With this focus, the habitat conditions of four irregular settlements in the neighborhood of San Francisco Caltongo are examined. These settlements are located in the Xochimilco, municipality to the south of Mexico City. Results from field work and the application of 75 semi-structured interviews reveals how a zone with high ecological and historical value has not received strong protective measures to avoid degradation. On the contrary, ecological degradation has been aggravated by poverty conditions in informal settlements, as well as by the complicity of the local State that tolerates irregularity and tends to ignore precarious conditions in the settlements. Among the more serious factors of environmental degradation are, the absence of potable water supply, lack of drainage network, expansion of irregular settlements, and the discharge of grey waters and sewage to the channels.

AB  - Birds play a crucial role in plant reproduction, being one of the most important pollinators and seed dispersers among vertebrates. Here, we aim to study plant-bird interactions in the Cerrado biome of Brazil, highlighting existing mutualistic relations and their role in forest regeneration processes. We sampled plants and recorded feeding events and other interactions between frugivorous birds and tree and shrub species in forest and non-forest environments between May 2015 and July 2016. We registered 74 plant species of 36 genera in 23 families, along with 44 bird species, 63.7% of which were frugivores. The rainy season (September-October) offered the highest resource availability for birds, therefore most feeding events and other interactions also occurred during this period. Approximately 64% of the plants observed at the study site had zoochoric dispersal and more than half of them relied on birds. We found a variety of bird species interacting with plants that supplied their food in urban fragments and highlight the relevance of plant-bird interactions to maintaining urban ecosystems. This result demonstrates the importance of maintaining forested environments, as habitat loss reduces ecological interactions, leaving only a few healthy ecological systems as scattered forest fragments within the urban matrix.

AB  - During a Doctoral research, data were produced jointly with young participants who narrated their urban mobility across the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. One of these youths presented the photographs he took during the process, which represented the places he visited round the city, and the desire to exhibit them. Together, we created a virtual exhibition of his photographs that was called "Everyday Life". The exhibition is available online and can be accessed in different social media. We present, here, the creation process of the exhibition and the stories of some of the images that compose it. Based on this report and focusing on the research process, we aim to reflect on collaborative data production and on the utilization of significant activities for the subjects who participate in the process. We believe in the researcher's involvement in the research process and in a joint composition with his or her collaborators.

AB  - In this article, we propose as a critical exercise the relational reading about El Rey de La Habana (1990), of Pedro Juan Gutierrez and Caballo con arzones (pustulas) (2017), by Ahmel Echevarria-two texts that, with twenty years of distance, convene, in principle, the same urban territory, but they distance themselves in the way in which their characters live and inhabit it. We start from some reflections on the relations between city-text and body-city that emerge from the reading of the theoretical proposals by Margulis (2009) and De Certeau (2000). This movement leads us to consider the racial variable as a central element to think about the inscription of the bodies in the cities that were configured under the modern-colonial logic (Mignolo, 2000). From there, we focus on working with these novels, understood as a part of Havana's dynamics and, therefore, able to offer clues of the disputes that revolve around the city and subjects (bodies also racialized by fiction) that occupy it.

AB  - Considering the increasing incidence of allergy symptoms in Europe in the past decades, it is useful to obtain precise ecological and biological data regarding the allergenic plants. This study was conducted in order to assess habitat conditions allowing the development of allergenic plants along the Danube-Tisza-Danube canal network (Banat region, Serbia). In this regard, the distribution of these plants and the relationships among their eco-biological characteristics were studied. The results represent the one step further in the assessment of the habitat conditions allowing the development of allergenic plants in the study area. Twenty four allergenic plants were found, with a predominance of wetland plants (37.50%) and geophytes (41.67%). Correlation and PCA analyses determined that the flowering time of allergenic plants is correlated with the ecological group, life form and habitat conditions (aeration, pH, humus content, moisture, and continentality). The unfavorable periods for allergy sufferers are early spring and summer. Pollen-allergenic forest phanerophytes flowered early, had the shortest flowering period, and inhabited neutral to alkaline soil with less humus content, compared to the wetland and weed-ruderal allergenic plants. Habitat moisture reduced soil aeration and modified the effects of the continental climate, favoring the development of numerous allergenic species along the canals. Most of the identified allergenic species are invasive in Europe. Moreover, these species are frequently grown in urban green areas. Therefore, the avoidance of excessive use of these allergenic species in urban ecosystems may provide healthier environments for allergy sufferers and contribute to the preservation of the native flora biodiversity.

AB  - Many shorebirds (Order: Charadriiformes; Family: Charadriidae, Recurvirostridae, Scolopacidae, Haematopodidae, Jacanidae) are highly migratory, traversing thousands of kilometers between high latitude breeding and low latitude nonbreeding sites. In doing so, they are dependent on networks of coastal and interior wetland ecosystems. To aid in the effective conservation and management of their populations, and to assess the impact of threats facing shorebirds, standardized data on shorebird abundance are needed from multiple sites representing a gradient of conditions across the hemisphere. Such data would provide insight on whether fluctuations at one location represent real changes in abundance because of some localized threat, or whether other factors acting across broader scales such as the redistribution of predators, are responsible. We designed the Migratory Shorebird Project (MSP), now implemented in 11 countries along the Pacific Coast of the Americas, to characterize spatial and temporal variation in shorebird abundance, to understand which factors (habitat, threats) most influence their populations across the flyway, and to increase capacity for integrated research, monitoring, and conservation. We used bird inventory data from historical surveys and spatial data on habitat distribution along with a set of hypotheses about important threats to guide the design of the project and to identify data requirements to test hypotheses. We counted birds one time per year at 84 nonbreeding sites (similar to 1400 sampling units) between 15 November and 15 February, when shorebirds were relatively stationary. In each of the first three annual counts from 2013/14 to 2015/16, the Migratory Shorebird Project counted similar to 1M shorebirds representing 44 species, including five species for which > 20% of the estimated biogeographic population was recorded annually, and nine additional species with > 5% recorded annually. The magnitude of variability in estimates of shorebird abundance was inversely correlated with survey effort with the most uncertainty, and lowest survey effort, in the South Temperate region followed by the Neotropical region (southern Mexico to northern Peru) and then the North Temperate region. Evaluation of variance highlighted both among-site and among-unit ("units" are nested within sites) variation in bird abundance and cover types as well as threats such as potential disturbance and predator abundance. Overall, shorebird density was significantly, and positively, associated with the area (ha) of intertidal mudflats, beaches, and aquaculture. Survey units with intermediate levels of bare ground and flooding had the highest shorebird density. As for threats, we found, contrary to our hypothesis, that shorebird abundance was significantly, and positively, associated, with the density of Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus); however we found no relationship between shorebird abundance and the amount of urban development, our index to potential human disturbance, in the surrounding landscape. The Migratory Shorebird Project is providing an essential data foundation and network for increased knowledge of the factors affecting shorebirds across the Pacific Coast of the Americas and identifying what and where conservation actions could have the greatest impact.

AB  - Introduction: Rio de Janeiro is the second-largest city in Brazil, with strong socio-spatial segregation, and diverse and heterogeneous land use, occupation, and landscapes. The complexity of dengue requires the construction of surveillance and control tools that take into account the historical, social, economic, and environmental processes mediated in the territory as a central axis of public policy. In this context, this study aimed to stratify the city into areas of receptivity to dengue, using innovative "territorial indicators" because they are built based on the actual occupation of the territory. Methods: We designed and constructed 17 indicators that sought to characterize the transformed and inhabited space according to receptivity to dengue. We used data on land use and occupation, connectivity, climate, and landscape. We developed the dengue receptivity through principal component analysis (PCA), using multiple criteria analysis and map algebra integrated in a GIS platform. Results: The most receptive areas were concentrated in the transition between the north and west zones of the city, a region of unconsolidated urban sprawl. The areas of greatest receptivity had the highest incidence and density ofAedeseggs during the study period. The correlation between receptivity index and incidence rate was positive in the epidemic years. Conclusion: The proposed set of indicators was able to identify areas of greater receptivity, such as regions of disorderly urban sprawl, with a concentration of social and environmental processes that are related to the occurrence of dengue outbreaks and high vector density. On the other hand, population immunity plays an important role in the spatial distribution of dengue during non-epidemic years.

AB  - Aedes aegypti (L.), the main vector of dengue and other arboviruses, was declared eradicated from Argentina in 1964; however, in 1987, it was detected again and nowadays it occurs in most of the country territory. To understand the transmission of vector-borne diseases, knowledge of the dispersal of vector populations is essential to evaluate the risk of pathogen transmission. We conducted a population genetic analysis of Ae. aegypti in 20 neighborhoods from Cordoba, the second largest city in Argentina, using 10 microsatellite loci. High genetic differentiation and the absence of an isolation by distance pattern was found using Weir and Cockerham's theta. Bayesian and multivariate clustering analyses showed that the studied sites included individuals with high membership coefficients (Q) in their populations, individuals with membership in another cluster, and admixed individuals. Individuals with high Q in clusters different from the population in which they were collected strongly suggests that passive transport is important in shaping the Ae. aegypti dispersal pattern in COrdoba city. Knowing the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations and their dispersal patterns would contribute to the implementation of vector control programs.

AB  - Microbial ecosystems of the built environments have become key mediators of health as people worldwide tend to spend large amount of time indoors. Underexposure to microbes at an early age is linked to increased risks of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Transportation systems are of particular interest, as they are globally the largest space for interactions between city-dwellers.
   Here we performed the first pilot study of the Moscow subway microbiome by analyzing swabs collected from 5 types of surfaces at 4 stations using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The study was conducted as a part of The Metagenomics and Metadesign of the Subways and Urban Biomes (MetaSUB) project.
   The most abundant microbial taxa comprising the subway microbiome originated from soil and human skin. Microbiome diversity was positively correlated with passenger traffic. No substantial evidence of major human pathogens presence was found. Co-occurrence analysis revealed clusters of microbial genera including combinations of microbes likely originating from different niches. The clusters as well as the most abundant microbes were similar to ones obtained for the published data on New-York City subway microbiome.
   Our results suggest that people are the main source and driving force of diversity in subway-associated microbiome. The data form a basis for a wider survey of Moscow subway microbiome to explore its longitudinal dynamics by analyzing an extended set of sample types and stations. Complementation of methods with viability testing, "shotgun" metagenomics, sequencing of bacterial isolates and culturomics will provide insights for public health, biosafety, microbial ecology and urban design.

AB  - Antibiotic-resistant pathogens pose a significant threat to human health. Several dispersal mechanisms have been described, but transport of both microbes and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) via atmospheric particles has received little attention as a pathway for global dissemination. These atmospheric particles can return to the Earth's surface via rain or snowfall, and thus promote long-distance spread of ARGs. However, the diversity and abundance of ARGs in fresh snow has not been studied and their potential correlation with particulate air pollution is not well explored. Here, we characterized ARGs in 44 samples of fresh snow from major cities in China, three in North America, and one in Europe, spanning a gradient from pristine to heavily anthropogenically influenced ecosystems. High-throughput qPCR analysis of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) provided strong indications that dissemination of ARGs in fresh snow could be exacerbated by air pollution, severely increasing the health risks of both air pollution and ARGs. We showed that snowfall did effectively spread ARGs from point sources over the Earth surface. Together our findings urge for better pollution control to reduce the risk of global dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes.

AB  - Simple Summary Red foxes are a well-established species of urban ecosystems in the UK and worldwide. Understanding how foxes use urban landscapes is important for urban biodiversity and disease management. The Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH) proposes that home range size is smaller in larger, better quality habitats and increases as such habitats become patchier. Here, we tested the RDH for foxes in the city of Brighton and Hove, focusing on predominantly residential areas, as foxes are reported to prefer residential gardens to other urban habitats. We compared fox range size according to extent of garden land cover and varying garden size and configuration. We tracked 20 foxes (12 males and 8 females) with satellite collars recording at 15 min intervals for several weeks over four seasons to determine their range size and internal structure. We then measured garden size and configuration within fox ranges using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We found that foxes had smaller ranges in areas containing few, large, well-connected gardens and larger ranges where numerous smaller gardens were crisscrossed by internal barriers (e.g., fences, walls) or fragmented by other habitats. Our findings confirm the RDH, showing that habitat dispersion can be used to predict fox movement in cities with relevance to urban planning. Red foxes are a well-established species of urban ecosystems in the UK and worldwide. Understanding the spatial ecology of foxes in urban landscapes is important for enhancement of urban biodiversity and effective disease management. The Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH) holds that territory (home range) size is linked to distribution and richness of habitat patches such that aggregation of rich resources should be negatively associated with range size. Here, we tested the RDH on a sample of 20 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)in the city of Brighton and Hove. We focused on residential garden areas, as foxes were associated with these in previous studies. We equipped 12 male and 8 female foxes with GPS collars recording at 15 min intervals during discrete seasons over four years. We regressed fox core area size against garden size, number of garden patches, and edge density within and between patches as extracted from GIS in a series of bivariate linear mixed models. We found that foxes used smaller core areas where gardens were large and well-connected and larger core areas where numerous, smaller gardens were fragmented by internal barriers (e.g., fences, walls) or bisected by other habitats such as managed grassland or built-up areas. Our findings confirm the RDH and help to inform future urban planning for wildlife.

TI  - ST-MFM: A Spatiotemporal Multi-Modal Fusion Model for Urban Anomalies Prediction
T2  - ECAI 2020: 24TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

CP  - 24th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)
AB  - Urban anomaly prediction is of great importance for urban management and public safety. Accurate anomaly prediction can avoid much unnecessary loss. Urban anomalies are usually caused by many complex factors, such as festivals, demonstrations and market promotions. It is not possible to predict anomalies from the perspective of reason, thus, most of the previous work analyzes the impacts of anomalies from multiple crowd flow datasets and observes the shift to ordinary distribution when they occur. Most existing models use observation-based methods to extract relevant spatiotemporal features, which are difficult to fully extract hidden relationships and eventually lead to low accuracy and low recall. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning based approach, called spatiotemporal multi-modal fusion model to collect the impacts of urban anomalies on multiple crowd flow datasets and predict anomalies in each region of the city for next time interval in turn. More specifically, we model the city into a graph and regard each region as a node. We use graph convolution network to obtain its spatial features and use gate recurrent units to obtain its temporal features. The features of those multiple modalities are further aggregated with points of interest in a two-stage-fusion method for assigning different weights to different functional regions. We evaluate our method using five datasets associated with New York City: 311 complaints, taxicab data, bike rental data, points of interest and road network dataset. Results show the advantages nearly 10% beyond the-state-of-the-art urban anomalies prediction methods.

AB  - The landscape's structure can play a relevant role in epidemic patterns of arboviruses, influencing factors such as abundance, movement, and dispersal ability in arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts, besides promoting alterations in the rate of potential infectious contacts between these organisms. In the Americas, yellow fever (YF) exhibits only the sylvatic cycle, in which the virus circulates in sylvatic areas among non-human primates, being transmitted by mosquitoes of the Haemagogus and Sabethes genera. In this study, we investigate some aspects of the landscape in relation to diversity and abundance of culicid species associated with YF transmission. Studies were performed in the Cantareira State Park, a remnant of the Atlantic Forest located in Greater Metropolitan Sao Paulo, Brazil, where the YF virus circulated recently with dozens of deaths in howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba), in addition to reported human cases. Mosquito collections were carried out monthly from February 2015 to April 2017. Mosquitoes were collected from three sites using battery-powered aspirator (12-volt battery), CDC, and Shannon traps for adults, and suction samplers and entomological spoons in breeding sites to collect immature forms. 703 mosquitoes belonging to 12 species of the Aedini and Sabethini tribes were collected. Aedes scapularis and Psorophora ferox exhibited higher abundance, while Haemagogus leucocelaenus, the main vector of YF in Sao Paulo state, showed lower abundance in all sampled areas. The site with longer edge between forest area and anthropic area presented more richness and abundance of YF vector species, while the site with larger forest cover area and shorter edges between forest and anthropic areas exhibited an inverse pattern. Statistically significant differences were observed between the composition of potential YF vector species among the investigated sites. Although Hg. leucocelaenus occurred in all sampled sites, the different patterns of distribution and abundance of other mosquitoes such as Aedes scapularis and Psorophora ferox suggest that these species may be involved in the transmission of sylvatic YF in the study area.

AB  - The article explores the role of solidarity in housing movement organizations in Rome (Italy). Most notably, it enquires the modalities through which activists try to prevent the housing eviction of precarious urban dwellers, the majority of whom are immigrants. The argument is twofold. First, these practices foster solidarity between migrant and non-migrant locals, contributing to the formation of a new collective subjectivity that brings together individualized local and immigrant inhabitants sharing a need for a roof. Second, this process has an impact on the cityscape as it contributes to mapping alternative models of city construction. This article is based on an extensive participant observation (2016) in the network Movements for the Right to Inhabit and on in-depth interviews with activists and experts.

AB  - Increasing coastal populations and urban development have led to the loss of estuarine habitats for fish and wildlife. Specifically, a decline in complexity and heterogeneity of tidal marshes and creeks is thought to negatively impact fish communities by altering the function of nursery grounds, including predator refuge and prey resources. To offset these impacts, numerous agencies are restoring degraded habitats while also creating new ones where habitat has been lost. To improve understanding of what contributes to a successful restoration, six quarterly sampling events using two gear types to collect small- and large-bodied fishes were conducted to compare the fish community structure and habitat characteristics at three natural, three restored, and three impacted (i.e. ditched) areas along the coast of Tampa Bay, Florida. Overall, impacted sites had significantly lower small-bodied and juvenile fish diversity than natural and restored areas, while restored sites harbored a greater number of fish species than impacted sites for both large- and small-bodied fish. Habitat features such as shoreline slope differentiated impacted and restored from natural areas. Although we did not find a direct correlation, habitat heterogeneity likely played a role in structuring fish communities. These findings provide guidance for future coastal restoration or modification of existing projects. Specifically, the habitat mosaic approach of creating a geographically compact network of heterogenous habitat characteristics is likely to support fish diversity, while decreasing shoreline slope in a greater amount of area within coastal wetland restorations would more closely mimic natural areas.

AB  - Urban environments have been shown to have profound, yet still poorly understood effects on key ecosystem processes such as carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling, as well as for key aspects of organism ecology, such as community assembly and network interactions. The study of natural abundances of C and N stable isotopes, C-13 and N-15, can help infer mechanistic hypotheses on ecosystem processes at play in urban environments. No existing study has investigated whether a visible urban effect on soil and plant C and N biogeochemistry is being transferred to the animal compartment of urban ecosystems through trophic interactions. Here, we report C-13 and N-15 natural abundance values measured on three pollinating species of wild bees (Lasioglossum laticeps, Lasioglossum morio, and Lasioglossum nitidulum) sampled in 12 locations along an urbanization gradient in the Ile-de-France region (Paris area, France). Our objective was to test whether already recorded isotopic patterns in urban soils and plants in the Paris area would also be visible in pollinators, and to reflect on whether this would be indicative of an urban isotopic signal being transferred to pollinators. Results indicate a significant effect of urbanization on the delta C-13 and delta N-15 for all three bee species, with enrichment for both C-13 and N-15 linked to increased urbanization. This could be linked to an urban imprint on the diverse plants on which pollinating insects forage on in the Paris area, or to other factors linked to the physiology and foraging strategies of insects. A better understanding of the drivers influencing pollinator delta C-13 and delta N-15 could help better understand urban biogeochemistry and trophic chains, as well as elucidate the origin of specimens and the migratory capacities of bee species, an important yet still elusive question considering the increase of habitat fragmentation.

AB  - Introduction: Although Brownfield greening (BG) can be a crucial solution to green space deficiency in dense urban areas, the potential benefits of different BG initiatives have rarely been quantitatively pre-evaluated. Here, the concept and main features of BG and its costs and benefits are firstly depicted. Next, a conceptual framework is presented which combines ecosystem service (ESS) valuation, economic cost-benefit analysis, and spatial pattern analysis. The framework is used to perform ex ante valuation of the ESS value of BG in Xuhui District, Shanghai. Outcomes: The scenario comparison results show that it can spatially reflect a closer-to-reality value of ESS at the urban scale instead of a theoretical value at the site scale. The ultimate values of ESS (After economic and landscape adjustments) in the composite scenario is more than 21% higher than those in the full-eco scenario, whereas the initial values of ESS (before the adjustments) in the former was 14% lower than those in the latter. These results suggest that a considerable part of brownfield greening projects need to be implemented in the more populated and economically vibrant areas instead of solely in the ecological construction zone, thereby correspondingly providing more cultural and regulation services and forming a better urban green space network. Conclusion: The framework provides a simple, science-based, and feasible tool for making BG decisions from a systematic perspective in dense urban areas. It can help meet the need for applying ESS knowledge to BG-based green space planning and policy making in the context of urban sustainable development.

AB  - Households diversify their income driven by various push and pull factors. This research examined whether income diversification is a means of survival or accumulation among rural and semi-urban households of Ambo district, Ethiopia. A survey of households from rural and semi-urban (n= 350) was conducted. We used Simpson's index of diversity and Shannon's equitability index to measure household income diversity. Ordinary least squares estimation method and independent samplesttest were also employed in data analysis. Additionally, instrumental variable method was applied to overcome the possibility of reverse causality (an endogeneity bias). The result indicated that household income diversification was a means ofsurvivalfor rural households and a means ofaccumulationfor semi-urban households in the study areas. The findings also showed that rural households had a predisposition to specialization than diversification, while the semi-urban households diversified their income moderately. Moreover, from the variables used to determine household income diversification in the second-stage least square model, education, family size, distance to market, crop failure and income were statistically significant. The study suggests policy interventions that facilitate the scaling up of income diversification and the movement of poor households out of low-return and high-risk activities to sustainable economic activities along with easier access to credit and market.

AB  - Many estuarine shorelines are influenced by urbanization. Extensive shoreline modification in Upper New York Harbor (UNYH) included port development, landfilling marshes, and armoring. Recent sedimentation in constructed shipping terminal embayments, abandonment of shoreline structure maintenance, subsequent recruitment of upland and intertidal vegetation, and restoration projects have naturalized some shorelines in this urban setting. We determined the species composition and relative abundance of fishes and crabs in shallow shoreline habitats in constructed embayments of UNYH with seine sampling to determine the potential for restoring similar isolated shallow water sites as functional habitats. Twenty-seven identified species of fishes and crabs, including seasonally transient and resident marsh species, were represented in samples dominated by Menidia menidia, but marsh resident and coastal ocean species were also periodically abundant. Differences in assemblage structure among the sampled embayments as measured by principal components analysis were weak despite some differences in the slope and colonization of vegetation along shorelines. The mere presence of shallow shorelines was sufficient to recruit numerous species. Assemblage differences relative to a nearby relatively unaltered estuary revealed a lack of southern, warm affiliated species reflecting a natural clinal gradient. Marsh resident species dominated in UNYH, but not as strongly as at the reference estuary. Together with a previously published evaluation of life cycle connectivity for several sentinel species, this study shows that even small, isolated projects seeking to restore shallow shorelines add value to the estuarine landscape and are worth pursuing.

AB  - Many of the world's major cities are located in coastal zones, resulting in urban and industrial impacts on adjacent marine ecosystems. These pressures, which include pollutants, sewage, runoff and debris, temperature increases, hardened shorelines/structures, and light and acoustic pollution, have resulted in new evolutionary landscapes for coastal marine organisms. Marine environmental changes influenced by urbanization may create new selective regimes or may influence neutral evolution via impacts on gene flow or partitioning of genetic diversity across seascapes. While some urban selective pressures, such as hardened surfaces, are similar to those experienced by terrestrial species, others, such as oxidative stress, are specific to aquatic environments. Moreover, spatial and temporal scales of evolutionary responses may differ in the ocean due to the spatial extent of selective pressures and greater capacity for dispersal/gene flow. Here, we present a conceptual framework and synthesis of current research on evolutionary responses of marine organisms to urban pressures. We review urban impacts on genetic diversity and gene flow and examine evidence that marine species are adapting, or are predicted to adapt, to urbanization over rapid evolutionary time frames. Our findings indicate that in the majority of studies, urban stressors are correlated with reduced genetic diversity. Genetic structure is often increased in urbanized settings, but artificial structures can also act as stepping stones for some hard-surface specialists, promoting range expansion. Most evidence for rapid adaptation to urban stressors comes from studies of heritable tolerance to pollutants in a relatively small number of species; however, the majority of marine ecotoxicology studies do not test directly for heritability. Finally, we highlight current gaps in our understanding of evolutionary processes in marine urban environments and present a framework for future research to address these gaps.

AB  - Deforestation and fragmentation are two of the main factors responsible for climate change. The construction of large enterprises such as hydropower plants can modify landscape dynamics, boosting the urban centers and other economic land uses. We evaluated the landscape around Governador Bento Munhoz da Rocha Netto Hydropower Plant, Parana, Brazil, aiming to identify the land use dynamics since its construction in 1980. Satellite images of the years 1976, 1984 and 2016 were obtained and landscape and patch metrics of composition, shape, core area, connectivity and isolation were calculated. The deforestation conversion profile was also evaluated. Our results showed a reduction of forest areas by 18.9%, with great replacement of forest stands. A large increase of small forest remnants was noted, indicating a high degree of landscape fragmentation and an expressive reduction of the core area. The deforestation profile revealed that the transformation rates were low, indicating gradual conversions. On the other hand, conversions of natural areas occurred in almost half the area in the initial years - which comprise the period after hydropower plant construction. Changes in the landscape may be related to the hydroelectric plant construction. However, the local economic cycle that happened naturally may have driven the forest fragmentation.

AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.) is the primary vector of various infectious viruses and is typified by a polymorphic color and abundance of white scales on the body. It has been conventionally separated into two subspecies, Ae. aeg. formosus (Walker) (Aaf) and Ae. aeg. aegypti (L.) (Aaa), with Aaf considered a 'sylvan' form and Aaa a 'domestic' form. Because the two subspecies show different susceptibilities to dengue viruses it is important to understand their distribution. In this study, we collected larvae from artificial and natural habitats in southern Kenya and reared them to adults to morphologically identify subspecies. We describe the geographical distribution and relative abundance of Aaa and Aaf in Kenya, and estimate the environmental factors associated with their distributions by GIS using climate and environment data. A total of 5,243 Ae. aegypti adults were collected from 249 sites, with Aaa accounting for 22% of the specimens. The relative abundance of Aaa was higher in coastal areas versus sites in western Kenya. Aaa abundance was also higher in urbanized than forested areas, which is consistent with known ecology. In contrast and inconsistent with previous studies, both Aaa and Aaf were sympatric in artificial and natural habitats. The high relative abundance of Aaa in coastal areas might derive from old populated cities, climate, and/or introduction from abroad.

AB  - Green infrastructure enhancements are widely supported to address urban heat-related risks. The challenge of implementing enhancements in dense cities has necessitated the development of surface greening, with vertical living walls having gained increased prominence in recent years. This paper considered the performance of such in-situ applications to quantify the extents of their influence on the microclimates of two sheltered urban conditions. The results highlight the potency of hygrothermal modifications to be most apparent within the proximate zone, with other phenomena introducing mixing to disrupt influence distribution. Air movement data at the indoor study also highlights a dominant daytime downward flow that encourages the formation of a microscale centripetal thermal system. This flow lacks potency to cause discomfort, although has capacity to present thermal sensation and diversity to occupants. The findings therefore highlight the necessity for installation designers to take account of proximity influence, and in future designs increase building occupant access to their canopies.

AB  - Aim Hotspots of human activity are focal points for ecosystem disturbance and non-native introduction, from which invading populations disperse and spread. As such, connectivity to locations used by humans may influence the likelihood of invasion. Moreover, connectivity in freshwater ecosystems may follow the hydrological network. Here we tested whether multiple forms of connectivity to human recreational activities promotes biological invasion of freshwater ecosystems.
   Location England, UK.
   Time period 1990-2018.
   Major taxa studied One hundred and twenty-six non-native freshwater birds, crustaceans, fish, molluscs and plants.
   Methods Machine learning was used to predict spatial gradients in human recreation and two high risk activities for invasion (fishing and water sports). Connectivity indices were developed for each activity, in which human influence decayed from activity hotspots according to Euclidean distance (spatial connectivity) or hydrological network distance (downstream, upstream and along-channel connectivity). Generalized linear mixed models identified the connectivity type most associated to invasive species richness of each group, while controlling for other anthropogenic and environmental drivers.
   Results Connectivity to humans generally had stronger positive effects on invasion than all other drivers except recording effort. Recreation had stronger influence than urban land cover, and for most groups high risk activities had stronger effects than general recreation. Downstream human connectivity was most important for invasion by most of the groups, potentially reflecting predominantly hydrological dispersal. An exception was birds, for which spatial connectivity was most important, possibly because of overland dispersal capacity.
   Main conclusions These findings support the hypothesis that freshwater invasion is partly determined by an interaction between human activity and species dispersal in the hydrological network. By comparing alternative connectivity types for different human activities, our approach could enable robust inference of specific pathways and spread mechanisms associated with particular taxa. This would provide evidence to support better prioritization of surveillance and management for invasive non-native species.

AB  - Network analysis was used as a method to investigate the relationship between benthic macroinvertebrates in an urban river watershed and physicochemical variables. The measured physicochemical variables were the dissolved oxygen, temperature, nutrients, conductivity, pH, total organic matter, biochemical oxygen demand and river discharge. The metrics applied in the study were the degree of connections between nodes, the number of edges identified for each study location and the functional feeding groups. The river sampling took place over 14 months and sampling took place at five sites, two of which were upstream of a major wastewater treatment works and three sites were downstream of the works. A biological and environmental (BIOENV) analysis was included as part of the overall analysis to compare the variables that influenced the river ecosystem. This study shows that the relationships between benthic macroinvertebrates were stronger at the upstream locations of the watershed, while the downstream locations were controlled by the physicochemical relationships. From this analysis, the river quality and biodiversity were mainly controlled by the discharge, conductivity and availability of relevant organic matter suitable for organisms. Through the network, the degree of connections between the variables revealed the status of the urban river and provided insight into the possible management of vegetation cover across the urban watershed.

AB  - Context. In Australia, various species of macropods (family Macropodidae) are known to occur within peri-urban areas, where they can be a source of human-wildlife conflict. Some species, such as the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), have received considerable research attention over the past few years following demands from land managers for evidence-based management guidelines; however, the ecology of other macropod species found in peri-urban areas, such as the eastern wallaroo (Osphranter robustus robustus), remains poorly understood.
   Aims. The aims were to determine the home range of male and female eastern wallaroos and assess habitat selection in order to define whether wallaroos in a peri-urban environment should be viewed as thriving ('matrix-occupying'), persisting ('matrix-sensitive') or struggling ('urban-sensitive').
   Methods. Home range and habitat use of six adult male, five adult female and one subadult male eastern wallaroo were investigated using GPS telemetry between October 2017 and May 2018 in the south-west of Sydney.
   Key results. Home ranges (mean +/- s.e.) of males (63.1 +/- 10.2 ha) were significantly larger than those of females (31.1 +/- 3.3 ha). Every adult wallaroo had highly overlapping monthly home ranges, indicating strong site fidelity in all individuals. Eastern wallaroos selected habitats based on vegetation composition during the night and canopy cover during the day. Grassland and open native woodlands were preferred during foraging activities at night. By contrast, humanmodified habitats, including hard surfaces and lawns, were avoided at all times by all individuals.
   Conclusion. The results indicate that eastern wallaroos avoid human-modified features in the landscape, so they could be viewed as persisting ('matrix-sensitive') in peri-urban areas. Implications. Compared with matrix-occupying macropods, such as the eastern grey kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo is less likely to cause human-wildlife conflicts - a result of its avoidance of human-modified habitat. Land-use planning, involving green corridors linking remnant vegetation, should be implemented as part of urban planning to enable the persistence of diverse mammal populations in urban areas, particularly matrix-sensitive species.

AB  - Broadband access in the home is a necessity, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasingly, connectivity is of vital importance for school, work, family, and friends. Existing international research on the implementation of broadband has studied its adoption patterns with a focus on the rural/urban digital divide. This paper explores the digital divide in a case study of the seventh largest city, by population, in the United States; San Antonio is a majority-minority city where over half of the people are Hispanic. This paper focuses on the five key affordability factors that drive broadband adoption. Researchers test social exclusion theory, the structural facets of poverty and social marginality to ascertain its potential impact on broadband access. The authors conducted a survey in both English and Spanish to learn more about the affordability factors that influence the broadband digital divide. Through our analysis, we found evidence that four of the factors (geographical disparities, profit-based discrimination, technology deployment cost, and socio-economic factors) played a role in the digital divide in this case study. The results of this study demonstrate that the digital divide is not exclusively a rural/urban digital divide, but can also occur in an intra-city context. This is especially evident in low-income areas within the city because they have substantially lower broadband adoption rates. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of looking closely at issues of social exclusion of marginalized groups and the affordability of broadband access intra-city.

AB  - Although biodiversity is generally diminishing, in some areas its conservation is expanding. However; the exact path of this expansion is uncertain. This can lead to problems of path-dependence and lock-in effects. Path dependence describes situations where history strongly influences present decisions and lock-in effects refer to situations where an earlier decision provides strong incentives to follow a particular path, even if more efficient alternatives are available later on. We develop a conceptual ecological-economic model to investigate which ecological and economic parameters favour the appearance of efficiency losses in biodiversity conservation due to path dependence and lock-in effects in a dynamic two-period two-region model. Generally we find that efficiency losses occur if there are signals that guide the first-period budget into a region that later turns out to be suboptimal if both time periods had been considered right from the beginning. To illustrate the conservation relevance of our findings, we present potential efficiency losses through path dependence in the hypothetical case of applying offsets to conserving the endangered Maculinea teleius butterfly near the city of Landau in Germany.

AB  - Simple Summary Hedgehogs are declining in the United Kingdom and are now absent from large areas of agriculture land. This commentary discusses the requirements of hedgehogs and links these to land management options that are currently used to benefit wildlife in agricultural areas. Using our knowledge of hedgehog requirements for population persistence, we suggest which land management practices are likely to be of benefit to hedgehogs in the hope that land owners will adopt some of the suggestions to help maintain and expand existing hedgehog populations across agricultural landscapes of the United Kingdom. Hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are traditionally thought of as being a rural dwelling species, associated with rural and agricultural landscapes across Europe. However, recent studies have highlighted that hedgehogs are more likely to be found in urban than rural habitats in the United Kingdom. Here, we review the status of rural hedgehog populations across the UK and evaluate the potential benefits of agri-environment schemes for hedgehog persistence, while highlighting a lack of empirical evidence that agri-environment options will benefit hedgehog populations. Our synthesis has implications for future conservation strategies for hedgehogs and insectivorous mammals living in agricultural landscapes, and calls for more empirical studies on agri-environment options and their potential benefits to hedgehogs.

AB  - We analysed the population characteristics of African spurred tortoises (Centrochelys sulcata) kept in captivity in cities in Burkina Faso (West Africa), a country where the species occurs naturally. We focused on two cities - Ouagadougou, the capital and the largest city in the country and Fada N'Gourma in the East of the country. We identified 50 households in Ouagadougou and 14 in Fada that kept spurred tortoises in captivity.
   We recorded a total of 310 tortoises from which we took morphometric data of 281 individuals. Another 63 spurred tortoises were reported in other locations in Ouagadougou, but no access was allowed by the owners. Most tortoises in Ouagadougou were young, and had an equal sex ratio. In Fada, the majority of tortoises were adults and there was a practically even sex ratio. Population structure of the captive tortoises differed between cities, and about 30% of the Fada individuals were captured from the wild in the surroundings of the town. Body size of spurred tortoises in both cities differed between sexes: males were significantly heavier and had longer carapace and plastron than females. Body condition status was similar in Ouagadougou and Fada, with large adults being underweight compared to their optimal. The distribution of tortoise numbers according to city sector in both cities was clumped. Tortoise owners varied in their socioeconomic background. Most tortoises are fed an omnivorous diet, but some were given a strictly herbivorous regime. Our results suggest that there is a significant potential to engage tortoise owners to use their animals in a collaborative captive breeding programme to produce hatchlings for reintroduction.

AB  - Little is known about the relatedness structure of carnivores living in urban areas, where green spaces may vary in size and resource availability. We examined the minimum population size, relatedness structure, and genetic diversity of a recently established population of eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) inhabiting New York City (NYC). The population has been established for approximately 25 years, and sample collection for genetic analysis has been ongoing since 2010. We genotyped 234 scat, eight tissue, and three blood samples at nine microsatellite loci. We identified 45 individual coyotes with a male-biased sex ratio of 2.2:1. We also found moderate to high levels of genetic diversity, with average observed heterozygosity of 0.779 and mean number of alleles per locus of 7.8. Most of the green spaces surveyed supported a single group of closely related coyotes in each. Relatedness comparisons between parks also indicated that coyotes compared across different parks were also closely related. We identified two unrelated mated pairs and found no support for polygamy. The high incidence of relatedness suggests that the coyote population is descended from a small number of founding individuals. Additionally, we genetically recaptured several coyotes, including one individual sampled in the Bronx and in Queens, with a median of 103 days between resampling. This result indicates that the coyotes are persisting in some of the isolated greenspaces of New York City and able to move successfully between them.

AB  - Mental health is an exceedingly prevalent concern for the urban population. Mounting evidence has confirmed the plausibility of high incidences of mental disorders in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. However, the association between the neighborhood built environment and individual mental health is understudied and far from conclusive, especially in developing countries such as China. The underlying mechanism requires in-depth analysis combining potential intermediates such as perceived environmental disorder and supportive social relationships. Using a health survey conducted in Beijing in 2017, this study investigates for the first time a socio-environmental pathway through which perceived disorder and social interaction account for the relationship between the built environment and mental health under the very notion of the neighborhood effect. The results from multilevel structural equation models indicate that individual mental health is influenced by the neighborhood-scale built environment through three pathways, independent of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantages: (1) proximity to parks is the sole indicator directly linked to mental health; (2) population density, road connectivity and proximity to parks are indirectly associated with mental health through interactions with neighbors; and (3) population density, road connectivity and facility diversity are partially associated with perceived neighborhood disorder, which is indirectly correlated with mental health through interactions with neighbors. This study is a preliminary attempt to disentangle the complex relationships among the neighborhood environment, social interaction and mental health in the context of developing megacities. The relevant findings provide an important reference for urban planners and administrators regarding how to build health-supportive neighborhoods and healthy cities.

AB  - Urban movement data as collected by location-based social networks provides valuable information about routes and specific roads that people are likely to drive on. This allows us to pinpoint roads that occur in many routes and are thus sensitive to congestion. Redistributing some of the traffic to avoid unnecessary use of these roads could be a key factor in improving traffic flow. Many of the previously proposed approaches to combat congestion are either static (e.g. a city tax) or do not incorporate any movement data and hence ignore how citizens use the infrastructure. In this work, we present a method to redistribute traffic through the introduction of externally imposed variable costs to each road segment, assuming that all drivers seek to drive the cheapest route. We propose using a metaheuristic optimisation approach to minimise total travel times by optimising a set of road-specific variable cost parameters, which are used as input for an objective function based on Greenshields traffic flow theory. We evaluate the performance of this approach within the context of a case study on the city centre of Tokyo. An optimisation scenario was defined for this city using public spatial road network data, and movement data acquired from Foursquare. Experimental results on this case study show that, depending on the amount of cars on the road network, our proposed method has the potential to achieve an improvement between 1.35% (437 hours for 112,985 drivers) and 13.15% (925 hours for 31,584 drivers) of total travel time, compared to that of a currently operational road network configuration with no imposed variable costs.

AB  - Melioidosis is a severe disease caused by the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei that affects both humans and animals throughout northern Australia, Southeast Asia and increasingly globally. While there is a considerable degree of genetic diversity amongst isolates, B. pseudomallei has a robust global biogeographic structure and genetic populations are spatially clustered in the environment. We examined the distribution and local spread of B. pseudomallei in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, which has the highest recorded urban incidence of melioidosis globally. We sampled soil and land runoff throughout the city centre and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on B. pseudomallei isolates. By combining phylogenetic analyses, Bayesian clustering and spatial hot spot analysis our results demonstrate that some sequence types (STs) are widespread in the urban Darwin environment, while others are highly spatially clustered over a small geographic scale. This clustering matches the spatial distribution of clinical cases for one ST. Results also demonstrate a greater overall isolate diversity recovered from drains compared to park soils, further supporting the role drains may play in dispersal of B. pseudomallei STs in the environment. Collectively, knowledge gained from this study will allow for better understanding of B. pseudomallei phylogeography and melioidosis source attribution, particularly on a local level.

AB  - Flash mobs are commonly portrayed in the media as light-hearted events intended to surprise bystanders. Meanwhile, academic literature features a number of explicitly political interpretations of flash mobs. However, to date, no empirical study has addressed why individuals organize and take part in the internationally spread mass events organized by the most popular contemporary flash mob incarnation, the Urban Playground Movement (UPM). In this paper, we place Budapest's UPM on an entertainment practice versus social movement mobilization spectrum. Our interviews with the leaders of the largest Hungarian UPM organization show that the functioning of the UPM in Budapest heavily relies on social movement continuity, where organizers see their events as ways to reclaim public spaces and to prefigure more social cities. However, among participants surveyed at the most notable yearly UPM event, the International Pillow Fight Day, we found fun as the primary motivation for participation, thus showing movement discontinuity. We conclude that the UPM in Budapest is a collective action, but not a social movement. Secondly, we find that the UPM exhibits 'thin' diffusion both in its reliance on individual activists over coalitions and in its usage of commercial social media as its diffusion infrastructure. Lastly, our results show that UPM collectives can act as 'containers' of social movement frames, implying that these playful groups could function as vehicles in the spread of protest in movement milieus. Our key finding that UPM is not a social movement contradicts the numerous academic interpretations of flash mobs as outright political events.

AB  - The constituents of a complex system exchange information to function properly. Their signaling dynamics often leads to the appearance of emergent phenomena, such as phase transitions and collective behaviors. While information exchange has been widely modeled by means of distinct spreading processes-such as continuous-time diffusion, random walks, synchronization and consensus-on top of complex networks, a unified and physically grounded framework to study information dynamics and gain insights about the macroscopic effects of microscopic interactions is still eluding us. In this paper, we present this framework in terms of a statistical field theory of information dynamics, unifying a range of dynamical processes governing the evolution of information on top of static or time-varying structures. We show that information operators form a meaningful statistical ensemble and their superposition defines a density matrix that can be used for the analysis of complex dynamics. As a direct application, we show that the von Neumann entropy of the ensemble can be a measure of the functional diversity of complex systems, defined in terms of the functional differentiation of higher-order interactions among their components. Our results suggest that modularity and hierarchy, two key features of empirical complex systems-from the human brain to social and urban networks-play a key role to guarantee functional diversity and, consequently, are favored.

AB  - This article makes a case for reappraising the designed landscapes of post-war social housing as welfare landscapes to inform current debates, policies and practices regarding social housing and its renewal. We look back at the development processes of three Danish estates which literally materialised the emerging welfare state in concrete, asphalt, plantings and earthworks. Guided by actor-network theory we recount how their landscapes materialised as multiscalar socio-material assemblages. We show that non-human things played a crucial role in the development of welfare landscapes which focused on child welfare and community development, offered architectural and ecological diversity, and co-shaped the urban landscape beyond the individual estates. Understanding welfare landscapes as socio-material assemblages does not only acknowledge the role of non-human things in their historical production. Ultimately it also calls for the inclusion of the welfare of non-human species and may offer inspiration for developing future welfare landscapes for more than humans.

AB  - The vertical dimension constitutes an important niche axis along which mosquitoes may adjust their distribution. Here, we evaluated whether the vertical distribution of container-inhabiting Aedes mosquitoes differs along a gradient of anthropogenic land-use intensity within an urban landscape. Using a pulley system, we hung oviposition cups at three heights (ground level, 4.5, and 9 m) and in three habitats: forest, park, and a built environment. We hypothesized that mosquito abundance and diversity would be highest in the least disturbed forest habitat, decrease in the park, and be lowest at the UNC-Greensboro campus. We also expected Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Ae. triseriatus (Say) to mainly oviposit at ground level and Ae. hendersoni (Cockerell) at canopy height. Aedes albopictus was the most common species (68.8%) collected in all three habitat types and was the only species found in the built environment. In that habitat, Ae. albopictus exhibited a bimodal distribution with the lowest activity at the intermediate height (4.5 m). Aedes triseriatus (28.9%) did not differ in egg abundance between the forest and park habitats but did exhibit diverse vertical habitat use while avoiding the canopy in the park habitat. Aedes hendersoni (2.3%) was the most sylvatic species and oviposited only at ground level. Our results indicate that the vertical distribution of mosquitoes is affected by the type of habitat in which they occur, and that this variation could be driven via local-scale modification of microclimatic factors.

AB  - Aquatic bacterial communities play an important role in biogeochemical cycling in river ecosystems; however, knowledge of the linkages between bacterial communities and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in urban rivers is limited. Here, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and parallel factor (PARAFAC) modeling of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy were used to analyze the compositions, co-occurrence patterns, and interactions with chromophoric DOM (CDOM) of bacterial communities in urban river water samples influenced by different human activities. The results revealed that two protein-like components accounted for 65.2 +/- 9.56% of the total variability in all three fluorescence components, which suggests that CDOM in urban rivers is mainly a microbial source. In addition to pH and DO, CDOM is also an important factor affecting bacterial community structure, and the main classes (Gammaproteobacteria and Clostridia) and genera (Limnohabitans and Alpinimonas) showed strong positive corre-lations with terrestrial humic-like C1 and tryptophan-like C2, respectively. When autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria coexist in urban rivers, the production and degradation of CDOM will occur simultaneously. Furthermore, the riverine bacterial co-occurrence network had a nonrandom modular structure, which was mainly driven by classification correlation and bacterial function. The high abundance of genes related to xenobiotic metabolism, carbon metabolism and nitrogen metabolism in the urban river indicated that anthropogenic activity may be the dominant selective force altering the bacterial communities. Overall, our results provide a novel view for the assembly of bacterial communities in urban river ecosystems under the influence of different human activities. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urbanization is a global phenomenon with major effects on species, the structure of community functional traits and ecological interactions. Body size is a key species trait linked to metabolism, life-history and dispersal as well as a major determinant of ecological networks. Here, using a well-replicated urban-rural sampling design in Central Europe, we investigate the direction of change of body size in response to urbanization in three common bumblebee species,Bombus lapidarius,Bombus pascuorumandBombus terrestris, and potential knock-on effects on pollination service provision. We found foragers ofB. terrestristo be larger in cities and the body size of all species to be positively correlated with road density (albeit at different, species-specific scales); these are expected consequences of habitat fragmentation resulting from urbanization. High ambient temperature at sampling was associated with both a small body size and an increase in variation of body size in all three species. At the community level, the community-weighted mean body size and its variation increased with urbanization. Urbanization had an indirect positive effect on pollination services through its effects not only on flower visitation rate but also on community-weighted mean body size and its variation. We discuss the eco-evolutionary implications of the effect of urbanization on body size, and the relevance of these findings for the key ecosystem service of pollination.

AB  - This article uses a multiscale approach for assessing landscape changes in one of the world's biodiversity hotspots in Brazil, the Rio Doce State Park (PERD). In this article, we assess land use changes over a 30 year period. Our results show that, while inside the park landscape changes were minimal, in the park buffer zone human induced changes are steadily rising due to an increase in eucalyptus plantations and urban sprawl that grew by 4% and 1.9%, respectively. Agricultural land has been reduced by 6.35%, but there are trends that a form of welcome forest transition has been occurring. We report an increase in native forests from 40,588 ha in 1985 to 45,690 ha in 2015. The analysis of human impacts in the study area delivers very different results when varying the pixel size from 25 ha to 900 m(2). The former shows a very high level of human influence while the latter reveals small but vital patches of native forest offering hopeful opportunities for sustainable natural resource management in this critical biome. Our work stresses the importance of better targeted policy making and sympathetic land use management of buffer zones of protected areas. Currently, such zones suffer from many development pressures and often experience contradictory policy frameworks which encourage a clash between biodiversity conservation and intensive agro husbandry production.

AB  - Large-scale population flow reshapes the economic landscape and is affected by unbalanced urban development. The exploration of migration patterns and their determinants is therefore crucial to reveal unbalanced urban development. However, low-resolution migration datasets and insufficient consideration of interactive differences have limited such exploration. Accordingly, based on 2019 Chinese Spring Festival travel-related big data from the AMAP platform, we used social network analysis (SNA) methods to accurately reveal population flow patterns. Then, with consideration of the spatial heterogeneity of interactive patterns, we used spatially weighted interactive models (SWIMs), which were improved by the incorporation of weightings into the global Poisson gravity model, to efficiently quantify the effect of socioeconomic factors on migration patterns. These SWIMs generated the local characteristics of the interactions and quantified results that were more regionally consistent than those generated by other spatial interaction models. The migration patterns had a spatially vertical structure, with the city development level being highly consistent with the flow intensity; for example, the first-level developments of Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Chongqing occupied a core position. A spatially horizontal structure was also formed, comprising 16 closely related city communities. Moreover, the quantified impact results indicated that migration pattern variation was significantly related to the population, value-added primary and secondary industry, the average wage, foreign capital, pension insurance, and certain aspects of unbalanced urban development. These findings can help policymakers to guide population migration, rationally allocate industrial infrastructure, and balance urban development.

KW  - urban projects
AB  - The paper aims to unveil the process of production of space on the Riverfront in the city of Porto Alegre, capital of Rio Grande do Sul - Brazil. The study is positioned in the field of Urban Critical Studies and its fundamental repertoire is Marxist thinking from the work of Henri Lefebvre. The data analysis takes place from the concepts of totality, reality and alienation together with the triad of the production of space that provides a trialetic movement between the conceived space (of the technicians, architects and urbanists), the perceived space (the spatial practice), with the lived space (the spaces of domination and / or transformation). The argument goes through the association of the action of the real estate market in relation to investment funds, the image of the city via urban marketing and urban entrepreneurialism with technological innovation and the creation of leisure consumption spaces that operate in valuing the value of the built environment. Even so, insurgent groups through occupations and social movements put themselves in the process struggling for a social production of urban space, against the neoliberal capitalist production.

AB  - Native to China and the Korean Peninsula, the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB),Anoplophora glabripennis, has been introduced to North America and Europe. In both its native range and the territory it has invaded, ALB is responsible for the death or removal of millions of urban, roadside, and forest trees. Here, we present the population genetic structure of ALB in South Korea, using 801 bp of mitochondrial DNA and the most comprehensive sampling to date. ALB populations in South Korea are divided into three distinct geographical subgroups: the northeastern natural forest, and the western and southern urban areas. Historical records suggest that the forest-dwelling subgroup is native, as does the moderate genetic diversity of this population. Meanwhile, the fact that ALB was first observed in the western and southern areas only recently, the extreme genetic bottleneck status of these populations, their distribution in large port cities and adjacent areas, and the difference in observed host plants used by the forest subgroup and the urban subgroups suggest that the urban populations are non-native recent invaders. Approximate Bayesian computation suggests that the western and southern subgroups most likely originated from northeastern and northwestern China, respectively. Therefore, our study demonstrates that ALB invasion has occurred even within the species' native territory. This finding alters our perception of biological invasion by providing a unique example of a species that has invaded its own native range.

AB  - Although the yard is a hybrid social and material landscape, much social science research emphasizes the socio-cultural factors and has mostly neglected the potentially important influence of plants, animals, and the nonliving material world on homeowners' decision-making. Using interviews across six metropolitan areas in the United States, we investigated the ways residential yards' nonhuman context is perceived to influence homeowners' relationships with and planning for their yards. We found that nonhuman dynamics establish boundaries of yard-related decision-making, and that homeowners described their relations with the nonhuman context of the yard as cooperative, oppositional, and negotiable. We call for social science in urban spaces to be more explicitly informed by a consideration of nonhuman agency, and offer an ethical reflection of who or what is considered to have a right to cohabitate in homeowners' yards.

AB  - In From public art to post-muralism. Policies of urban decorum in Urban Regeneration (I) processes (Remesar 2019) when investigating the link of Public Art to urban Regeneration processes, we concluded that, possibly, the time of Public Art periclines and, for better or for worse, we enter a stage in which the socalled "urban art" reigns, specifically what we called post-muralism, a series of artistic practices that anchor their development in the culture and experiences of graffiti.
   The objective of this second part is to analyse the role that water has in the city, from the perspective of its connection with the new types of urban spaces that will appear since the beginning of the modern era, and its role in relation to the statuary, public art and landscaping. The research deepens the processes of aestheticization of cities that occur before the emergence, as a dominant paradigm, of the paradigm of the modern movement.
   To address this objective, we analyse how the fountains have gone from being mere artefacts to supply water to the city, to elements of urban composition and urban decorum. The article is divided into the following sections
   [1] Water in the square where the ways of supplying water are reviewed;
   [2] Opening spaces for [almost] everyone where we study the emergence of new public spaces and the role that water plays in them;
   [3] Providing water in which the role that fountains play as an interface with users is reviewed;
   [4] Serial fountains: a first step in the democratization of art, reviews the important role of cast iron fountains as diffusers of masterpieces of art hidden in museums;
   [5] Beyond utility. Water in the urban landscape, reviews how the emergence of public spaces such as parks will cause the use of water in a new, more monumental format.
   To this section follows [6] Finally, public space for all [or almost all], which reviews the role of the hygienist model in the creation of new public spaces and the value given to water, recovering water fronts (rivers , sea) and generating new public spaces such as "promenades", "costaneras" or "malecones". This section implicitly argues that the development of these spaces is linked to the urban patriciate as a ruling class.
   Finally [7] Water as an urban spectacle, addresses the new model of water use in public spaces that the interests of the new urban service companies associated with the urban patriciate will ensure that it is massive and spectacular, associated with electricity as a new urban service.

AB  - The interconnections between rural and urban areas have been a major topic of discussion among scholars and policy makers for decades. While both rural and urban areas depend on each other for critical services, rural areas, especially in the developing countries, are often under-represented in policy and essential service provisions. Though widely studied from different perspectives across the globe, the academic landscape of rural-urban nexus is poorly characterized. This study aims to characterize the field, employing bibliometric analysis. Bibliometric is applied because it allows obtaining useful quantitative overview of the evolution of an academic field. The study aims to address six important questions: (1) how has scholarship evolved over the past three decades in this subfield of rural-urban studies? (2) which countries are at the forefront of knowledge production in the subfield? (3) what are the leading productive institutions in the world? (4) where are scholars publishing their works? (5) who are the leading authors in the field? and (6) are there any major areas where scholars have been focusing on over the last three decades? Results show that rural-urban scholarship has grown exponentially over the studied period (1990-2018). The United States has been a major single player in publication records, productive authors, international collaboration and institutional contribution. Further, research in the domain of rural-urban nexus can be categorized into six major clusters; (1) socioeconomic inequalities, (2) livelihood, (3) migration, (4) consumption and poverty, (5) biodiversity and conservation, and (6) connectivity and integration. Given the dearth of contribution in the developing world, the study argued that the subfield of rural-urban scholarship is largely under the hegemony of global north scholars. Potential research areas and study weaknesses are discussed.

AB  - Invasive rats and mice typically arrive in novel regions through unintentional transportation aboard ocean-going vessels, which makes seaports the principal point of entry of these species. In this innovative study, we modeled the spatial distribution and abundance of two invasive rodent species (Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus) in Paranagua, a port city, in southern Brazil whose original vegetation cover was Atlantic Forest. Occupancy and abundance were estimated using live and pitfall traps during nine field campaigns (4,214 trap.nights) at 18 sampling sites distributed along a gradient of habitat between the port and the forest. The abundance and occupancy of both species were affected negatively by the percentage of forest cover within a radius of 1,000 m. The occupancy of M. musculus was also affected by the abundance of buildings within a radius of 100 m and by the distance to the nearest forest edge. The occupancy of R. norvegicus was related positively to the proximity of the access roads that link the port of Paranagua with the rest of the state of Parana. We conclude that, while the port is the point of entry for invasive rodents, neither study species was associated strongly with this area. The study identified the principal elements associated with rat and mouse occupancy, which provides the local authorities with important insights for the implementation of an effective invasive species management program in the municipality of Paranagua. Overall, the Atlantic Forest reveals a remarkable ecosystem service and appears to act as a natural barrier to the dispersal of both rats and mice, being associated with a reduced abundance of these species and low occupancy probabilities.

AB  - Riverine ecosystems around the world have undergone extensive anthropogenic alterations, often to the detriment of native aquatic biodiversity. Migratory fishes are particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and degradation. For example, Chinook Salmon populations in the Sacramento River, CA have been declining for nearly a century. Its Mediterranean climate, position in a landscape dominated by urban and agricultural land use, and the presence of an inland delta that serves as the hub of California's vast water conveyance system, makes this a particularly perilous region for migrating juvenile salmon. This study used acoustic telemetry to investigate survival and routing of juvenile fall and spring-run Chinook Salmon through their riverine and estuarine migratory phases during the historic California drought of 2012-2016. Survival to the ocean in this river system is already lower relative to Chinook Salmon populations in North American. Survival to the Pacific Ocean ranged from 0.0-9.1% over the course of this three-year study. Use of four migratory routes through the Delta was variable, both within and between years. We documented extensive use and relatively high survival in Steamboat Slough (up to 41.5% routing through and up to 39.8% survival), part of the Sacramento River's distributary network. Migration through this pathway precludes juvenile salmon from encountering junctions leading to low survival routes. Results from this modeling effort provide valuable information and highlight opportunities for directing management actions to benefit these ecologically and economically valuable runs of Chinook Salmon.

AB  - Freshwater communities are threatened by the conversion of natural landscapes for urban and agricultural purposes. Changes to land use may disrupt stream nutrient and geomorphological processes and reduce water quality, increase sedimentation, and decrease habitat heterogeneity eventually leading to species loss and decreases in ecosystem productivity. Endemic species are frequently at greater risk of habitat-mediated fragmentation and extirpation due to their constrained distributions.
   The Kanawha darter (Etheostoma kanawhae) is an understudied fish endemic to the New River Drainage in North Carolina and Virginia, USA. To investigate the potential effect(s) of land-use change on Kanawha darters, naive occupancy was modelled using instream habitat characteristics and upstream forest cover.
   Generalized linear models revealed that instream habitat and forest cover are reliable predictors of Kanawha darter site occupancy. Specifically, models demonstrated that occupancy increased in reaches with reduced stream width, velocity, and bedrock substrate but higher concentrations of coarse woody material. Kanawha darter occupancy was also positively associated with the extent of forest cover in upstream catchments.
   Although Kanawha darters are not currently considered imperilled, most populations occurred in isolated reaches separated by large sections of unoccupied habitat. Continuing ex-urban development in riparian zones is likely to be the primary threat to Kanawha darters and other endemic species in this catchment. Resource managers and stakeholders should preserve forest cover in headwaters and occupied tributaries and protect or restore riparian zones along the main-stem South and North Forks of the New River to preserve high-quality habitat and enhance connectivity among isolated Kanawha darter populations.
   As human populations in montane regions continue to grow, there is a need to understand how land-use change affects endemic freshwater species. This study further supports the importance of retaining forest cover as an effective strategy for protecting and restoring populations of endemic fishes in high-gradient streams.

AB  - India is endowed with a variety of coastal wetlands viz., mangroves, seagrasses, saltmarshes, coral reefs, lagoons and tidal flats, and the country is also a signatory to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the Convention of Biological Diversity, besides having a robust framework of laws and policies, governing the wetland conservation. However, the conservation strategies can better be improved in the context of increasing pressures and threats and limited success of restoration/rehabilitation. Land conversion and ecological degradation of coastal wetlands are the stressors, associated with rapid coastal developmental activities and climate change. The coastal wetlands require desired habitat niche and hence, the conversion of coastal wetlands to other land uses (including agricultural and urban lands) may lead to permanent loss, whereas ecologically degraded coastal wetlands may be resilient if supported by effective protection measures. Preventing the habitat conversion and maximizing the adaptive potential (viz., the ability of populations or species to adapt to rapid environmental change with minimal disruption) by preserving the ecological health are the need of the hour to safeguard the existing coastal wetlands and sustain the provisional ecosystem services offered by them rather than short-term increase in area by unproductive restoration/rehabilitation efforts. Since coastal wetlands are flow through ecosystems, preserving the hydrological connectivity, facilitating the connectivity between adjacent ecosystems and protection of natural corridors are potential strategies that are required to enhance the adaptive potential of coastal wetlands. This analysis calls for site-specific, long-term and integrated ecosystem-based protection, management and rehabilitation strategies based on scientific principles and enforcing the effective legislative measures to regularize the coastal developmental activities in India.

AB  - The prevalence of human-generated noise is posing novel challenges to birds, by changing how they communicate or causing them to disperse away from the source of noise. We sought to understand how noise affected space-use and social connectivity in a small passerine bird, the Red-backed Fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus). As the displaced birds would likely be forced to occupy a smaller area that may already have resident individuals, we predicted that noise-affected birds would show increased social connectivity that may include new individuals. To test this, we introduced an experimental point-source of traffic noise to groups of fairywrens in an otherwise quiet habitat and compared the change in social connectivity of birds in groups exposed to noise to the changes in social connectivity in neighbouring groups unaffected by noise. Contrary to our prediction, noise-affected birds had reduced social connectivity during experimental noise treatments, as measured by weighted-degree, which was driven by a reduction of interactions with birds of neighbouring groups outside the noise zone. Additionally, we did not discern a change in space-use in response to our noise treatment. Therefore, we suggest that noise reduces the efficacy of signal transmission and detection in this species, resulting in the reduction of social connectivity between groups of this otherwise highly social songbird.

AB  - This study investigates and identifies five main urban design elements in Pudu of Jalan Loke Yew and an observation on the architecture planning style of which the urban planning of the area falls into based on a Malaysian context. The research conducted by visiting the site, observations, and open-ended interviews to understand the area. Targeted interviewees are observers who frequently use this area. The research findings show that this area has been developed to include all the five main urban design elements, according to Lynch (1960). Several landmarks within this area are also identified. Issues touched on in this paper discuss the lack of free pedestrian movement, diversity in land use and people, no clear demarcation of all educational and religious districts and landmarks and nodes as wayfinding cues. The study concludes that Loke Yew- Pudu has proper urban planning based on the presence of these dominant elements and in the context of Malaysia. It is observed that planning in this area falls into the 1950s-1970s periods.

AB  - The demand for ornamental plants is increasing due to urban greening and rural construction, while the growing environment of plants, especially the soil environment, is deteriorating. Hence, sustainable methods of ornamental plant cultivation need to be developed quickly. The application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to ornamental plants can be one of the eco-friendly ways to achieve the objective. Soil AMF establish mycorrhizal symbiosis with roots of ornamental plants, which can develop a marvelous mycorrhizal mycelium network in the rhizosphere to stimulate nutrient and water acquisition of host plants. Numerous researches have proven that AMF improved the quality of ornamental plants, like fruit yield, height, biomass, seed quality, the size and number of flowers, leaf, and root. In addition, mycorrhizal fungi also improve nutrient uptake and endogenous hormone balance of host plants. Another important function of AMF is to regulate the physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses of host plants to adversity, including drought stress, temperature stress, heavy-metal stress, and insect and disease stress. From the perspective of the ecological garden landscape, AMF richness would maintain plant abundance, nutrient and energy balance, and higher productivity in normal and soil environment stress, thus, establishing a friendly-environmental ecosystem. This review also provides the basis to exploit and improve the commercial application of AMF in ornamental plants in the future.

AB  - Decisions made during natal dispersal highly influence the future fitness of the animal. The selection of future home range affects, for example, food supply and mating success. In order to select between potential sites, dispersing individuals may use different search strategies, and for example, aim to compare quality of different sites by revisiting them. Alternatively, dispersers visit new sites without comparison until a suitable site is located. By using radio telemetry, we studied search strategies during natal dispersal in both urban and rural environments. We examined what kind of sites juvenile red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) choose as their home range from all visited sites and whether they display revisit behavior during natal dispersal. We found that most of the dispersing individuals perform revisits while searching for the settlement site. In the rural study area, there were also individuals (mostly long-distance dispersers) that did not perform revisits and settled in the last visited area. The landscape characteristics did not explain the amount of revisits individuals made, but the amount of revisits declined with site's distance to natal nest and dispersal distance of individuals. The effect of landscape characteristics on settlement decision was small, but surprisingly, juvenile red squirrels in the rural area settled in sites with more built area compared with sites only visited. However, the decision-making of red squirrels during natal dispersal seems to be driven mainly by other factors (potentially food availability and conspecific density) than landscape characteristics. We conclude that revisiting behavior is linked to dispersal strategy of red squirrels and can differ between the sexes and habitats of the species. Significance statement Animals often choose their habitat from among multiple alternative habitats and potential settlement sites, and the decisions made during dispersal highly influence the future fitness of the animal. We examined what kind of areas juvenile red squirrels choose as their home range in both urban and rural environments and whether they display revisit behavior when selecting their home range from many alternatives. We found that search strategies during natal dispersal can vary between individuals and habitats. Surprisingly, juvenile red squirrels in the rural area settled in sites with more built area compared with the sites only visited. However, for red squirrel, decisions made by juveniles during the search of a home range are mainly influenced by other factors than landscape composition.

AB  - This present work analyzes the Occupy Square Movement (2015-2016),as of the perspective of networks as a theoretical framework. Ocupa Pram was formed as a resistance group by residents of a neighborhood of Teresina (capital of the state of Piaui) in the confrontation against the attacks of the local City Hall, which, in order to implement part of the Urban Mobility Plan, intended to suppress a square with wide green area. The research identified how the different movements and organizations reinforced the power of Ocupa Pram in the political scenario. To this end, documents, information from the corporate media and the Movement on social networks were analyzed. Nine interviews were also conducted with militants who formed links in the network of supporters and one with a representative of the government. As a result, it was highlighted the strong presence of "nodes" of a movementist network that guided the socio-environmental issue in the public debate and expanded the Movement's power of interlocution, generating impact and influence on the urban mobility policy, changing it according to residents' interests.

AB  - We assessed the relative importance of human activity and environmental suitability as drivers of compositional dissimilarity of alien birds for 65 of the most populous cities of the Iberian Peninsula. We examined how these drivers relate to Zeta diversity (zeta) for alien Passeriformes and Psittaciformes. We performed the analysis using multiple orders of zeta, which provides insight on the role played by rare and common species in determining levels of dissimilarity. We also ran the analyses using the community of native Passeriformes as a phylogenetically close contrasting control. Our results showed that the proportion of urban area, a variable related to colonization and propagule pressure, had a strong influence on Psittaciformes but not on alien Passeriformes. This latter group showed to be primarily influenced by environmental factors, similarly to what was found for native Passeriformes. On other hand, human connectivity, as measured by distance through roads and railways seemed to play a significant role in shaping the compositional dissimilarity of alien Passeriformes, but not Psittaciformes. Regardless of the group analysed, the relative importance of the explanatory variables was similar for both rare and common species. Our findings highlight differences between the factors driving compositional dissimilarity for distinct groups of birds. While the emerging biogeography of Psittaciformes is mainly a reflection of distinctiveness in urban areas, alien Passeriformes are more strongly affected by the natural environment and thus their biogeography may increasingly resemble the one of their native counterparts.

AB  - Pervasive human impact in heavily transformed landscapes may lead disturbance-adapted species to thrive, resulting in floristic homogenization across forest stands. However, environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation may be antagonistic forces to homogenization, maintaining inherent floristic differentiation across sites.
   We evaluated the extent to which peri-urban Andean forests are undergoing floristic homogenization in both late- and early-successional stands. We considered seedling assemblages as well, as they provide key insights into forests' future. We then quantified the relative importance of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering in determining the observed patterns of floristic similarity across the landscape.
   We used tree, seedling, soil and climatic data from six sites located in the high plain where Bogota lies (Colombia). Within each site, we established six 20 x 20 m plots, three in early-successional stands and three in late-successional stands, for a total of 36 plots.
   To evaluate the extent of floristic homogenization, we defined tree floristic similarity among late-successional stands as a baseline, reflecting our best-guess of the original species composition that would have once occurred previous to intense anthropogenic intervention. Tree floristic turnover across the landscape was alike in late- and in early-secondary stands, a finding that does not support the homogenization scenario. Seedling species composition, in contrast, was more homogeneous among early- than among late-secondary stands, an outcome suggestive of homogenization.
   The relative importance of spatial and environmental drivers shifted between life stages. Distance between plots was the best predictor of tree species dissimilarity (29% of variance explained), whereas seedling compositional variation was more sensitive to changes in environmental conditions (41% of the variance explained). Relative humidity and several variables related to soil fertility showed a significant effect on floristic dissimilarity across the landscape, although significant factors were often different between life stages.
   Synthesis. Despite high anthropogenic transformation, we found little trace of floristic homogenization in these peri-urban landscapes. Inherent floristic differentiation, promoted both by dispersal limitation and environmental heterogeneity, suggests that all patches are important to the conservation in these Andean forests, critical centres of endemism.

AB  - The article is devoted to the study on the spatial distribution features of fungi - xylophytes and saprophytes - using the example of the oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm.) in suburban plantations (Ukrainian Roztochya) and urbogenic conditions of the city of Lviv. The natural-climatic and forest-typological characteristics of the study region were revealed. Detailed attention was focused on the occurrence of this species in various types of plantings within suburban forest parks, parks, urban gardens and street plantings. The distribution of oyster mushroom individuals in the population was calculated according to the conventional Schwerdtfeger method. The urban-ecological conditions of the suburban and urban green plantings of the Lviv city revealed a high level of oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm.) distribution, due to a set of favorable edaphoclimatic conditions of habitats, age and mechanical damage to trees. It was found that the distribution of the individuals in the suburban forests is half of that in the urban areas, which is confirmed by the calculation of variance (dispersion). The dispersion of oyster mushroom individuals in Lviv is 29.3 m(2). With spontaneous arrangement of individuals, the value of the dispersion is approximately equal to the average value of the number of mushrooms in the population, while there is a tendency for accumulation of the studied macromycetes (S2 >= m). In urban plantings, the dispersion of individuals is twice as large as in forests, which indicates the wide possibilities for the oyster mushroom spores dispersal.

AB  - Aims Novel ecosystems are self-maintaining ecosystems that support species assemblages without historical precedent. Despite much interest and controversy around novel ecosystems, it remains poorly understood how they are generated, what their capacity to support biodiversity is and what the implications for society are. Here, we address these issues through a global synthesis of non-native palms, since palms are likely generators of novel ecosystems because they are introduced widely beyond their native range and have the capacity to act as ecosystem engineers. Location Global. Methods We gathered data on non-native palms from peer-reviewed literature/papers, grey literature and online databases. We extracted data on the biogeographic context of palm invasions, plant functional traits and anthropogenic drivers to quantify their effects on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services. Results Of the 2,557 palm species, 3.4% (86 species) were recorded as naturalized and 1.1% (28 species) as invasive, which exceeds the average invasion success across all woody plants. Naturalized palms are present in most tropical and subtropical regions around the world, often in urban areas, reflecting the use of palms in horticulture. Many naturalized palms were taller and more likely to originate from open habitats or dry forest than non-naturalized palms. These features likely represent the naturalized palms' competitive ability, high fecundity and dispersal ability along with ecological matching to human-disturbed environments. Overall, literature on ecological effects of palm invasions was sparse, but we found multiple cases in which palm invasions resulted in strong ecosystem changes or even biome shifts. Main Conclusions We found strong evidence that palm invasions can generate novel ecosystems. Although there are substantial knowledge gaps on the ecological effects of palm invasion, anthropogenic drivers like urbanization and ongoing global warming will continue to expand palm ranges and promote non-native palms as generators of novel ecosystems.

AB  - River confluences result in mixture and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM), influencing the phylogeny of microbial community, furthermore, the integrity and function of river systems. The relationship between the microbial community and DOM is complex, especially in the confluence zone. Previous reports focused on shifts in the different bacterial community in response to exposure to the same terrestrial DOM. However, the transformation of bacterial community induced by convergent DOM remains unknown. This study showed the shifts of DOM components at the junction via excitation -emission matrices parallel factor analysis. Metabolic differences were also determined via phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states. The results demonstrated a direct link between the microbial metabolism and DOM biodegradation during the heterotrophic process. In response to diverse DOM conditions, the taxonomic composition and metabolic function of the microbial community presented significant differences. Different taxa may be involved in metabolizing various DOM components. As indicative bacteria that are closely associated with DOM components, Proteobacteria (Sphingomonas) are significant for microbial utilization and were important during the DOM-degrading process. Compared with other conditions, the abundance of carbon metabolism was higher in convergences where urban rivers joined with estuary or source water. Furthermore, humic-like DOM, converging in the confluence zone, induced a more active lipid metabolism. This study applied techniques that capture the diversity and complexity of bacterial communities and DOM, and provides new insight on the basis of the interaction between bacterial communities and DOM in confluence processes of biogeochemical significance.

AB  - The only self-sustaining population of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) requires a network of conservation lands for wintering along the Texas Gulf Coast (USA), so that this increasing population can reach downlisting under the Endangered Species Act (1000 birds). We identify locations providing the highest quality and most sustainable wintering habitat for these whooping cranes through 2100 by predicting future habitats under three projections of sea level rise (0.6, 1.0 and 2.0 m by 2100), while incorporating two scenarios of future urban development. Our method combines predictions of future habitat quality with current whooping crane density estimates to calculate the potential carrying capacity of whooping cranes for each 10 m pixel within this 17,725 km(2) area. We found whooping cranes used locations with salt marsh at twice the rate of places lacking marsh. Areas > 15 km from development or < 2 km from estuarine water had increased crane use. Predicted area of salt marsh habitat oscillated across time given different rates of sea level rise. One urbanization scenario predicted 3% and the other 1% of the area converting to development by 2100. We estimated the study area can support 4414 (95 % CI: 4096-4789) whooping cranes currently, 4795 (95 % CI: 4402-5269) with 0.6 m sea level rise, 3559 (95 % CI: 3352-3791) with 1 m sea level rise, and 2480 (95 % CI: 2375-2592) with 2 m sea level rise by 2100, under the more aggressive urban development scenario. By anticipating climate-induced habitat loss with species population expansion we provide the requisite spatial information for conservation planners to build a sustainable conservation estate for downlisting whooping cranes. By coupling wildlife biology with conservation planning and on-the-ground implementation, our work exemplifies a proactive approach to recover endangered species.

AB  - The peri-urban area has undergone tremendous changes in various aspects. Tourism-driven development in this area, echoing the longing of urban residents for recreational and leisure space, provides an alternative to conventional urbanization approaches. Particularly, in view of heightened conflicts and fierce competitions that often occur in the area, developing the knowledge of the co-visitation network, or how different attractions and villages interact with each other from the visitors' perspective, is key to more informed planning strategies. With the rapid development of online social media platforms and mobile devices, researchers can collect massive realtime data on the basis of online user-generated content. While there are already many attempts on its application on tourism design, few studies to date have explored how peri-urban attractions and villages are organized in same trips. In this paper, we design a new methodology on the basis of social media analytics to construct and map a co-visitation network, and apply NetMiner-enabled social network analysis to explain its structure and nodal functions. The usefulness of this methodology is demonstrated through a detailed case study in Shenzhen, China. Research findings reveal types of existing co-visitation patterns, which help planners predict future trends, design new experiences and take specific measures in line with visitor demands.

AB  - The rapid development of urbanization has increased traffic pressure and made the identification of urban functional regions a popular research topic. Some studies have used point of interest (POI) data and smart card data (SCD) to conduct subway station classifications; however, the unity of both the model and the dataset limits the prediction results. This paper not only uses SCD and POI data, but also adds Online to Offline (OTO) e-commerce platform data, an application that provides customers with information about different businesses, like the location, the score, the comments, and so on. In this paper, these data are combined to and used to analyze each subway station, considering the diversity of data, and obtain a passenger flow feature map of different stations, the number of different types of POIs within 800 m, and the situation of surrounding OTO stores. This paper proposes a two-stage framework, to identify the functional region of subway stations. In the passenger flow stage, the SCD feature is extracted and converted to a feature map, and a ResNet model is used to get the output of stage 1. In the built environment stage, the POI and OTO features are extracted, and a deep neural network with stacked autoencoders (SAE-DNN) model is used to get the output of stage 2. Finally, the outputs of the two stages are connected and a SoftMax function is used to make the final identification of functional region. We performed experimental testing, and our experimental results show that the framework exhibits good performance and has a certain reference value in the planning of subway stations and their surroundings, contributing to the construction of smart cities.

AB  - Increasing nitrogen (N) loads present a threat to estuaries, which are among the most heavily populated and perturbed parts of the world. N removal is largely mediated by the sediment microbial process of denitrification, in direct competition to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which recycles nitrate to ammonium. Molecular proxies for N pathways are increasingly measured and analyzed, a major question in microbial ecology, however, is whether these proxies can add predictive power around the fate of N. We analyzed the diversity and community composition of sedimentnirSandnrfAgenes in 11 temperate estuaries, covering four types of land use in Australia, and analyzed how these might be used to predict N removal. Our data suggest that sediment microbiomes play a central role in controlling the magnitude of the individual N removal rates in the 11 estuaries. Inclusion, however, of relative gene abundances of16S,nirS,nrfA, including their ratios did not improve physicochemical measurement-based regression models to predict rates of denitrification or DNRA. Co-occurrence network analyses ofnirSshowed a greater modularity and a lower number of keystone OTUs in pristine sites compared to urban estuaries, suggesting a higher degree of niche partitioning in pristine estuaries. The distinctive differences between the urban and pristine network structures suggest that thenirSgene could be a likely gene candidate to understand the mechanisms by which these denitrifying communities form and respond to anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents release not only chemical constituents in watersheds, but also contain microorganisms. Thus, an understanding of what microorganisms are released and how they change microbial communities within natural streams is needed. To characterize the community shifts in streams receiving WWTP effluent, we sampled water-column microorganisms from upstream, downstream, and the effluent of WWTPs located on 23 headwater streams in which no other effluent was released upstream. We characterized the bacterial community by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We hypothesized that the down-stream community profile would be a hydraulic mixture between the two sources (i.e., upstream and effluent). In ordination analyses, the downstream bacterial community profile was a mixture between the upstream and effluent. For 14 of the sites, the main contribution (>50%) to the downstream community originated from bacteria in the WWTP effluent and significant shifts in relative abundance of specific sequence variants were detected. These shifts in sequence variants may serve as general bioindicators of wastewater-effluent influenced streams, with a human-gut related Ruminococcus genus displaying the highest shift (30-fold higher abundances downstream). However, not all taxa composition changes were predicted based on hydraulic mixing alone. Specifically, the decrease of Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast reads was not adequately described by hydraulic mixing. The potential alteration of stream microbial communities via a high inflow of human-gut related bacteria and a decrease in autotrophic functional groups resulting from WWTP effluent creates the potential for general shifts in stream ecosystem function.

AB  - Personality traits shape individual perceptions of risks and rewards, and so, should affect how animals value and use their environment. Evidence is emerging that personality affects foraging, space use, and exploitation of novel environments such as urban habitat. But the influence of personality is also hypothesized to be sex-dependent when primary motivation for space use differs between sexes, as often occurs in polygynous species. We tested the influence of personality traits, interacting with sex, on space use by the polygynous common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, in an urban-woodland boundary in Sydney, Australia. We quantified personality traits, including exploration, using behavioral assays in an artificial arena. We also GPS-tracked free-ranging individuals, and measured range size, core area: home range, and proportional urban range. We found that personality traits affected space use either as a main effect or, as predicted, an interaction with sex. More exploratory animals, regardless of sex, had higher core area: home range ratios and proportionally larger ranges within urban habitat. However, less exploratory females yet more exploratory males had larger ranges. Our findings provide new insight into movement ecology by demonstrating, for the first time, the sex-dependent influence of personality. The demonstrated influence of personality on urban use by possums also suggests a personality filter for wildlife, as populations transition into urban areas. Finally, as individuals at the interface between urban and natural habitat are also a conduit between the two, a corollary of our findings is that there may be personality-mediated spread of disease across this boundary.
   Lay Summary: Animal personality traits, such as exploration, quantify consistent behavioral differences among individuals. These traits can influence space use and urban exploitation by individuals, but effects may also differ between the sexes. We found that more exploratory possums on the urban fringe favored urban over woodland habitat. In addition, less exploratory females but more exploratory males had larger ranges; a pattern likely driven by different primary motivators such as food (females) or access to mates (males).

AB  - The threats to small urban streams lead to a decrease in their water quality and dysregulate their ecological balance, thereby affecting the biodiversity and causing degradation of indicators that determine the ecological potential. The aim of our study was to determine the impact of abiotic conditions induced by intensive human activity on the community structures of invertebrates (zooplankton and macroinvertebrates) in the small urban stream Bukowka in the Szczecin agglomeration (NW Poland). This stream exhibits the same characteristics as a large river, in which the mass of live organic matter increases with their length. The composition of invertebrates (zooplankton and macroinvertebrates) was strongly influenced by the changes caused by humans in the stream bed. The construction of small reservoirs and bed regulation in this small urban streams had a similar effect on the quality of the water and ecological potential as in large rivers, but at a lower scale.

AB  - The concept of complete streets arises from the need to transform the current urban planning model of cities, where individual motorized transportation is considered the protagonist of the public space. Nowadays, many concepts are launched that raise the question of making cities for people, that bring benefits to the urban environment and the well-being of the population, as pedestrians become the priority in planning, followed by the incentive to use sustainable transport. This paper consists of the elaboration of research about the physical-spatial aspects of downtown Joao Pessoa/Paraiba, aiming to obtain information about the local demands, to apply the objectives of the Complete Streets and to investigate their pertinence to the area. Spatial syntax was used to define the streets to be worked and the counting, mapping, photographing and keeping diary methods, which were compatible in the scope of the work and assisted in the more accurate survey of the flows and behaviors of the population of the neighborhood, enabling the preparation of the proposal. With the results, it was possible to perceive that there are a series of streets in downtown that need great interventions in favor of pedestrians and that the neighborhood needs actions that encourage the occupation of the empty/underused lots with mixed uses and active facades, to guarantee the movement of the place throughout the day.

AB  - A large number of shallow-buried tunnels have currently been built in cities, and specific strata, such as thick upper-soft and lower-hard ground layers, are often encountered. For shallow-buried large-span metro tunnels in urban composite strata, it is particularly important to study the effects of rock mass structures on engineering applications; random joint network simulation technology is a suitable method to study this problem. Considering the shallow-buried large-span metro tunnel in Dalian, which is located in a composite stratum, as the engineering background, first, a set of visualizations is developed with a joint network simulation program. The program can also generate several sets of joints and multistratum random joint networks and then combine program-generated data files and UDEC discrete element software-generated random network models. Combined with orthogonal testing, the failure modes of shallow-buried large-span metro tunnels are discussed, and the influences of rock mass structural parameters on tunnel failures are analyzed. The results indicate that the failure modes of all models are shear or tension failure of the overburden strata along weak planes of random joints, which eventually leads to the occurrence of staggered traction slip collapses and clear slip surfaces. This study provides a certain degree of guidance for the deformation and failure of shallow-buried large-span metro tunnels and for the determination of the surrounding rock pressure in urban composite strata.

AB  - Plants are continuously exposed to human air pollution, absorbing pollutants in their tissues. Trees can store pollutants in wood, in the annual growth rings, retaining traces of pollutants in the environment. Information on past pollution events are archived by trees, which dendrochemistry, a dendrochronological science combined with chemistry, is able to access. Many authors have suggested that trees could complement the conventional environmental monitoring: a forest archive of pollution events. However, the implications of trees occurrence in polluted areas on planning and management have not yet been discussed. In this article, we investigate whether forest archives exist and whether they should be integrated into the network of existing monitoring stations. We use a case study, the Veneto region of Italy, one of the most polluted areas in Europe, to examine the occurrence of trees around 28 industrial plants retrieved from a European pollution register. We propose planning actions to develop the latent potential of these forest archives for environmental monitoring, which society may benefit. We follow three steps: (a) assessing the cover and composition of tree canopies around the industrial plants, (b) inventorying the existing artificial air monitoring stations in order to discover whether pollutants around the industrial plants are already monitored, (c) assessing land use patterns in order to identify which are the receptors of air pollution and enhance the forest archive in the future. These spatial analyses are conducted in a 1-km radius buffer with the industrial plant as the centre. Results show that forest archives are available, with cover and composition suitable for dendrochemistry studies. Artificial monitoring stations are too far from industrial plants or have been installed recently, unable to provide historical data. Trees are an alternative source of pollution data. Receptors of air pollution include a diversity of urban, rural and agricultural lands, where forest archives can be managed and conserved through a variety of actions. Environmental protection agencies should value these trees, preserving them and accessing the records held in this forest archive. Similar inventories must be promoted in other industrialised regions of the world even at larger scales. Studies like this one should also be incorporated into landscape or urban planning processes.

AB  - Weeds can impact many ecosystems, including natural, urban and agricultural environments. This paper discusses core weed biosecurity program concepts and considerations for urban and peri-urban areas from a remote sensing perspective and reviews the contribution of remote sensing to weed detection and management in these environments. Urban and peri-urban landscapes are typically heterogenous ecosystems with a variety of vectors for invasive weed species introduction and dispersal. This diversity requires agile systems to support landscape-scale detection and monitoring, while accommodating more site-specific management and eradication goals. The integration of remote sensing technologies within biosecurity programs presents an opportunity to improve weed detection rates, the timeliness of surveillance, distribution and monitoring data availability, and the cost-effectiveness of surveillance and eradication efforts. A framework (the Weed Aerial Surveillance Program) is presented to support a structured approach to integrating multiple remote sensing technologies into urban and peri-urban weed biosecurity and invasive species management efforts. It is designed to support the translation of remote sensing science into operational management outcomes and promote more effective use of remote sensing technologies within biosecurity programs.

AB  - Friendship formation is of central importance to online social network sites and to society, but can suffer from significant and unequal frictions. In this study, we demonstrate that social networks and policy makers may use an IT-facilitated intervention - displaying things in common (TIC) between users (mutual hometown, interest, education, work, city) - to encourage friendship formation, especially among people who are different from each other. Displaying TIC may update an individual's belief about the shared similarity with another and reduce information friction that may be hard to overcome in offline communication. In collaboration with an online social network, we design and implement a randomized field experiment, which randomly varies the prominence of different types of things in common information when a user (viewer) is browsing a non-friend's profile. The dyad-level exogenous variation, orthogonal to any (un)observed structural factors in viewer-profile's network, allows us to cleanly isolate the role of individuals' preference for TIC in driving network formation and homophily. We find that displaying TIC to viewers may significantly increase their probability of sending a friend request and forming a friendship, and is especially effective for pairs of people who have little in common. Such findings suggest that information intervention is a very effective and zero-cost approach to encourage the formation of weak ties, and also provide the first experimental evidence on the crucial role of individuals' preference (versus structural embeddedness) in network formation. We further demonstrate that displaying TIC could improve friendship formation for a wide range of viewers with different demographics and friendship status, and is more effective when the TIC information is more surprising to the viewer. Our study offers actionable insights to social networks and policy makers on the design of information intervention to encourage friendship formation and improve the diversity of the friendship, at both an aggregate and an individual level.

AB  - The article examines the housing occupation movements in Milan in 1969-1975, relating them to the restricted supply of cheap housing-a situation that created difficulties for newly arrived immigrant. Housing occupation activists were influenced by the experience of squatting in other European cities, a phenomenon that particularly fascinated the educated young, who participated in the movement, supported by organizations of the radical left. The movement's political project was to take the class struggle outside the factories, to attack "urban income growth" as a tool of capitalist domination. Compared with other Italian experiences, there was less involvement from the underclass, and the aim of obtaining a house was secondary to the project of maintaining political conflict at a high level. The movement waned in the late 1970s, due to the fact that the revolutionary groups' drive for political mobilization no longer coincided with the social housing needs of young people.

AB  - Genetic diversity is expected to erode in disturbed habitats through strong selection, local extinctions, and recolonization associated with genetic bottlenecks and restricted gene flow. Despite this general prediction and over three decades of population genetics studies, our understanding of the long-term effect of environmental disturbance on local and regional genetic diversity remains limited. We conducted a population genetic survey of the microcrustacean Daphnia across a landscape subject to anthropogenic stressors from a century of industrial mining. At the local scale we found moderate genetic diversity (i.e., low clonal diversity), characteristic of habitat-specific selective sweeps and local extinctions, but high diversity and strong genetic structure at the regional scale despite the shared watershed of many lakes and exceptional dispersal ability of daphniids. Many habitats experienced changes in species assemblages, with the obligate asexual Daphnia pulex lineages-known only to inhabit ponds-dominating disrupted urban lakes. This habitat transition (pond to lake) was likely facilitated by the disruption of ecological barriers maintaining the genomic separation of these young species. Thus, disrupted habitats can exhibit complex and unexpected genetic patterns of local extinctions and recolonizations, followed by habitat transitions, hybridization and potential speciation events that arc difficult to predict and should not be underestimated.

AB  - As part of an Urban Buzz scheme, strips of teasel (Dipsacus fullonum) and greater knapweed (Centaurea scabiosa) have been established along a sea wall flood defense in the UK to provide a corridor of flower-rich habitat for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The cutting of tall grassland and planting of dicotyledons also created a suitable short sward environment (c. 30 cm height) for Orthoptera nymphs in the establishment year (2018). I lowever, by 2019, the grassland in the pollinator strips was taller (c. 75 cm) and suboptimal for grasshoppers; in contrast to Roesel's bushcricket (Roeseliana roeselii), which inhabited the taller vegetation in greater abundance. The progression to established grassland with flowering D. fut.lonztm saw the pollinator strips attract significantly higher numbers of bees and butterflies than the floristically poor control strips. This small-scale study illustrates that pollinator strips can have multi-functional benefits for ecosystems beyond pollination, with Orthoptera of tall grassland (R. roeselii) likely to persist alongside planted wildflowers.

AB  - Worldwide, the addition of treated wastewater (i.e. effluent) to streams is becoming more common as urban populations grow and developing countries increase their use of wastewater treatment plants. Release of treated effluent can impair water quality and ecological communities, but also could help restore flow and maintain aquatic habitat in water-stressed regions. To assess this range of potential outcomes, we conducted a global review of studies from effluent-fed streams to examine the impacts of effluent on water quality and aquatic and riparian biota.
   We identified 147 quantitative studies of effluent-fed streams, most of which were from the U.S.A. and Europe. Over 85% of the studies identified water quality as a primary study focus, including basic physical and chemical parameters, as well as trace organic contaminants. Nearly 60% of the studies had at least some focus on aquatic or riparian biota, primarily fish, aquatic invertebrates, and basal resources (e.g. algae).
   Effluent inputs generally impaired water quality near discharge points, mainly through increased water temperature, nutrients, and concentrations of trace organic contaminants, but also via decreased dissolved oxygen levels. The majority of ecological studies found that basal resources, aquatic invertebrates, and fish were negatively affected in a variety of ways (e.g. biodiversity losses, replacement of sensitive with tolerant species). However, several studies showed the importance of effluent in providing environmental flows to streams that had been dewatered by anthropogenic water withdrawals, especially in semi-arid and arid regions.
   Knowledge gaps identified include the abiotic impacts of effluent, such as changes in channel morphology and hydrology (e.g. how nutrient-rich and warmer effluent affects infiltration rates or interactions with groundwater), the effects of effluent on plants and vertebrates (e.g. amphibians, birds), and the impact of effluent-induced perennialisation on naturally intermittent or ephemeral streams.
   Although effluent-fed streams often exhibit signs of ecological impairment, there is great potential for these systems to serve as refuges of aquatic biodiversity and corridors of ecological connectivity when wastewater treatment standards are high, especially in semi-arid and arid regions where natural streams have been dewatered.

AB  - Questions As urban areas expand around the world, understanding how to restore and maintain forests within the urban environment becomes increasingly important. Given that a comprehensive understanding of regeneration dynamics is critical to designating appropriate management interventions we ask the following: how does regeneration, vis-a-vis the buried seed bank, vary in heterogenous urban forests? And, can forest patch size be used to predict regeneration and consequent management interventions?
   Location Vacant lots and public parks throughout New Haven, CT, USA.
   Methods We sampled buried seed banks in 131 plots distributed across three forest patch sizes ranging from large intact parks (95-126 ha), to small parks (1-19 ha), and vacant lots (0.05-0.65 ha). We collected soil samples from the surface mineral soil and stratified them over sand in a greenhouse over a period of five months to record germination.
   Results By examining seed bank floristics in a range of forest patch sizes we found that species composition, nativity, and dominance of specific functional groups shifted with patch size representing a spectrum of urbanization within just one city. Seed bank floristics in large parks more closely resembled results from seed bank studies in rural forests with over 85% native germinants on average. In contrast, vacant lots were dominated by non-native germinants and more ruderal species indicative of earlier successional stages. Seed banks in small parks were variable and in some cases were more similar to large parks or vacant lots.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that large parks in urban areas may be largely self-sustaining whereas smaller parks may require more intensive management for site rehabilitation, especially in early states of succession. Furthermore, our results confirm the highly heterogenous nature of urban forest patches and call for more systematic sampling of urban areas to capture this variation and improve management prescriptions and outcomes.

AB  - Water's physical and chemical characteristics are important constraints in aquatic ecosystems, acting on the development, survival, and adaptation of different organisms. Immature forms of mosquitoes develop in widely diverse aquatic environments and are mainly found in permanent or temporary freshwater bodies with little or no movement. The current study aimed to investigate whether variations in larval habitats' pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and water temperature influence the composition of Culicidae assemblages and the presence and abundance of Aedes albopictus and Ae. aegypti. From August 2012 to July 2013, captures of immature forms and measurement of water's physical and chemical profiles were performed monthly in natural and artificial breeding sites in four urban parks in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Changes in species composition related to the parameters' variation were assessed by multivariate analysis. Regression trees were performed to evaluate the effect of breeding sites' physical and chemical variations on the presence and abundance of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti. The observations suggest ranges of conditions for the measured variables in which most species tend to be found more frequently, and pH and salinity are the variables most closely associated with variations in mosquito composition. Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were present in both natural and artificial breeding sites and were observed under significantly varying conditions of pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature. For Ae. albopictus, larval habitat type and pH were the best predictors of incidence and abundance. For Ae. aegypti, pH and salinity were the best predictors of abundance, while dissolved oxygen and larval habitat type were better predictors of presence. This information broadens our understanding of the ecology and interaction of the investigated species with abiotic factors in the aquatic environments, providing useful data for studies that seek to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of selection and colonization of breeding sites by these mosquitoes. This study also reinforces previous observations indicating that Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti can colonize diverse types of larval habitats with widely varying physical and chemical conditions.

AB  - Conflicts, upon the author's four experiences, exist between the methods, technologies, and world views of ecological and industrial civilizations. The movement against the channelization of the Shuangyuan Stream in Dali City, Yunnan Province failed to rescue the loss of natural assets that have accumulated for tens of thousands of years. Due to the indifference to the protest from environmentalists and scholars, Beijing's river channelization projects resulted in severe damages to the city's ecological resilience. A same conflict occurred over the anti-seepage project of Yuanmingyuan Park in Beijing, which marked a beginning of China's "nature-based solutions." Moreover, the heavy storm attacked Beijing on July 21, 2012, urged municipal managers to reflect on urban drainage system design, and promoted the spread of "Green Sponge," a nature-based solution, to the problem of urban waterlogging nationwide. Only by taking the tough journey to utilize nature-based solutions can China tackle ecological and environmental problems caused by urbanization and industrialization, and contribute to the world. Natural forces, instead of the engineering approaches praised by industrial civilization, may help improve urban resilience in their ingenuity addressing environmental crises and for a greater social advance.

AB  - Fire management agencies undertake a range of fire management strategies in an attempt to reduce the risk posed by future wildfires. This can include fuel treatments (prescribed burning and mechanical removal), suppression and community engagement. However, no agency has an unlimited budget and numerically optimal solutions can rarely be implemented or may not even exist. Agencies are trying to quantify the extent to which their management actions reduce risk across multiple values in the most cost-effective manner. In this paper, we examine the cost-effectiveness of a range of prescribed burning strategies across multiple landscapes in south-eastern Australia. Landscapes considered include vegetated areas surrounding the cities of Hobart, Melbourne, Adelaide, Canberra, and Sydney. Using a simulation approach, we examine the potential range of fires that could occur in a region with varying levels of edge and landscape prescribed burning treatment regimes. Damages to assets are measured for houses, lives, transmission lines, carbon and ecological assets. Costs of treatments are estimated from published models and all data are analyzed using multi-criteria decision analysis. Cost-effectiveness of prescribed burning varies widely between regions. Variations primarily relate to the spatial configuration of assets and natural vegetation. Regions with continuous urban interface adjacent to continuous vegetation had the most cost-effective fuel treatment strategies. In contrast, those regions with fragmented vegetation and discontinuous interfaces demonstrated the lowest cost-effectiveness of treatments. Quantifying the extent to which fuel treatments can reduce the risk to assets is vital for determining the location and extent of treatments across a landscape.

AB  - The Amazon basin contains few obvious geographic barriers, yet it is the most biodiverse region on Earth. One hypothesis to explain its diversity is that the very large rivers promote allopatric divergence. Consistent with this, maps of heliconiine butterflies made from museum specimens show high subspecies richness close to the Amazon river, suggesting that it may produce or maintain intra-specific phenotypic variability. However, museum data are subject to strong spatial biases (the 'Wallacean shortfall' of distribution data), raising the possibility that this pattern is a sampling artefact. To test this, we systematically collected along a similar to 900 km north-south transect running through central Amazonia. We found a significant association between phenotypic diversity and major rivers, with distance from the Amazon river explaining 61% of the variance in the mean polymorphism of 25 species. This association is partly because many species exhibit different phenotypes on either side of the river. Nonetheless, we also find sites with high polymorphism close to the river, indicating continual cross-river dispersal. Our results strongly suggest the presence of a suture zone (a region where multiple species have hybrid zones) near the city of Manaus. However, the effect of the river on spatial patterns of intra-specific phenotypic diversity depends on a species' mimetic phenotype. Rather than being absolute barriers, our results support the idea that rivers can act as partial barriers that trap moving hybrid zones, resulting in a suture zone. As such, the wide Amazonian rivers help generate and maintain colour pattern diversity, but to date there is no evidence that they lead to speciation in our study group.

AB  - This study examines urban agriculture (UA) in Sacramento, California (USA), the nation's self-branded "Farm-to-Fork Capital," in order to highlight UA's distinct yet entangled roots. The study is based on 24 interviews with a diverse array of UA leaders, conducted as part of a five-year transdisciplinary study of UA in Sacramento. In it, we unearth three primary "taproots" of UA projects, each with its own historical legacies, normative visions, and racial dynamics. In particular, we examine UA projects with "justice taproots," "health taproots," and "market taproots." We use this analysis to understand how different kinds of UA projects are embedded in racial capitalism in ways that transform relationships between people, the city, and food systems. Unearthing these entangled roots helps illuminate UA's underlying politics, showing how these roots grow in both competitive and symbiotic ways within the soil matrix of racial capitalism. We argue that these roots interact differently with racial capitalism, creating disparities in their growth trajectories. In particular, UA projects associated with the justice taproot are historically underrepresented and undervalued. However, we argue that there are some prospects for building alliances between the UA movement's three roots, and that these are both promising and problematic.

AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms are a global ecological problem that directly threatens human health and crop safety. Cyanobacteria have toxic effects on aquatic microorganisms, which could drive the selection for resistance genes. The effect of cyanobacterial blooms on the dispersal and abundance of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) of concern to human health remains poorly known. We herein investigated the effect of cyanobacterial blooms on ARG composition in Lake Taihu, China. The numbers and relative abundances of total ARGs increased obviously during a Planktothrix bloom. More pathogenic microorganisms were present during this bloom than during a Planktothrix bloom or during the non-bloom period. Microcosmic experiments using additional aquatic ecosystems (an urban river and Lake West) found that a coculture of Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii increased the richness of the bacterial community, because its phycosphere provided a richer microniche for bacterial colonization and growth. Antibiotic-resistance bacteria were naturally in a rich position, successfully increasing the momentum for the emergence and spread of ARGs. These results demonstrate that cyanobacterial blooms are a crucial driver of ARG diffusion and enrichment in freshwater, thus providing a reference for the ecology and evolution of ARGs and ARBs and for better assessing and managing water quality. Qi Zhang, Zhenyan Zhang et al. show that the numbers and relative abundance of antibiotics-resistance genes increase during a cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu of China. This correlation provides insights to the ecologists and the policy makers who manage the quality of fresh water.

AB  - The Spanish right to housing movement has become a reference for housing struggles across the globe. Yet the movement's marked diversity, particularly in a moment of rising xenophobia in Europe, has largely escaped notice. In this article, I reveal how Andean activists impelled the housing movement in Madrid, articulating lines of protest and methods of action that would then prove integral to the movement's arsenal of resistance. In untangling the migrant history of the housing movement, I argue differential experiences with inequality and discrimination on the one hand, and alternative modes of habitation, cooperation, and social justice on the other mean migrants can serve as key catalysts in social mobilizations. In considering diverse social movements, meanwhile, I probe not only previous engagement in activist struggles, but also migrant lifeworlds that influenced later dissent. Again accounts that privilege extant transnational activist networks and/or local struggles over collective consumption, this methodological orientation demonstrates how to trace the role of modest transnational flows and subaltern geographies within contemporary social movement struggles.

AB  - Increasingly available high-frequency data during storm events, when hydrological dynamics most likely activate nitrate storage-flux exchanges, reveal insights into catchment nitrate dynamics. In this study, we explored impacts of seasonality and landscape gradients on nitrate concentration-discharge (C-Q) hysteresis patterns in the Selke catchment, central Germany, which has heterogeneous combinations of meteorological, hydrogeological and land use conditions. Three nested gauging stations established along the main Selke River captured flow and nitrate export dynamics from the uppermost subcatchment (mixed forest and arable land), middle subcatchment (pure steep forest) and lowermost subcatchment (arable and urban land). We collected continuous high-frequency (15-min) discharge and nitrate concentration data from 2012 to 2017 and analyzed the 223 events detected at all three stations. A dominant hysteresis pattern in the uppermost and middle subcatchments was counter-clockwise and combined with an accretion effect, indicating many proximal and mobilized distal nitrate sources. However, 66% of all events at the catchment outlet experienced a dilution effect, possibly due to mechanisms that vary seasonally. During wetting/wet periods (October-March), it was combined mainly with a counter-clockwise pattern due to the dominance of event runoff volume from the uppermost and middle subcatchments. During drying/dry periods (April-September), however, it was combined mainly with a clockwise pattern due to occasional quick surface flows from lowland near-stream urban areas. In addition, the clockwise hysteresis occurred mainly from May-October during mostly drying/dry periods at all three sites, indicating little distal nitrate transport in response to the low terrestrial hydrological connectivity, especially in the lowermost dry and flat sub-catchment. This comprehensive analysis (i.e., clockwise vs. counter-clockwise, accretion vs. dilution) enables in-depth analysis of nitrate export mechanisms during certain periods under different landscape conditions. Specific combination of C-Q relationships could identify target locations for agricultural management actions that decrease nitrate output. Therefore, we strongly encourage long-term multisite and high-frequency monitoring strategies in heterogeneous nested catchment(s), which can help understand process mechanisms, generate data for physical-based water-quality modeling and provide guidance for water and agricultural management.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected vector-borne disease associated with socioeconomic and environmental issues. In Brazil, epidemics of VL have occurred in major cities since 1980. Applied models for medical and epidemiological research have been used to assess the distribution and characteristics of disease endpoints and identify and characterize potential risk factors. This study described the demographic features of VL and modeled the spatio-temporal distribution of human VL cases and their relationship with underlying predicitve factors using generalized additive models. We conducted an ecological study covering an 18-year period from the first report of an autochthonous case of VL in Campo Grande, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in 2001 to 2018. The urban area of the city has 74 neighborhoods, and they were the units of analysis of our work. Socioeconomic and demographic data available from Brazilian public databases were considered as covariables. A total of 1,855 VL cases were reported during the study period, with an annual mean incidence rate of 13.23 cases per 100,000 population and a cumulative crude incidence of 235.77 per 100,000 population. The results showed the rapid transition from epidemic to endemic and the centrifugal dispersal pattern of the disease. Moreover, the model highlighted that the urban quality of life index, which is calculated based on income, education, housing conditions, and environmental sanitation data, plays a role in VL occurrence. Our findings highlighted the potential for improving spatio-temporal segmentation of control measures and the cost-effectiveness of integrated disease management programs as soon as VL is difficult to control and prevent and has rapid geographical dispersion and increased incidence rates.

AB  - In India, the majority of urban roads are undivided where the behavior of flows in a particular direction is predominantly influenced by the opposing traffic. Due to lack of lane segregation, the vehicles in ongoing direction occupy the opposing lane, which increases the lateral interactions between vehicles. These lateral interactions are influenced by various parameters such as vehicle types, driver behavior and vehicular speeds. Study of such complex interactions plays an important role in evaluating various management measures using microscopic simulation models. The lateral characteristics of vehicles, such as placement, separation and movement, act as necessary input for simulation models. The present study aims to analyze and model the lateral characteristics of vehicles on two-lane urban undivided roads. To achieve this, traffic flow data were collected from an urban undivided mid-block section in Bangalore City, India, using video graphic technique. Multiple linear regression model was developed for predicting the lateral placement of subject vehicle and it was found that lateral placement of subject vehicle is influenced by types and speeds of subject and opposing vehicles. Lateral separation for different types of ongoing (subject) and opposing pairs was also analyzed. The results show that both the ongoing and opposing vehicles have less freedom to move laterally when their sizes increase and hence, lateral separation decreases. The choice of path of vehicles' lateral shifts (left, current and right) on urban undivided roads was modeled using multinomial logistic regression. Lateral shift of a vehicle is influenced by speeds of subject vehicle and leader vehicle in current path, speed of leader vehicle in target path, and lateral gap between leader vehicles in current path and target path.

AB  - It is usually considered that Protected Areas (PAs) are an efficient tool for policies to conserve biodiversity. However, there is evidence that some pressures and threats arise from processes taking place both inside them and in their surroundings territories-habitat loss, changes in land use, fragmentation of natural ecosystems. In this paper, we aim to test the hypothesis that municipalities located in the Socioeconomic Influence Zones (SIZs) of the fifteen National Parks (NPs) in Spain are more sustainable than those in their surroundings or, conversely, that the municipalities of their surroundings are more unsustainable. To measure their sustainability, we propose a system for assessment using fifteen indicators selected by experts. The methodology is based on the normalization of the data of each indicator, comparing them with a desirable target value defined in terms of sector policies and strategies. We then aggregate the indicators for each group in three indices that cover the classic dimensions of sustainability-environmental, economic and social. On a network scale, the results show that municipalities inside the SIZs are 1.594 points more sustainable environmentally, 0.108 economically and 0.068 socially than those of their surroundings. A system for assessment of the sustainability of municipalities (SASMU) may be a useful tool for NP managers, and for local and regional administrations, when setting priorities for policies, projects and compensation for regulatory restrictions related to NPs.

AB  - In recent centuries, the mosquito Aedes aegypti has spread into most urban areas throughout the tropics. This species is considered the main vector of the chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses and causes major public health issues. The aim of this study is to investigate the relative influence of biotic and abiotic parameters on immature populations of Ae. aegypti. During a one-year-long field experiment, we monitored 108 macroinvertebrate aquatic communities inhabiting four types of water containers across three different urbanized sites in a Neotropical city. A multimodel inference approach revealed that, in addition to abiotic parameters, biotic interactions with aquatic organisms had an important influence on the abundance of Ae. aegypti and that the urbanized site considered influences the outcomes of the interactions. Controphic species other than mosquitoes aided Ae. aegypti development, suggesting a mechanism of facilitation through a chain of processes. However, the abundance of Ae. aegypti was lowered by competition with native mosquito species in the slightly urbanized area and by predation in more urbanized areas. Competitive displacement and reduction, as well as predation by native aquatic organisms, can be considered a form of ecosystem service. The conservation and/or augmentation of natural enemies should improve the short- and long-term success of incompatible and/or sterile insect techniques, thus opening up perspectives for the future of mosquito management.

AB  - Various multi-scale hierarchical river health approaches and assessments have been developed and implemented with a variety of scientific and management purposes. Although many existing biological and geomorphological assessments offer insights into stream function, none were developed for or exclusively capture the functions of streams in the urban environment. Quantitative aspects of existing screening tools are limited in urban streams due to the unique combination of hydrogeomorphic and anthropogenic factors in the urban environment. Analyzing the physical, biological, and social drivers within the concept of the urban stream syndrome coupled with recent advances in stream assessments connects the health of urban streams with past, present, and future impacts. The urban stream assessment procedure (USAP) provides an innovative framework and conceptual model to comprehensively assess stream functions in the urban environment and quantify their health at multiple scales. The specific aim is to identify the highest function and lowest maintenance "version" of an urban stream that is achievable given the context-varying hydrologic regimes, geomorphic conditions, ecological diversity, social contexts, and community goals. It is designed to classify urban stream reaches and corridors according to their hydrological, geomorphological, vegetation characteristics and to support identification of reaches that might be candidates for rehabilitation. Employing a multi-scale framework yields greater success in assessing stream function, diagnosing watershed-wide drivers, and implementing strategies to enhance streams in the urban environment. Furthermore, the USAP framework can assist water resources managers in assessing and managing health specific to urban streams through applicable spatial and relevant parameters and metrics.

AB  - In 2019, what began in Hong Kong as a series of rallies against a proposal to permit extraditions to mainland China grew into a raft of anti-authoritarian protests and challenges to Beijing's grip on the city. Given the gravest political crisis confronting Hong Kong in decades, this research investigates why the protests have lacked centralized leaders and why the solidarity among the peaceful and militant protesters has been immense. This article also examines the strengths and limitations of this leaderless movement with different case studies. The authors argue that serious threats to the commonly cherished values in Hong Kong, amid the absence of stable and legitimate leaders in its democracy movement, underpinned the formation of a multitude of decentralized decision-making platforms that orchestrated the protests in 2019. Those platforms involved both well-known movement leaders organizing conventional peaceful protests and anonymous activists crafting a diversity of tactics in ingenious ways, ranging from economic boycotts, human chains around the city, artistic protests via LennonWalls, to the occupying of the international airport. The decentralized decision-making platforms, while having generated a boon to the movement with their beneficial tactical division of labor, also produced risks to the campaign. The risks include the lack of legitimate representatives for conflict-deescalating negotiations, rise in legitimacy-sapping violence, and susceptibility to underestimating the risks of various tactics stemming from a dearth of thorough political communication among anonymous participants who had different goals and degrees of risk tolerance. In short, Hong Kong's anti-extradition movement in 2019 sheds light on the basis of leaderless movements, and on both the strengths and risks of such movements.

AB  - Tapinoma sessile (Say) is a common ant throughout the United States that frequently relocates portions of its nests to form large polydomous colonies in urban areas. Despite widespread research on the control of T. sessile as a nuisance pest, relatively little work has focused on the biology of its nesting behavior and movement. We evaluated shade, moisture, and proximity to food as factors triggering colony movement in laboratory assays. Initially, T. sessile colonies moved to shaded artificial nest sites irrespective of arena moisture. Then, workers and brood were increasingly moved to moist artificial nest sites over time. Colonies moved workers and brood to near-food artificial nest sites over both 1 m and 6 m distances. Queens relocated to near-food nest sites over 1 m distances, but not 6 m distances, during the 49-d study. Results suggest that an increase either in moisture or food in proximity to a residence is likely to account for observed increases in T. sessile abundance near structures.

AB  - Urbanization represents a fierce driver of phenotypic change, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying observed phenotypic patterns are poorly understood. Epigenetic changes are expected to facilitate more rapid adaption to changing or novel environments, such as our towns and cities, compared with slow changes in gene sequence. A comparison of liver and blood tissue from great tits Parus major originating from an urban and a forest site demonstrated that urbanization is associated with variation in genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation. Combining reduced representation bisulphite sequencing with transcriptome data, we revealed habitat differences in DNA methylation patterns that suggest a regulated and coordinated response to the urban environment. In the liver, genomic sites that were differentially methylated between urban- and forest-dwelling birds were over-represented in regulatory regions of the genome and more likely to occur in expressed genes. DNA methylation levels were also inversely correlated with gene expression at transcription start sites. Furthermore, differentially methylated CpG sites, in liver, were over-represented in pathways involved in (i) steroid biosynthesis, (ii) superoxide metabolism, (iii) secondary alcohol metabolism, (iv) chylomicron remodelling, (v) cholesterol transport, (vi) reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic process and (vii) epithelial cell proliferation. This corresponds with earlier studies identifying diet and exposure to ROS as two of the main drivers of divergence between organisms in urban and nonurban environments. Conversely, in blood, sites that were differentially methylated between urban- and forest-dwelling birds were under-represented in regulatory regions, more likely to occur in nonexpressed genes and not over-represented in specific biological pathways. It remains to be determined whether diverging patterns of DNA methylation represent adaptive evolutionary responses and whether the conclusions can be more widely attributed to urbanization.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the relationship between self-managed habitat production and changes in women's life. Our study is based on the experience of the cooperatives "La Fabrica" and "El Molino" cooperatives, of the Movement of Occupants and Tenants of the city of Buenos Aires Argentina. The analysis is based on fieldwork-based on participant observation, ethnographic interviews, and a specific survey conducted in 2018. Throughout the paper, the various ways in which the participation of women in collective decision-making bodies that have a significant impact on their habitat through self-management are highlighted. We conclude that this process enables tendencies of delocalization as part of the resignation of daily life and associated with a value of the collective and the "common".

AB  - In this study an urban stream network with earthen and concreted sections were studied for different seasons (wet and dry) to investigate the macroinvertebrate composition and the governing factors. The factors considered were water quality (nitrogen species, soluble reactive phosphorus etc.) and stream eco-hydraulics (velocity, wetted depth and width, vegetative indicators, number of mesoscale physical habitats, etc.). In contrast to common perception, results showed that concrete lined sites are not ecologically dead. Even though low, concrete line section had viable populations of macroinvertebrates and importantly a few native species. Interestingly, some macroinvertebrate indices of the concrete lined sites did not show a significant difference with the earthen sites. About 60% of the macroinvertebrates were grazers and filterers, and these two group populations always showed an inverse relationship. Earthen and concrete lined sites had similar diversities, but for different reasons. In general earthen sites diversity and pollution tolerance index of macroinvertebrates (PTI) was positively correlated, but no uniform correlation was observed in concrete lined sites. Some concrete lined sites with high diversity showed low PTIs (i.e. high diversity as a result of many types of pollution tolerant species) whereas in some the high diversity associated with high PTIs. Macroinvertebrate composition and the influencing factors were to a greater degree section dependent and to a lesser extent were dependent on the season. Physical heterogeneity played an important role in the macroinvertebrate responses in earthen sites. Water quality and flow rate explained comprehensively, the variations in the concrete lined sites. Results proved that nutrient levels need to be limited and instream heterogeneity needs to be improved to enhance diversity and populations of pollution intolerant species. Also, controlled vegetation harvesting is recommended in contrast to the current practice of complete removal for flow conveyance.

AB  - Seagrasses need to be resilient if they are to persist in the long term. Being able to build up a dormant seed bank in sediments is a key strategy that some species employ to regenerate from large-scale degradation. Much of the research on seed banks has focussed on temperate species, and little is known regarding the status of seed banks in tropical meadows. In the present study, we examined the seed bank status of three common seagrass species at six sites in Singapore and attempted to identify potential drivers of seed abundance. Our results indicated depauperate seed banks with few species setting viable seed and low seed densities.Halophila ovalisseeds were found at four sites andHalodule uninervisseeds at two sites, butCymodocea rotundataseeds were absent from all six sites. WhereasH. ovalisseed viability ranged from 20% to 68.8%, none of theH. uninervisseeds was viable.Halophila ovalisseed densities (33-334 m(-2)) were much higher than those ofH. uninervis(9-21 m(-2)). Of the variables examined, onlyH. ovaliscover was positively correlated with the number of seeds. Our study has highlighted the vulnerability of seagrass meadows in Singapore's urban waters to future disturbances.

AB  - San Jose 520 is a Classic period hamlet of single-family residences in the urban periphery of Teotihuacan, just beyond the southeast edge of the city. Three burial features were associated with one of the residences, AF2. One of the features contained the burial of a single adult, another the successive burials of eight adults and one neonate, and the third held a neonate. We analyzed 29 bone and enamel samples from the adults for bioapatite phosphate oxygen-isotope composition; we also considered isotopic data for another five bone samples analyzed in a separate project. The isotopic results suggest a pattern of birth in the Teotihuacan region and then movement in early childhood to a "relocation" region, the geographic location of which is unknown. Later, probably in adolescence, the individuals returned to live, and eventually die, in San Jose 520. Without knowing more about the occupation of the relocation region, it is difficult to say what concerns or beliefs underlay this unusual but long-established settlement system.

AB  - The literature, aimed at understanding the income-price elasticity of air passenger demand, bases its analysis on airport movement. The diversity of studies regarding the casualty between air transportation and economic growth are examples. Some studies covering this link, estimate the income-price relationship with the demand considering international traffic. Considering a domestic setting, where this traffic is significant in Brazil, studies related to remote regions are scarce, and the existing ones focus on governmental policies and subsidies. In addition, empirical studies on the theme consenter themselves in developed regions, such as Europe, North America, and Australia. For Brazil, where we find the Amazon region, there is no empirical research. This paper analyses the price-income elasticity of the demand regarding domestic passengers in air links from remote cities of the Brazilian Amazon. This study uses panel data regression analysis method on a database of domestic scheduled flights of Brazil ' s National Civil Aviation Agency. The results show that air passengers involving remote region flights present a lower sensitivity regarding local income and an airline ' s price variations than those in flights among capitals. The higher difference is in the income elasticity of the remote city of origin, which is lower than that of the air traffic among capitals.

AB  - The degradation of urban natural spaces reduces their ability to benefit human populations. Restoration can support urban sustainability by improving both the ecological health of these spaces and the public benefits they provide, but studies rarely combine both perspectives. We assessed the ecological and social benefits of an urban river restoration project relative to an unrestored river on the basis of the following four principles: Increasing ecological integrity; benefitting and engaging society; taking account of the past and future; and sustainability. Ecological health at each site was assessed by analyzing macroinvertebrate samples. The social benefits were measured by conducting focus groups with local users of green spaces surrounding the two rivers and comparing their responses. Restoration increased the ecological health of the river and was viewed positively by users, enhancing the river as a space to visit for psychological benefits. However, there were concerns over the erasure of the cultural heritage of the area. Our findings indicate that the long-term sustainability of restoration projects, particularly in urban areas, can be enhanced by integrating ecological and social dimensions. Although short-term ecological improvements may be small, they have the potential to provide a range of benefits for human populations.

AB  - Microeukaryotes play key roles in the structure and functioning of lotic ecosystems; however, little is known about the relative importance of the processes that drive planktonic microeukaryotic biogeography in rivers, especially the effects of anthropogenic inputs (e.g., wastewater discharge and pesticide and fertilizer use) on the taxonomic and functional diversity of microeukaryotes. Herein 185 ribosomal RNA sequencing was used to examine the assembly of microeukaryotes in samples from Xiaoqing River, a mid-sized river in north China that runs through urban and agricultural areas and then discharges into the Bohai Sea. We found that diversity of microeukaryote dedined obviously due to the excessive disturbance of the urban and agricultural activities in the midstream of the river. Our results support the concept that species sorting caused by local pollution can largely determine microeukaryotic community structure when significant environmental gradients exist in polluted running-water ecosystems and that compositional dissimilarity increased with increases in the Euclidean distance of environmental variables. Variation of microeukaryotic diversity was mainly determined by changes in levels of nutrients, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and salinity and they can affect the rare subcommunities significantly. Furthermore, zooplankton were dominated in rare taxa, meanwhile phytoplankton was composed by the abundant taxa mainly. These findings confirmed the dynamic character of riverine ecosystems and the significance of human activities in shaping microeukaryote diversity in rivers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Questions The ecological condition of riparian habitats has been negatively altered by human activities and land-use changes. The aims of this study were to evaluate: (a) how adjacent land use affects the ecological condition of riparian habitats; and (b) whether the ecological condition relates to riparian vegetation properties (i.e., structure, diversity, and species composition). Location Watershed of the Duero River, in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. Methods Sampling sites were established along the Duero River riverbank by considering three different land uses (i.e., native forest, agriculture, and urban). At each site, we assessed the ecological condition of riparian habitats with a riparian condition index (RCI) composed of six subindices, with 17 indicators. Using a survey of woody plants (DBH >= 2.5 cm) in 12 different 0.1-ha sites, we assessed vegetation properties. Results According to the RCI, 76% of the studied riparian habitats had a very poor ecological condition, and only one site scored an excellent condition. The values of all subindices as well as the RCI were significantly greater in the forest than in the agricultural or urban land uses. The significant relationships between the RCI and its components (subindices) with vegetation properties were all positive and explained between 22% and 73% of the variation in structural and diversity attributes, and between 48% and 66% in floristic composition. Conclusions This study shows how human land-use activities affect the ecological condition of riparian habitats and hence riparian forests. Overall, the RCI had a high predictive power for the vegetation properties of riparian forests. This information is critical for programs involved in the management, conservation, and ecological restoration of riparian habitats. Low-cost and time-efficient indices, such as the RCI, facilitate ecological condition assessments of riparian habitats not only by scientists but also by previously trained land managers and the general public.

AB  - The fragility of the postcolonial Zimbabwean state and concomitant failed governance has opened crevices through which alternative forms of self-organising and social formation are emerging. In the face of state-inspired uncertainties One God Ministry (OGM) members have organised themselves along religious lines to strengthen their livelihoods and wellbeing. This article draws on the findings of an ethnographic study of members of an anonymised Pentecostal Charismatic Christian movement (PCC) that self-organised to push for the attainment of economic democracy through provision of decent housing and income-generating activities for its members. It argues that OGM is filling the void left by the weakening postcolonial state. The Pentecostal movement's success is derived from its ability to proffer pragmatic solutions to structural challenges that members face. Furthermore, OGM builds its solutions around diversity in membership, transnational relations, and followers' hopes and aspirations.

AB  - The hemiparasitic European mistletoe, Viscum album L. (Viscaceae), displays a rapid and remarkable expansion into natural and urban ecosystems in Ukraine. The monitoring and management of this quickly spreading species is becoming increasingly difficult as new plant species become hosts. Unlike other local mistletoe species, the European mistletoe has a broad distribution and thus requires a countrywide pest status assessment for control. This review outlines the major taxonomic and evolutionary issues pertinent to V. album with an emphasis on the characters used to distinguish its five currently recognized subspecies. The review also provides an updated distribution map and host range for the three V. album subspecies in Ukraine [V. album subsp. album, V. album subsp. abietis (Wiesb.) Janch., and V. album subsp. austriacum (Wiesb.) Vollm.], addressing the current knowledge of their biology and ecology. A significant portion of the paper is devoted to the diversity of organisms associated with V. album, including herbivores, endophytes, and parasites, drawing particular attention to major pollination and dispersal vectors, as well as potential biocontrol agents for this mistletoe species.

AB  - The inner Sicilian area of the Erei hills, crossed by rivers and important streams directed to the Catania's lowland, witnessed very ancient human occupation and activities, starting from the Upper Palaeolithic. Here the dynamics of human activities and the organization of the supply basin during early times were distinctive in certain historical periods: some featured a substantial continuity with the earlier phases, while others showed a complete discontinuity with the older human settlement framework and a new organization of the area and activities connected with the environment. These agricultural, proto-urban and urban communities organized their existence on the exploitation of natural resources, distributing themselves according to the local morphology. They built, mostly on top of the hills, constructions used as control viewpoints of the area, and created a complete communication network to connect settlements of the same or different level. Those features in several cases had a long-term continuity that survived to dramatic historical changes and represent today the optimal way for a right perception of current landscape and its millenary history.

AB  - The concept of seismic vulnerability is a yard-stick of damage estimation from a probable earthquake considering physical cum social dimension and enables a basis for decision-makers to develop preparedness and mitigation strategies. We aim at vulnerability assessment of the typical urban system of capital city Shillong situated on hilly terrain. High-resolution satellite imagery of Shillong facilitates analysis of building footprints, communication network, and open ground. Different building typologies are identified taking into account the building's structural configuration assessed through a rapid visual survey of more than 15% of total residential households. Slope map demarcates the landslide-prone area through discrete elevation modelling. A methodology incorporating several parameters e.g. building typology, slope angle, shear wave velocity characteristics, geomorphology, and the number of occupants in correlation with a physical measurement of vulnerability is presented and is applied to estimate the dimension of vulnerability. Additionally, MASW survey indicates lithology up to 30m deep along with the existence of stiff soil and rocks at different depths whereas resonant frequency is identified to be in the range of 6-8Hz through H/V ratio. Integrating all, it is observed that more than 60% of Shillong city falls under moderate to higher vulnerability and the rest is less vulnerable.

AB  - As the world becomes more urbanized, neighborhood parks are becoming an increasingly important venue where people engage in physical and social activities. Using park-use data collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the aim of this study is to account for park use in light of park attributes and neighborhood conditions. The role of the built environment near a park receives particular attention as it is understudied in the literature. A regression model shows that neighborhood park utilization is positively associated with park attributes (i.e., larger area, a playground, a creek/pond, quality maintenance, and organized activities) and neighborhood attributes (i.e., fewer minority/low-income population, higher density, more commercial and public uses, and a well-connected street network). The statistical significance of these factors varies by user types. This study provides insights into the role of neighborhood compactness and mixed land use, which calls for interdisciplinary collaboration among urban planners/designers, landscape architects, and park programmers.

AB  - Global changes, such as climate and urbanization, are strongly entwined and aggravated by the development of human activities, which also intensifies the human-mediated dispersal of species. However, few studies have explicitly considered the combined influence of urbanization and climate on species expansion. We investigated the combined roles of climate, urbanization and human-mediated dispersal in the expansion of Tetramorium immigrans (an invasive pavement ant in North America) in urban areas of South-eastern France. A total of 544 T. immigrans individuals were sampled from 16 urban gradients and genotyped at 14 microsatellite markers. Based on molecular ecology methods and statistical modelling, we evaluated the impact of climate and urbanization on its distribution patterns. Through the combined study of the occurrence probabilities of T. immigrans, its genetic structure and the founder effects within its populations, the effect of climateurbanization interaction on species distribution was clearly evidenced, suggesting that in the north of its range, T. immigrans subsists under harsher climate by colonizing the most urbanized areas. Many taxa may conform to such pattern, making the combined study of climate and urbanization a necessary challenge for future studies. Distribution patterns concurred with similar observations in the American invasive range of T. immigrans, making it likely that it may not be native to the northernmost part of its European range. Cryptic invasions or discreet range shifts in response to increasing urbanization are likely to occur in many taxa, especially in ants, and deserve increased attention from researchers and managers alike.

AB  - Siphonophores are commonly considered to be useful indicators of water masses and water-mass movement, but their employment as such across the wider Southern Ocean has not so far been attempted. We redress this here using archived samples, collected during January-February 1993 along a transect from Cape Town to the South African National Antarctic Expedition (SANAE) base in Antarctica, and compare the patterns generated with those determined from a prior analysis of whole assemblages at lower taxonomic resolution. Twenty-one species were identified from 18 of the original 53 samples collected, and two distinct assemblages were confirmed as separated by the Sub-Antarctic Front. That to the south was characterised by low diversity and high abundance and was dominated by cold-water specialists, whereas that to the north comprised a larger number of subtropical and temperate species at low abundance. Assemblage structure was strongly influenced by the mixed layer depth, sea surface salinity and chlorophyllaconcentration, as well as mesozooplankton biomass. Congruence with the whole-assemblage study was high, indicating that this taxon can be suitably employed as a proxy in studies such as this. The study emphasises the value of archived plankton samples and makes a plea for better curation.

AB  - The role of urban areas in the introduction of alien plant species, and their subsequent spread in the countryside, has long been identified. However, it was mainly considered indirectly due to the lack of data on the frequency of planting of alien species and their early stages of colonization. In this study, we took advantage of the spectacular flowering of the pampa grass (Cortaderia selloana), a tall ornamental plant, visible from afar, to study the spatial dynamics of planted and naturalized stands (i.e. those resulting from seed dispersal) over 600 km(2) and over an 11-year period. Using distance sampling methods, we detected 216 and 241 planted stands in 2002 and 2013, respectively. In 2002, we also detected 853 naturalized stands, closely associated with anthropogenic habitats around urban areas. Such spatial association could have represented the initial stages of a spread from urban areas to natural habitats. However, 11 years later, this very close association between naturalized stands and urban areas has not weakened, suggesting a persistent pattern. In both 2002 and 2013, less than 15% of naturalized individuals grew up in natural habitats, almost all limited to the edges of reed beds where they did not threaten local biodiversity. Our study shows that the massive introduction of an alien plant into urban areas, and its subsequent massive naturalization, does not necessarily means its spread to natural habitats. On the contrary, it can remain closely associated with anthropogenic habitats.

AB  - Access to sewage system is an important indicator of life quality. In 2016, 73% of the Polish population was connected to wastewater treatment plants. Although in cities this share is 95%, in rural areas it is only at 41%. There are still nearly 9 million people in rural areas without access to wastewater network. The purpose of this paper is to report on the current state of the sewage management infrastructure in Poland, especially in areas where the fastest migration processes occur, i.e. in form of suburbanisation. It also gives an overview of infrastructure development over the last 20 years. Geostatistical tools (Arc GIS 10.5.1) are also used to identify areas where access to the analysed infrastructure is the weakest and the best. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistics for each commune were calculated by use of the Hot Spot Analysis tool to identify the statistically significant spatial clusters with high values (hot spots) and low values (cold spots) of analysed parameters. Spatial differentiation of identified communes (especially rural communes) has been analysed, taking into account i. a. the borders of 26 polish functional urban areas (FUA), where the so-called integrated territorial investments (ITI) are implemented. The rural communes belonging to the cold spot were identified in 4 FUAs and the hot spots in 13 FUAs.

AB  - Mosquito-borne infections often have concerted peaks, or are synchronous, across landscapes. This phenomenon might be driven by vector responses to similar environmental conditions that synchronize their abundance. While adult mosquito populations can be synchronous over spatial scales ranging from a few meters to a few kilometers, little to nothing is known about immature mosquito synchrony, including its relationship with mosquito colonization and persistence in larval habitats. Here, we present results from a 2-yearlong synchrony study in co-occurring populations of Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse), Aedes (Stegomyia) flavopictus Yamada and Aedes (Finlaya) japonicus japonicus (Theobald), three invasive mosquito species, along an urban altitudinal gradient in Japan. We found that Ae. albopictus was asynchronous while Ae. flavopictus and Ae. j. japonicus had synchrony that, respectively, tracked geographic and altitudinal patterns of temperature correlation. Spatially, Ae. albopictus was more persistent at hotter locations near urban land use, while Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. flavopictus increasingly persisted farther away from urban land. Temporally, Ae. albopicus and Ae. flavopictus decreased the proportion of colonized habitats following variable rainfall, while Ae. j. japonicus increased with vegetation growth and leptokurtic temperatures. Our results support the hypothesis that immature mosquito synchrony is autonomous from dispersal and driven by common environmental conditions.

AB  - Studies of the indoor airborne microbiome have mostly been confined to a single location and time point. Here, we characterized, over the course of a year, the geographic variation, building-function dependence, and dispersal characteristics of indoor and outdoor airborne microbiomes (bacterial members only) of eight mechanically ventilated commercial buildings. Based on the Sloan neutral model, airborne microbiomes were randomly dispersed in the respective indoor and outdoor environments and between the two environments during each season. The dominant taxa in the indoor and outdoor environments showed minor variations at each location among seasons. The airborne microbiomes displayed weak seasonality for both indoor and outdoor environments, while a weak geographic variation was found only for the indoor environments. Source tracking results show that outdoor air and occupant skin were major contributors to the indoor airborne microbiomes, but the extent of the contribution from each source varied within and among buildings over the seasons, which suggests variations in local building use. Based on 32 cases of indoor airborne microbiome data, we determined that the indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratio of PM2.5 was not a robust indicator of the sources found indoors. Alternatively, the indoor concentration of carbon dioxide was more closely correlated with the major sources of the indoor airborne microbiome in mechanically ventilated environments.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is a spatial technique based on obtaining the phase differences of two radar images, acquired by a satellite from separate orbits and at different times, to obtain a ground displacement image of a study area, This image is called interferogram. On the other hand, space syntax is a technique within architecture that is applied to quantify and describe the level of ease of population movement through any urban space in a city. It analyzes the flow, transit, displacement, accessibility and concentration of the population in areas of basic services, health, security, commerce and entertainment. What would happen if an earthquake greater than 6 or 7 Moment Magnitude-Mw occurs in these areas of intense concentration of the population that are in buildings constructed on intense deformations of the land? With respect to the seismic risk in the city of Quito, many studies related to seismic risks have been published, but there are no studies that relate the deformation of the land (INSAR) with the space syntax, so this article presents a new vision in the joint application of these tools, a useful vision for urban planners and designers, considering the occurrence of a major earthquake in areas of buildings that are located on intense land deformations and have high population concentrations. This study has been prepared in two phases: in the first phase, the built-up areas concentrated in the greatest terrain deformations by accumulated displacement obtained using the APS estimation & multitemporal analysis by PSI-InSAR time series analysis methodology and Sentinel 1A and 1B satellite images were categorized. In the second phase, through the space syntax's theory and the use of DepthmapX, the movement patterns and traffic flows of the population were determined by means of graphs of spaces interconnected by streets (axial maps), to predict the spatial behavior of humans and its concentration in the mentioned sites. Finally, the results were integrated, determining the degree of exposure of the population found in built areas with high to very high displacement and an intense population concentration.

AB  - In the past four decades, China has achieved tremendous economic success, but it has also faced serious ecological security (ES) problems. The land use/cover change (LUCC) plays a decisive role in the issue of ES. LUCC and ES evaluation were combined by predicting the change in land use and simulating ES pattern. Taking the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PRD) as the study area, the temporal changes of land use were predicted by the CA-Markov model, and the land use pattern in three different scenarios in 2025 was simulated. Based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model, the ES evaluation of the PRD in 2005, 2010 and 2015 was carried out, and the safety level dropped from 75.39% to 66.67% in this period. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed by the GeoDA to reflect the dynamic of ES pattern of the PRD, which suggested that there is greater heterogeneity within the PRD, and the homogenous sub-region continues to increase. Through change the transition probability among different land use types, three scenarios were set: Inertial development, Over expansion, and Ecological protection scenario, which showed that the expansion of construction land (accounting for 18.58%, 20.12% and 17.93% respectively) must occupy agricultural and forest lands and lead to decrease on ES level, the safety level are accounting for 79.07%, 78.30% and 79.95% in the three scenarios respectively. The ES pattern of the PRD was described, the central sub-region of the PRD with high urbanization have relative low ES, and the periphery sub-regions with good ecological order have high ES level, there are more than 63.59% and less than 4.06% of unsafety level of Dongguan and Zhaoqing respectively, which are both the representative city of these two sub-regions. Based on the spatial-temporal dynamic of urban ES, the optimized ES pattern of the PRD was proposed, three eco-functional zones were determined: ecological conservation zone, living environment guarantee zone and ecological restoration zone. The eco-functional zones have defined the leading ecological functions of each sub-region and could gradually improve the integrity and connectivity of the entire ecosystem of the PRD, which provides valuable knowledge for understanding and planning regional city management.

AB  - Changes in land cover are the main threats to integrity and biodiversity of wetlands. Here, we evaluated the effects of agriculture and urbanization on the functional traits (FT) of aquatic invertebrate. We evaluated 30 wetlands distributed among agricultural, urban and natural landscapes on the south of Brazil. We selected eight FT that encompassed aspects of life history, morphology and behavioral strategies to functionally characterize invertebrate fauna and 10 environmental variables of wetlands. We collected 3868 organisms distributed among 138 taxa (Crustacea, Mollusca, Hexapoda. The RLQ analysis (environmental, R; species-abundances, L; species-traits, Q) showed that there was a relationship between environmental conditions and the functional composition of the invertebrates. The FT that were more sensitive to environmental changes were scrapers feeding habit, reproduction mode, resistance form, adult aquatic stage, flat body shape, and dispersal mode. Our results suggest that land use acted as environmental filters, as they promote the selection and convergence of specific characteristics that give organisms more resilience and/or resistance to cope with the effects of anthropogenic disturbances. Also this results showed that (i) human disturbance can influence directly on the dynamic of the wetlands ecosystems functioning and (ii) the efficiency of the use FT in the environmental monitoring.

AB  - A set of widely developed ground fissures within the Datong Basin, northern China, have inflicted serious damage to farm fields, roads, houses, and building foundations in Datong City. Such emergence of large-scale ground fissures is rare in urban areas. The formation mechanisms of these features were therefore investigated in detail through surveying, mapping, trenching, drilling, and geophysical prospecting. The 11 fissures in Datong City are located on the hanging wall of the Kouquan fault (part of regional horst and graben terrain), and run approximately parallel, with a dominant strike of NE34 degrees-70 degrees and a maximum length of 5.5 km. These structures occur in clear zones with similar directions and lateral distributions on the surface. They possess evident syn-sedimentary fault characteristics, including y-shaped, trapezoidal, and traction structures in their profiles. The synergistic action of different tectonic factors and groundwater exploitation is responsible for fissure formation. Under the influences of regional tensile stress, upper mantle uplift, and fault block movement, activity along local faults created hidden fracture systems within the hanging wall. The over-exploitation of groundwater in the region subsequently accelerated fracture growth, and varying vertical compressibility of the strata on both sides of the local fault resulted in uneven subsidence on the surface, generating tensile zones and promoting the appearance of fissures at the edges of settlement funnels.

AB  - Plastic and, particularly, microplastic (MP) pollution is a growing research theme, dedicated largely to marine systems. Occurring at the land-sea interface, estuarine habitats such as mangroves are at risk of plastic pollution. This study compared MP pollution (level, morphotype, polymer composition, size and colour) across four South African estuaries, in relation to the built and natural environment. Mouth status, surrounding human population densities and land-use practices influenced the level and type of MP pollution. Systems that were most at risk were predominantly open estuaries surrounded by high population densities and diverse land use types. Microplastic levels and the diversity of types detected increased with increasing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Overall, microfibres dominated in estuarine water (69%) and mangrove sediment (51%). Polyethylene (43%) and polypropylene (23%) were the dominant polymers overall. Weathered fishing gear, weathered packaging items and run-off from urban/industrial centres are probable sources of MP pollution. Increased run-off and river input during the wet/rainy season may explain the markedly higher MP loads in estuarine waters relative to the dry season. By contrast, MP deposition in mangrove sediment was higher during the dry season. Sediment MP abundance was significantly positively correlated with both pneumatophore density and sediment size (500-2000 mu m). This study highlights the role of mangroves as MP sinks, which may limit movement of MPs into adjacent environments. However, under conditions such as flooding and extreme wave action, mangroves may shift from sinks to sources of plastic pollution.

AB  - The Royal Sites have been studied and analysed from many points of view and there is an extensive bibliography regarding their historic, artistic and touristic heritage. However, their importance in the conservation of the environment, namely the conservation of soils and ecological corridors allowing the movement of animals and maintenance of biodiversity, has hardly been studied. Their high levels of protection, both as patrimony of the State and as ecological areas, have helped to preserve these natural landscapes even in areas close to big cities. In this paper we will analyse the importance that the Royal Sites, located in the northwest of the Autonomous Community of Madrid and in areas nearby in the Province of Segovia, have had in the conservation of the soils.

AB  - The Yucatan tidal wetland (YTW), located in the southeastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico is an extensive, heterogeneous, seasonally flooded area with a high diversity and richness, but urbanization is changing the ecosystem and, therefore, could change the functions it provides. Two important functions of the wetlands have been highlighted, its function as a nursery and the transfer of biomass to other ecosystems. To corroborate those functions, the percentage of juveniles and the links of the fish assemblage with other ecosystems need to be registered. In the present study, the fish assemblage of the YTW was analyzed to determine: (1) zonation; (2) assemblage and trophic structure; (3) environmental constraints on the fish assemblage, and (4) usage and connectivity of the ecosystem. Fifty-one stations were analyzed and segregated into three zones: Z1, the coastline, characterized by oxygenated and high salinity waters, and the highest fish richness and trophic diversity. Its fish assemblage is constituted by species associated with marine (31%), brackish (30%), reef (22%), and freshwater (17%) ecosystems, with 50% of the population registered as juveniles and 33% in the first-maturity size. Z2, the brackish environment, presents average fish richness and trophic diversity and physicochemical variation, its fish assemblage is constituted by species associated to freshwater (44%), brackish (34%), marine (15%), and reef (7%) ecosystems, with 43% of the population registered in first-maturity size and 33% in juveniles sizes. Z3, the freshwater environment, characterized by low oxygen levels and salinity, low fish richness and trophic diversity and the highest biomass. Its fish assemblage is constituted by species associated with freshwater (65%), brackish (34.5%), and marine (0.5%) ecosystems, with 80% of the population registered in adult sizes. The nursery, refuge, and feeding ground functions of the YTW and the transfer of biomass, via individuals, to other ecosystems were corroborated. It can be concluded that the YTW presents an intricate trophic and functional relationship among zones and ecosystems surrounding it; thus, the detrimental impacts in the YTW will produce negative effects in the near aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, it is of priority importance to ensure that the urban development plans of the YTW ensure the connection between zones, the clean input of freshwater, and the natural flow between the sea and the YTW.

AB  - Background: Aedes aegypti is an efficient vector of several arboviruses of public health importance, including Zika and dengue. Currently vector management is the only available avenue for disease control. Development of efficient vector control strategies requires a thorough understanding of vector ecology. In this study, we identified households that are consistently productive for Ae. aegypti pupae and determined the ecological and socio-demographic factors associated with the persistence and abundance of pupae in households in rural and urban Kenya.
   Methods: We collected socio-demographic, environmental and entomological data monthly from July 2014 to June 2018 from 80 households across four sites in Kenya. Pupae count data were collected via entomological surveillance of households and paired with socio-demographic and environmental data. We calculated pupal persistence within a household as the number of months of pupal presence within a year. We used spatially explicit generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to identify the risk factors for pupal abundance, and a logistic regression to identify the risk factors for pupal persistence in households.
   Results: The median number of months of pupal presence observed in households was 4 and ranged from 0 to 35 months. We identified pupal persistence in 85 house-years. The strongest risk factors for high pupal abundance were the presence of bushes or tall grass in the peri-domicile area (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.13-2.28), open eaves (OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.33-4.95) and high habitat counts (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.21-1.66). The main risk factors for pupal persistence were the presence of bushes or tall grass in the peri-domicile (OR: 4.20, 95% CI: 1.42-12.46) and high number of breeding sites (OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.03-4.58).
   Conclusions: We observed Ae. aegypti pupal persistence at the household level in urban and rural and in coastal and inland Kenya. High counts of potential breeding containers, vegetation in the peri-domicile area and the presence of eaves were strongly associated with increased risk of pupal persistence and abundance. Targeting households that exhibit pupal persistence alongside the risk factors for pupal abundance in vector control interventions may result in more efficient use of limited resources.

AB  - Cardboard publishers (editoriales cartoneras) are small, independent publishers linked by the recovered cardboard that covers their books, a commitment to the promotion of local authors, and a drive to make literature accessible. This cultural movement, whose actors often form part of broader social movements, has spread across Latin America and beyond, with other 250 active collectives. Drawing on ethnography conducted with some of Mexico's thirty cartoneras, and literary analysis of their texts, this paper contributes to debates on violence and public space in the context of the brutal Mexican "war on drugs". Dialoguing with a body of scholarship spanning from Setha Low's pioneering urban anthropology to Jacques Ranciere's art theory, we argue that cartoneras might be considered "public-ers", in that their book-making labor involves the production not just of books, but of new social relations, communities, and publics. By analyzing aesthetic materials in relation to the social contexts in which they are embedded, we demonstrate that decisions to denounce violence and perform its alternatives on the written page, and in the public plaza, are inseparable and intertwined cultural forms of action that create affective encounters, contact zones, and spaces of dissensus in the city.

AB  - Citizen science-based research has been used effectively to estimate animal abundance and breeding patterns, to monitor animal movement, and for biodiversity conservation and education. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of using social media observations to assess the distribution of small apes in Peninsular Malaysia. We searched for reports of small ape observations in Peninsular Malaysia on social media (e.g., blogs, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, iNaturalist, etc.), and also used online, radio, print messaging, and word of mouth to invite citizen scientists such as birders, amateur naturalists, hikers, and other members of the public to provide information about small ape observations made during their activities. These reports provided new information about the occurrence of all three species of small apes (Hylobates agilis, Hylobates lar, and Symphalangus syndactylus) in Peninsular Malaysia. Social media users reported observations of small apes in almost every state. Despite the fact that small apes are believed to occur primarily in the interior of large forested areas, most observations were from fairly small (<100 km(2)) forests near areas of high traffic and high human population (roads and urban areas). This suggests that most outdoor enthusiasts primarily visit well-traveled and easily accessible areas, which results in biased sampling if only incidental observations reported on social media are used. A more targeted approach specifically soliciting reports from citizen scientists visiting large, less-accessible forests may result in better sampling in these habitats. Social media reports indicated the presence of small apes in at least six habitats where they had not been previously reported. We verified the reported data based on whether reports included a date, location, and uploaded photographs, videos and/or audio recordings. Well-publicized citizen science programs may also build awareness and enthusiasm about the conservation of vulnerable wildlife species.

AB  - Patterns of genetic diversity in invasive populations can be modulated by a range of factors acting at different stages of the invasion process, including the genetic composition of the source population(s), the introduction history (e.g. propagule pressure), the environmental suitability of recipient areas, and the features of secondary introductions.
   The North American red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, is one of the most widely introduced freshwater species worldwide. It was legally introduced into Spain twice, near the city of Badajoz in 1973 and in the Guadalquivir marshes in 1974. Thereafter the species rapidly colonised almost the entire Iberian Peninsula.
   We used seven nuclear microsatellites to describe the genetic diversity and structure of 28 locations distributed across the Iberian Peninsula and to explain the expansion process of the red swamp crayfish. Additionally, we analysed the relationship between environmental suitability and genetic diversity of the studied locations.
   The red swamp crayfish had a clear spatial genetic structure in the Iberian Peninsula, probably determined by the two independent introduction events in the 1970s, which produced two main clusters separated spatially, one of which was dominant in Portugal and the other in Spain.
   The human-mediated dispersal process seemed to have involved invasion hubs, hosting highly genetically diverse areas and acting as sources for subsequent introductions. Genetic diversity also tended to be higher in more suitable environments across the Iberian Peninsula.
   Our results showed that the complex and human-mediated expansion of the red swamp crayfish in the Iberian Peninsula has involved several long- and short-distance movements and that both ecological and anthropogenic factors have shaped the genetic diversity patterns resulting from this invasion process. Early detection of potential invasion hubs may help to halt multiple short-distance translocations and thus the rapid expansion of highly prolific invasive species over non-native areas.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) existence, identification and source were investigated by studying a total of 2539 particles in 349 sediment samples from nine different tourist beaches [(Sodwana & Richard Bays; Ballito, Mtunzini, Tugela, Zinkwazi, Ballito (north & south) and Durban north & south)] of southeastern coast of South Africa. They are more abundant in the beaches of the Durban city, followed by the Sodwana & Richards Bays, Ballito and Mtunzini. The black particles prevailed over the blue, white, pink, brown, red and green MPs. Supremacy of MPs in the Durban city is mainly due to the longshore coastal Agulhas current in the South eastern side of African coast aiding the degradation of primary plastics coming both from continent and sea. SEM images provided the evidences of weathering/degrading process through grooves, cracks, deep fissures, sharp edges and layered degradation showing signs of oxidation due to long term exposure in the coastal environment. EDS results suggested presence of elements (i.e. C, -O, Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Na, K, S, Ti, Cu and Zn introduced during the production of plastics as additives. FTIR spectral matches identified from all samples infer polypropylene (PP) (62%), rayon (RY) (17.2%), polycarbonate (PC) (29.8%), nylon (NY) (18.92%), polyester (PES) (31.2%), polyacrylonitrile (PAN) (11.21%) and polystyrene (PS) as well as low (28.9%) & high (36.1%) polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Higher abundance of MPs in the beaches of South Africa in comparison with studies around the world emphasizes the need of dispersal monitoring and use of plastic materials/polymers.

AB  - Background: Functional regions are abstract, uniformly defined territorial units that form an important basis for many development strategies of a country or a region. Objectives: This study analyses the application of network theory to the detection of such regions. Methods/Approach: Functional regions are analysed using two methods based on the graph theory: the Walktrap algorithm and the chain approach. The quality of the two regionalization methods is analysed using the fuzzy set theory with the revised method. Slovenia was used as a case study. Results: The Walktrap algorithm generated eight functional regions; seven of them corresponded to those identified in previous studies. The only difference occurred in the northwestern mountainous part of Slovenia. The chain approach led to similar results, although it resulted in a huge functional urban region of the capital Ljubljana. Conclusions: The results show that the Walktrap algorithm calculates regions that are more closed, where more workers find work in the home region, than the chain approach.

AB  - Released in 2009, the "Minha Casa Minha Vida" Program has been boosted the Brazilian housing production and changes the cities landscape, mainly in peripheral areas where the housing estates or complex of housing estates have been constructed. The urban landscapes analyses reflect the multiples interests and actors (in different scales) and in these housing estate developments are possible understand the relationship between global and national actors and local characteristics with its daily dynamic production of space. This paper aims analyses the post-occupation changes in housing estates from "Minha Casa Minha Vida" Program, highlighting the antagonistic and complementary movement between local and global scales in the structuring of landscape. With this purpose, it was selected five housing estates in Araraquara to developing the research. Supported by basic bibliography, landscape observation and fieldwork, it was possible to verify the space deep changes, what show great social demands in the se housing estates, but show dreams and hopes of its habitants as well.

AB  - In an increasingly interconnected world, the exposure and subsequent spread of emergent viruses has become inevitable. This is particularly true forAedes(Ae.) mosquito-vectored viruses, whose range has increased over the past decade from tropical to temperate regions. However, it is unclear if all populations ofAe.mosquitoes in temperate New York City are able to successfully replicate and transmit arboviruses. To answer this question, we rearedAe. albopictusmosquitoes living in a temperate climate from three locations in New York City. We first sequenced the salivary antiviral protein D7 from individual mosquitoes in each population and found single nucleotide variants that are both shared and unique for eachAe. albopictuspopulation. We then fed each population chikungunya virus (CHIKV) via an artificial blood meal. All three mosquito populations could be infected with CHIKV, yet viral titers differed between populations at 7 days post infection. Moreover, we found that these mosquitoes could transmit CHIKV to mice, and that virus RNA reached the saliva as early as two days post infection. Upon sequencing of the saliva CHIKV genomic RNA, we found mutations at sites correlated with increased transmission and virulence. These studies show that NYCAe. albopictuspopulations can be infected with and transmit CHIKV, CHIKV is able to evolve in these mosquitoes, and that host salivary factors display population-specific diversity. Taken together, these studies highlight the need to study how distinct mosquito populations control viral infections, both at the virus and host level.

AB  - The work was dedicated to the topic of riding e-scooters in urban transport systems. These kind of new mobility solution is becoming more and more popular in the case of shared mobility operators and also the new social trend. It has been noticed by the authors that the appearance of a large number of e-scooters in urban traffic conditions, has caused many problems related to safety and legal issues. That problems occur in issues related to moving and park e-scooters on the streets, intersections as well as pavements. Because of that fact, the authors tried to indicate conditions for flowing movement of e-scooters in the city. The aim of the work was to present the concept of rules and recommendations for riding individual and shared e-scooters in the road network. In addition, the text also gives global examples of how e-scooters operate in urban transport systems.

AB  - Estimates about which scale insect species are most frequently encountered in U.S. landscapes and commercial production systems are largely anecdotal. This survey of records maintained across about 15 years within the National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN) National Data Repository (NDR) returned information from 10,671 records of 192 scale insect species and 23 suspected species that were associated with ornamental plants. This broad species diversity challenges our ability to effectively train diagnosticians, can confound species identification accuracy, and impedes outreach efforts and resource development. To help focus future efforts in the development of outreach resources and diagnostic training guides, lists were assembled that identified the 60 top-ranked soft, armored, mealybug, and other scale insect taxa most frequently diagnosed within NDR records. Diagnostic service records from Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee provided more extensive information regarding sites or client types from which submitted samples originated. Results are being used to develop web-based, image-rich guides to key scale insect taxa in the southeastern United States that will explain life cycles, behaviors, and biology for pest species. These web-based guides can be exploited to optimize pest management actions.

AB  - Research on the possible benefits of green infrastructure as a hazard mitigation strategy has been limited by the lack of effective tools for the identification and measurement of the specific dimensions of green infrastructure particularly within highly developed urban environments. Consequently, there has been little empirical research conducted on the potential benefits of green infrastructure for reducing streamflow, an indicator of runoff and potential flooding mitigation. This study seeks to further research green infrastructure as a potential tool for hazard mitigation by examining its consequences for streamflow over a 2-year period in 2004 and 2010 for two key urban areas subject to flooding in Texas, USA (Austin and Houston Metropolitan areas) in panel models to assess the effectiveness of green infrastructure for reducing runoff as assessed by using streamflow gage data predicting annual peak flow. The statistical models suggested that green infrastructure contributes to reduce annual peak flow in urbanized watersheds. The effect in the fixed effects model suggests that with every percent increase in green infrastructure within the 100-year floodplain, peak annual flow decreased by 7.7% (R-2 = 0.6985). The effects of green infrastructure outside the floodplain appeared to be significant, and its magnitude in the fixed effects model was - 7.1% (R-2 = 0.6447). These differences suggest slightly greater consequences for preserving green infrastructure within floodplains when it comes to peak annual flows. Moreover, the analyses explained that green infrastructure in Austin appears to be more effective on peak annual flow when, compared to Houston, suggesting that green infrastructure has elevated consequences in areas with greater topographical diversity. The effectiveness of green infrastructure in critical places will help make a guideline for the balanced urban development with implementation of green infrastructure.

AB  - Urbanization has been and will continue to be the mainstream trend of global population movement, including China. Depression is the most common mental disorders and the leading factor of disabilities. However, the impacts of urbanization on the depression occurrence are still unclear. This paper analyzed the data from 3 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) with sample size as 8510 adults representing the middle aged and elderly group in China. Depression was identified and measured by the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10). Urbanization level was measured by population density, GDP per capita and secondary/tertiary industry as percentage to GDP in the China City Statistical Yearbook. The fixed effect regression model was used to explore the association between the changes of urbanization and depression. As result, depression is closely related to the urbanization, protective effects are found for 3 indicators above: The depression prevalence decreases while urbanization level increases (from lowest urbanization level to the highest: P < 0.01). Among the 10 depression symptoms, "Bothered", "Reduced energy leading to diminished activity" and "Hopelessness" are the most significantly improved with urbanization. The impact of urbanization on residents' mental health is a long-term, multi-factor interaction. Therefore we need to fully consider all possible influencing factors, and longer follow-up study to verify.

AB  - Visual pollution (VP) in the form of outdoor advertisements (OA) is a threat to landscape physiognomy. Despite their proven usefulness in landscape aesthetic studies, landscape metrics have not yet been applied to address the phenomenon of VP. To fill this knowledge gap, a methodological framework for the measurement of VP using tangential view landscape metrics is proposed, which is accompanied by statistically significant proofs. Raster products derived from aerial laser scanning data were used to characterize two study areas with different topographic conditions in the city of Lublin, East Poland. The visibility of the cityscape in motion was simulated through viewshed measurements taken at equal intervals in the forwards and backwards directions along pedestrian walkways. The scrutinized tangential view landscape metrics (visible area, maximum visible distance, skyline, Shannon depth, view depth line) was the object of a two-fold interpretation wherein the spatial occurrence of VP as well as its impacts on the visual landscape character (VLC) were examined. The visible area metrics were found to be highly sensitive VP indicators. The maximum visible distance metrics provided evidence for the destructive effect of OA on view corridors. The Shannon depth and depth line metrics were not found to be statistically significant indicators of VP. Results from directional viewshed modelling indicate that distortion in the analyzed cityscape physiognomy depends on the view direction. The findings allow for particular recommendations with practical implementations in land use planning, which are discussed along with limitations to our proposed methods.

AB  - The "right to housing" is provided for the Constitutional Charter as a social right of the Brazilian people. However, as the law does not create reality, understanding the relations of the space production is fundamental for the analysis of the conditions for realizing rights. In the absence or limitation of housing policies and the impossibility of access to housing by the market, social movements of "struggle for housing" promote occupations of buildings and land in order to guarantee the right to housing, while also problematizing private property. The Social Function of Urban Property, in this context, emerges as a legal-political category in dispute in the field of contradictions between the guarantee of property and the Right to the City. The objective of the work was to understand how the social function is signified in the discourses and practices of these collective subjects. The National Movement for Struggle for Housing (MNLM) and the Union for Popular Housing of Parana (UMP-PR) in Curitiba, Brazil were analysed. It was observed that social movements unfold the "struggle for housing" in different collective actions and heterogeneous discourses in the dispute for housing provision and for the right to the city, with social function being one of the categories that emerges notably in the mediations between the State and the legal field.

TI  - Eight years of homicide evolution in Monterrey, Mexico: a network approach
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
KW  - SOCIAL NETWORKS
AB  - Homicide is without doubt one of Mexico's most important security problems, with data showing that this dismal kind of violence sky-rocketed shortly after the war on drugs was declared in 2007. Since then, violent war-like zones have appeared and disappeared throughout Mexico, causing unfathomable human, social and economic losses. One of the most emblematic of these zones is the Monterrey metropolitan area (MMA), a central scenario in the narco-war. Being an important metropolitan area in Mexico and a business hub, MMA has counted hundreds to thousands of casualties. In spite of several approaches being developed to understand and analyze crime in general, and homicide in particular, the lack of accurate spatio-temporal homicide data results in incomplete descriptions. In order to describe the manner in which violence has evolved and spread in time and space through the city, here we propose a network-based approach. For this purpose, we define a homicide network where nodes are geographical entities that are connected through spatial and temporal relationships. We analyzed the time series of homicides in different municipalities and neighborhoods of the MMA, to observe whether or not a global correlation appeared. We studied the spatial correlation between neighborhoods where homicides took place, to observe whether distance is a factor of influence in the frequency of homicides. We constructed yearly co-occurrence networks, by correlating neighborhoods with homicides happening within a same week, and counting the co-occurrences of these neighborhood pairs in 1 year. We also constructed a crime network by aggregating all data of homicides, eliminating the temporal correlation, in order to observe whether homicide clusters appeared, and what those clusters were distributed geographically. Finally, we correlated the location and frequency of homicides with roads, freeways and highways, to observe if a trend in the homicidal violence appeared. Our network approach in the homicide evolution of MMA allows us to identify that (1) analyzing the whole 86-month period, we observed a correlation between close cities, which decreases in distant places. (2) at neighborhood level, correlations are not distance-dependent, on the contrary, highest co-occurrences appeared between distant neighborhoods and a polygon formed by close neighborhoods in downtown Monterrey. Moreover, (3) An elevated number of homicides occur close to the 85th freeway, which connects MMA with the US border. (4) Some socioeconomic barriers determine the presence of homicide violence. Finally, (5) we show a relation between homicidal crime and the urban landscape by studying the distance of safe and violent neighborhoods to the closest highway and by studying the evolution of highway and crime distance over the cartel-related years and the following period. With this approach, we are able to describe the spatial and temporal evolution of homicidal crime in a metropolitan area.

AB  - Anthropogenic litter (i.e., trash, AL) on beaches has negative ecological and economic impacts. Beach AL is likely moved together with coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM, algae, leaves), but no previous studies have assessed AL and CPOM co-distribution. We measured AL and CPOM on four urban beaches in Chicago, Illinois, USA, along two transect types (pier-adjacent, non-pier adjacent) in which each has three habitats (upland, beach, strand line). As expected, AL and CPOM density were positively related across all transects. AL and CPOM were significantly higher adjacent to piers, and variable among habitats. Wood, leaves, and smoking-related AL were most abundant in beach and upland zones while glass and algal detritus were abundant at the strandline. Overall, AL and CPOM show 'patchy' distribution attributed to wind and wave movement toward accumulation sites. Beach CPOM is a hot spot of biological activity (e.g., microbes, invertebrates, birds). Therefore, mixing of AL and CPOM suggests organisms may be more likely to encounter AL in mixed accumulations. Efforts to reduce the abundance and biological impacts of beach AL will benefit from emphasizing organic matter accumulation sites.

AB  - Extreme haze was often observed at many locations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region within several hours when they occurred, which is referred to as extreme co-movements and extreme dependence in statistics. This article applies tail quotient correlation coefficient to explore the temporal and spatial extreme dependence patterns of haze in this region. Hourly PM2.5 station-level data during 2014-2018 are used, and the results show that the tail quotient correlation coefficient between stations increases with month. Specifically, the simultaneous extreme dependence was strong in the fourth season, while the haze was severe. In the first season, while the haze was also severe, the extreme hazes only show strong co-movements with a time difference. These observations lead to the study of two special scenarios, that is, the concurrence/extreme dependence of the worst extreme haze and its lag effects. City clusters suffering simultaneous extreme haze or with certain time difference as well as the most frequently co-movement cities are identified. The extreme co-movements of these cities and the reasons for their occurrences have strong implications for improving the PM2.5 joint prevention and control in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The importance of lag effects is also reflected in the precedence order of the extreme haze's appearance. It is especially useful when setting the mechanism of the early warning system which can be triggered by the first appearance of extreme haze. The precedence orders also avail in investigating the transmission path of the haze, based on which more precise meteorological models can be made to benefit the haze forecasting of the region.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneity is an important aspect to be studied in infectious disease models. It takes two forms: one is local, namely diffusion in space, and other is related to travel. With the advancement of transportation system, it is possible for diseases to move from one place to an entirely separate place very quickly. In a developing country like India, the mass movement of large numbers of individuals creates the possibility of spread of common infectious diseases. This has led to the study of infectious disease model to describe the infection during transport. An SIRS-type epidemic model is formulated to illustrate the dynamics of such infectious disease propagation between two cities due to population dispersal. The most important threshold parameter, namely the basic reproduction number, is derived, and the possibility of existence of backward bifurcation is examined, as the existence of backward bifurcation is very unsettling for disease control and it is vital to know from modeling analysis when it can occur. It is shown that dispersal of populations would make the disease control difficult in comparison with nondispersal case. Optimal vaccination and treatment controls are determined. Further to find the best cost-effective strategy, cost-effectiveness analysis is also performed. Though it is not a case study, simulation work suggests that the proposed model can also be used in studying the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, 2003.

AB  - The human effect on air quality in cities and the evolution of air pollution is obvious, due to economic activity, vehicle traffic, etc. The situation created indirectly by COVID-19, has caused many countries to impose during certain periods restriction of movement and stoppage of economic activities, which has allowed us to observe the instant effect that occurs on the air quality in cities. This article discusses what the observed effect has been, focusing on the early moments of the pandemic (January 2020 to March 2020), with an analysis of the situation from its origin in China to its arrival in Europe and more specifically the situation created in Spain. After the analysis of the situation, it can be seen the large reduction of pollutants in the air of different cities, and in particular in Spain, which came to reduce about 80%. All this leads us to the observation of how human activity can greatly influence air pollution.

AB  - To date, there is no effective treatment to cure dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease which has a major impact on human populations in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Although the characteristics of dengue infection are well known, factors associated with landscape are highly scale dependent in time and space, and therefore difficult to monitor. We propose here a mapping review based on 78 articles that study the relationships between landscape factors and urban dengue cases considering household, neighborhood and administrative levels. Landscape factors were retrieved from survey questionnaires, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and remote sensing (RS) techniques. We structured these into groups composed of land cover, land use, and housing type and characteristics, as well as subgroups referring to construction material, urban typology, and infrastructure level. We mapped the co-occurrence networks associated with these factors, and analyzed their relevance according to a three-valued interpretation (positive, negative, non significant). From a methodological perspective, coupling RS and GIS techniques with field surveys including entomological observations should be systematically considered, as none digital land use or land cover variables appears to be an univocal determinant of dengue occurrences. Remote sensing urban mapping is however of interest to provide a geographical frame to distribute human population and movement in relation to their activities in the city, and as spatialized input variables for epidemiological and entomological models.

AB  - Predictions of suitable habitat areas within a specific region can provide important information to assist in the management of invasive plants. Here, we predict the current and future potential distribution ofSolidago altissima(tall goldenrod) in South Korea using climatic and topographic variables and anthropogenic activities. We adopt four single models (the generalized linear model, generalized additive model, random forest, and an artificial neural network) and a weighted ensemble model for the projection based on 515 field survey points. The results showed that suitable areas forS. altissimawere mainly concentrated in the southwest regions of South Korea, where temperatures are higher than in other regions, especially in the winter season. Solar radiation and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) were also positively associated with the occurrence ofS. altissima. Anthropogenic effects and distances from rivers were found to be relatively less important variables. Based on six selected explanatory variables, suitable habitat areas forS. altissimahave expanded remarkably with climate changes. This range expansion is likely to be stronger northward in west coastal areas. For the SSP585 scenario, our model predicted that suitable habitat areas increased from 16,255 km(2)(16.2% of South Korea) to 44,551 km(2)(44.4%) approximately over the past thirty years. Our results show thatS. altissimais highly likely to expand into non-forest areas such as roadsides, waterfront areas, and abandoned urban areas. We propose that, based on our projection maps,S. altissimashould be removed from its current margin areas first rather than from old central population areas.

AB  - Simple Summary
   We determined the genetic variability, population structure, and influence of genetic factors on two parameters of fitness (body mass and reproductive ability) in roe deer females in the contact zone between the Alps and the Dinaric Mountains by utilizing microsatellite variations in 214 individuals collected throughout Slovenia, Central Europe. Spatial differences in the genetic diversity of the species can be explained by population history, different approaches to population management and/or different connectivity among subpopulations. The population genetic structure confirms the high side fidelity of roe deer, but also shows the existence of admixtures of genes among different areas. We found evidence that genetic factors, including individual heterozygosity, influence body mass, confirming that heterozygosity positively affects fitness in wild populations. However, as the effect of genetic factors is usually masked or overruled by the influence of environmental factors, i.e., availability of resources, data on the joint influence of external and intrinsic factors on fitness and other life-history traits are needed to better predict the population dynamics of targeted species, which would enable sustainable, science-based population management.
   Across its pan-European distribution, the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) faces a wide diversity of environmental and climatic conditions; therefore, several factors, including intrinsic ones, shape life-history traits and cause significant variability in parameters of fitness. By utilizing microsatellite variations in 214 roe deer females collected throughout Slovenia, Central Europe, we determined the genetic variability and population structure of this species in the contact zone between the Alps and the Dinaric Mountains, i.e., over a wider area where data on the genetic outlook for this-the most common and widespread European wild ungulate-have been completely lacking so far. Throughout the country, we found moderate microsatellite diversity (Ho = 0.57-0.65) in relation to the observed heterozygosity reported for other roe deer populations in Europe. Spatial differences in genetic diversity of the species in Slovenia can be explained by population history linked to varying approaches to population management and/or different connectivity among subpopulations in topographically differentiated habitats. A country-wide pattern of genetic structure is clearly defined by separation of the populations into three groups present in the following regions: (i) Southern sub-Mediterranean and Karst regions, (ii) Central Slovenia, and (iii) the Sub-Pannonian Region in the north-east. This is also confirmed by evidencing a moderate isolation by distance, especially by separating southern samples (coastal Slovenia) from others. Levels of genetic differentiation vary among populations, which can be explained by the effect of natural geographical barriers or the presence of anthropogenic barriers such as urban areas and highways. In the subset of 172 yearling females, we analyzed the influence of genetic advantage (individual heterozygosity) and other genetic data (reflected in the structuring of the population) on body mass and reproductive ability. We found evidence that genetic factors influence the body mass of roe deer yearling females (explaining altogether 18.
   8% of body mass variance), and the level of individual heterozygosity alone also positively affected body mass, which is in accordance with the theory that heterozygosity is commonly positively correlated with fitness in wild populations. However, we did not uncover any effect of heterozygosity on two parameters of reproductive ability (fertility and potential reproductive outcome), indicating that several other factors, especially environmental ones, have a predominant effect on the parameters of fitness in roe deer.

AB  - The sustainable delivery of ecosystem services relies on the functional traits that underpin ecosystem service production. Organisms that share functional traits can be grouped together, simplifying questions of management and providing insights into the external drivers that impact ecosystem service provision. Linkages between the functional traits of organisms and provisioning and regulating ecosystem services are well established, but the traits that underpin the benefits derived from cultural ecosystem services are not. To this end we interviewed 401 socio-economically diverse local ecosystem users in South Africa, selected using a mixture of convenience and purposive sampling, to elucidate peoples' perceptions of the traits associated with bird species. Subsequently, we used cluster analysis to examine whether these traits could provide a consistent typology of cultural functional groups. We identified six major cultural functional groups based on scores assigned to bird species: Visual Traits; Negative Visual and Behavioural Traits; Movement and Ecological Traits; Place Association and Abundance Indicators; Common Traits; and Behavioural Traits. Significantly higher scores were assigned to birds with interesting movement and ecology, whereas bird species with perceived negative visual or behavioural traits scored poorly. We additionally show that there are potential synergies between positively perceived cultural functions and ecological functions. Grounding cultural functional traits in a broader typology of functional groups makes components of ecological complexity more interpretable and may be used to predict how the loss of functional traits within a system will impact cultural benefits experienced by local ecosystem users.

AB  - Understanding environmental factors driving ecological processes of archaeal communities in heavily contaminated rivers is crucial for improvements in river ecological monitoring and indication. However, succession mechanisms underlying vertical and horizontal archaeal community assemblages in contaminated rivers remains largely unstudied. Here, to investigate ecological processes controlling archaeal community succession in a contaminated urban river, multivariate statistics approaches were applied to fields samples collected from locations representing vertical and horizontal assemblages of archaeal community. Our results revealed that archaeal community in the river showed distinct vertical and horizontal distribution patterns and the differences between water and sediment samples were most significant. Beta-diversity patterns in the vertical and horizontal assemblages are both almost completely caused by species replacement between sampling points (horizontal beta(SIM) = 0.60 +/- 0.09, beta(NES) = 0.09 +/- 0.05; vertical beta(SIM) = 0.40 +/- 0.07, beta(NES) = 0.10 +/- 0.06). Considering phylogenetic turnover deviation, homogenizing dispersal was the most crucial process dominating archaeal community assemblages in water samples while main ecological process in sediment samples was variable selection. Ewyarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota were found to prefer high-nutrients and low-nutrients environments, respectively. Analysis of environmental drivers of archaeal phyla distribution and community assemblages indicated that nutrients played a decisive role in driving the sediment archaeal community. Dissolved oxygen (DO) explained the most variation in phylogenetic turnover deviation within all water archaeal community while oxidation reduction potential (ORP) contributed most for horizontal sediment archaeal community assemblages. These findings help to indicate the pollution situation of the river and provide information to predict how archaeal communities would respond to different environmental variations.

AB  - Marine species live out-of-sight, consequently geographic range, population size and long-term trends are extremely difficult to characterise for accurate conservation status assessments. Detection challenges have precluded listing of marine bony fishes as Extinct on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, until now (March 2020). Our data compilation on handfishes (Family Brachionichthyidae) revealed them as the most threatened marine bony fish family, with 7 of 14 species recently listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered. The family also includes the only exclusively marine bony fish to be recognised as Extinct - the Smooth handfish (Sympterichthys unipennis). Ironically, some of the characteristics that threaten handfishes with extinction have assisted assessments. Poor dispersal capabilities leading to small, fragmented populations allow monitoring and population size estimation for some shallow water species. Evidence that the Smooth handfish is now Extinct included no sightings over 200 years in an area subject to numerous scientific surveys, inferred shallow habitat and moderate abundance at time of original collection, and major habitat transformation through fishing, aquaculture, rising sea temperature, and urban development. Contemporary threats to extant handfish species include habitat degradation, introduced species, loss of spawning substrate, climate change, and demographic risks associated with small, fragmented populations. Multifaceted conservation efforts are needed, including addressing threats to habitat quality, bolstering wild population numbers, and implementing novel techniques to find and monitor populations. Expanded monitoring, including application of eDNA methods, represent critical steps towards overcoming the challenges in studying wild populations of rare marine species. Ongoing investigation will likely reveal numerous other threatened species for which little is known.

AB  - Human activities have largely modified nitrogen (N) sources supply, cycling and export from land to ocean. Nitrification and denitrification are vital processes alleviating N pollution in aquatic ecosystems but the diverse responses and niche of microbial N retention to human disturbance are still understudied. Here we investigated the changes in N species and functional genes in the urban, agriculture and reservoir river sections of the Jiulong River (southeast China). Our results show that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (Nitrosomonas) were dominant in the urban river section receiving ammonium-rich sewage that enhanced nitrification and subsequent denitrification, while ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) was more abundant than AOB in the river section flowing through areas of pomelo (Citrus maxima) agriculture with low pH, low ammonium and very high nitrate input. Warm temperatures and large total suspended matter (TSM) in the wet season promoted growth of nitrifiers and denitrifiers, which were mostly particle-attached. The potential river N retention through gaseous N removal (PRN2O and PRN2) in the agriculture section with huge N loading was among the lowest. Strong nitrification and denitrification were suspected to occur in the agricultural acid soil system rather than in the river network. In addition, the decreased TSM and N concentration promoted free-living microbes in the reservoir. The highest PRN2 and N-2 production observed in the reservoir in the dry season implied that denitrification and anammox occurring in sediments was likely to increase N retention. This study suggests the diverse factors involved in processing of N pollution among diverse landscapes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - While abrupt regime shifts between different metastable states have occurred in natural systems from many areas including ecology, biology, and climate, evidence for this phenomenon in transportation systems has been rarely observed so far. This limitation might be rooted in the fact that we lack methods to identify and analyze possible multiple states that could emerge at scales of the entire traffic network. Here, using percolation approaches, we observe such a metastable regime in traffic systems. In particular, we find multiple metastable network states, corresponding to varying levels of traffic performance, which recur over different days. Based on high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) datasets of urban traffic in the megacities of Beijing and Shanghai (each with over 50,000 road segments), we find evidence supporting the existence of tipping points sepa-rating three regimes: a global functional regime and a metastable hysteresis-like regime, followed by a global collapsed regime. We can determine the intrinsic critical points where the metastable hysteresis-like regime begins and ends and show that these critical points are very similar across different days. Our findings provide a better understanding of traffic resilience patterns and could be useful for designing early warning signals for traffic resilience management and, potentially, other complex systems.

AB  - The fragmentation of forests is a consequence of human activities that intensively change the natural landscapes. In Brazil, there is a long-standing legal framework for native vegetation protection, called Forest Code. The last update is from 2012. The revisions incorporated in this restructured code (Law No. 12,651/12) encompassed new rules, rights and obligations for adequate land use management of productive systems and for environmental conservation and protection. An example of a protective measure was the creation of a Legal Reserve inside the rural properties and Areas of Permanent Protection around the watercourses. This study explored the effects of implementing the new code on the spatial and temporal evolution of forest cover fragmentation since the legal changes were set up. In that context, the area, perimeter and shape (circularity index) of forest fragments, as well as the buffer strips along watercourses, were assessed from 2010 to 2016 within the municipality of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The assessment resorted to remote sensing techniques and visual inspection of orbital images. It was clear from the results that forest patches became more abundant but smaller, more dispersed and elongated, and that this route to fragmentation was hinged on a chaotic expansion of urban and agricultural areas. Important edge effects were anticipated from these results. The area numbers revealed that Ribeirao Preto was 7.95% covered with forest fragments in 2010, while this percentage rose to 8.03% in 2013 and reached 8.35% in 2016. Most of this increase occurred within a 30-meter wide buffer along the watercourses. This was a positive outcome. However, the numbers also revealed that forested areas smaller than 51 hectares increased from 71% in 2010 to 73% in 2016. The conclusions were that implementation of Law No. 12,651/12 is leading to an increase of forestland, but not yet promoting sustainability, namely through improved connectivity among fragments for reduction of edge effects and provision ecosystem services.

AB  - When, where and how people move is a fundamental part of how human societies organize around every-day needs as well as how people adapt to risks, such as economic scarcity or instability, and natural disasters. Our ability to characterize and predict the diversity of human mobility patterns has been greatly expanded by the availability of Call Detail Records (CDR) from mobile phone cellular networks. The size and richness of these datasets is at the same time a blessing and a curse: while there is great opportunity to extract useful information from these datasets, it remains a challenge to do so in a meaningful way. In particular, human mobility is multiscale, meaning a diversity of patterns of mobility occur simultaneously, which vary according to timing, magnitude and spatial extent. To identify and characterize the main spatio-temporal scales and patterns of human mobility we examined CDR data from the Orange mobile network in Senegal using a new form of spectral graph wavelets, an approach from manifold learning. This unsupervised analysis reduces the dimensionality of the data to reveal seasonal changes in human mobility, as well as mobility patterns associated with large-scale but short-term religious events. The novel insight into human mobility patterns afforded by manifold learning methods like spectral graph wavelets have clear applications for urban planning, infrastructure design as well as hazard risk management, especially as climate change alters the biophysical landscape on which people work and live, leading to new patterns of human migration around the world.

AB  - Hiptage lushuiensis, a new species from the Hengduan Mountains, northwestern Yunnan Province, China, is described and illustrated here. This species was found growing at the margin of an open forest in the Nujiang Gorge of Lushui City. Hiptage lushuiensis is distinctive for its pink petals, 2 or more calyx glands, and large and pink samara with white hairs. This species is isolated in the deep gorge (25 degrees 51 ' N, 98 degrees 51 ' E, altitude 917 m), at the northern edge distribution range of the genus. These distinctive morphological differences and the geographic isolation suggest a history of long-distance dispersal and allopatric speciation. Hiptage lushuiensis has a shorter filament but larger herkogamy than related species, suggesting that H. lushuiensis may have adapted to other pollinators with short but fat body such as Amegilla or Bombus spp.

AB  - Video analytics is the automatic understanding of complex events occurring in a captured scene, by artificial intelligence. It is a fundamental task for homeland security and crime prevention. Some video analytics tasks are being addressed by at the edge processing approach, which combines algorithmic with hardware development, within the camera system design. The at the edge processing approach looks for real-time performance on specific domains and low network bandwidth requirements. However, it implies that the already installed city-camera-network should be replaced and continuously updated since it introduces constraints to analytics capabilities related to cameras' characteristics and functionalities. Thus, city surveillance by the at the edge processing approach requires a large budget, and continuous investment, to keep the system working. In this paper, we present both faced challenges and obtained achievements during the design process of video-analytics-system software architecture. Interoperability, availability, and security were the prioritized quality attributes by the Quality Attribute Workshop method. A microservices and cloud-based design was the result of applying the Attribute Driven Design method, incorporating software engineering sustainability concerns. As a practical advantage, the designed system can work with the already installed city surveillance camera network and allows incorporating video analytics algorithms as the surveillance system evolves. The evaluation combined the functional and operative prototype as well as the ATAM method, according to which approach is more suited to evaluate a specific driver. The discussion on findings of design an evaluation processes is a takeaway for the reader.

AB  - Urbanization and urban lifestyle are progressively diminishing individuals' opportunity (e.g., nature exposure) to experience and orientation (affinity) towards nature, ultimately reducing people's experiences of nature. This process has been described as the 'extinction of experience' (EoE), and it was suggested that it can alter the way people benefit from, interact with, learn about, emotionally connect with and commit to protect the natural world. The EoE is underpinned by interconnected relations between the drivers, nature experiences and outcomes, yet to date most research have focused on bilateral relations (e.g. between opportunity and well-being). Here we adopt a holistic approach to jointly explore the network of relationships suggested by the EoE theory. We conducted a survey of 523 inhabitants of a large metropolis, Tel Aviv, Israel, living in neighborhoods varying in nature intensity levels, and explored their orientation, health, well-being, environmental attitudes and conservation behaviors. Using a structural equation model, we empirically demonstrated the validity of the theoretical model of the EoE, but also showed more complex relationships. For instance, opportunity to experience urban nature was only related to health and well-being benefits, while orientation towards nature was related to well-being, conservation attitudes and behaviors in different contexts. Thus, providing opportunities to experience nature seems to be less sufficient than strengthening people's orientation to avert the EoE, as the latter can simultaneously enhance nature experiences, conservation behaviors and provide social benefits. This knowledge is pivotal if we are to promote policies that achieve the behavioral changes needed to mitigate the biodiversity crisis.

AB  - Thousand cankers disease threatens Juglans nigra (Eastern Black Walnut) in urban and natural landscapes. Incidence and severity of thousand cankers disease is higher in the host's introduced range in the western United States. We hypothesized that these differences are driven partly by geographical variation in the host phytobiome due to its roles in host stress tolerance, nutrient acquisition, and defense. To evaluate the role of the phytobiome in mediating thousand cankers disease, we characterized the J. nigra phytobiome of diseased and healthy trees in portions of its native (Indiana and Tennessee) and introduced (Washington) ranges. Grafted clones present in each state and open-pollinated populations were sampled. DNA was extracted from soil and branch (caulosphere) tissues and internal transcribed spacer and 16s regions were sequenced for characterization of fungal and bacterial communities. We found that microbial communities in the caulosphere and soil differ between native and introduced ranges of J. nigra and harbor different mutualistic and pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, caulosphere microbial communities were more species rich and diverse in the native range of J. nigra, suggesting greater levels of functional redundancy and multifunctionality in the native-range phytobiome compared with the introduced range. We also found higher network complexity in the caulosphere of trees in the introduced range and evidence for two alternative stable community states associated with diseased and healthy trees. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that geographical variation in thousand cankers risease incidence and severity is partially driven by differences in the phytobiome of J. nigra in its introduced and native ranges.

AB  - Aquatic bacterial communities play crucial roles in the circulation of nutrients in watershed ecosystems. However, the interaction between bacterial communities and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in freshwater ecosystems has not been studied in depth. In our study, we examined the constitution and interactions of CDOM with the bacterial community in Lake Chaohu and its inflow rivers under the influence of different exogenous pollutants. The results revealed that the bacterial community diversity in the inflow rivers was significantly lower than that in the lake sites. Clustering of different types of polluted inflow rivers integrated with the most abundant genera observed in specific areas indicated that environmentally guided species selection had a large impact on the composition of aquatic bacterial communities. Moreover, our study suggests that communities in lake environments may be more susceptible to interference through a variety of physiologies or via functional redundancy, allowing them to preserve their community structure. Through linear discriminant analysis effect size (Lefse) methods, we revealed that some taxa (from phylum to genus) were consistently enriched in the lake sites. Based on correlation network analysis results, the supersession niches of bacterial community members related to different CDOM in the biogeochemical process was determined. This study provides an ecological basis for the control of external pollution and the protection of the water environment in watershed ecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several reptiles and amphibians frequently occur in environments exposed to artificial lights and appear to effectively hunt prey animals attracted to the light. Therefore, it would be beneficial for them to use such a habitat to survive in urban areas. In this paper, we examined site fidelity of a nocturnal gecko, Gekko japonicus, to a particular artificial light environment in the field. We observed short-term dependence on the same light environment by individual geckos for four to nine consecutive nights and also examined long-term site fidelity once every 10 days from March to November. The same individual frequently came to the particular light for several consecutive nights, but day and time of appearance varied among individuals. Over several months, 20% of marked individuals were repeatedly sighted at the same place although the number of their re-sightings was low (1-5 times). These results suggest that each G. japonicus may settle down in a certain artificially lit environment and use it repeatedly, but the dependence on lights not be so strong.

AB  - This article reports on a study of the Waterloo public housing estate in Sydney, Australia. In 2015, the state government announced the inner-city estate would be redeveloped to accommodate some affordable/social dwellings (30%) but with the majority of new dwellings being private market housing (70%). Based on ethnographic research conducted with residents of Waterloo between 2010 and 2017, we analyze the Waterloo redevelopment as an example of emplaced displacement. We draw on the work of geographer Doreen Massey and legal scholar Sarah Keenan to understand place as more than physical space, allowing us to conceptualize displacement as something more than simply the movement of people from one physical place to another. We bring to the fore the subjective experience of place, as articulated by public housing tenants, demonstrating that although they remain physically in place, the threat of eviction posed by the redevelopment significantly alters tenants' spatial, sociocultural, and temporal relationship to place (i.e., the spaces tenants carry with them). The concept of embodied displacement seeks to capture the spatiotemporal diversity of low-income public renters' experiences of loss of place.

AB  - The city of Naples (Campanian region, Southern Italy) has been hit by the strongest earthquakes located inside the seismogenic areas of the Southern Apennines, as well as by the volcano-tectonic earthquakes of the surrounding areas of the Campi Flegrei, Ischia and Vesuvius volcanic districts. An analysis of the available seismic catalogues shows that in the last millennium, more than 100 earthquakes have struck Naples with intensities rating I to III on the Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg (MCS) scale over the felt level. Ten of these events have exceeded the damage level, with a few of these possessing an intensity greater than VII MCS. The catastrophic earthquakes of 1456 (I-0 = XI MCS), 1688 (I-0 = XI MCS) and 1805 (I-0 = X MCS) occurred in the Campania-Molise Apennines chain, produced devastating effects on the urban heritage of the city of Naples, reaching levels of damage equal to VIII MCS. In the 20th century, the city of Naples was hit by three strong earthquakes in 1930 (I-0 = X MCS), 1962 (I-0 = IX MCS) and 1980 (I-0 = X MCS), all with epicenters in the Campania and Basilicata regions. The last one is still deeply engraved in the collective memory, having led to the deaths of nearly 3000 individuals and resulted in the near-total destruction of some Apennine villages. Moreover, the city of Naples has also been hit by ancient historical earthquakes that originated in the Campanian volcanic districts of Campi Flegrei, Vesuvio and Ischia, with intensities up to VII-VIII MCS (highest in the Vesuvian area). Based on the intensity and frequency of its past earthquakes, the city of Naples is currently classified in the second seismic category, meaning that it is characterized by "seismicity of medium energy". In this paper, we determine the level of damage suffered by Naples and its monuments as a result of the strongest earthquakes that have hit the city throughout history, highlighting its repetitiveness in some areas. To this aim, we reconstructed the seismic history of some of the most representative urban monuments, using documentary and historical sources data related to the effects of strong earthquakes of the Southern Apennines on the city of Naples. The ultimate purpose of this study is to perform a seismic macro-zoning of the ancient center of city and reduce seismic risk. Our contribution represents an original elaboration on the existing literature by creating a damage-density map of the strongest earthquakes and highlighting, for the first time, the areas of the city of Naples that are most vulnerable to strong earthquakes in the future. These data could be of fundamental importance to the construction of detailed maps of seismic microzones. Our study contributes to the mitigation of seismic risk in the city of Naples, and provides useful advice that can be used to protect the historical heritage of Naples, whose historical center is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

AB  - In this paper, the novel study of the multilayered network model for the disrupted infrastructure of the 5G mobile network is introduced. The aim of this study is to present the new way of incorporating different types of networks, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET), and DRONET Networks into one fully functional multilayered network. The proposed multilayered network model also presents the resilient way to deal with infrastructure disruption due to different reasons, such as disaster scenarios or malicious actions. In the near future, new network technologies of 5G networks and the phenomenon known as the Internet of Things (IoT) will empower the functionality of different types of networks and interconnects them into one complex network. The proposed concept is oriented on resilient, smart city applications such as public safety and health and it is able to provide critical communication when fixed network infrastructure is destroyed by deploying smart sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles. The provided simulations shows that the proposed multilayered network concept is able to perform better than traditional WSN network in term of delivery time, average number of hops and data rate speed, when disruption scenario occurs.

AB  - The article discusses the architectural and landscape organization of the district of energy-efficient houses Norra Djurgardsstaden in Stockholm. Since the end of the 19th century, the Norra Djurgardsstaden district, with an area of more than 2 thousand hectares, has been part of the industrial area of the Royal Seaport. At the beginning of the 21st century, it was decided to modernize this area and destroy previous industries. Construction began in 2011 as part of the Living City strategy, which envisaged a balanced integrated design and construction of housing, trade, offices, services and public places. The strategy of resource management and responsibility for the climate meant that the city should develop in the direction of a resource-efficient and non-toxic future free of fossil fuels. Using the energy characteristics of buildings, monitoring the amount and recycling of construction and household waste, as well as soil restoration, has significantly reduced the impact on the environment. It was revealed that the architectural and landscape organization, based on the principles of individualization of "spaces of movement" and "spaces of being", ensured maximum contact with nature, conservation of biodiversity, ecological, visual and social value of streets and courtyards.

AB  - Climate change and invasive species threaten biodiversity, yet rigorous monitoring of their impact can be costly. Citizen science is increasingly used as a tool for monitoring exotic species, because citizens are geographically and temporally dispersed, whereas scientists tend to cluster in museums and at universities. Here we report on the establishment of the first exotic ant taxon (Tetramorium immigrans) in Denmark, which was discovered by children participating in The Ant Hunt. The Ant Hunt is a citizen science project for children that we ran in 2017 and 2018, with a pilot study in 2015. T. immigrans was discovered in the Botanical Garden of the Natural History Museum of Denmark in 2015 and confirmed as established in 2018. This finding extends the northern range boundary of T. immigrans by almost 460 km. Using climatic niche modelling, we compared the climatic niche of T. immigrans in Europe with that of T. caespitum based on confirmed observations from 2006 to 2019. T. immigrans and T. caespitum had a 13% niche overlap, with T. immigrans showing stronger occurrence in warmer and drier areas compared to T. caespitum. Mapping the environmental niches onto geographic space identified several, currently uninhabited, areas as climatically suitable for the establishment of T. immigrans. Tetramorium immigrans was sampled almost three times as often in areas with artificial surfaces compared to T. caespitum, suggesting that T. immigrans may not be native to all of Europe and is being accidentally introduced by humans. Overall, citizen scientists collected data on ants closer to cities and harbours than scientists did and had a stronger bias towards areas of human disturbance. This increased sampling effort in areas of likely introduction of exotic species naturally increases the likelihood of discovering species sooner, making citizen science an excellent tool for exotic species monitoring, as long as trained scientists are involved in the identification process.

AB  - It is of great significance to identify the driver's fatigue state in actual operation to improve the safety of urban railway transportation and prevent the occurrence of various safety accidents caused by driver's fatigue. Based on the train driving simulation experiment of urban railway transportation, electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and eye movement characteristics of subjects were obtained, and the collected data were analyzed. By analyzing the data, the fatigue degree of the subjects is judged, and the fatigue period is distinguished according to the time period of fatigue occurrence, and the indicators that can be used to construct support vector machine are selected in the obtained data. Finally, according to the theory of support vector machine, using MATLAB and libsvm software, select the appropriate kernel function, train the fatigue identification model of non-linear support vector machines (SVM), and verify the accuracy of the model with experimental data.

AB  - Little is known regarding the comparative source-sink relationships between primary mosquito breeding sites (source) and neighboring (sink) environments in heterogeneous landscapes. An exploration of those relationships may provide unique insights into the utility of open-space buffer zone mitigation strategies currently being considered by urban planners to reduce contact between mosquitoes and humans. We investigated the source sink relationships between a highly productive mosquito habitat and adjacent residential (developed) and rural (undeveloped) coastal environments. Our results suggest that source-sink relationships are unaffected by environment. This conclusion is supported by the high level of synchronicity in daily saltmarsh mosquito abundance observed among all surveyed environments (beta = 0.67-0.79, P < 0.001). This synchronicity occurred despite the uniqueness of each surveyed environment and the considerable distances of open water and land (2.2-2.6 km) between them. Trap catches, which we interpret as expected mosquito biting nuisance, were high in both residential and rural coastal landscapes (309.4 +/- 52.84 and 405.3 +/- 62.41 mosquitoes/day, respectively). These observations suggest that existing and planned open-space buffer zones will do little to reduce the biting burden caused by highly vagile saltmarsh mosquitoes. This strengthens the need for empirically informed planning guidelines that alert urban planners to the real risks of human residential encroachment on land that is close to highly vagile mosquito habitat.

AB  - This paper estimates the effects on rural education of the send-down movement during the Cultural Revolution, when about 16 million urban youth were mandated to resettle in the countryside. Using a county-level dataset compiled from local gazetteers and population censuses, we show that greater exposure to the sent-down youths significantly increased rural children's educational achievement. This positive effect diminished after the urban youth left the countryside in the late 1970s but never disappeared. Rural children who interacted with the sent-down youths were also more likely to pursue more-skilled occupations, marry later, and have smaller families than those who did not.

AB  - The role of allochthonous nutrient inputs in governing phytoplankton distribution and abundance were assessed from the estuarine regions of the Amba River, west coast of India. A total of 35 species belonging to 24 genera were recorded, where the diatom Coscinodiscus oculus-iridis (99%) dominated the estuarine mouth with a density of 3.5 x 10(5) cells 1(-1). Community analyses indicate that diversity (H') decreased towards the estuarine mouth (0.002 +/- 0.001) compared to the middle (0.38 +/- 0.06) and inner estuary (1.83 +/- 0.14) due to the diatom outbreak. Chlorophyll a reached an average of 12.51 mu g 1(-1) at the estuarine mouth, which is over three times the value determined in the middle estuary (4.25 mu g 1(-1)). The key sources of these land-based nutrients are identified as agricultural land and urban runoff for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), extensive sand mining for silica (Si) and aeolian deposition of iron minerals from industrial conveyor belts. A linear correlation between cell density and chlorophyll a with chemical variables indicated that silicate coupled with excess nitrogen input was crucial causative factors for the bloom. The nutrient enrichment towards the estuarine mouth is due to the dispersal of these land derived nutrients by complex hydrological forces. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Atmospheric bioaerosols, which contain a diverse group of various biological materials, also include pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, and fungal spores. The dispersal of various pathogens negatively impacts the human and ecosystem health. While the impact of pathogenic bacteria and viruses on human and ecosystem health is well documented, the impact of fungal spores on crop, however, is poorly characterized. An unprecedented increase in number of fungal and fungal-like diseases (emerging fungal diseases (EFDs)) in plants is threatening the food security and endangering the biodiversity. In present communication, we show an increasing trend in the fungal bioaerosol attacks on crops over India outstripping bacteria and viruses. We further argue about the complex interactions between the fungal species, and crop impact over India is unique and highly interconnected with the topography, meteorological variables, and season of the year. Under constantly warming scenario, the fungal attacks on plants are expected to rise and, in all likelihood, extend to the sensitive and fragile ecosystems like the Himalayan region and the Western Ghats. An increasing trend in EFDs calls for immediate coordinated efforts towards understanding the type and diversity of pathogenic fungal bioaerosols. There is, however, a lack over Indian region about biogeography of pathogenic fungi. The detailed biogeography would help in improving public and political awareness to formulate the effective policy decisions. Any further disregard and delay in recognizing the importance of EFDs to crop and sensitive ecosystems can have severe societal and ecological repercussions over Indian region.

AB  - Puszcza Zielonka Landscape Park (PZLP), located in western Poland is an area under the constant pressure of urbanization processes occurring in the zone of influence of the Poznan urban agglomeration. The park was established in 1993. The protected area is surrounded by built-up areas, which interrupt the continuity of wildlife corridors. The park and its buffer zone are located in six communes, which have their own spatial policies. The aim of the article was to determine changes in the trends, scale and rate of investments in the park and its buffer zone, expressed by changes in the land cover and use, which have taken place since the establishment of the park. These changes were considered important factors affecting the state of protected natural values and defining the effectiveness of protective instruments. The study included an analysis of the spatial policy of the communes expressed in Study of the Conditions and Directions of the Spatial Management (SCDSM) and its compliance with the Park protection trends indicated in the Protection Plan. The analyses were carried out with GIS tools. The results showed conflicts between the intended changes in land development expressed by local governments and the park protection objectives.

AB  - Background With the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART), pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) appears >= 10% amongst ART-initiators in many developing countries, including Cameroon. Northwest region-Cameroon having the second epidemiological burden of HIV infection, generating data on PDR in these geographical settings, will enhance evidence-based decision-making. Objectives We sought to ascertain levels of PDR and HIV-1 clade dispersal in rural and urban settings, and their potential association with subtype distribution and CD4-staging. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017 among patients recently diagnosed with HIV-infection and initiating ART at the Bamenda regional Hospital (urban setting) and the Mbingo Baptist hospital (rural setting). Protease and reverse transcriptase sequencing was performed using an in-house protocol and pre-treatment drug resistance mutations were interpreted using StanfordHIVdb.v8.3. Phylogeny was performed for subtype assignation. Results A total of 61 patient sequences were generated from ART initiators (median age: 37 years old; 57.4% female; median CD4 cell count: 184 [IQR: 35-387] in urban vs. 161 [IQR: 96-322] cells/mm(3)in rural). Overall, the level of PDR was 9.8% (6/61). Of note, burden of PDR was almost doubled in urban (12.9% [4/31]) compared to rural setting 6.7% (2/30),p= 0.352). Fifteen (15) PDR mutations were found among four patients the urban settings [6 resistance mutations to NRTIs:[M41L (2), E44D (1), K65R (1), K70E (1), M184V/I (2), K219R (1)] and 6 resistance mutations to NNRTIs: K103N (1), E138A/G (2), V179E (1), M230L (1), K238T (1), P225H (1)] against two (02) mutations found in two patients in the rural setting[2 resistant mutations to NNRTIs: E138A (1) and Y188H (1)]. The rural setting showed more genetic diversity (8 subtypes) than the urban setting (5 subtypes), with CRF02_AG being the most prevalent clade (72.1% [44/61]). Of note, level of PDR was similar between patients infected with CRF02_AG and non-CRF02_AG infected (9.1% [4/44]) vs. 11.8% [2/17]),p= 1.000). Moreover, PDR appeared higher in patients with CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm(3)compared to those with CD4 cell count >= 200 cells/mm(3)(14.7% [5/34]) vs. 3.7% [1/27]),p= 0.214). Conclusions PDR is at a moderate rate in the Northwest region of Cameroon, with higher burden within urban populations. CRF02_AG is the most predominant clade in both urban and rural settings. No effect of HIV molecular epidemiology and CD4-staging on the presence of PDR in patients living in these settings was found. Our findings suggest close monitoring, NNRTI-sparing regimens or sequencing for patients initiating ART, especially in urban settings.

AB  - U.S. cities prioritize the storage of automobiles over the safe movement of bicycles. While this generally occurs by allocating street curbs for car parking instead of bike lanes, the privileging of the automobile is even more evident in the case ofangledparking, in which cars sit roughly perpendicular to the flow of traffic. Such a layout takes up nearly double the space in the right of way as does parallel parking, which leaves even less room for bike lanes. Though angled parking is defended as a traffic-calming measure, numerous studies indicate that this layout is associated with higher rates of collisions than parallel parking. In addition, angled parking also inherently increases the number of cars that can be parked along a given curb, which incentivizes automobile travel generally. However, one challenge of understanding the impact that angled parking has on safety and bicycle infrastructure is that cities do not always maintain accurate records as to where angled parking occurs. For example, San Francisco, CA has ambitious air-quality, climate-mitigation, and active transportation goals, all of which are undermined by angled parking. Yet, its supply of this parking layout is unquantified, given that parking angle was omitted from the city's parking census. This study uses satellite imagery to resolve this data gap, and calculates that San Francisco dedicates 50 miles of street curbs to angled parking. While some assume angled parking is a planning response to San Francisco's famed hills, the majority of it occurs on streets with no incline at all. As to angled parking's traffic-calming effect, this benefit appears to be non-existent in San Francisco; average vehicle speeds differed by less than a half-mile per hour between angled-parking streets and adjacent non-angled streets. The angled parking identified here-particularly the four miles that overlap with the city's bike-lane network-represents opportunities for conversion to more balanced road layouts. Overall, this methodology can serve as the basis for identifying angled parking in other cities, a configuration that should be re-evaluated by transportation planners given its car-centric effects, debatable ability to calm traffic, and preclusion of separated bicycle facilities.

AB  - Family bonds and deviant peers constitute two important competing forces of socialization in migrants' social life. This study furthers the theory of family-peer relationship by arguing that migrants' social network homogeneity shapes the development of family bonds and peer deviance and is ultimately associated with increased likelihood of sexual risk behaviors. Applying regression techniques and structural equation modeling with bootstrapped estimates to survey data collected in 2011 among male Chinese migrant labors, this study found that 1) network homogeneity in terms of homeplace and occupation is associated with sexual risk behaviors, and 2) at least half portion of such association is significantly mediated by family bonds and peer deviance.

AB  - On 18 October 2019, after weeks of subway fare evasions in a protest for a fare increase, protesters occupied some stations of the Metropolitan Public Transport Network in Santiago, Chile's capital city. An explosive and surprising escalation of violence ensued later that night marking the beginning of an ongoing social crisis that extended to other regions of the country, and reshaped, probably permanently, the political landscape.
   It is not yet possible to provide a definitive account of events that are still unfolding. We do not aim (nor can) settle the debate, nor give an exhaustive account of all arguments in such a short text. Instead, we describe the main facts of the still ongoing social crisis and the context leading to this crisis, and suggest some explanations based on current body of research and on survey data fielded during the crisis.

AB  - The American White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) is a nomadic wading bird that is increasing the amount of time spent foraging in urban areas, relying on artificial wetlands and other anthropogenic resources year-round. In this study, we explore whether and how American White Ibis association with urban environments is predictive of variation in the timing and length of behavioral seasons. Other urbanized species exhibit altered annual cycles such as loss of migratory behavior and year-round breeding related to consistent resource abundance, often related to intentional and unintentional provisioning. To determine if these same patterns of behavior were also present in White Ibis, we used behavioral change point analysis to segment the tracks of 41 ibis equipped with GPS backpacks to identify the initiation and duration of four behavioral seasons (non-breeding, pre-breeding, breeding, post-breeding) the degree of urban association. We found that intraspecific variation in urban habitat use had strong carryover effects on the timing and duration of behavioral seasons. This study revealed ibis with higher use of urban habitats in non-breeding seasons had longer non-breeding seasons and shorter breeding seasons that began earlier in the year compared to ibis that primarily use wetland habitats. The timing and duration of seasons also varied with ibis age, such that ibis spent more time engaged in breeding-related seasons as they aged. Juvenile and subadult ibis, though considered to be reproductively immature, also exhibit behavioral shifts in relation to breeding seasons. The behavioral patterns found in this study provide evidence that ibis are adapting their annual cycles and seasonal behaviors to exploit urban resources. Future research is needed to identify the effect of interactions between ibis urban association and age on behavioral season expression.

AB  - Due to the increased emission of harmful exhaust components, in particular CO2 (carbon dioxide), CO (carbon monoxide), THC ( total hydrocarbons), by motor vehicles, especially in the centres of urban agglomerations, it is necessary to create traffic simulation models that allow to estimate the emissions from road transport. One of the places where the largest accumulation of vehicles in cities occurs are intersections. This contributes to increasing the number of stops and repetitions of the acceleration and braking cycle, which has a direct impact on vehicle emissions. At the same time, roundabouts are intersections with specific traffic movement characteristics, therefore it is necessary to calibrate the simulation model beforehand. The aim of the study was to develop a methodology for modeling vehicle traffic at the roundabout and compare the combustion engines emissions resulting from vehicle movement on the example of the selected roundabout case studies. Vehicle traffic modeling was performed in the Vissim traffic microsimulation program based on real data. The comparison concerned the emissions for a two-lane and a turbo roundabout for the assumed traffic volume scenarios for properly calibrated simulation models. The results show that the performance of the simulation allows for the analysis of emissions and determination of its size for each of the roundabout inlets. It is also possible to determine the general dependencies e.g. the length of the queue of vehicles in relation to the emission of the analysed exhaust components. The analysis can be used as an introduction to changes in the guides for designing road intersections concerning vehicle emissions.

AB  - As lockdowns and stay-at-home orders start to be lifted across the globe, governments are struggling to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies. In dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity, enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging, if not practically impossible. Governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading. Indeed, certain places, like some people, can be "super-spreaders". Is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs? Here, we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept of super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it. Our proposed data-analytic framework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport in Singapore. By constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics, we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations. Our results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that counterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore, but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center. It therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness.

AB  - The construction of ecological security pattern is one of the important ways to alleviate the contradiction between economic development and ecological protection, as well as the important contents of ecological civilization construction. How to scientifically construct the ecological security pattern of small-scale counties, and achieve sustainable economic development based on ecological environment protection, it has become an important proposition in regulating the ecological process effectively. Taking Fengxian County of China as an example, this paper selected the importance of ecosystem service functions and ecological sensitivity to evaluate the ecological importance and identify ecological sources. Furthermore, we constructed the ecological resistance surface by various landscape assignments and nighttime lighting modifications. Through a minimum cumulative resistance model, we obtained ecological corridors and finally constructed the ecological security pattern comprehensively combining with ecological resistance surface construction. Accordingly, we further clarified the specific control measures for ecological security barriers and regional functional zoning. This case study shows that the ecological security pattern is composed of ecological sources and corridors, where the former plays an important security role, and the latter ensures the continuity of ecological functions. In terms of the spatial layout, the ecological security barriers built based on ecological security pattern and regional zoning functions are away from the urban core development area. As for the spatial distribution, ecological sources of Fengxian County are mainly located in the central and southwestern areas, which is highly coincident with the main rivers and underground drinking water source area. Moreover, key corridors and main corridors with length of approximately 115.71 km and 26.22 km, respectively, formed ecological corridors of Fengxian County. They are concentrated in the western and southwestern regions of the county which is far away from the built-up areas with strong human disturbance. The results will provide scientific evidence for important ecological land protection and ecological space control at a small scale in underdeveloped and plain counties. In addition, it will enrich the theoretical framework and methodological system of ecological security pattern construction. To some extent, it also makes a reference for improving the regional ecological environment carrying capacities and optimizing the ecological spatial structure in such kinds of underdeveloped small-scale counties.

AB  - Herkes kin Mimarhk ('Architecture for All', HiM) is a group of architects, urban planners, designers, and sociologists who conduct participatory renovation projects. They were involved in the Occupy Gezi Park movement by questioning top-down urban politics in Istanbul, developing a series of online and on-site events including the Gezi Festivals, interview videos, timelines, zines, and exhibitions. Working fivm these case studies, this article examines the ways HiM archived the occupied milieu as a means of resistance: How do the materials that HiM documented during the Occupy Gezi Park movement contribute to knowledge production through a non-authoritarian and a non-linear history writing? I argue that temporality plays a crucial role in this process, as it is impossible to predetermine the duration of a protest movement and the course of events complicates decision-making regarding what to include or exclude in the archive. Through in-depth interviews and archival research that focus on HiM's public events and design works, this article examines the group's curatorial and documentation practices with respect to questions of authenticity, authorship, accessibility, and security.

T2  - MEDIEVAL ARCHAEOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - PRESENT-DAY ESTONIA WAS INCORPORATED into the Christian world in the early 13th century. This event brought dramatic changes to both its society and landscape, including the establishment of the first towns that soon played an important role in the emerging Hanseatic network, mediating trade between the West and East. These political and cultural changes are also reflected in the influences that reached Estonian towns, with the migration of craftspeople from German-speaking areas and Scandinavia; in particular, these innovations occurred in non-ferrous casting technology. The most important changes included the introduction of refractory crucibles, massive melting furnaces and more complex stone-casting moulds. Residue analysis showed evidence of highly specialised metalworking taking place. The large sample size revealed some unusual alloys, which are explained either by craftspeople's experimentation or by the reuse of scrap metal. By looking at the different crucible types and mould fragments, we are able to demonstrate how the mobile craftspeople were the carriers of both casting tools and knowledge inside the Hanseatic world.

AB  - The House and Ball Community (HBC), a tight-knit social and cultural network comprised primarily of Black sexual and gender minorities (SGM), offers unique opportunities for HIV prevention that leverage naturally occurring social support networks. However, experiences of socioeconomic marginalization, stigma, violence, and trauma may impede HIV prevention efforts. This study analyzed data from 551 Black SGM recruited at HBC events in 2 cities over 24 months. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations examined associations between socio-structural stressors, mental health, substance use, and sexual behavior among HBC participants. Findings indicated high prevalence of depressive symptoms, history of trauma, intimate partner violence, and substance use, and significant associations between socioeconomic marginalization and depressive symptoms, substance use, and condomless anal sex. Future research is needed to better elucidate the temporal relationships between socioeconomic marginalization, mental health and substance use, and HIV transmission dynamics. Results highlight a need for integration of mental health services, substance use treatment, and HIV prevention for this community.

AB  - The 'bazaar', or the marketplace has been one of the most influential bases of the city in terms of social, political and economic development, and is considered as an active public space for initiating fundamental changes in society. Across Islamic cultures and civilizations, as well as their historical precedents, the marketplace has occupied a broad and complex social meaning, especially in Iran. In this research, the marketplace is considered from a socio-commercial point of view. In order to improve the efficiency of public spaces, it is necessary to identify their effective parameters of socialization, and utilize them towards the future design or improvement of built environments. While the socio-cultural influence of a bazaar determines the development of human relationships around it, its environmental components are also effective in responding to 'physical needs' of a populace, that is, the provision of necessities such as food and clothing as well as repair services. The relationship between environmental, social and cultural elements is found to be the most influential factor in increasing the sociality of the public space. In order to analyze bazaar socialization, the research methodology employed in this article comprises a descriptive survey that uses Delphi and Q methodology. According to the results, six key factors were identified: activity-behavioural-movement (ABM) components, physical-functional qualities, enviornmental impacts, physical components (PCs), cultural values (CVs), social cohesion and integration, diversity and spatial attraction. Crucially, the study also finds that the socialization of space is formed through the interaction between human experiences in place and the prevailing cultural forms within it, that is, the regional customs, traditions and overall 'way of life' of the native populace. Therefore, the cultural features of urban spaces are another important factor in their development. Studying these factors opens the possibility for facilitating greater levels of interaction and participation in public spaces in a manner that also accommodates different groups of people and their varying subcultures.

AB  - Identifying the source of marine litter is essential to design effective mitigation measures to reduce plastic leakage into marine ecosystems. Kenya recently banned the use of polyethylene bags, but PET drink bottles remain a contentious source of litter in the country. I collected bottles and other single-use containers at nine Kenyan beaches, and compared their composition, country of manufacture and approximate age (time since manufacture) to bottles collected in coastal towns. Locally manufactured bottles dominated street litter (98%) and on urban beaches (93%) but became increasingly uncommon with distance from coastal towns, comprising only 30% of bottles at remote beaches. These steep spatial gradients indicate that most local bottles do not disperse far from source areas. The presence of lids is important for long-distance dispersal of glass and PET bottles, and many PET bottles littered in urban areas lack lids. HDPE bottles are much more common on beaches than on streets, and most come from Indonesia. The presence of epibionts and bite marks suggest that most HDPE bottles have drifted in the South Equatorial Current from southeast Asia, whereas foreign PP bottles mostly come from Indian Ocean island states. Reducing plastic leakage in southeast Asia should reduce the amount of beach litter throughout the western Indian Ocean. Some foreign PET bottles come from neighbouring states, but many are probably dumped illegally from ships operating from Asia. In addition to reducing plastic leakage from land-based sources, we need to ensure compliance with MARPOL Annex V regulations banning the disposal of plastic wastes at sea. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transportation is the movement of humans or animals, goods, and information from one location to another. In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point. Transportation is a derived demand that follow all basic human needs. The more populated of certain area, the more intensively of transportation, and it triggers the transport congestion. Public transportation is one solution to minimize congestion problems due to the large number of private vehicles. This study aims to (1) identify potential users of the Trans Jogja Bus; and (2) analyze the level of Trans Jogja bus occupancy. This study use quantitative research method, i.e. survey method, by using questionnaire instruments for conducting structured interviews and check lists for conducting observations. The mechanism for obtaining data in this study are by collecting primary and secondary data. The location of the research is Yogyakarta City and its surroundings which are covered by Trans Jogja Bus routes. The data was processed with SPSS 19.0 software and analyzed by quantitative descriptive analysis techniques. Results of this research shows that: (1) all of Trans Jogja Bus route actually have potential trip generation, as well as trip destination, however; (2) the occupancy level of Trans Jogja Bus are still little bit low even though service level is quite good.

AB  - Invasive alien plant species are frequently grown as ornamental plants in gardens. Until recently, in Slovenia, there were neither specific collection centres for a safe disposal of invasive plant species, nor any legislation that defined procedures for their removal and disposal. We investigated in two experiments how to dispose of pieces of selected invasive plant species, with the aim to prevent their survival and further dispersion. In the first experiment, we chose eight species that are known for spreading by either growing from pieces of cut stem (Cornus sericea, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Buddleja davidii) or through subterranean rhizomes and tubers (Solidago canadensis, Solidago gigantea, Rudbeckia laciniata, Helianthus tuberosus, Symphyotrichum novae-angliae). The plant fragments were exposed to three different storage treatments: drying, composting on an open compost heap, and storage in black bin liners, all of which can be used in the home garden. After 5 months of storage, the materials were planted in box planters, and their development was monitored. Drying and composting was highly efficient for disposal, as the conditions destroyed the majority of the plant material. However, storage in a bin liner was inefficient because it did not kill any of the plant species tested, and did not delay their growth of new roots. In the second experiment we investigated selected woody invasive plants (Cornus sericea, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Buddleja davidii, Acer negundo, Forsythia x intermedia) to determine whether their branch fragments can sprout new roots, and whether shredding of their branches represents an efficient dispersal pathway. These dried fragments did not grow roots under any circumstances, while freshly shredded fragments rooted in some cases. Therefore, the use of mulch that has not been treated properly might allow dispersal of woody invasive plants. We can conclude that not all recommended treatments for invasive plant disposal are equally successful to prohibit plant survival and further spread.

AB  - Horticulture is an important source of alien plant species that could potentially escape the garden fence, survive in nature, reproduce abundantly and finally became harmful to natural ecosystems (i.e. invasive). Additionally, residential garden owners promote the invasion of alien species by dumping garden waste in nature. A surprisingly high number of garden waste deposits was found in lowland peri-urban forest fragments in NE Slovenia. A positive relationship between proximity to these deposits and the number of alien plant species originative from discarded plants has been observed. This fact encouraged us to assess public knowledge of and opinions about invasive alien plant species (LAP), the public's habits in managing garden waste disposal and thus their awareness of promoting invasions. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey shared among various interest groups on social media platforms in Slovenia. Our results showed relatively good knowledge among respondents about IAPs. Over half the respondents were able to list at least one LAP. The most frequently listed IAP was Ambrosia artemisiifiVia, followed by Solidago sp. and Fallopia sp. More than 10% of respondents who own a private residential garden confirmed our assumption that they discarded garden waste in the natural environment - in nearby forests. Respondents who were aware that such an approach could present a possible threat of promoting IAPs were less likely to discard garden waste in forests. According to itspondents' socio-demographic status, we hypothesize that overall public awareness of promoting IAPs by discarding garden waste in forests is probably lower than our survey response showed. Findings of this study should be used to improve awareness among the general public about IAPs and possible unintentional introduction paths and dispersal of IAPs, caused by inappropriate garden waste management. In the near future, more activities to improve awareness must be carried out. Our proposal is supported by the opinion of our respondents ; 79% of them perceive their knowledge about IAPs as insufficient.

AB  - The Revolution of 1905 had an enormous impact on many nations in the Russian Empire. In order to study the society of the Russian Empire during the Revolution of 1905, many aspects need to be considered. Besides political and social changes, it is also important to study how and why violence occurred during the Revolution.
   Violence had many sources in the Revolution of 1905 in the Russian Empire. One such source was the revolutionary political parties, which saw acts of violence as a means for realising their political agenda. Revolutionary parties formed armed groups, which attacked the authorities and other people. Bombs exploded in many places. Revolutionaries also gave speeches and printed various texts calling upon the masses to engage in violence against the authorities. The authorities also used violence in situations where it was unnecessary for defending themselves or protecting the lives of others. On many occasions, soldiers opened fire on political demonstrations or crowds of strikers. Although the authorities finally managed to supress the Revolution using violence, it is also evident that during the Revolution, the use of violence by the authorities played a role in the radicalisation of the revolutionary movement. It is well known that the shooting of demonstrators in St Petersburg on 9 January 1905 became a catalyst for the Revolution. Later, similar events took place in many parts of the Russian Empire.
   In many areas of the Empire (Poland, Latvia, etc.), large numbers of people were killed by the authorities and by the people participating in the revolutionary movement. This study reveals that almost all of the people who were killed during the Revolution of 1905 in Estonia died at the hands of the authorities. There were 102 known victims of the Revolution in Estonian towns, and all of them were killed by the authorities. Most of them died on 16 October when soldiers opened fire on a peaceful workers' demonstration in Tallinn. There was a total of five revolutionary events in Estonian towns where people were killed. Three of them took place in Tallinn, one in Tartu and one in Narva. All five events took place during workers' strikes. Events in the countryside need to be investigated more thoroughly, but as far as is known, it seems to have been extremely rare for revolutionaries or participants in uprisings to kill anyone in the countryside as well. We know with certainty that only one German landlord (Arthur von Baranoff) was killed in Estonia in 1905. The punitive squads that were sent to Estonia by the authorities in December of 1905 killed hundreds of people. So although the events in the countryside need further research in order to obtain more reliable data, it is clear that most of the victims of the Revolution of 1905 in the countryside were killed by the authorities.
   It is exceedingly difficult to point out exactly why the revolutionary movement in Estonia was less violent than in many other areas of the Russian Empire. Estonia and Latvia were in a relatively similar political situation, but the Revolution became much more violent in Latvia. This may be due to the fact that the socialist movement was not as widespread in Estonia as it was in Latvia. Socialist organisations in Estonia were also weaker than in Latvia. An event already occurred on 13 January in Riga in which soldiers opened fire on a crowd of people. It is possible that this contributed to the early radicalisation of the revolutionary movement in Latvia. Tallinn's City Council may also have played an important role in keeping the peace. Estonians had won election to the City Council of Tallinn for the first time in 1904. It is likely that Estonian workers found it easier to communicate with the Tallinn's municipal government than Riga workers with their local city government that was still dominated by Germans. Tallinn's municipal government did not position itself against the workers' movement and in some cases tried to work together with the representatives of the workers. It is possible that this also played an important role in revolutionary events in Tallinn.

The samples were harvested by a fisherman in Sibolga city and Natal district-Mandailing Natal Regency, North Sumatera. We recorded three males and ten females of Charybdis goaensis, which consists of juveniles and ovigerous females. Both sampling locations are in one coastline in west coast Sumatera which faces directly to the Indian Ocean. We assumed that the dispersal of this species through the Indian Ocean is at their larval phase.

AB  - Rodents have long plagued forestry production in China, particularly in desert areas in northwestern China, where prevention and monitoring techniques are lacking. Predators are important in regulating rodent populations, and determining how to maximise the role of predators in the comprehensive management of rodent pests is one of the most important issues in rodent control. To accurately understand the activities and vegetation damage patterns of the great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) in a desert forest area, as well as the activities of its predators, we set up infrared cameras in the Sal Hu Song desert forest region of Altay city, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, in December 2016 and conducted one year of field monitoring of R. opimus and its predators. A total of 2407 independent and valid photographs of R. opimus and its predators were collected. By calculating the relative abundance index, we analysed the activity rhythms of R. opimus and its predators and calculated the correlations of their activity rhythms. The relative abundance of R. opimus was 237.75 in Sal Hu Song, and the predators were mainly the long-legged buzzard (Buteo rufinus) at 94.50, marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna) at 45.74, and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) at 44.26. R. opimus is a typical diurnal animal, with activity peaks occurring between 10:00 and 12:00 and between 17:00 and 19:00, and its activities were mainly movement and foraging. Over the year, R. opimus had two peak activity periods, March and September-October. The peak activity periods of V. peregusna were March and September, while the peak activity period of V. vulpes was February-March. The peak activity period of B. rufinus was June. Among these three predators, the activity rhythms of V. peregusna had the highest correlation with those of R. opimus. This study will contribute to monitoring and managing pest animals in these desert areas. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simple Summary Wildlife are moved (translocated) for numerous reasons, whether it is to establish a new population for conservation purposes or to move animals out of harm's way. Unfortunately, animals that are moved often fail to survive in their new homes. Soft release is a technique of penning animals at the release site before letting them free, which allows them to become acclimated to their new surroundings and prevents them from immediately trying to return to their capture location. We soft-released Texas horned lizards at an urban military installation in Oklahoma, United States. While soft-released adults did have reduced post-release movements, they also had low survival, suggesting that they do not respond well to translocation. However, post-release survival of juveniles was high and equivalent to resident juveniles. Translocation efforts of Texas horned lizards may be most successful if they focus on relocation of juveniles rather than adults. Wildlife translocation is an often-used technique to augment populations or remove animals from harm's way. Unfortunately, many translocation efforts fail to meet their goals for myriad reasons, particularly because translocated animals make large, erratic movements after release, which can result in high mortality rates. Soft release, holding animals in acclimation pens for some period of time at the recipient site before release, has been proposed as a technique to reduce these large movements and increase the survival of translocated animals. Here, we compared the survival and movement patterns of soft-released Texas horned lizards (Phrynosoma cornutum) with resident lizards, as well as hard-released lizards from a prior study. Juvenile lizards that were soft-released had high survival rates similar to resident lizards, despite still moving more frequently and occupying larger home ranges than residents. Conversely, soft-released adult lizards had survival rates similar to those that were hard-released, and much lower rates than resident adults. Curiously, soft-released adults did not have significantly higher movement rates or home range sizes than residents. Our results suggest that caution should be used before adult Texas horned lizards are translocated. However, juveniles responded well to soft release, and future research should explore whether they are more resilient to translocation in general, or if soft release provided a specific survival advantage. Contrary to our predictions, the survival of translocated animals was not related to their post-release movement patterns, and the mechanism underlying the observed survival patterns is unclear.

AB  - "Any man who does not have his own land is not a man." - Talmud, Yevam 63a. The presence of homelessness is universal, but its assessment varies. While in some analysis we find romantic references to it, policy systems sometimes try to forcefully eradicate this lifestyle. The appearance of homelessness is not uniform across the globe: it appears with varying degrees of intensity, role and perspective in different parts of the world. This research is spatially defined, as it focuses on the lifestyle of homeless people who visit the day center (social service) in Prater Street, in Budapest. It is based on a questionnaire that aims to reconstruct the mobility of homeless people through questions related to where respondents spent their day, what did they do and how did they move around. Researching and mapping the mobility of homeless people is an important part of understanding and developing urban societies. The research presents the target group in more detail in terms of urban use.
   The processing of the questionnaire is divided into three parts: data analysis, map analysis and video analysis. In addition to some basic information (the respondents' gender, age, housing circumstances and the length of time they have spent living in homeless situation), a single question was asked: "Where do you spend your day?". Based on the answers, maps and videos were created using data visualization. By observing the morphology of movements in these maps, respondents could be grouped into global and local transporters - depending on the extent of movement. The global transporter is able to travel long distances in one day, taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the city. He or she uses a lot of public transport, knows the social welfare systems available in the city - be it a hospital, a workplace, a homeless shelter, a day center or a soup kitchen. The movement of the local transporter is limited to the places (territories) in his or her comfort zone close to his or her accomodation and well-known environment. He or she rarely travels long distances, uses only a few elements of the social welfare system. There is another, special group of transporters called "their home is the road", who use public transport for sleeping and relaxing. Therefore, the interpretation of the movement of this group is very different from the previous ones, as,their home is the road" transporters inadvertently travel huge distances.
   Research findings indicate the diversity of homelessness, which is line with Gyori's conclusion (2019) that the homeless people we perceive (gubbery or deadbeat) make up only 21% of the homeless society. In fact, far more people struggle with the state of homelessness, who remain invisible to the majority society, and often to social workers. Respondents can be grouped by age, housing circumstances (on the street, in a at, in a social institute), transport habits or the length of time they have spent living in this situation. During examining the morphological behavior of the different groups, recurring elements and complex patterns could be identified. There are different mobility patterns (local and global) between young and old homeless people, between people sleeping in the street or in a social welfare institute, between those who use public transport and those who do not, etc. They use the city and take the opportunities of urban life in different ways.
   The different forms of data visualization provide an opportunity to develop new insights, to validate previous research and to establish a new methodology for future research. It helps to present the human side of homelessness to the majority society and to understand the complexity of the situation. One of the most important results of this research is the realization of the potential of public transport. According to Oross (1996), there must be an important direction to help those living with the social services and to support those who are trapped outside the system. The proportion of public transport users in the target group is very high and they spend a lot of time travelling by public vehicles, so public transport can become the new means to reach and help non-users of the social welfare system.

AB  - The Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is listed as threatened in Mexico but there is little information on populations in the state of Sonora. We amalgamated 121 records of the Golden Eagle in Sonora between 1892 and 2019, including 49 observations by the authors between 1997 and 2016. Observations were from all months of the year, peaked during the breeding season and again in December with 53.7% representing likely breeding individuals. Most observations were from the Sky Islands region and Sonoran Desert of northern Sonora, with fewer from coastal west-central and especially southern Sonora. Most observations were from grasslands (34.3%), Madrean evergreen woodland (31.3%), and desert-scrub (30.3%), and very few were from subtropical forest and thorn-scrub (< 2.0%) suggesting preference for open vegetation communities that foster hunting. We found evidence of recent occupation of all general portions of Sonora that were occupied historically, except in central Sonora due possibly to changes in land use and land cover. Although our results suggest broad-scale distribution has been largely stable, more focused monitoring is needed to understand population trends. Large-scale urban and agricultural development, loss of grasslands and other open environments, electrocution, and poisoning pose major threats to Golden Eagles in Sonora.

AB  - Wildfires are a major disturbance in the Mediterranean Basin and an ecological factor that constantly alters the landscape. In this context, it is crucial to understand where wildfires are more likely to occur as well as the drivers guiding them in complex landscapes such as the Mediterranean area. The objectives of this study are to estimate wildfire probability occurrence as a function of biophysical and human-related drivers, to provide an assessment of the relative impact of each driver and analyze the performance of machine learning techniques compared to traditional regression modeling. By employing an Artificial Neural Network model and fire data (2004-2012), we estimated wildfire probability across two geographical regions covering most of the Italian territory: Alpine and subalpine region and Insular and peninsular region. The high classification accuracy (0.68 for the Alpine and subalpine region and 0.76 for the Insular and peninsular region) and good performances of the technique (AUC values of 0.82 and 0.76, respectively) suggest that our model can be used in the areas studied to assess wildfire probability occurrence. We compared our model with a logistic function, which showed a weaker predictive power (AUC values of 0.78 for the Alpine and subalpine region and 0.65 for the Insular and peninsular region) compared to the Artificial Neural Network. In addition, we assessed the importance of each variable by isolating it in the model. The importance of an individual variable differed between the two regions, underscoring the high diversity of wildfire occurrence drivers in Mediterranean landscapes. Results show that in the Alpine and subalpine region, the presence of forest is the most important variable, while climate resulted as being the most important variable in the Insular and peninsular region. The majority of areas recently affected by large wildfires in both regions have been correctly classified by the ANN model as 'high fire probability'. Hence, the use of an Artificial Neural Network is efficient and robust for understanding the probability of wildfire occurrence in Italy and other similar complex landscapes.

AB  - Land-use conversion and habitat loss and degradation are among the factors affecting populations and species genetic integrity. Understanding how these factors govern the genetic structure of threatened plant populations is essential to design efficient conservation strategies. Here we analyze how environmental correlates, geographic location and anthropogenic disturbance (at local, landscape and regional scales) relate to population differentiation and genetic diversity of a keystone semiarid long-lived shrub,Ziziphus lotus. The European range of this species is restricted mainly to the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula (> 90%) but its area has shrunk considerably as a consequence of intensive agriculture and urban expansion since the 1950s. We characterize its genetic diversity and structure across the Iberian Peninsula with microsatellite markers, considering 21 populations. All populations showed high and relatively similar values of genetic diversity (mean/pop:H-o = 0.54;H-e = 0.55;A(R) = 3.59). Three main genetic clusters were defined by clustering analyses corresponding largely to west, central (core) and east of its distribution. Molecular variance analysis revealed that 87.3% of genetic variation was grouped within populations, 5% among populations and 7% between regions. Geographic location (37.88%) has stronger correlation with population genetic differences than landscape characteristics (5.82%). Natural habitat cover at the landscape level was the only environmental variable associated withF(ST)population differences. The detected population genetic patterns are probably related primarily to historical gene flow and secondarily to intensive land-use change of this area in the last 60 years. Our results suggest that, although the long-lived and resprouting strategy of the species is buffering the erosion of genetic diversity at population and regional level, there are already genetic consequences of landscape degradation, which could be aggravated in the future.

AB  - This paper examines the evolvement of the 'movement of the squares' following the end of the more visible cycles of mobilization of the squares ' occupations. We argue that a crucial aspect of this evolution lies in the creation of a social infrastructure of alternative (re)productive projects in the form of commons. We call this type of outcomes 'social' in order to distinguish them from the cultural, political and biographical outcomes underlined in typologies on the consequences of social movements. Bridging social movement studies with the literature on the commons, we build a conceptual framework of their relationship. Through a comparative analysis of the movements in Athens and Barcelona, we show how the commoning practices of the square encampments gave rise to more endurable commons disseminated across cities ' social fabrics. We identify both direct and indirect mechanisms of movements ' transmutation into commons, and distinguish the former into transplantation, ideation, and breeding processes. Our second aim is to scrutinize the political dimension of these commons in relation to what has been framed as the 'post-political condition'. We maintain that the post-square commons constitute political and politicizing actions for activists and users for their effects on everyday life, for their capacity to link their practices with broader, structural dynamics of injustice, inequality and exclusion, and for their selective engagement with counter-austerity politics.

AB  - In this paper, we report a remarkable population of the rare plantSternbergia colchiciflorafound along a busy road section in the downtown of county seat Veszprem (W-Hungary). The population contains at least 7000 individuals and spreads across fifteen grassy traffic islands. Regarding the position of individuals, their relative distance from the road/sidewalk within the traffic islands differed significantly from a hypothetical uniform distribution, with higher number of individuals situated close to the island edges than expected by chance. Besides this rare bulbous plant, several other dry grassland specialist plant species were also found in these habitat patches, e.g.,Astragalus austriacus, Festuca rupicola, Filipendula vulgaris, Muscari neglectum, Petrorhagia saxifraga, Potentilla arenaria, Ranunculus illyricus, Salvia nemorosa, Sanguisorba minor, Teucrium chamaedrys, Thesium linophyllon, Verbascum phoeniceumandVinca herbacea. The origin of these dry grassland plants in this highly disturbed urban environment is uncertain; possibly, they were introduced ca. 15 years ago in the course of earthworks during the construction of the road. Recent management (frequent and motorized lawn mowing) seems to favor theSternbergia colchiciflora, while the habitat is currently not directly threatened. Unfortunately, the potential for local conservation appears to be highly limited.

AB  - The political transformation taking place in Central European countries at the turn of 1980s and 1990s influenced, among other aspects, the methods of nature protection and making it available for tourism. The changes taking place at that time have been traced in the article on the example of three sandstone landscapes, which belong to the most popular geotouristic attractions of the Czech Republic and Poland: Prachov Rocks Nature Reserve with adjacent fragments of the Bohemian Paradise Protected Landscape Area, Adrspach-Teplice Rocks National Nature Reserve and the Table Mountains National Park. These changes were analysed on the basis of transformations of the networks of hiking trails and development of other tourism facilities within the boundaries of the protected areas. Analysis covers the entire period from the end of communism (1980s) up to present days. According to the study, in the case of all analysed protected areas, the systemic transformation in Central Europe played an important role as a factor affecting the network of hiking trails. In each case, however, local factors were also important. The biggest changes occurred in the Adrspach-Teplice Rocks and the Table Mountains. In the first case, the number and distribution of visitors needed to be controlled, leading to modification of route network. The main reason of its significant reduction was to separate paid routes from those not charged. In the Table Mountains, the network was substantially developed as a consequence of the establishment of a national park there and the political changes at the turn of twentieth and twenty-first centuries which opened the border zone and forced the marking of new tourist trails. In the Prachov Rocks, the existing layout of hiking trails has been largely kept unchanged because the continuous intensive tourist traffic did not allow any reductions, even if these would help to protect the environment. On the other hand, the network was really well developed, that it did not require further growth. Today's networks of tourist trails in the Prachov Rocks and some parts of the Table Mountains seem too developed, taking into account the protective regime of both areas. In terms of interpretation of geoheritage, the most extensive and targeted offer can be found in the Table Mountains National Park. Referring to the methods used, the graph theory cannot be applied easily to tourist trails networks, especially when a dissected landscape is analysed. A simple but very helpful indicator illustrating the development of the network is the density of tourist trails per square kilometre.

AB  - This article reviews the current discourse on urban struggles to bring to the surface strategies of interpretation, which deal with theoretical concerns insinuated by the situated existence of struggling subjects. The first part, concentrating on the domain of "negative places," contrasts interpretive strategies distinguished by their orientation to the phenomena of local solidarities, alternatively, solidarities organized by collective projects. The second part turns from "negative places" to "other places" to consider the strategy of interpretation operating with the concept of affective solidarities. The article argues for a critical reinterpretation of affective solidarities in reference to Foucault's idea of "other places" to disclose how the disobedient subject's transfiguration into collective subjects of solidarity is entwined with the diversity of modes in which the corporeal existence of subjects is situated in the world.

AB  - Historical aerial photographs provide salient information on the historical state of the landscape. The exploitation of these archives is often limited by accessibility and the time-consuming process of digitizing the analogue copies at a high resolution and processing them with a proper photogrammetric workflow. Furthermore, these data are characterised by limited spectral information since it occurs very often in a single band. Our work presents a first application of deep learning for the extraction of land cover from historical aerial panchromatic photographs of the African cities of Goma, Bukavu and Bujumbura. We evaluate the suitability of deep learning for land cover generation from a challenging dataset of photographs from the 1940s and 1950s that covers large geographical extents and is characterised by radiometric variations between dates and locations. A fully convolutional approach is investigated by considering two network architectures with different strategies of exploiting contextual information: one used atrous convolutional layers without downsampling, whereas the second network has both downsampling and learned upsampling convolutional layers (U-NET). The networks are trained to detect three main classes namely, buildings, high vegetation and a mixed class of bare land and low vegetation class. High overall accuracies of > 90% in Goma-Gisenyi and Bukavu, and > 85% in Bujumbura are obtained. This work provides a novel methodology that outperforms a baseline standard machine learning classifier for the exploitation of the vast archives of historical aerial photographs that can aid long-term environmental baseline studies. Future work will entail developing domain adaptation strategies in order to make the trained network robust for different image mosaics.

AB  - Evaluating patterns of sexual violence against young people across the world in the era of the #MeToo movement presents great opportunities for research and practice but also challenges. The aim of this article is to critically assess an internet-based methodology employed in a comparative study conducted with university students in 18 different cities, in six continents. While our main purpose is to examine the methodological aspects of this study, the article also presents briefly its major findings and discusses compiled recommendations to curb sexual violence in some of the most important transit systems in the world. Findings show that sexual violence in transit environments is a common occurrence globally, is highly underreported, and ranges considerably from one city to the other, and between gender groups. Lessons from this study suggest that it is crucial to use identical research tools and choose partners who can ensure that research tasks are undertaken on time, ethically, and with good care for the quality of data and the research process. To curb sexual violence on transit, actions tailored to local contexts are necessary, but as underreporting of harassment is prevalent in all contexts, one global need is initiatives that facilitate incident reporting.

AB  - The history of the Sheikdom of al-Zubayr is an essential aspect of Gulf history as it closely relates to significant events that have helped shape the region. Due to the relative lack of research into this important sheikhdom, this article makes a significant contribution to the historical narrative of al-Zubayr focusing on its links between its sister city states of Najd. This paper notably investigates the political relationship between al-Zubayr and the Najd city states of Harma and Huraymila. In doing so, the article shows how this sheikhdom, has been socially, culturally and politically shaped by the Najdi city states. Hence, the article argues that al-Zubayr also occupies a central position in the political and religious landscape of that time as it acted as a de facto refuge for many powerful Najdi clans during the rise of the Saudi/Wahhabi movement. Based on a review of several Arabic primary sources, it is shown how the Najdi city states' political conflicts were exported to the sheikhdom of al-Zubayr which witnessed a particularly violent political history shaped by the various conflicts between two main Najdi factions, Harma and Huraymila.

AB  - The beginning of the military campaign of 1814 in France was marked by a movement against recruitment and tax payments. Avesnes-sur-Help was the first city on this path in the northern departments. The city was unprepared to defend, had survived a severe epidemic of typhoid, and surrendered to the Allies without resistance. The fear of a typhoid epidemic was replaced by Avesnes residents worry due to the city surrender without resistance and loss of "honor". Moreover, government officials continued to perform their functions, but in favor of the occupation authorities. The French government regarded this as a betrayal. Avesnes residents turned from "their" into "strangers" and began to fear the threat of Napoleonic troops returning to the city and subsequent repressions. The informational isolation of the city dwellers did not allow them to carry out at least medium-term planning of life trajectories, and when choosing a behavioral model, the existential foundations of motivation were exposed. The division of the district of Avesnes-sur-Help into two suprefectures stirred up ambitions and engendered the struggle of neighbors (residents of Landrecies and Maubeuge) for the "Avesnes inheritance". But among all these "the Passions of the Avesnes" no one, not even the Napoleonic press, mentioned any robberies and rapes by the occupiers. Avesnes residents, if they complained, then about the "burdens" and not about the "excesses". Actually, the occupation of the city by Russian troops was relatively painless for the city dwellers and did not cause "passions". The honorary saber was presented by the city dwellers to commandant R.K. Nasakin is evidence of that.

AB  - Background: Argentina is located at the southern temperate range of arboviral transmission by the mosquito Aedes aegypti and has experienced a rapid increase in disease transmission in recent years. Here we present findings from an entomological surveillance study that began in Cordoba, Argentina, following the emergence of dengue in 2009.
   Methods: From 2009 to 2017, larval surveys were conducted monthly, from November to May, in 600 randomly selected households distributed across the city. From 2009 to 2013, ovitraps (n = 177) were sampled weekly to monitor the oviposition activity of Ae. aegypti. We explored seasonal and interannual dynamics of entomological variables and dengue transmission. Cross correlation analysis was used to identify significant lag periods.
   Results: Aedes aegypti were detected over the entire study period, and abundance peaked during the summer months (January to March). We identified a considerable increase in the proportion of homes with juvenile Ae. aegypti over the study period (from 5.7% of homes in 2009-10 to 15.4% of homes in 2016-17). Aedes aegypti eggs per ovitrap and larval abundance were positively associated with temperature in the same month. Autochthonous dengue transmission peaked in April, following a peak in imported dengue cases in March; autochthonous dengue was not positively associated with vector or climate variables.
   Conclusions: This longitudinal study provides insights into the complex dynamics of arbovirus transmission and vector populations in a temperate region of arbovirus emergence. Our findings suggest that Cordoba is well suited for arbovirus disease transmission, given the stable and abundant vector populations. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of regional human movement.

AB  - Light pollution is a rapidly growing threat to biodiversity, with many unknown or poorly understood effects on species and ecosystems spanning terrestrial and aquatic environments. Relative to other taxa, the effects of artificial light at night on aquatic invertebrates are poorly understood, despite the abundance and integral significance of invertebrates to marine and freshwater ecosystems. We affixed heart rate and acceleration biologgers to adult Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus), an ecologically, culturally and economically significant species in the western Atlantic ocean, to test the effect of artificial light at night on this species'physiology and behaviour relative to appropriate controls. The experiment was conducted in a simulated reef mesocosm in The Bahamas with incandescent lighting used to illuminate it at 1 lux, approximating light levels offshore of urban areas. In the conditions tested here, artificial light at night was found to have no effect on heart rate or locomotor activity in P. argus. We observed a dissociation between activity and heart rate at both short-term and long-term temporal scales. Lobsters were more active at night and nocturnal activity was higher in trials closer to new moon; however, heart rate did not vary with diel or lunar cycle. There was less than 8% difference between daytime and night time average heart rate despite the average percentage of time spent active almost tripling in nights versus days, to 19.5% from 7.2%, respectively. Our findings suggest P. argus may have some resilience to low levels of light pollution, which warrants further research on aspects of this species' life history, performance and fitness in the face of this potential anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue virus in South America. In the last fifteen years, Argentina has suffered three large dengue outbreaks: one in 2009, another one in 2016 and the current 2020 outbreak, with 26,000, 66,000 and more than 43,000 confirmed cases, respectively. These outbreaks are associated with the circulation of the virus in neighboring countries due to the constant movement of people across the frontier. In 2009, the main province affected was Chaco province, with 11,037 confirmed cases (50% of total cases). Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the temporal oviposition rate of Aedes aegypti in Resistencia, the capital city of this province, in relation to meteorological variables. Mosquitoes were sampled weekly, from April 2015 to March 2017, using ovitraps located in houses randomly selected within the urban area. Oviposition rate was evaluated by means of the total number of eggs collected per week and the proportion of positive ovitraps per week. The coefficient of variation for these two indicators was estimated for the whole study period and then compared using the Wilcoxon Pair test. A generalized linear model (GLM) was performed to infer association between meteorological variables and oviposition rate without time lag and with a time lag of 1 to 4 weeks, considering the biology of this mosquito species. Comparisons between the coefficient of variation of egg number versus the proportion of positive ovitraps showed significant differences, being the former more variable than the latter. The most significant time lag was 2 weeks for the minimum temperature. The number of Ae. aegypti eggs increased 4.05 times when the minimum temperature increased 1 degrees C two weeks before, and decreased 0.69 times with an increase of 1 unit in relative humidity. No eggs were collected when the temperature was below 8 degrees C. The oviposition rate was associated with the increase in the critical minimum temperature (over 8 degrees C) and the weekly frequency of precipitation and dissociated with relative humidity. The maximum oviposition rate was recorded between November and January of both years. The GLM could not explain the relation between meteorological variables and the proportion of positive ovitraps. The peaks of Ae. aegypti egg abundance occurred simultaneously with dengue autochthonous cases recorded in Chaco province, resulting in a good indicative of the period of greatest epidemiological risk.

AB  - Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF), initially described in the United States as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, is an anthropozoonosis reported only in the Americas and caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii. In Brazil, transmission occurs mainly through tick bites of the genus Amblyomma spp. The disease was initially described as transmission of rural and wild areas; however, peri-urban and urban areas have been presenting cases, mainly related to the presence of humans residing in small fragments of riparian forest. The present study aimed to elucidate the dispersal of BSF near the Guarapiranga and Billings Reservoirs, in the city of Sao Paulo, SP. The presence of anti-R. rickettsii, Rickettsia parkeri and Rickettsia bellii antibodies were evaluated in dogs treated in surgical sterilization campaigns and residents around the Reservoirs. Samples were collected from 393 dogs and serum samples were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence reaction (RIFI) with a cutoff of 1:64. The titles for R. rickettsii varied from 256 to 4096 with a positivity of 3.3% (13/393); for R. bellii from 128 to 1024 and 4.1% (16/393) of positive and a single animal (0.25%) was seropositive for R. parkeri with a titre of 128. The findings allow us to conclude that the study region has conditions to become a possible area with BSF cases, as it involves Atlantic Forest, ideal conditions for the maintenance of the vector of the genus Amblyomma already described in the region and the presence of circulating Rickettsia rickettsii among dogs, confirmed by the presence of antibodies. Conducts regarding the awareness of the population through educational work should be implemented to prevent the disease in the population of the area.

AB  - The Philippines is blessed with an abundance of natural-cultural attractions with an excellent prospect for ecotourism development. Ecotourism has become a key national strategy in promoting local development. Despite this, the country continues to lag behind in ecotourism development as many of its tourism resources in the countryside remain untapped and undeveloped. This situation is exacerbated by the few scholarly discussions on how ecotourism development takes root in a local context. Against this backdrop, the study explores the specifics and dynamics of initiating and establishing ecotourism at the municipal level by looking into the experiences of two localities-Pandin Lake of San Pablo City and Tayak Hill of Rizal Municipality, both in Laguna province of the Philippines. Using a case study design, the article illustrates that in Pandin Lake, the ecotourism development is a locally driven and nongovernmental organisation-inspired initiative, and in Tayak Hill, it is a top-down driven endeavour where the efforts are mainly personal actions of the local executives. In Pandin Lake, the instigating conditions include: the awareness brought about by the save Sampaloc Lake movement; the constraint to aquaculture expansion; the scenic natural beauty of the small lake; and the lack of development-oriented actions by its administrative agencies. In Tayak Hill, the precipitating conditions comprise: the urgent need for instituting a promotional identity for the town and a catalyst for the local socioeconomic development; the advent of a new local government administration that is open to novel development strategies; and the discovery of Tayak Hill as a historical landmark.

AB  - "Taking back" has long been a rallying call of urban social movements asserting land rights. This call often involves seeking to ward off dispossession by taking possession. Scholars rethinking property beyond the normative "ownership model" have explored the seeming paradoxicality of resisting dispossession through legal forms of possession that reproduce deprivation. In this paper, I consider the possibilities for taking back the concept of possession itself by examining claims to "vacant" property in Philadelphia. I put taking back through a citywide "land bank" in conversation with the taking over of a poor people's movement that occupies government-owned properties as a means of survival and political mobilization. I argue that outside or on the edge of legal recognition, the effort to take back property functions not as an end in itself, but rather as an explicitly political taking on of the notion of possessive ownership.

AB  - Estuaries are experiencing high rates of modification because of urban development and on-going associated maintenance works which impacts their ecosystem functions and services. This research appraises the fish and crustacean community occupying urbanised estuaries, and whether necessary maintenance works (dredging, mangrove pruning) could be timed to better protect the ecosystem values. Using a range of sampling equipment we collected fish and crustacean assemblages from urban, semi-urban, and non-urban estuaries, in addition to water quality, tidal inundation, and marine plant densities to determine relationships among sites. Seasonal differences in body size distributions of socio-economically important species were also examined to infer timing of juvenile recruitment. Despite common assumptions that urbanised estuaries are degraded and provide little habitat value for coastal species, we found that the species composition of aquatic assemblages was similar between urban and non-urban sites, but differed according to tidal position (i.e. supralittoral vs. lower tidal). Seasonality in body size distributions differed among socio-economically important fisheries species, with some species showing juvenile recruitment during the wet season, dry season, or throughout the year. This study demonstrates that, regardless of urban vs. non-urban context, estuaries provide habitat for many aquatic animals, including socio-economically important fish species. Complexity associated with the dynamism of estuarine ecosystems and variability in constituent species' life-history patterns makes management decisions regarding timing and delivery of urban waterway maintenance difficult. However, maintenance works that occur during Austral dry season (May to October) would provide the best protection for marine plants (non-flowering season for mangroves), while also reduces downstream movement of sediments and contaminants during wet season rainfall flow. Undertaking necessary maintenance works in the dry season provides grounds for wide scale seascape ecosystem optimism.

AB  - Until three or four decades ago, humanity was no longer constrained by the depletion of certain natural resources (especially energy) and the intensified degradation of the natural environment. The consequences of these major crises-such as the economic, financial, and social upheaval of the world, dramatic climate change, and the entry of politics into a Brownian sarabande-necessitate the transition of civilization to another viable formula. Adequate, timely, and sustainable solutions are being sought, from the subsistence ones to those of economic efficiency. Thus, the mobility revolution is credited as one of the most important levers of change. Starting from the reality that most cars in traffic are not occupied at their maximum capacity, some ideas have already been advanced and even put into practice-"inspired"-which would improve the efficiency in this regard. For example, the reduction in the number of seats in cars and, correspondingly, the considerable reduction in the dimensions of cars are already found in the design of mini-cars and the correlation of identical interests of the self-movement of several people and the integration of this coincidence in a single concurrent mobility formula is already functional through the ride sharing system. Along with intelligent mobility management and the transition to electric and autonomous mobility, streamlining the occupancy of moving cars is seen as a great potential of the mobility revolution. Within the limits of the methodology of data collection in economic statistics, this study proposes a complex technique associated with a convincing tactic of empirical measurement of specific indices of urban traffic issues. The special method is characterized by the simultaneity and plurality of observation points followed by the correlation of the values obtained from the measurement thus performed, with the results from the video recordings taken at the same time. This method will increase the methodological accuracy of data collection in economic statistics. By advancing this method, this study aims to capture the occupancy rates of people in urban vehicle traffic, in different cities, using a combined method.

AB  - Multidisciplinary approaches are required for the management of invasive woody species in urban areas. In this context, phenological studies are a useful tool to understand tree development and devise suitable management strategies under urban forestry conditions. The significant role of phenology in attributing competitive advantages to invasive alien species has also been long recognized by community ecologists. Therefore, phenological calendars of invasive species may help in their detection, management and mitigation. In the present study, an attempt has been made to understand the invasive potential of an emerging invasive tree of urban landscapes, Broussonetia papyrifera (paper mulberry; Moraceae), through its phenological assessment by using a standardized numerical scale, BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt, CHemische Industrie). The tree is native to southeastern and eastern Asia and the Pacific Islands, and is rapidly spreading across various tropical and subtropical regions. The phenology of B. papyrifera was described in eight principal growth stages (PGSs) with two developmental cycles in a year, presented as primary (January-June) and secondary (June-November) flushes. The observations were further supported by the corresponding dates, photographs, meteorological data (air temperature, precipitation, and photoperiod), and climatic water balance of the study area. Results suggest that the occurrence of two developmental cycles, a prolonged reproductive period, strategy to attract frugivores with brightly colored pulpy fruits, and ability to survive under a wide temperature range help in the spread of B. papyrifera. The phenological scale provided in this study describes accurate and precise developmental stages of the tree that can be used to devise efficient management strategies for its control in urban areas. The information can also be exploited for assessing the climatic conditions required for its prevalence, predicting its future geographic range, and further research.

AB  - The effervescent contemporary discussions on social problems linked to vulnerable groups call attention to linguistic studies. In this sense, themes such as sexual and gender diversity, LGBT human rights and the fight against LGBTphobia have gained increasing space on social media and in academic research. Situating on the theoretical-analytical assumptions of Textual Linguistics and Rhetorical Argumentation, this article seeks to investigate the reference processes and argumentative-rhetorical strategies that indicate the construction of the collective LGBT ethos in the text of activists from two LGBT entities in Aracaju city, Sergipe state. Methodologically, it is a qualitative research and takes the descriptive-interpretative approach, opting for the open interview as a technique for collecting the corpus. The results point to the LGBT ethos split between LGBTphobia and everyday resistance in socio-political context of struggles for the construction of a collective identity, through the intertwining of different textual-discursive aspects.

AB  - On October 26, 2016, a large-scale mass movement occurred surrounding the Medellin-Bogota highway, near the municipality of Copacabana. This paper investigates the physical and legal conditions of the place where the landslide occurred, and thus, to corroborate the causes, the possibility of avoiding or preventing the phenomenon and the influence of anthropic activities in the sector. To determine the susceptibility to mass movements and verify the physical conditions, it was carried out by means of geological mapping, geomorphology and interpretation of satellite images. The legal and bibliographic review was consulted in the reports of the event, the PBOT of the municipality of Copacabana and the mining file of the Cantera Las Nieves. The area was found to be highly susceptible to mass movements, and exploitation in the Cantera Las Nieves triggered the landslide, which could be avoided. Similar phenomena could occur in the near future in the area.

AB  - This work proposes a new type of web-based geospatial decision support system-called Soil Monitor-which provides a multidisciplinary operational tool useful for a multi-stakeholder community to challenge soil sealing. Various technological and technical features of Soil Monitor are presented and discussed with particular reference to the combination of WebGIS with on-the-fly geospatial processing based on GPU computing, specifically designed to allow real-time requests. In addition, we present three quantitative analysis of soil sealing at three different scales. The study at national level illustrated that the type of land use strongly affected soil-sealing dynamics. Indeed, the class complex cultivation pattern resulted the most fragile land use while forests resulted the most resilient one. The study at province level illustrated the key importance of having on-the-fly the map of rural fragmentation for any Italian province. This map-quantifying the landscape integrity of the rural and natural areas-enables to better locate both new green corridors or new urban developments minimizing the environmental impact of human activities. The study at municipality level demonstrated the importance of quantifying a pool of spatial planning indicators and illustrated that (a) the largest urban dispersion occurs in hilly touristic municipalities close to the sea, (b) the increase in soil sealing in rural sites is not related to population growth. As a result, Soil Monitor is deemed useful both to support decision making at different spatial scales and to raise awareness in people, professionals, and experts of other fields. Keywords soil sealing, geospatial decision support system, compute unified device architecture, graphical processing unit computing, urban planning.

AB  - Level crossings between railway and highway causes transportation problems in the form of traffic jams and accidents. The Manahan Flyover development in the Surakarta city is an effort to minimize transportation problems in the Manahan and Kota Barat areas. Field condition shows that traffic congestion in the Manahan Flyover can be minimized, but traffic accident rate is increasing. Within nine months an accident occurred with two dead victims. The potential of traffic accident is inseparable with the design of the Manahan Flyover with the design of three-way intersection. The aim of study is to redesign traffic movement in the Manahan Flyover and surrounding Manahan area. Traffic micro-simulation VISSIM model is used to evaluate the performance of road networks at peak traffic conditions with different simulation models. The scenario simulation model is developed based on the calibrated base simulation model. In order to avoid potential accidents, therefore, the direction of traffic movement at the Manahan Flyover is made with a one-way system. The modelling scenario results indicate that the diversion of traffic movement at the Manahan Flyover must be followed by various traffic management and engineering efforts in the Manahan area including road widening, parking management, application of a one-way system.

AB  - Pedestrian deaths causing from road traffic crashes are a foremost and rising problem in urban India. However, pedestrian safety assessment using precise statistical analysis and modeling techniques is still in an early stage in urban India owing to the absence of crash data collection and maintenance, difficulties in obtaining appropriate road inventory data and traffic volume data. The present study composes an effort to fill the research gap by analyzing past crash data (2011-2016) collected from Kolkata police and identifies the hazardous corridors and intersections posing the high risk to the pedestrian. Consequently, to develop an understanding of the risk factors associated with pedestrian fatalities, a set of fixed-parameter Negative Binomial models is established. In these models, several attempts are made to identify the risk factors linked to traffic exposures and operational parameters, roadway characteristics and infrastructure, land use and road network planning. Based on the statistical analyses carried out in this study, there is evidence that factors such as approaching speed of the vehicles, vehicular traffic and pedestrian volume of the intersection and their interaction, disorderly movement of traffic (i.e., overtaking tendency of the vehicles), the presence of specific land-use type (i.e., commercial hubs), inefficient planning and design (i.e., inaccessibility of the pedestrian crosswalk, the absence of pedestrian signal head, etc.), the presence of wider carriageway, the encroachment of the footpath, restricted visibility (i.e., inadequate sight distance) are found to be major risk factors with regards to the fatal pedestrian crash occurrence in Kolkata City, India.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused an explosive epidemic linked to severe clinical outcomes in the Americas. As of June 2018, 4,929 ZIKV suspected infections and 46 congenital syndrome cases had been reported in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Although Manaus is a key demographic hub in the Amazon region, little is known about the ZIKV epidemic there, in terms of both transmission and viral genetic diversity. Using portable virus genome sequencing, we generated 59 ZIKV genomes in Manaus. Phylogenetic analyses indicated multiple introductions of ZIKV from northeastern Brazil to Manaus. Spatial genomic analysis of virus movement among six areas in Manaus suggested that populous northern neighborhoods acted as sources of virus transmission to other neighborhoods. Our study revealed how the ZIKV epidemic was ignited and maintained within the largest urban metropolis in the Amazon. These results might contribute to improving the public health response to outbreaks in Brazil.

AB  - The current urbanization and motorization have caused a gradual negative impact on the existing transport infrastructure in Yangon City. Currently, the road network throughout Yangon operates at or above its desired capacity during the peak periods. At present, there are over 62,886 registered taxis operating in Yangon City. These taxis provide two different services to passengers: non-metered taxi (traditionally hailed on the street) service and metered taxi (on demand) service. Private cars and taxis constitute 70% of the modes of transport in Yangon City; this may lead to traffic congestion. However, there is lack of relevant data and taxi trip pattern information on how taxi service is related to traffic congestion. Therefore, studies on taxi surveying using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) need to be conducted, and investigations on the effect of taxi services on traffic congestion from these GPS data need to be performed. This study explores the comparison between hourly and daily trips' frequencies as well as spatial and temporal variations of taxi trips between the two services. Field survey data collected through the GPS and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to estimate the different taxi travel times that can be applied in predicting the occupied and vacant times in the study area. The specific objective of this research is to examine vacant taxi movement and stationary time (parking time and congestion time) of the two services to quantify the impact of taxi travel time on traffic congestion in Yangon. Moreover, by knowing how the two services vary in terms of operation, the main solution for reducing the congestion in Yangon City can be established. Further, the taxi stationary duration information is useful for knowing the taxi trip hotspot points in each township in Yangon. This may lead to support in defining proposed taxi stands in Yangon City.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution is associated with the ever-increasing requirements for vocational training. The important factors that are required for the qualitative change of vocational training include increasing the diversity of the vocational training programs, optimization of the school network, increasing the effectiveness and interaction between primary vocational training and the training systems of the labor market, and effective improvement of the qualification/competences of vocational teachers. The understanding of the changing role of vocational teachers and the expression of their competences are directly related to the learning motivation, self-education, striving for continuous education, and orientation towards the improvement of the acquired professional qualification among the learners of vocational training centers. This paper presents theoretical insights into the vocational teachers' competences, comparing the documents that regulate European and Lithuanian vocational training, and presents the results of the interview of a focus group with vocational teachers of Kaunas city vocational training centers. The qualitative study aimed at revealing which competences were expressed among vocational teachers in the context of the fourth industrial revolution. The study showed that the vocational teachers regarded the group of functional (activity) competences as most important for the quality of their work and recognized the influence of the fourth industrial revolution on changes in their competences.

AB  - Mistletoes are a group of flowering plants that have developed a parasitic lifeform through complex eco-evolutionary processes. Despite being considered a pest, mistletoes represent a keystone forest resource and are involved in complex plant-plant and plant-animal interactions. Their parasitic lifeform and specialized ecological interactions make mistletoes an ideal model with which to understand the effects of anthropogenic disturbances in a changing world. The accelerated growth of the human population has altered all ecosystems on Earth, leading to biodiversity loss. Land-use changes (involving habitat loss, fragmentation, degradation, and transformation processes) can alter the ecological scenario for mistletoe by altering hosts, mutualists, and nutrient cycling. Those changes may have large consequences at the community level, changing the spatial structure of mistletoes, as well as interaction effectiveness, facilitation process, interaction disruption, and novel interactions with invasive species, leading to non-analog communities in the long run. Furthermore, climate change effects operate on a global scale, enhancing the effects of land-use changes. As temperatures increase, many species would alter their distribution and phenology, potentially causing spatial and temporal mismatches. But more critical is the fact that water stress is likely to disrupt key ecological interactions. Thus, mistletoes can provide valuable insights for what we can expect in the future, as a result of human disturbances.

AB  - Heavy metals have been recognized as potential factors driving the evolution and development of antibiotic resistance. However, the relative effects of cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) on the prevalence and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) remain unclear. We investigated the co-selection effects of Cd and As on ARGs in 45 paddy soils polluted by heavy metals, using high-throughput quantitative PCR. A total of 119 ARGs and 9 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were detected in all samples. Regression analysis showed that the single pollution index (PIAs and PICd) and Nemerow integrated pollution index (NIPI) both had significant and positive correlations with ARGs (P < 0.05), indicating the co-selective effects of Cd and As on ARGs distribution. The significant correlations between bacterial taxa and different ARGs in network analysis revealed potential hosts of ARGs. Structural equation models indicated that the effects of As on ARGs were stronger than that of Cd. The profile of ARGs could be impacted by Cd and As indirectly by strongly affecting the bacterial abundance. Overall, this study extended our knowledge about the co-selection of Cd and As on ARGs in paddy soil, and had important implications for assessing the potential risks of ARGs in paddy soils.

AB  - The present article reflects on the paradigm of coexistence with the semiarid based on the history that is evidenced by the Pernambucano Forum for confronting Drought -Drought Forum (1989-1996) as a political project that announces paths of resistance and struggle. The Drought Forum is a necessary reference in discussing the issue of drought from a political perspective in the occasion of the Public Act of occupation of the Northeast Development Superintendence - SUDENE in March, 1993. Analyzing the consequences of these movements we focus onto the city of Serra Talhada, in the semiarid of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil, as a privileged site of discussions. In this city, the Drought Forum meant much more than a movement demanding permanent actions to combat drought, but the beginning of a political project capable of legitimacy within the state through the notion of coexistence with the semiarid. The present arguments were provided by qualitative research based on the analysis of historical documents and on two semi-structured interviews which led us to the Forum. The intertwining of narratives made possible to understand that such resistance movements have a lot to teach our modus vivendi and invite us to defend historical achievements.

AB  - In the recent times, considerable urbanisation has taken place in few places around the world. This urbanisation has occurred due to rapid development in various industries. Furthermore, urbanisation has lead to an increase in movement of the people from rural to urban centres in search of employment. As people kept moving from urban to rural areas there has been a constant demand for the extension of built-up area. As a result of which, the land which was once covered by green vegetation having permeable and low emissivity is now replaced by built-up area with impermeable land and high emissivity. In addition to this, the surface of these built up areas absorbs solar radiation during the day time and emit radiation during the night time and causes increase in surface temperature. The rate of temperature is higher in urban built up area when compared to the rural counterpart making Urban Heat Island (UHI). In this study, an attempt is made to investigate the impact of urbanisation and formation of UHI in the Tirupur region around the corporation limit. The land use land cover (LULC) pattern mapping was carried out through maximum likelihood supervised classification technique for the years 1991, 2001, 2009, 2011 and 2018. Along with this study, Land Surface Temperature (LST) was estimated using Landsat satellite data of the years 2001 and 2018. Furthermore, the impact on LST shows that the urban area has relatively higher LST when compared to the surrounding rural area. Thus it is found that UHI has formed in the region.

AB  - Two parapatric Rattus norvegicus subspecies, R. n. humiliatus (RNH) and R. n. caraco (RNC), are classified according to morphological divergence and are mainly distributed in North and Northeast China. Here, we aimed to explore the population genetic structure, genetic boundary, and gene flow in these rats using 16 microsatellite loci. Structure analysis and principal component analysis revealed 3 ancestral clusters. We found that the intermediate cluster exhibited higher genetic diversity and a lower inbreeding coefficient than the other 2 clusters. The genetic differentiation between the 3 clusters was significant but weak, with a higher F-ST value being observed between the clusters on both sides. The subspecies boundary inferred from microsatellite markers may indicate the existence of an admixture or hybridization area covering Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and Jilin Provinces, rather than corresponding to the administrative provincial boundaries between Liaoning and Jilin. The RNH and RNC subspecies presented moderate gene exchange and an asymmetric bidirectional gene flow pattern, with higher gene flow from the RNH subspecies to the RNC subspecies, constraining speciation. Such genetic characteristics might be explained by biological processes such as dispersal ability, mate choice, and dynamic lineage boundaries.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is one of the major health concerns of the present century. The direct discharge of urban sewage, hospital effluents, and pharmaceutical wastes increases the concentration of antibiotics in riverine ecosystems. This provides selection pressure for the development of novel antibiotic-resistant strains. In this study, metagenomics approach was employed a for constructing a comprehensive profile of the Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) identified in the sediments of the Yamuna River. A total of 139 ARGs were identified from 39 microbial species. Abundance analysis revealed that, aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, macrolide, and tetracycline resistance genes were highly abundant in the sediment samples obtained from the Yamuna River. The evolutionary relationships among the ARGs were studied by phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that, the identified resistome comprised eight clusters. Network analysis was performed for investigating the broad-spectrum profiles of the ARGs and their enrichment in different biological functions and pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses revealed that, 76, 36, 18, and 5 Gene Ontology (GO)-terms were significantly enriched in Biological process, Molecular Function, Cellular Component, and KEGG Pathways analysis, respectively. The present study elucidates the ecology of microbial antibiotic resistance in the riverine ecosystem of the Yamuna River and provides novel insights into the environmental hotspots that are amenable to the emergence of ARGs in the contaminated riverine hydrosphere.

TI  - Attitudes towards the Use of Violence against Police among Occupy Wall Street Protesters
T2  - POLICING-A JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA  - English
AB  - Although many social movement participants claim to embrace non-violent civil disobedience strategies, protesters tend to have heterogeneous views on the morality and utility of engaging in violence. In particular, protesters sometimes view violence against the police as warranted, especially if they perceive that police have treated them or their peers in a procedurally unjust or excessively forceful manner. This article examines the nature and correlates of attitudes towards the use of violence against police officers among Occupy Wall Street (OWS) protesters in New York City. Data were drawn from in-person surveys of 302 OWS participants on the 6-month anniversary of the movement in March 2012. Our findings reveal that in this context, respondents who perceive that police use unjust force against protesters are significantly more likely to endorse the use of violence against police.

AB  - Impacts of urban development on aquatic populations are often complex and difficult to ascertain, but population genetic analysis has allowed researchers to monitor and estimate gene flow in the context of existing and future hydroelectric projects. The Lower Mekong Basin is undergoing rapid hydroelectric development with around 50 completed and under-construction dams and 95 planned dams. The authors investigated the baseline genetic diversity of two exploited migratory fishes, the mud carpHenicorhynchus lobatus(five locations), and the rat-faced pangasiid catfish,Helicophagus leptorhynchus(two locations), in the Lower Mekong Basin using the genomic double digest restriction site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing method. In both species, fish sampled upstream of Khone Falls were differentiated from those collected at other sites, andN(e)estimates at the site above the falls were lower than those at other sites. This was the first study to utilize thousands of RAD-generated single nucleotide polymorphisms to indicate that the Mekong's Khone Falls are a potential barrier to gene flow for these two moderately migratory species. The recent completion of the Don Sahong dam across one of the only channels for migratory fishes through Khone Falls may further exacerbate signatures of isolation and continue to disrupt the migration patterns of regionally vital food fishes. In addition,H. lobatuspopulations downstream of Khone Falls, including the 3S Basin and Tonle Sap system, displayed robust connectivity. Potential obstruction of migration pathways between these river systems resulting from future dam construction may limit dispersal, which has led to elevated inbreeding rates and even local extirpation in other fragmented riverine species.

AB  - Eucalyptus benthamii is a threatened species with a restricted range to the southwest of Sydney, Australia. One extant subpopulation is relatively secure within a closed water catchment in the Kedumba Valley. However, the other main subpopulation, which once probably had a more-extensive distribution along the Nepean River, is now fragmented due to clearing for agriculture and urban development. This has impacted on reproductive success and recruitment. Planting of trees in urbanised areas and other locations along the Nepean River has been ongoing for over 20 years and is an important circa situm conservation measure. Government policy has been to plant trees that are of local provenance, however it is difficult to know whether this policy has been properly implemented: it is possible that planting stock may have been sourced from the Kedumba subpopulation. Microsatellite markers were used to examine the probable origins and kinship of 133 planted trees from 15 planted sites around Camden, NSW. Population assignment confirmed that the majority of planted trees are probably from the local Nepean River subpopulation, although some were identified that are very likely to have originated from the Kedumba Valley. While the overall diversity of the planted trees is high, kinship within individual planted stands is often elevated, increasing the potential for inbreeding and limiting their usefulness as seed sources. This probably reflects seed sourced from a narrow genetic base. We discuss the findings and their implications in the context of the species' management and conservation strategy.

AB  - This discussion paper deals with the participation in the exhibition entitled The "Greater Number". This exhibition was the ghost stage of the Milan Triennale XIV in 1968. A scenario that could be perceived as an inverted "amarcord" today. The exhibition was organized with the Italian architect Giancarlo De Carlo in a leading role. The "Greater Number" defined the construction details, invited prestigious speakers, attracted international participants, designed the physical space, and called on the media. However, it did not take place. It was absent and occupied, a priori, by a citizen's movement, by a generalized and crystalline discontent on an international scale. In the face of the tangible crisis of May 1968, we now find the "intangible" one of May 2020. This is when the debate on The "Greater Number" and "participation" in the city arose again 50 years later.

AB  - When 3D modeling of the geological body is carried out based on the section, problems such as unable to close the structural plane, slow rendering speed of the model and uneven and long and narrow section triangle network will occur due to the situation of super near point or too dense fold point. To solve the appealing problem, this paper proposes a section thinning-densification method based on the Douglas Peucker algorithm and equidistance algorithm. When processing the original section data, the Douglas Peucker algorithm is used for thinning, and then the equal distance is used for density increase. In this way, the section obtained by thinning-densification method solves the problem of uneven break points on the original section line and does not affect the shape of the section line, effectively solving the problem caused by too dense or too sparse break points on the section line in 3D geological modeling Series of modeling problems. In this paper, through the research on the modeling method of the above ground structure, the application demonstration of the above-ground and underground integrated three-dimensional model construction in Chengdu International Biological city is carried out, which verifies that the above-ground and underground integrated three-dimensional model construction technology is feasible and applicable and worthy of promotion.

AB  - Large-scale structural interventions and "Big Events" like revolutions, wars and major disasters can affect HIV transmission by changing the sizes of at-risk populations, making high-risk behaviors more or less likely, or changing contexts in which risk occurs. This paper describes new measures to investigate hypothesized pathways that could connect macro-social changes to subsequent HIV transmission. We developed a "menu" of novel scales and indexes on topics including norms about sex and drug injecting under different conditions, experiencing denial of dignity, agreement with cultural themes about what actions are needed for survival or resistance, solidarity and other issues. We interviewed 298 at-risk heterosexuals and 256 men who have sex with men in New York City about these measures and possible validators for them. Most measures showed evidence of criterion validity (absolute magnitude of Pearson's r >= 0.20) and reliability (Cronbach's alpha >= 0.70). These measures can be (cautiously) used to understand how macro-changes affect HIV and other risk. Many can also be used to understand risk contexts and dynamics in more normal situations. Additional efforts to improve and to replicate the validation of these measures should be conducted.

AB  - The transportation network enables movement of people and goods and is the basis of economic activity. Recently, short-term locally heavy rains occur frequently in urban areas, causing serious obstacles to road flooding and increasing economic and social effects. Therefore, in advanced weather countries, many studies have been conducted on realistic and reliable impact forecasting by analyzing socioeconomic impacts, not just information transmission as weather forecasts. In this paper, we use the Spatial Runoff Assessment Tool (S-RAT) and Flood Inundation model (FLO-2D model) to calculate the flooding level in urban areas caused by rainfall and use the flooding rate. In addition, the rainfall flood depth curve and the Flood Vehicle Speed curve were presented during the analysis, and the traffic disruption map was prepared using this. The results of this study were compared with previous studies and verified by rainfall events in 2011. As a result of the verification, the result was similar to the actual flooding, and when the same rainfall occurred within the range of the target area, it was confirmed that there were sections that could not be passed and sections that could be passed smoothly. Therefore, the results suggested in this study will be helpful for the driver's route selection by using the urban flood damage analysis and vehicle driving speed analysis.

AB  - The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) contain many important absorption bands relevant for characterizing organic matter (OM) and obtaining organic matter to organic carbon (OM/OC) ratios. However, extracting this information quantitatively - accounting for overlapping absorption bands and relating absorption to molar abundance - and furthermore relating abundances of functional groups to that of carbon atoms poses several challenges. In this work, we define a set of parameters that model these relationships and apply a probabilistic framework to identify values consistent with collocated field measurements of thermal-optical reflectance organic carbon (TOR OC). Parameter values are characterized for various sample types identified by cluster analysis of sample FTIR spectra, which are available for 17 sites in the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) monitoring network (7 sites in 2011 and 10 additional sites in 2013). The cluster analysis appears to separate samples according to predominant influence by dust, residential wood burning, wildfire, urban sources, and biogenic aerosols.
   Functional groups calibrations of aliphatic CH, alcohol COH, carboxylic acid COOH, carboxylate COO, and amine NH2 combined together reproduce TOR OC concentrations with reasonable agreement (r = 0.96 for 2474 samples) and provide OM/OC values generally consistent with our current best estimate of ambient OC. The mean OM/OC ratios corresponding to sample types determined from cluster analysis range between 1.4 and 2.0, though ratios for individual samples exhibit a larger range. Trends in OM/OC for sites aggregated by region or year are compared with another regression approach for estimating OM/OC ratios from a mass closure equation of the major chemical species contributing to PM fine mass. Differences in OM/OC estimates are observed according to estimation method and are explained through the sample types determined from spectral profiles of the PM.

AB  - For a long time, limestone has been massively used in stone building and monuments because of its easy extraction and common presence in the landscape. On ancient monuments, mostly built in urban areas, it is exposed to urban-borne pollutants responsible for specific alteration mechanisms and weathering kinetics. Especially, the dissolution of calcite and the precipitation of new phases will affect the limestone pore network, modify the stones capillary properties, and influence the further alteration. In order to better understand these processes, an altered limestone sample from 'Tribunal Administratif' (TA) in Paris was studied. The main secondary phase was found to be syngenite, which can be explained by the location of the sample close to the soil, a potential source of K (fertilizers). This phase is more soluble than gypsum that is commonly found on altered limestone. In order to assess the reactivity of the system (limestone and new phases), oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were used to trace the transfer of water ((D2O)-O-18) and identify the location of the reactive areas (susceptible to alteration). For that, TA samples were exposed in a climatic chamber to relative humidity (RH) cycles (25% RH for 2.5 days and 85% RH for 4.5 days) for 2 months with a (D2O)-O-18 vapor to simulate alteration occurring in conditions sheltered from the rain. Results have shown that the water vapor easily circulates deep in the sample and reacts preferentially with syngenite the most reactive phase (compared with calcite and quartz). This phase could evolve in gypsum when exposed to an environment different from the one resulting in its formation.

AB  - Collaboration has been the key to success for urban forest management in Colorado, not only collaboration amongst agencies at all levels of government but also in engaging industry allies, coordinating education and outreach efforts and in fostering community support. A unique interagency team, the Emerging Pests in Colorado (EPIC) Workgroup, was formed in 2009 to address the immediate threat from Thousand Cankers Disease (TCD) of walnut and to plan for the arrival of other invasive urban forest pests to Colorado. When the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) (EAB) was detected in Boulder, Colorado in 2013, it marked the westernmost occurrence of EAB in the US, threatening millions of planted and naturalized ash trees representing over 25 percent of the tree canopy throughout Colorado's urban and riparian forests. The detection in Boulder prompted the development of a second multi-agency group, the Colorado EAB Response Team (CORT). The preparedness and established working relationships between stakeholders and responsible authorities allowed for a quick, decisive and unified response. We review as a case study: (1) the formation and history of collaborative interagency groups in Colorado; (2) how the interagency collaborative planning and post-detection EAB response have supported community forestry programmes throughout the state; (3) development of the post-detection EAB management plan and economics behind the strategy in Boulder, Colorado; and (4) the proactive EAB planning and outreach efforts underway in Denver, Colorado.

AB  - The main objective of this work was to determine the presence of anisakid larvae in fresh Chilean hake Merluccius gayi gayi coming from the coastal area near the city of Talca, Chile, commonly commercialized by a regional fish supply center located in the same city. Flesh and viscera of 214 fish were analyzed via direct observation, and the prevalence of parasitism was calculated. The results showed a prevalence of 100% and 24.3% in viscera and flesh, respectively. Morphologic characterization of 138 randomly selected larvae was performed via diaphanization technique, observing 106 larvae of Anisakis spp., 13 larvae of Pseudoterranova spp. and 19 nematodes classified as "unidentified." All larvae here analyzed were viable based on the spontaneous movement ability of parasites. Overall, the high prevalence of fish infected with Anisakidae larvae highlights the importance of taking early intervention actions in order to prevent the occurrence of anisakidosis in the human Chilean population; particularly critical given the current culinary preference for raw fish dishes such as ceviche and sushi, which poses a public health issue.

AB  - In this study, a triangulation of (a) spatial data, (b) self-awareness, and (c) behavioral self-analysis seeks to provide an explanation from an innovative perspective for the likelihood of the occurrence of predatory crimes in the city center. This study does not examine the circumstances in which criminal acts occur. Instead, it focuses on a broader concept that combines both the configurational factors and the behavioral interconnections in which criminal acts occur. We orient the occurrence probability of crime towards appropriate objectives in the presence or absence of attractors/detractors, with interesting variation in the behavior of the acting subject-in our case, a random walker (also called the Random Movement-displacement Agent, or RDMA, in the text), which is the key variable that triggers the occurrence probability of predatory crimes. The relationship between spatial and/or behavioral observations and the probability of the crimes that may result from such observations is limited in this text to "predatory crimes," which are the most common and light forms of crimes that endanger both human quality of life and the related safety in the city. Such crimes include theft, damage (specifically crime against public property and all similar offensive acts, such as littering and incivility), physical attacks (restrained to attempted violence against defenseless people), robberies, and car thefts (i.e., the most frequent crimes in urban areas). The theory of complexity, specifically as illustrated by the in-depth work of the 20th century German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, also suggests the importance of self-analysis in specific contexts to construct a mosaic of social phenomena. We conducted both a behavioral self-survey and a metric-based self-analysis by measuring random walks (RWs) to achieve some common behaviors-for example, buying food, shopping, or just looking at shop windows-on the streets of downtown Hamburg, Germany. RWs are used in our article to indicate random walks in the city center and any activities that may arise from them, such as protecting oneself from potentially hostile contexts, seeking information, or conforming oneself to official signals and customs. The hundreds of images taken by us in October 2019 during their RWs in Hamburg form a reservoir of our pictures, with the aim of showing the acceptable patterns of random movements-displacements that emerge. This method was primarily discursive but based on the ongoing search for a transformative conduit of behaviors that were intuitively established and observable for us but actually involved a complex process of imaginative ideation that was impossible to promote and pass on to the reader.

AB  - The emergency management system is a complex network consisting of structural components, such as buildings, infrastructure and emergency areas, and non-structural elements, such as procedures, emergency workers, information management, etc. This document describes the evaluation of only its structural components. The system was adopted at the territorial scale and is defined by a multi-municipality area extension. This paper presents a methodology for the probabilistic evaluation of operating the emergency structural system in the case of a seismic event occurrence and, in detail, it highlights the methodology for calculating the seismic hazard including seismic local effects (amplification and permanent co-seismic effects). Systemic seismic risk and associated impact were considered in a rigorous and unified way. Moreover, the importance of the interconnection and interdependence between elements at risk belonging to the same system and between different networks at urban or territorial scales is well known. The aim of the proposed methodology is to evaluate the operational losses of an emergency system considering the connections between the components of the system, contributing, in an original way, to the estimation of the seismic effects. The fundamental characteristics of this calculation are:
   Estimating ground motion amplification at the territorial scale using a Vs30 from a probabilistic map obtained with the seismic microzonation national database;
   Estimating shaking scenarios in terms of PGA and PGV depending on the Vs30;
   Co-seismic permanent failure and deformations (landslide and liquefaction) evaluated with regression logistic methods.
   Finally, a case study is presented showing the application of the methodology on a real emergency system in an area of southern Italy.

AB  - Data relating to contact mixing patterns among humans are essential for the accurate modeling of infectious disease transmission dynamics. Here, we describe contact mixing patterns among migrant workers in urban settings in Thailand, based on a survey of 369 migrant workers of three nationalities. Respondents recorded their demographic data, including age, sex, nationality, workplace, income, and education. Each respondent chose a single day to record their contacts; this resulted in a total of more than 8300 contacts. The characteristics of contacts were recorded, including their age, sex, nationality, location of contact, and occurrence of physical contact. More than 75% of all contacts occurred among migrants aged 15 to 39 years. The contacts were highly clustered in this age group among migrant workers of all three nationalities. There were far fewer contacts between migrant workers with younger and older age groups. The pattern varied slightly among different nationalities, which was mostly dependent upon the types of jobs taken. Half of migrant workers always returned to their home country at most once a year and on a seasonal basis. The present study has helped us gain a better understanding of contact mixing patterns among migrant workers in urban settings. This information is useful both when simulating disease epidemics and for guiding optimal disease control strategies among this vulnerable section of the population.

Climatic comfort maps were created by ArcMap10.3 software using Kriging Method. Difference maps for climatic comfort and NDVI values of satellite images between 2006 - 2016 were created. At the pixel scale, these data were used for teaching artificial neural network model by Neural Designer software in randomly selected 500 points. All NDVI values (-1 -1) and possible vegetation changes (-1 -1) that could occurs in the study area were entered as input to the trained neural network model and the possible values of climate comfort change values were determined.
   Results: Most significant 2006 NDVI average and mean values were observed at 0.7, 0.6 and 0.5. In the value of NDVI in 2016 forecast, climatic comfort values could get higher in an area which can change into a mediocre or low vegetation value. The maximum average and mean values were 1.0, 0.9 and 0.8. This forecast shows that there could be positive and negative major changes between the climatic comfort values that may occur.
   Interpretation: Artificial neural networks are the recent ways for such studies and are rapidly developing. Understanding artificial neural networks boundaries and advantages will allow for more efficient modeling tools. As in every part of life, the use of artificial neural networks is expected to increase day by day in landscape planning and design studies.

AB  - Constructed in the 1980s, the BCR Corridors complex is the most iconic building at Qatar University (QU). However, it is also notorious for way-finding difficulties. The problem appears to derive from the repetitive similarity of individual parts in its modular design. Elevators, stairwells, screens, and temporary installations also create impediments to user readability and visibility. Collectively, this tends to complicate its relationship to the immediate context of the university campus. Recently, researchers at QU conducted a post-occupancy evaluation (PoE) of the BCR Corridors. It included (1) direct observation of movement flows and static occupation of space in common areas, (2) room use and photographic surveys, and (3) computer modeling of the spatial layout using space syntax. Space syntax is an international research program of academics and practitioners studying the role of built space in society from the single building to entire cities. The purpose of the PoE study was to understand observed patterns of movement and space use with reference to the problems for way-finding in the BCR Corridors. Based on this, researchers developed proposals for design alterations to enable easier use of the complex. The findings of the study support the above hypothesis about navigation problems in the building.

AB  - The Iiyama slope failure occurred in the early morning of May 19, 2017, in Nagano Prefecture, central Japan. It caused a debris flow in the Idegawa River, resulting in the evacuation of the residents of the neighboring areas for half a year. Since the source was located in a mountainous area, the cause of the debris flow was not discovered immediately.
   To investigate the mechanism of this slope failure, we performed a field survey and obtained aerial photos of the slope failure using an unmanned aerial vehicle. Additionally, we analyzed seismic data recorded by the surrounding stations, to identify the ground motion generated by the mass movements.
   We found that the Iiyama slope failure involved two major mass movements: a large landslide and a subsequent debris flow triggered by the landslide. The movement of the landslide was recorded with long-period seismic waveforms, and the estimated force history showed a unidirectional movement from north to south for 50 s, reaching a maximum velocity of about 6.6 m/s. Following, debris flew for about 5 km from the top of the landslide source area. The initial collapse produced a large shaking with a short-period component, and the signal gradually decayed as the debris flow traveled along the river.
   Our study shows that the two mass movements in the Iiyama slope failure generated ground motions with completely different frequencies. This suggests that the ground motions recorded by the seismometer are significant for understanding the movement mechanism of slope failure. The seismic signal, combined with the aerial photos, helps us to understand the dynamic movement history of the landslide.

AB  - Anthropogenic modifications at catchments scale may be reconducted primarily at soil sealing and streams culverting, even if important consequences result from roads density and, more in general, infrastructures as they cause landscape fragmentation, and agricultural areas extension. Their most important outcomes in terms of hydrologic balance are the decreasing time of concentration and the increasing flood risk at catchment scale. The research introduces a methodological approach to classify the degree of anthropogenic modifications at catchment scale: clustering techniques have been applied to 508 catchments in a high-risk flooding sector of the Mediterranean region. Then, flood data recorded in the study area in the 1900-2018 period have been compared to clustering classification, pointing out the relationships with soil sealing and hydrographical network culverting in the catchment.
   The analysis has been performed considering fourteen subsets of 8 descriptive parameters each that differ in the evaluation of culverting in the terminal part of the hydrographical network; the analysis has been conducted identifying the optimal number of descriptive parameters and the corresponding best number of clusters on quantitative basis. The results show that three classes clustering is the more appropriate from a computational point of view. That division looks coherent with the features of the studied basins and is well correlated with floods occurrence in the last 100 years.
   Finally, the proposed methodology of anthropogenic disturbance classification at catchment scale may be applied to other areas even adapting and implementing other descriptive parameters. Then, it may be used to support the planning of mitigation strategies in term of flood risk. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat requirements of Hydromedusa tectifera from an urban impacted stream from the Buenos Aires province, the Rodriguez stream, are here studied. We describe the type of underwater refuges, how they are used in different stream sections, stream margins, year season, size class and sex of the individuals, and analyze patterns of recurrence and aggregative use of refuges. Fieldwork was carried out from March 2017 to January 2018. Turtles were caught manually recording the following variables: site, transect and margin, sex, straight carapace length, and weight. Substrate types are differently used according to stream section, stream margin, year season and size class of individuals, but no difference was found between sexes. In the whole stream, most used refuges were the hollows on the margins (55.05%), followed by marginal aquatic vegetation (19.27%). Turtles of all class sizes and both sexes refuge into hollows on the stream margins. Despite different microhabitats provide refuge to turtles during all year seasons, hollows are the most important refuge during extreme cold and extreme hot seasons. In addition, turtle recaptures evidence a recurrence and aggregative pattern in the use of refuges. This information provides insight into the key aspects of the microhabitat requirements of the species and will be certainly useful in mitigating and preventing negative effects of the current stream management policies. It is worth highlighting the need to keep the stream margins unaltered to favor the presence of turtles in urban environments.

AB  - Coastal dynamics have a significant effect on the use of coastal resources where more than 60 percent of cities in the world develop in this region and use it for urban infrastructure, settlements, and economic development. shoreline change is one of many indicators of coastal dynamics which is the result of interaction between biotic, abiotic and human activities which further influences policy and management practices for coastal areas. This paper presents the results of study on shoreline dynamics in Pariaman, West Sumatra using vector analysis in DSAS 4.3 between 1988-2003 and 2003-2018. The shoreline is interpreted from three Landsat images, namely Landsat 5 TM 1988, Landsat 7 ETM + 2003 and Landsat 8 OLI / TIRS 2018 that have been corrected (radiometric and geometric). The shorelines derived from Landsat combined with shoreline from topographic map by Badan Informasi Geospasial (BIG) as baseline for net shoreline movement (NSM) and end point rate (EPR) analysis. Then, The data of shoreline changes is used as a basis for qualitative analysis of local government policies on coastal management. The results show that shoreline changes occur dynamically wherein 1988-2003 abrasion occurred with an average rate of 2.88 m/yr and accretion of 1.64 m/ yr while in the 2003-2018 an abrasion rate of 2.76 m/yr occurred and accretion rate 1.12 m/ yr. This condition occurs along with the increase of longshore current speed. Some of the locations also have faster abrasion and accretion rates due to structural built.

AB  - Objective: Due to the reduced physical ability of elderly, the occurrence of non-collision incidents is higher for these passengers in standing position. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to determine the critical time points of non-collision incidents using the level of leg muscle activity in elderly standing passengers on urban bus. Methods: To determine the critical time points in the occurrence of non-collision incidents, the level of muscular activity of the standing passengers was analyzed using a surface electromyography (surface EMG) device during the movement scenario of the bus. The results of assessing the leg muscle activity was analyzed in SPSS software. Results: The contraction pattern of the leg muscles in standing passengers was consistent with Newton's First Law. The results showed that the level of muscular activity decreased in the right leg muscles when changing the phase of bus motion from acceleration to constant velocity. This level of muscular activity in the left leg muscles increased when constant velocity changed to deceleration. These changes were quite significant in the medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (P < 0.05). Conclusions: According to these findings, it was found that the acceleration and deceleration phases, especially the starting and changing phases of bus motion, are the most critical time points in the occurrence of non-collision incidents in elderly standing passengers on urban bus.

AB  - This article explores the potential that community-led digital engagement with heritage holds for stimulating active citizenship through taking responsibility for shared cultural heritage and for fostering long-lasting relationships between local community heritage groups and national museums. Through the lens of a pilot project titled Science Museum: Community-in-Residence, we discovered that - despite working with community groups that were already loyal to and enjoyed existing working ties with the Science Museum in London, United Kingdom - this undertaking proved challenging owing to a range of structural and logistical issues even before the application of digital devices and tools had been considered. These challenges notwithstanding, the pilot found that the creation of time and space for face-to-face dialogue and interactions between the Science Museum and the participating community heritage groups helped to establish the parameters within which digital co-curation can effectively occur. This, in turn, informed the development of a digital prototype with huge potential to enable remote, virtual connectivity to, and interactivity with, conversations about shared heritage. The ultimate goal was twofold: (a) to help facilitate collaborative sense-making of our shared past and (b) to aid the building of sustainable institutional and community/public working ties around emerging affinities, agendas and research questions in relation to public history and heritage.

AB  - Background
   The coexistence of undernutrition (thinness) and overnutrition (overweight/obesity) among children and adolescents is a public health concern in low-middle-income countries. Accurate prevalence estimates of thinness and overweight/obesity among children and adolescents are unavailable in many low-middle-income countries due to lack of data. Here we describe the prevalences and examine correlates of objectively measured weight status among urban and rural schoolchildren in Mozambique.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study design was applied to recruit 9-11-year-old schoolchildren (n = 683) from 17 urban and rural primary schools in Mozambique. Body mass index (BMI) was computed from objectively measured height and weight and participants' weight categories were determined using the World Health Organization cut-points. Actigraph GT3X + accelerometers were worn 24 hours per day for 7 days to assess movement behaviours. Multilevel multivariable modelling was conducted to estimate odds ratios and confidence intervals.
   Results
   Combined prevalence of overweight/obesity (11.4%) was significantly higher among urban participants compared to rural participants (5.7%; chi(2) = 7.1; p = 0.008). Conversely, thinness was more prevalent among rural (6.3%) compared to urban (4.2%) participants. Passive school commute, not meeting daily moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) guidelines, and maternal BMI > 25 kg/m(2) were associated with overweight/obesity while possessing one or more functional cars at home, maternal BMI > 25 kg/m(2) and being an older participant were associated with thinness in the present sample. The proportion of total variance in the prevalences of obesity and/or thinness occurring at the school level was 8.7% and 8.3%, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Prevalences of thinness, overweight/obesity and other key variables differ between urban and rural schoolchildren in Mozambique. MVPA, active transport and mother's BMI are important modifiable correlates of weight status among Mozambican schoolchildren.
   Results
   from this study demonstrate important differences between urban and rural schoolchildren that should not be ignored when designing interventions to manage malnutrition, formulating public health strategies, and interpreting findings.

AB  - Over the last decade, warehousing and distribution centers have decentralized to the urban peripheries where land is cheaper and readily available. This change in location patterns has been driven by the demand to build more modernized and larger facilities to accommodate an ever-increasing influx of freight. Since efficient freight movement is essential for the smooth functioning of metropolitan areas, decentralization should occur everywhere. However, this is not necessarily true. It is hypothesized that depending on the volume of goods movement and the spatial distribution of land prices, the extent of decentralization varies across metropolitan areas. This hypothesis is tested using 48 US metropolitan areas. Results provide robust evidence that high land prices push large warehouses away from central locations. When freight demand and land prices are not as high, the effect becomes insignificant. Indeed, not only is decentralization linked with large metro areas but also with very large warehouses.

AB  - Analysis of a small earthquake swarm near Virginia City, NV, reveals complex structural features, including an interplay of both fluid-driven and aseismic-driven earthquake migration within a naturally occurring tectonic sequence. The Virginia City earthquake sequence occurred over similar to 10 days in January 2014. We relocate 305 events to reveal three separate, well-defined planar structures. The earthquakes initially migrate at a rate consistent with pore fluid diffusion, outlining a moderately dipping plane. The earthquakes then jump to a vertical plane and migrate at a higher rate; the sequence continues to migrate rapidly onto a third, shallowly dipping plane, consistent with rates observed elsewhere associated with aseismic creep. Focal mechanisms indicate right-lateral strike slip on the vertical plane and both normal and left-lateral strike slip movement on the other planes, and the newly imaged structures illuminate the orientation of active faults at depth in the Walker Lane tectonic region.
   Plain Language Summary Earthquake swarms remain an intriguing phenomenon as the characteristics and mechanics controlling their progression are poorly understood. In this work, we study a small seismic swarm in western Nevada to better understand both the progression of the swarm and the active faults in the region. The Virginia City Earthquake sequence occurred for similar to 10 days in January 2014 with over 300 events. Our analysis shows these events occurred across three distinct planes, with two different mechanisms driving the earthquake activity: pore fluid diffusion and aseismic slip. Our study demonstrates the presence of these mechanisms in this part of the Walker Lane tectonic region. Additionally, our study provides information on fault structures at depth.

AB  - Domestic and wild mammals, domestic birds and particularly wild birds are considered to be reservoirs of many species of Enterobacteriaceae, and also important human enteric pathogens, e.g., the bacteria of the genus Campylobacter that occur in their digestive tracts. These species may be vectors of antimicrobial resistance dissemination in the environment, because they may have contact with an environment contaminated with antibiotics. Bird feeders have been suggested as potential dispersal centres between wild wintering birds whose feeding is supported by humans. Therefore, we checked for the presence of Campylobacter bacteria among great tits Parus major, the most common bird species on bird feeders in Poland. Samples (n = 787 cloacal swabs) were collected in urban and rural areas of Poland. Bacterial species were identified using multiplex PCR, and 23 (2.9%) positive tests for Campylobacter spp. were found; in ten samples, C. jejuni was detected. The odds ratio of Campylobacter infection in rural birds was over 2.5 times higher than urban birds. Ten samples with C. jejuni were tested for antibiotic resistance, and all were sensitive to azithromycin, erythromycin and gentamycin, while six isolates were resistant to tetracycline, and five were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Four Campylobacter isolates were resistant to both these antibiotics.

AB  - Coastal wetlands, such as saltmarshes and mangroves that fringe transitional waters, deliver important ecosystem services that support human development. Coastal wetlands are complex social-ecological systems that occur at all latitudes, from polar regions to the tropics. This overview covers wetlands in five continents. The wetlands are of varying size, catchment size, human population and stages of economic development. Economic sectors and activities in and around the coastal wetlands and their catchments exert multiple, direct pressures. These pressures affect the state of the wetland environment, ecology and valuable ecosystem services. All the coastal wetlands were found to be affected in some ways, irrespective of the conservation status. The main economic sectors were agriculture, animal rearing including aquaculture, fisheries, tourism, urbanization, shipping, industrial development and mining. Specific human activities include land reclamation, damming, draining and water extraction, construction of ponds for aquaculture and salt extraction, construction of ports and marinas, dredging, discharge of effluents from urban and industrial areas and logging, in the case of mangroves, subsistence hunting and oil and gas extraction. The main pressures were loss of wetland habitat, changes in connectivity affecting hydrology and sedimentology, as well as contamination and pollution. These pressures lead to changes in environmental state, such as erosion, subsidence and hypoxia that threaten the sustainability of the wetlands. There are also changes in the state of the ecology, such as loss of saltmarsh plants and seagrasses, and mangrove trees, in tropical wetlands. Changes in the structure and function of the wetland ecosystems affect ecosystem services that are often underestimated. The loss of ecosystem services impacts human welfare as well as the regulation of climate change by coastal wetlands. These cumulative impacts and multi-stressors are further aggravated by indirect pressures, such as sea-level rise.

AB  - Off-ramp areas are considered the critical sections of urban expressways where the exiting vehicles and straight-through vehicles merge. Therefore, lane-change behaviors frequently occur at the upstream of the urban expressway off-ramp, which lead to high chance of traffic crashes. This study looks at the risk of lane-change behaviors in the multilane urban expressway off-ramp areas. First, lane-change process information of exit vehicles in urban expressway off-ramp area was extracted from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study (SH-NDS) database. Second, for each lane-change movements of exit vehicles, a risk evaluation indicator (risk perception, RP) was adopted to quantify the lane-change risk. Based on the RP, the study proposed a four-rank risk classification criterion using K-means clustering to define the risk rank of each lane-change movement. Finally, a lane-change risk rank classification model was developed for traffic in the off-ramp areas of multilane expressways using four distinctive influencing factors. Four influencing factors, namely, traffic congestion level, demand lane change times, lane-change direction, and relative distance between vehicle and exit, were used to describe the traffic flow characteristics and exiting lane-change route for the modeling purpose. The risk model was developed using two support vector machine models, which were based on the partial binary tree structure and the directed acyclic graph structure, respectively. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the partial binary tree structure classifier was 65.71 % and the average AUC value was 0.9004, both of which shows a better performance of the partial binary tree structure classifier, compared with the directed acyclic graph structure classifier.

AB  - Tracing the aging progress of soot particles during transport is highly challenging. An Asian dust event could provide an ideal opportunity to trace the continuous aging progress of long-range-transported soot particles. Here, we collected individual aerosol particles at an inland urban site (T1) and a coastal urban site (T2) in China and a coastal site (T3) in southwestern Japan during an Asian dust event. Microscopic analysis showed that the number fraction of soot-bearing particles was 19 % and 16 % at T1 and T2 in China but surprisingly increased to 56 % at T3 in Japan. The dominant fresh soot (71 %) at T1 became partially embedded (68 %) at T2 and fully embedded (84 %) at T3. These results indicated that the tiny soot particles had lower deposition than other aerosol types and became more aged during the transport from T1 to T3. We quantified soot morphology using the fractal dimension and found an increasing trend of 1.65 at T1, 1.84 at T2, and 1.91 at T3. Furthermore, we found that the morphology compression of the soot aggregations was associated with secondary coating thickness and relative humidity. A unique mixing structure where multi-soot particles scattered in organic coatings instead of the sulfate core in individual core-shell particles was observed at T3 after the crossing of the East China Sea. The study provides understanding for important constraints of the soot morphological effects and provides a possible aging scale along with their transport pathway. These new findings will be helpful to improve optical calculations and regional climate modeling of soot particles during their transport in the atmosphere.

AB  - Shelters are places that receive certain species of domestic animals, mostly dogs and cats, that are normally abandoned. These animals are easy to handle because they are crowded and have limited movement. Dogs, due to the close relationship with humans, are considered the main domestic reservoirs in the peridomiciliary cycle of American trypanosomiasis infection in humans. Therefore, in several countries studies are carried out to assess the occurrence of infection in these animals. This work evaluated the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs from shelters in the city of Aracaju, Sergipe. This was an observational and cross-sectional study to detect the occurrence of T. cruzi in blood samples from shelter dogs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the TcZ1/TcZ2 primers. A total of 168 blood samples from dogs (104 females and 64 males) were collected and subjected to DNA and PCR extraction, and seventeen (10.1%) samples showed amplification of the product of the expected size. The TcZ1/TcZ2 primer pair used is considered specific for T. cruzi, and it is capable of amplifying all strains without amplifying other Trypanosoma species. The shelters evaluated had different physical infrastructure; animals positive for T. cruzi were found in all of them, as confirmed by sequencing. It is concluded that shelter dogs, as well as other domestic animals, can function as indicators of the occurrence of T. cruzi in Aracaju-SE, providing relevant epidemiological information for health surveillance and monitoring of Trypanosomatid infections.

AB  - Matching habitat choice is a unique, flexible form of habitat choice based on self-assessment of local performance. This mechanism is thought to play an important role in adaptation and population persistence in variable environments. Nevertheless, the operation of matching habitat choice in natural populations remains to be unequivocally demonstrated. We investigated the association between body colour and substrate use by ground-perching grasshoppers (Sphingonotus azurescens) in an urban mosaic of dark and pale pavements, and then performed a colour manipulation experiment to test for matching habitat choice based on camouflage through background matching. Naturally, dark and pale grasshoppers occurred mostly on pavements that provided matching backgrounds. Colour-manipulated individuals recapitulated this pattern, such that black-painted and white-painted grasshoppers recaptured after the treatment aggregated together on the dark asphalt and pale pavement, respectively. Our study demonstrates that grasshoppers adjust their movement patterns to choose the substrate that confers an apparent improvement in camouflage given their individual-specific colour. More generally, our study provides unique experimental evidence of matching habitat choice as a driver of phenotype-environment correlations in natural populations and, furthermore, suggests that performance-based habitat choice might act as a mechanism of adaptation to changing environments, including human-modified (urban) landscapes.

AB  - Consumption-side theorists of gentrification examine the flow of middle-class White people into previously working-class neighbourhoods and argue that their demand for housing stimulates gentrification. In contrast, production-side theorists emphasise the movement of capital into previously disinvested neighbourhoods and contend that profit-seeking development increases property values and sparks gentrification. Hybrid theorists argue that consumption and production occur simultaneously. This article operationalises arguments made by each approach, and asks: Do gentrifiers precede rising home values or do rising home values precede gentrifiers? To answer this question of sequence, we build a dataset of census and property tax assessment data for 2192 New York City census tracts between 2009 and 2016. Using cross-lagged regression models with tract and year fixed effects, we find neighbourhoods that experienced an increase in White, middle-class residents had related housing price spikes in each of the subsequent two years. A 1% increase in gentrifiers was associated with a subsequent 2.7% increase in property values. However, housing market growth did not predict future increases in gentrifiers. This suggests that consumption leads production during neighbourhood gentrification, and that developers are reactive, not proactive, in their investment decisions. Focusing on the sequence of gentrification's subsidiary elements enables city officials, non-profits and social movements to better anticipate gentrification and develop more targeted policies.

AB  - Rivers are representative of the overall contamination found in their catchment area. Contaminant concentrations in watercourses depend on numerous factors including land use and rainfall events. Globally, in Mediterranean regions, rainstorms are at the origin of fluvial multipollution phenomena as a result of Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) and floods. Large loads of urban-associated microorganisms, including faecal bacteria, are released from CSOs which place public health - as well as ecosystems - at risk. The impacts of freshwater contamination on river ecosystems have not yet been adequately addressed, as is the case for the release of pollutant mixtures linked to extreme weather events. In this context, microbial communities provide critical ecosystem services as they are the only biological compartment capable of degrading or transforming pollutants. Through the use of 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding of environmental DNA at different seasons and during a flood event in a typical Mediterranean coastal river, we show that the impacts of multipollution phenomena on structural shifts in the particle-attached riverine bacteriome were greater than those of seasonality. Key players were identified via multivariate statistical modelling combined with network module eigengene analysis. These included species highly resistant to pollutants as well as pathogens. Their rapid response to contaminant mixtures makes them ideal candidates as potential early biosignatures of multipollution stress. Multiple resistance gene transfer is likely enhanced with drastic consequences for the environment and human-health, particularly in a scenario of intensification of extreme hydrological events.

AB  - Among medium-sized carnivores, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) are the most abundant species in human-dominated landscapes worldwide. Both are known to be generalist predators that exploit a wide range of prey groups (e.g., mammals, birds, and invertebrates). Identifying red fox and domestic cat predation pressure on shared prey could shed light on their ecological role in shaping wildlife communities in human-dominated landscapes. Here, we assess the seasonal diet of red foxes and domestic cats in terms of composition, breadth, and overlap. Over two years, we collected their scats across three human-dominated study sites: park (n = 220 for foxes and n = 0 for cats), agricultural land (n = 159 for foxes and n = 146 for cats), and managed forest (n = 169 for foxes and n = 47 for cats). We detected similar diet breadth (B) for red foxes and domestic cats (B = 0.32 and B = 0.36, respectively) as well as strong dietary overlap (O = 0.83) between them. Moreover, the diet composition of both predators varied according to the study sites and seasons. Our results confirm the highly flexible trophic behaviour of these carnivores at the study sites, probably as a consequence of prey availability, and also the simultaneity of their predation over the same prey groups. Future studies should simultaneously monitor predator diet as well as predator and prey abundance in human-dominated landscapes to better understand the predatory impact of red foxes and domestic cats.

AB  - The rail passenger transport system in the state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN) serves the metropolitan region of Natal. This system allows the daily movement of 13 thousand passengers through Light Rail Vehicles (VLT) and Locomotives with passenger cars. This work evaluated the agents: whole body vibration, vibrations in hands and arms and occupational noise present in the activities of these workers. The results of the quantitative assessments were compared with the exposure limits provided for in Brazilian legislation and the criteria established by Fundacentro's occupational hygiene standards. Whole-body and hand-arm vibration data did not reach the daily exposure limit level set by Fundacentro standards NHO 09 and NHO 10, incorporated into the legal criteria from 2014. However, exposure to Whole body vibration of one of the two locomotives evaluated was above the action level. Regarding occupational noise, the daily dose was extrapolated according to legal parameters and those provided for by the NHO 01 Standard of Fundacentro.

AB  - The invasive yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina) was first detected in mainland Portugal in September 2001. The lack of information regarding the processes of species spread has hampered the development of adequate measures to mitigate the potential impact of this invasive predator.
   Crowdsourced data, i.e., information opportunistically reported by citizens, can facilitate the collection of numerous species occurrence records over large spatial scales, which can be valuable to understand the expansion of invasive species. Here, using validated crowdsourced data on the precise location of 49 013 nests, we: (i) update information regarding V. velutina distribution in Portugal; (ii) estimate the species expansion rate; and (iii) analyse the patterns of nests distribution at national and local scales.
   The species is currently distributed over an area of approximately 57 000 km(2), which corresponds to 62% of mainland Portugal. We estimated an average rate of 37.4 +/- 13.2 km/year for V. velutina expansion. Vespa velutina nests presented an aggregated distribution and nest density at the urban local-scale was estimated in 5.4 +/- 3.3 nests/km(2). The observed decrease in the nearest-neighbour nest distance over the years suggests that the density of nests has not reached its limit.
   We advocate that the development of a cheap and rapid method for nest detection and the study of fine-scale mechanisms leading to V. velutina dispersal are important steps to identify colonisation pathways and plan management approaches aiming to halt species spread and impact in apiaries.

AB  - The duality in China's traffic planning has given rise to the basic unit of urban form and function called the superblock, which is defined and bound by an arterial street network. The street network of China's superblock underpins the coexistence and interaction of global and local movement, the public and daily space, and affects place diversity and local characteristics. However, its configuration remains to be articulated because of the lack of a systematic representation method, and the associations between configuration and performance, cognition and design cannot be determined. This study proposes an improved representation method for the street network of China's superblocks based on Marshall's route structure analysis to explore the configurational characteristics and sustainability of the network. To fit local conditions, this study improves Marshall's route structure analysis from four perspectives, namely, the judgement of relative hierarchy, the node construction principle, and the deletion and addition of the original indicators. The improved method is then applied to calculate and compare the depth, connectivity, and complexity of the street networks of 10 sample super blocks in Nanjing, which are classified into six types by construction backgrounds, each having two scenarios differing by the level of publicity. Results indicate that the types formed in accordance with the "The Capital Plan" of the Republic of China, which presents a combination of fine orthogonal grids and radiations, and by the renewal of the traditional street-and lane network, which has the "characteristic structure" defined by Marshall, perform best in terms of configurational sustainability. The analysis also reveals that the addition of semipublic streets formed mainly from the bottom up narrows the sustainability gap among the samples. This study provides a tool for elaborate urban study and design and provides insights into the cognitive and practical aspects of China's urban planning and design.

AB  - Non-native plants can have strong effects on the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Recently, the American pokeweed (Phytolacca americana), indigenous to east United States, has expanded its range in many regions all over the world. The species combines several traits that facilitate its invasiveness and its impact on ecosystems in its introduced range. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of P. americana on multiple ground-dwelling arthropods by conducting a field survey in three forest sites in southwest Germany. Key findings were that P. americana invasion resulted in an altered arthropod community structure compared to native reference sites. Furthermore, the carabid species composition was influenced by the invasion, however this effect was dependent on the forest site. Contrasting effects of P. americana invasion on individual numbers of single ground-dwelling arthropod taxa were observed including positive (3 taxa), negative (1 taxa) and neutral effects (8 taxa). For 2 taxa (Carabidae and Formicidae) the effect of P. americana invasion was dependent on forest site. Reasons for the effects on the local fauna might be altered environmental conditions (reduced herbaceous plant cover) and biotic interactions. The study shows that P. americana induces shifts in the native faunal assemblages. Since responses depend on taxonomic groups and regions, the study highlights the importance for considering multiple taxonomic groups in evaluating the ecological impacts of invasive plants and that the evaluation of impacts must consider the regional context.

AB  - Over the last 10 years, the food supply has been secured in Malaysia through a combination of local food production and supply of imported food. The occurrence of COVID-19 has disrupted the food supply chain with the lockdown restriction known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) put in place to break the transmission mode of COVID-19. This article outlines the chronological events that took place in Malaysia after a COVID-19 outbreak due to a religious gathering. The impact of MCO on the food supply chain, particularly to urban residents, is also described, with recommended approaches to mitigate the situation.

AB  - Pesticides arc used today on a planetary-wide scale. The rising need for substances with this biological activity-due to an increasing consumption of agricultural and animal products and to the development of urban areas makes the chemical industry to constantly investigate new molecules or to improve the physicochemical characteristics, increase the biological activities and improve the toxicity profiles of the already known ones. Molecular databases are increasingly accessible for in vitro and in vivo bioavailability studies. In this context, structure-activity studies, by their in silica-in cerebra methods, are used to precede in vitro and in vivo studies in plants and experimental animals because they can indicate trends by statistical methods or biological activity models expressed as mathematical equations or graphical correlations, so a direction of study can he developed or another can be abandoned, saving financial resources, time and laboratory animals. Following this line of research the present paper reviews the Structure-Activity Relationship (SA R) studies and proposes a correlation between a topological connectivity index and the biological activity or toxicity made as a result of a study performed on 11 molecules of organophosphate compounds, randomly chosen, with a basic structure including a Phosphorus atom double botmded to an Oxygen atom or to a Sulfur one and having three other simple covalent bonds with two alkoxy (-methoxy or-ethoxy) groups and to another functional group different from the alkoxy groups. The molecules were packed on a cubic structure consisting of three adjacent cubes, respecting a principle of topological efficiency, that of occupying a minimal space in that cubic structure, a method that was called the Clef Method. The central topological index selected for correlation was the Wiener index, since it was possible this way to discuss different adjacencies between the nodes in the graphs corresponding to the organophosphate compounds molecules packed on the cubic structure; accordingly, "three dimensional" variants of these connectivity indices could be considered and further used for studying the qualitative-quantitative relationships for the specific molecule-eli7yme interaction complexes, including correlation between the Wiener weights (nodal specific contributions to the total Wiener index of the molecular graph) and the biochemical reactivity-of sonic of the atoms. Finally, when passing from SA R to Q(uantitative)-SAR studies, especially by the present advanced method of the cubic molecule (Clef Method) and its good assessment of the (neuro)toxicity of the studied molecules and of their inhibitory effect on the target enzyme-acetylcholinesterase, it can be seen that a predictability of the toxicity and activity of different analogue compounds can be ensured, facilitating the in vivo experiments or improving the usage of pesticides.

AB  - It is of great importance for pipeline systems to be is efficient, cost-effective and safe during the transportation of the liquids and gases. However, underground pipelines often experience leaks due to corrosion, human destruction or theft, long-term Earth movement, natural disasters and so on. Leakage or explosion of the operating pipeline usually cause great economical loss, environmental pollution or even a threat to citizens, especially when these accidents occur in human-concentrated urban areas. Therefore, the surveying of the routed pipeline is of vital importance for the Pipeline Integrated Management (PIM). In this paper, a comprehensive review of the Micro-Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU)-based intelligent Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) multi-sensor fusion technologies for the transport of liquids and gases purposed for small-diameter pipeline (D < 30 cm) surveying is demonstrated. Firstly, four types of typical small-diameter intelligent PIGs and their corresponding pipeline-defects inspection technologies and defects-positioning technologies are investigated according to the various pipeline defects inspection and localization principles. Secondly, the multi-sensor fused pipeline surveying technologies are classified into two main categories, the non-inertial-based and the MIMU-based intelligent PIG surveying technology. Moreover, five schematic diagrams of the MIMU fused intelligent PIG fusion technology is also surveyed and analyzed with details. Thirdly, the potential research directions and challenges of the popular intelligent PIG surveying techniques by multi-sensor fusion system are further presented with details. Finally, the review is comprehensively concluded and demonstrated.

AB  - In the Anglophone literature on local and regional development policy there are tendencies to overextension of claims from one side of the Atlantic to the other, or there is no comparative framing at all. As a result the specificity of the West European case tends to be lost. In contrast with the USA, the West European instance is very different indeed. Although there have been changes since the postwar golden years of urban and regional planning, central government remains crucial in the structuring of local and regional development and has given expression to counter-posed class forces: regional policy was historically an aspect of the welfare state as promoted by the labor movement, while urbanization policy has been much more about the forces of the political right. In the USA, by contrast, local governments and to a lesser degree, the states, have been and continue to be supreme; in contrast to Western Europe, location tends to be much more market-determined, with local and governments acting as market agents. Class forces have seemingly been much weaker, territorial coalitions occupying the center ground. As a first cut, these differences have to do with state structure: the Western European state is far more centralized, facilitating the implementation of policies that are relatively indifferent to local specificity, while in the USA the converse applies. State structures, however, are parts of broader social formations and reflect the different socio-historical conditions in which West European societies, on the one hand, and their American counterpoint, on the other, have emerged.

AB  - Many of the passengers and goods transportation operations are carried out by heavy transport vehicles (HTVs) like medium commercial vehicles (MCVs), heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs), and multi axle vehicles (MAVs) on multi-lane divided intercity highways. The presence of these HTVs in the traffic stream influences the overall characteristics of the traffic flow mix. The slow-speed movement of these vehicles in the median lane and kerb lane in the traffic stream affects the speed-flow characteristics of the mixed traffic, thereby deterring the speed of the other classes of vehicles, which eventually reduces the capacity of the traffic stream. The main aim of this study is to investigate and analyse the dynamic characteristics of HTVs occupying the high-speed lane (median lane) and low-speed lane (kerb lane). In order to gain a better understanding and qualitative overview of the HTVs' movement in the traffic stream, the data acquisition process was carried out using a transportable infra-red traffic logger (TIRTL) set up across one direction of the four-lane divided highway connecting the Chennai City with Nagapattinam City in India. Using the acquired data, dynamic passenger car units (DPCU) of each vehicle is estimated, and inferences are drawn concerning HTV's operating speed and flow. Also, a lane-based comparative study was carried out between the speed-flow characteristics of HTVs when these HTVs' are occupying the high-speed lane and low-speed lane during their operation on the multi-lane divided intercity highways. The analysis results showed that there is a significant drop in the capacity when the HTVs are operating on the high-speed lane at speeds lower than the desired operational speed when compared to that of the capacity when the HTVs are operating on the low-speed lane.

AB  - Acrocomia aculeata is a tropical palm tree native to Central and South America that has significant economic, social, and environmental potential. However, land encroachment due to the expansion of agribusiness, and other factors such as urban sprawl, have resulted in the fragmentation and destruction of its habitat, leading to the loss of genes and genotypes in A. aculeata populations. In this context, the objective of this study was to characterize the genetic variability of A. aculeata populations by estimating gene flow and effective population size using an approach based on coalescent theory. Four populations located in the municipalities of Teodoro Sampaio (TSI and TSII), Rosana (RA), and Amparo (AP) in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, were genotyped with nine microsatellite markers. Gene flow and effective population size were estimated using a coalescent-based Bayesian inference implemented in the MIGRATE-N software. The effective population size (N-e) was obtained considering an assumed mutation rate of 5 x 10(-5). Gene flow (Nm) for pairwise populations ranged from 0.28 to 1.17, with higher levels of migration between the three geographically proximal locations (TSI, TSII, and RA). The estimates of effective population size (N-e) were 444, 835, 838, and 874 for AP, TSII, RA, and TSI, respectively, showing that the effects caused by genetic drift may be more pronounced when N-e is smaller. The coalescent-based results add to our understanding of A. aculeata population genetics and suggest that some traditional assessment methods may be ineffective in characterizing historical evolutionary processes.

AB  - A data-driven modeling framework to link hydrologic, hydrodynamic, and water quality inputs to the migratory movements of endangered fish in urban estuarine watersheds is demonstrated. This will be useful in watersheds in which both the flow as well as the water quality have to be managed with sustaining fish stocks as one of the objectives. Additionally, it will allow the evaluation of management practice alternatives to analyze how flows and water quality will influence the habitat usage and population dynamics of economically valuable fish in river basins. Typically, physical processes in watersheds vary over tidal to inter-annual periods, while habitat use by aquatic organisms occur on different biological scales. Data are collected on yet other timescales independent of the underlying mechanisms. Models that incorporate the physical processes to inform biological movements are either purely statistical or include ad hoc migration rules. They are neither able to represent the biophysical mechanisms accurately nor are robust in out-of-sample hydrologic scenarios. In this modeling framework, the migration towards the ocean of juvenile salmon in the California Central Valley is represented at four timescales at which data is available, viz., seasonal/inter-annual, daily/subtidal, hourly to several minutes, and seconds to minutes. The data used include hourly records of salmon movement, flow and water quality available over several years at multiple locations throughout the system, as well as subminute salmon movement and water velocity data that is available at critical locations within the system from short-term experiments. By bridging the scales between animal movement, environmental processes, and data availability in this way, key drivers and stressors at the watershed level on animal migration can be identified. By building this process-based framework of animal movement, optimal use of the available data can be made to better inform ecological management and restoration in watersheds.

AB  - River incision and drainage reorganization have an important impact on the site selection of many major projects including city, road and others, and are the key issues of Quaternary environmental changes. Studies of river incision and river-network adjustment have traditionally been based on extensive field evidence, such as sediment age and beheaded river system. The Buyuan River basin is a large sub-basin of the upper Lancang-Mekong, with high mountains and extremely active erosion. The latter affects the preservation of the Quaternary period sediments leading to difficulties in understanding the main evolution characteristics of the basin. This study investigates differences in the equilibrium state of the longitudinal profile, infers incision rates, and evaluates drainage divide migration timelines using the stream-power incision model, the latest morphological dating, and Chi-plots (chi-z) based on digital elevation models (DEMs) on the GIS software platform. The final results show that two significant erosion base-level decreases occurred in the Late Pleistocene at least. The incision rate of the mainstream might have been 0-2.99 mm/yr since 100 ka BP and 0-3.28 mm/yr since 46 ka BP. The Chi-values across the divides suggest that space limited (or constrained) river reorganization and that there is no severe reorganization in the basin; the imbalance of traceable erosion only exists in local areas. The main driving force for the geomorphologic evolution of the Buyuan River basin is likely climate fluctuations rather than strong tectonic uplift since the Late Pleistocene.

AB  - Social relations between actors and symbolic relations between concepts or ideas are interwoven in discourse. We conceptually distinguish three approaches that construct relations between symbols with different connections to social structures. These three approaches are illustrated empirically with automated text analyses of the parliamentary proceedings of the Weimar Republic in Germany (1919-1933). First, cultural relations between symbols, as reconstructed from co-occurrences of terms in large text corpora, are supposedly widely shared in a social context. In this sense, we analyze a set of key terms in Weimar political discourse around the central term "Volk" ("people"). These fall into five word communities, each of them representing a different way of conceiving politics. Secondly, symbolic practices are related to actors positioning themselves through them in socio-symbolic constellations. We reconstruct such a constellation from the usage of key terms of Weimar parliamentary discourse by the eight major political parties in their speeches, with different parties signaling their ideological positions through these terms. Thirdly, the use of symbols in interaction characterizes social relationships between actors. In this vein, the ties between the Weimar parties show distinct patterns of hostility or support in their interjections and reactions to each other's speeches. The second and the third analyses reveal a two-dimensional patterning of the Weimar political landscape, with the traditional Left-Right dimension complemented by an opposition of forces supporting or rejecting the republic. Also, the similarities in word usage by parties correspond fairly well to the support or hostility in their interjections and reactions.

AB  - We assess risks posed by oak wilt-a disease caused by the fungal pathogen Bretziella fagacearum. Though not currently found in Canada, our distribution models indicate that suitable climate conditions currently occur in southern Ontario for B. fagacearum and two of its main insect dispersal vectors, Colopterus truncatus and Carpophilus sayi. Climate habitat for these species is projected to expand northward under climate change, with much of the oak range in eastern Canada becoming climatically suitable within the next two decades. Potential costs for the removal and replacement of oak street trees ranged from CDN$266 to $420 million, with variation related to uncertainty in costs, rate of tree replacement, and city-level estimates of oak street tree density. The value of standing oak timber in eastern Canada was estimated at CDN$126 million using provincial stumpage fees and as a CDN$24 million annual contribution to national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) when calculated using a combination of economic and forestry product statistics. These values can help inform the scale of eradication and/or management efforts in the event of future oak wilt introductions.

AB  - Hundreds of plants and half a kilogram of seeds of Spartina alterniflora, which were collected from Morehead City in North Carolina, Sapelo Island in Georgia, and Tampa Bay in Florida, were introduced to China in 1979. However, according to documented records, S. alterniflora from different origins were introduced to different areas when the species was first introduced to the coastal areas of China in the 1980s. In order to understand the relationship between the invasive S. alterniflora populations of China and the native S. alterniflora populations of the United States, and whether the genetic structure and genetic diversity of the invasive populations of China were affected by different introductions in the 1980s, molecular markers were used to determine the levels of gene flow and its effect on population differentiation. A total of 715 samples of S. alterniflora were collected from nine invasive populations in China and nine native populations from the United States. The genetic diversity and genetic structure of invasive and native populations were compared using microsatellite markers. The heterozygosity of Chinese invasive populations of S. alterniflora (H-O = 0.538, H-E = 0.725) were similar with those of native populations (H-O = 0.530, H-E = 0.744), which may attribute to its multiple introductions with the multisource populations from different geographic areas of the United States. However, the lower allelic diversities of Chinese invasive populations were detected, which may be due to the founder effect, or the bottleneck, which supports the theory that the allelic diversity is more sensitive to population bottlenecks than heterozygosity. The results of the STRUCTURE analysis among all sampling sites showed that the value of Delta K was largest when K = 2, which indicated that the invasive S. alterniflora populations in China had completed differentiated from the native populations of the United States. This may be because of admixture and hybridization of three non-overlapping original populations, or the postintroduction rapid evolution in China, and reproductive isolation under long-term geographic isolation. There was significant differentiation among invasive populations, which was mainly affected by different human-mediated introductions in 1980s. Significant genetic structure (K = 7) and high genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.30193) were detected in Chinese invasive populations, which may due to the low natural gene flow among populations. The genetic structure of the invasive populations in China was still affected by the human-mediated introductions in the 1980s, and the different initial introductions might promote differentiation among the invasive populations. In fact, the human-mediated long-distance dispersal should take the most of responsibility for the rapid spread of S. alterniflora along the coast of China. Multisource introductions of S. alterniflora are perhaps helpful for local adaptation but itself cannot cause rapid spread along the whole coast of China. Meanwhile, we suggest that the prevention of gene exchange among populations of S. alterniflora is the first and most important step in the control of the species on the coast of China, because admixture and hybridization of isolated populations might generate new heterosis and increase the difficulty of managing S. alterniflora in China.

AB  - A 17-year-old man with osteosarcoma of the proximal humerus was planned for possible limb salvage surgery after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, during the surgical phase of treatment, the COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) outbreak occurred changing the healthcare landscape due to uncertainty regarding the virus, risk of COVID-19 infection and complications, and implementation of an enhanced community quarantine restricting movement of people within cities. Instead of limb salvage surgery, the patient underwent a forequarter amputation. Exposure to the virus in a high-risk hospital setting was minimised with patient discharge after a short hospital stay and home convalescence monitored by video conferencing. Multidisciplinary sarcoma team meetings with family members and a sarcoma navigator nurse were crucial in managing expectations and deciding on appropriate treatment in the setting of a novel infectious disease causing a pandemic.

AB  - One of the most common modes of transportation in Indian cities is buses and autos. Jerks at regular intervals, that the driver receives from vehicles is transmitted to coccyx and lumbar vertebrae causing more serious spinal issues due to wear of gristle pad between vertebrae and insufficient cerebrospinal fluid circulation. There is also slow movement of blood to the lower extremity causing issues like varicose veins and deep vein thrombosis. Studies revealed that after long sitting hours, the person must involve in several activities for proper blood circulation which is not possible for fellow drivers of commercial vehicles. As a result, we have reflected an innovative idea in this paper to move the seats of the vehicles for countering the sudden jerks due to bumpy road as the wheels get into uneven surfaces. This could be a way to minimize the shock to the spine and abdominal areas and reduce the severity of pain due to prolonged sitting.

AB  - Magnitude-frequency (M-F) relationships represent important information on slope deformation and are used in hazard assessment or as supporting data for urban planning. Various approaches have been used to extract such relationships in the past, but most of these methods drove at the problem of exact events ' frequency determination. Dendrogeomorphic (tree ring-based) approaches are actually thought to be the most precise method of dating past mass movement events that occurred within the last several centuries. Together with information on the spatial positions of the analysed trees, they represent a potentially very valuable tool for reconstructing M-F relationships, although their use for this purpose has been very rare in the past. In this study, M-F relationships are reconstructed using dendrogeomorphic methods for three landslides of different types (a translational slide, a flow-like slide, and a rotational slide) occurring in different geological materials (thick-bedded flysch, limestone marls, and volcanic breccia). In total, 572 disturbed trees were analysed, and chronologies of mass movement events were built. Landslide magnitudes were expressed in three ways: (i) the value of the standard I-t index; (ii) the area, as determined using homogenous morphological units; and (iii) the area, as determined using tree buffers. The power-law nature of M-F relationships was confirmed for all the landslides that were studied and using all the approaches that were applied. All of the combinations of results yielded high correlation values; nevertheless, differences were noted. The advantages and limitations of each approach used to reconstruct M-F relationships are also discussed.

AB  - Ficopomatus enigmaticus (Fauvel 1923) is a reef-building serpulid polychaete that is found in warm and temperate estuaries across the globe. This ecosystem engineer causes ecological and socio-economic impacts in invaded systems through efficient filtering of the water column and the formation of large calcareous reefs. As such it is important to monitor F. enigmaticus invasions and track changes in distribution and abundance. Although recent genetic studies have highlighted cryptic sympatric species within invasions previously ascribed to F. enigmaticus the genetic status in South Africa remains unresolved. This study provides an assessment of the invasion by this tube worm in three estuaries of conservation importance in the Western Cape, South Africa. Through the use of historical data, the trajectories of these invasions were considered. Zandvlei Estuary supported the largest standing stock (29 194.22 kg) while Berg River Estuary supported only 3.39 kg. It was notable that in both estuaries the worm was almost totally confined to artificial substrata. Despite the presence of large intact reefs in Milnerton Lagoon, no live worms were recorded in 2019. Comparisons with historical data revealed that populations have declined in all three estuaries. These results highlight the need for routine monitoring of Ficopomatus populations. It is suggested that episodic removal of the small reefs from Berg River Estuary could minimise spread within the estuary and prevent the negative impacts known from elsewhere. Strategic removal from Zandvlei Estuary, and Milnerton Lagoon should the worm be detected again, could limit its negative impacts in these systems while retaining the benefit of enhanced water quality associated with this prolific filter feeder.

AB  - In this paper we study how the spatial arrangement of transit lines (lines structure) influences scale economies in public transport. First we show that the degree of scale economies (DSE) increases discretely whenever passenger volume induces a change in lines structure. The technical elements behind this are explained by using a new three-dimensional concept called directness, encompassing number of transfers, number of stops and passenger route lengths. This is first exemplified in a simple ad-hoc network, and then applied to examine the structural changes that occur in the design of transit lines in a fairly general representation of a city. We show that directness increases whenever lines structure changes as a response to larger demand volumes - increasing DSE at the particular value of flow where this change occurs - because systems with more direct lines for each OD pair diminish in-vehicle times while increasing waiting times mildly, such that users are benefited by lower travel times and operators are benefited by lower idle capacity. After the change, however, DSE decreases within the demand range where the new line structure is maintained, just as in the one line model. The possibility of deciding the line structure introduces directness as a new source of economies of scale which are finally exhausted after full directness is achieved.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Parking Occupancy Prediction Methods considering Parking Type and Parking Scale

KW  - REGRESSION
AB  - Parking issues have been receiving increasing attention. An accurate parking occupancy prediction is considered to be a key prerequisite to optimally manage limited parking resources. However, parking prediction research that focuses on estimating the occupancy for various parking lots, which is critical to the coordination management of multiple parks (e.g., district-scale or city-scale), is relatively limited. This study aims to analyse the performance of different prediction methods with regard to parking occupancy, considering parking type and parking scale. Two forecasting methods, FM1 and FM2, and four predicting models, linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVR), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), were proposed to build models that can predict the parking occupancy of different parking lots. To compare the predictive performances of these models, real-world data of four parks in Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Dongguan were collected over 8 weeks to estimate the correlation between the parking lot attributes and forecast results. As per the case studies, among the four models considered, SVM offers stable and accurate prediction performance for almost all types and scales of parking lots. For commercial, mixed functional, and large-scale parking lots, FM1 with SVM made the best prediction. For office and medium-scale parking lots, FM2 with SVM made the best prediction.

AB  - The olive tree (Olea europaea) is a native evergreen tree in the Mediterranean region, being one of the most important causes of seasonal respiratory allergies in Mediterranean countries. This work aims to relate flowering phenology, source tree distribution, meteorology, and airborne pollen records for this species and to analyse the possible arrival of air masses from distant areas during days when differences between the phenological and pollen peaks. Aerobiological sampling was carried out in Badajoz (SW Spain) for 4 years (2016-2019) using a Hirst volumetric sampler. Trees were geolocalized in the city and surrounding areas. The pollination phenology of 15 specimens was studied for four years (2016-2019) during the months from April to June. The daily data for the whole period and the hourly data for the four years, including pollen records and meteorology, were analysed. The comparison between the pollen records and sources distribution was assessed. The main pollen season (thereafter, MPS) lasted an average of 34.5 (29-40) days. Phenological observations indicate that pollination occurred for 26.5 days and was mostly within the period of recorded airborne pollen; however, were days with airborne pollen recorded outside the pollination period. In 2017 the peak day was recorded when the flowering period has reached only the 10%, in other seasons this value reached the maximum peak of pollen concentration was found only a few days after the maximum of flowering. The hourly analysis showed that the maximum pollen concentrations were reached just after noon. The analysis of pollen sources and pollen records showed a close relationship with the predominant winds and tree distributions. The observed discrepancies between phenological and aerobiological data (in 2017 and 2018) were explained by the movement of air masses and long-distance transport.

AB  - Traffic accident statistics in urban areas, both locally in Croatia and at the European level, identify children as a group of vulnerable road users. The analysis of the parameters that influence the interaction of child pedestrians and other road users requires special attention. This paper presents the results of research about the reaction time of children, measured both in laboratory conditions, via a computer reaction time test, and in actual traffic conditions. The results of the reaction time test in a situation with expected stimuli (a computer test) of children aged 6 to 10 years were compared with the results of the reaction time of adult traffic participants, drivers, who also took part in the computer test. Standard deviations of the reaction times between the control group (drivers, adults) and each subgroup of children were significantly different (p< 0.05). The results suggest that the largest developmental jump occurs between preschool children and first-grade children. In actual traffic conditions, the reaction time of children aged 4 to 16 years at the signalized intersection was measured. The model for predicting the reaction time of children in real traffic conditions was created using a neural network. The model prediction results matched well with the values measured in actual traffic conditions, for the observed intersection (correlation coefficient is 94.56%) and for the validation intersection (correlation coefficient is 92.29%). Parameters influencing children's reaction times in real traffic conditions were identified by applying both statistical analysis and the neural network model developed. Using both methods, the same key distractors were identified-the movement of children in the group and the use of mobile phones. The case study was conducted at selected signalized intersections in the city of Osijek, Croatia.

AB  - The coastal area holds great importance as it sustains a large number of people in addition to various bio-networks that have economic as well as biological significance. However, these may be prone to environmental calamities such as tsunamis. In the coastal areas of Pakistan, numerous earthquakes have been triggered by the tectonic movement under the Indian Ocean. Karachi and Gwadar cities being the economic hub of the country is at the potential risk of tsunamis; therefore, multi-criteria GIS mapping of tsunami susceptibility has been conducted in this paper for the Karachi to Gwadar, the coastal area of Pakistan. This study includes many geospatial variables such as coastal proximity and shape, topographic elevation and slope, and topography relative to the direction of the tsunami. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is exercised to develop an order of weights for each geospatial variable. For the potential tsunami risk, a land use map of coastal area of Pakistan is overlaid on the tsunami susceptibility map, and the final output map has shown that residential buildings, commercial complexes, and agricultural areas are vulnerable to destruction. Studies involving GIS are helpful in the evaluation of disaster, thereby aiding in the acceleration of local forecasting for the management of natural catastrophes like tsunamis. Tsunami susceptibility map presented in this paper seeks to support the evidence of the occurrence of the tsunami and the efforts directed towards the management of tsunami in the coastal areas of Pakistan.

AB  - One of the most durable building materials, stone has been used throughout history to build buildings. In particular, marble is the most common material in historical structures. For thousands of years, these materials have been valued for their beauty and versatility. Despite the permanent aura, marble can suffer from wear and tear. As a result of increased urbanization today in Rashid city, a high level of groundwater, salt accumulation and pollutions, marble degradation is occurring much faster than in the past. Accumulation of dust, cracked construction, spelling, and loss of structural integrity are among the problems affecting marble structures. There are many sources of marble deterioration, especially in the city of Rashid. Damage occurs through physical, chemical, and environmental weathering factors, air pollution, and soiling build-up. More damage can occur through corrosion, as a result of movement in marble (thermal expansion / shrinkage), damaged or broken impact points, and even a human error in design, engineering, or construction. The experimental group study was conducted on samples of historical marble using some traditional reinforcing materials and some nano materials to reach the best one in the treatment and maintenance of historical structural marble. The evaluation methodology was performed using a set of stress analysis of the treated sample and compared to the untreated sample or the clear sample that was not exposed to the treatments. Several parameters such as marble resistance point were measured using ultrasonic velocity testing, and mechanical properties, as well as physical properties of the sample including fine porosity, were determined The results proved the superiority of the samples that have been strengthened by Nano Restore with EucoColle materials in 50% concentration and diluted in water by 1:1 ratio. Finally, the present study involved strengthening and preserving some of the historical structural marble columns inside the Al-Mahaly Mosque in the city of Rashid.

AB  - Population concentration in urban areas has led traffic management a central issue. To mitigate traffic congestions, the government has planned to construct large-cross-section tunnels deep underground. This study focuses on estimating the damage caused to frame structures owing to tunnel excavation. When constructing a tunnel network deep underground, it is necessary to divide the main tunnel and connect the divergence tunnel to the ground surface. Ground settlement is caused by excavation of the adjacent divergence tunnel. Therefore, predicting ground settlement using diverse variables is necessary before performing damage estimation. We used the volume loss and cover-tunnel diameter ratio as the variables in this study. Applying the ground settlement values to the settlement induction device, we measured the extent of damage to frame structures due to displacement at specific points. The vertical and horizontal displacements that occur at these points were measured using pre-attached LVDT (Linear variable differential transformer), and the lateral strain and angular distortion were calculated using these displacements. The lateral strain and angular distortion are key parameters for structural damage estimation. A damage assessment chart comprises the "Negligible", "Very Slight Damage", "Slight Damage", "Moderate to Severe Damage", and "Severe to Very Severe Damage" categories was developed. This table was applied to steel frame and concrete frame structures for comparison.

AB  - Forced displacement - the involuntary movement of people from their homes and livelihoods - has captured public attention through diverging discourses of humanitarianism and global xenophobia. 2.5 million asylum claims were lodged in the European Union (EU) in 2015-16 leading to national and region-wide strategies of border securitization. Refugee governance in the EU is marked by contradictory ideological positions where liberal humanitarianism, through refugee acceptance, dovetails with racial violence evidenced by ongoing detention and circuitous displacement. These divergent positions, and their resultant policies of refugee management, avoid the social reality of neoliberalisation as it pertains to widespread homelessness and work-related insecurity in major EU cities such as Paris. This disavowal occurs in a raced market and impedes the survival of refugees through insistence on self-reliance - a disciplinary logic endemic to neoliberalism and imposed on refugees upon relocation. I argue that self-reliance transforms refugees into disposable subjects in capitalism at various stages of the asylum process from escape and detention to relocation and ongoing displacement.

AB  - The Amazon Region had and has marked in all its historical process a plurality of desires from various sources. The retrospective view of the environment enables prospective reflections on the species of urban environmental management that needs to be developed to ensure sustainability and environmental conservation. Thus, this article aims to rescue the memories of the occupation process throughout the 1960s until the implementation in 2012 of the Environmental Protection Area Manaos Forest. It is characterized by a unique case study, with a qualitative approach using bibliographic, documental and life history research. From this research it was possible to observe the complexity of harmonizing the different particular interests with the conservation of existing ecosystems, demonstrating the path taken by the emersion of environmental movements that focused on territorial defense and later became Environmental Sciences.

AB  - A large amount of the local and first-class road infrastructures in Central Europe lead through settled areas, such as villages or even historical cities and town centers. The vibrations generated by passing vehicles around the pavement spread to the subgrade to the environment and also affect civil engineering structures and buildings. We have decided to adopt the approach of small-scale modeling of the pavement with the subgrade. Small-scale physical modeling brings benefits, such as size reduction, simplification, or controlled conditions during the test. To study the effect of static and dynamic behavior during the occurrence, a simulation mass physical model is used for testing. A static plate load test is used to determine the bearing capacity and settlement and consistency of measurement of the plate's vertical movement at a given load acting on the plate. The aim of the mass surface simulation's dynamic testing was to measure the response in time acceleration forms. Based on the performed experimental measurements undertaken on the physical model as well as the numerical simulation performed in FEM, we can state that the gelatin-based simulation mass is usable for the simulation of the earth environment in contact with building structures.

AB  - One of the most evident and direct effects of roads on wildlife is the death of animals by vehicle collision. Understanding the spatial patterns behind roadkill helps to plan mitigation measures to reduce the impacts of roads on animal populations. However, although roadkill patterns have been extensively studied in temperate zones, the potential impacts of roads on wildlife in the Neotropics have received less attention and are particularly poorly understood in the Western Amazon. Here, we present the results of a study on roadkill in the Amazon region of Ecuador; a region that is affected by a rapidly increasing development of road infrastructure. Over the course of 50 days, in the wet season between September and November 2017, we searched for road-killed vertebrates on 15.9 km of roads near the city of Tena, Napo province, for a total of 1,590 surveyed kilometers. We recorded 593 dead specimens, predominantly reptiles (237 specimens, 40%) and amphibians (190, 32%), with birds (102, 17%) and mammals (64, 11%) being less common. Recorded species were assigned to three functional groups, based on their movement behavior and habitat use ("slow," "intermediate," and "fast"). Using Ripley's K statistical analyses and 2D HotSpot Identification Analysis, we found multiple distinct spatial clusters or hotspots, where roadkill was particularly frequent. Factors that potentially determined these clusters, and the prevalence of roadkill along road segments in general, differed between functional groups, but often included land cover variables such as native forest and waterbodies, and road characteristics such as speed limit (i.e., positive effect on roadkill frequency). Our study, which provides a first summary of species that are commonly found as roadkill in this part of the Amazon region, contributes to a better understanding of the negative impacts of roads on wildlife and is an important first step toward conservation efforts to mitigate these impacts.

AB  - There are an increasing number of mega engineering projects of removing the top of hills to fill in the valley for new land creation in the Loess Plateau of China, which significantly changes the hydrological and geological equilibrium state of the site. The formation of a new hydrological equilibrium state is associated with the water movement in the compacted and intact loess layers. Most disasters occurring in the loess area are related to water. The soil-water retention curve (SWRC) is the key to the implementation of unsaturated soil mechanics in engineering practice and is required to numerically model the movement of water in the soil. In this study, the SWRCs and microstructure of intact and compacted specimens from Lanzhou and Yan'an, two typical cities that have new land creation projects, are investigated. The SWRC is obtained using the filter paper method. The mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques are used to explore the microstructure. The results highlight that the intact loess has a higher air occlusion value (AOV) and a similar slope of SWRC in the transition zone compared with the remolded specimens that compacted at the natural water content. The normalized SWRC (i.e., degree of saturation versus suction/AVO) of the intact specimen is approximately the same as the remolded specimens compacted at the natural water content. The difference in the microstructure between intact and compacted specimens originates from different existing states of the clay particles and further contributes to the variation of the SWRC.

AB  - Land issues are a major constraint for resource management, whether it relates to urban planning, environmental protection or agricultural development. There is presently a proliferation of initiatives by a diversity of actors, that produce notable changes in terms of land tenure. A few studies have described some of them in France, without analysing the change mechanisms. Moreover, land tenure is often difficult to understand given its complexity and its multiple dimensions. Here, we propose an analysis of land tenure changes with the lens of property-use relationships (PUR), through a social innovation framework. This allows us to analyse the collective action at the heart of change. The analysis rests upon two case studies selected for their multiscale character, and as two different entries to scrutinize land changes: the "Terre de Liens" movement, a new actor stemming from civil society; and the "rural land lease subject to environmental clauses", a recent authorized instrument of tenancy contract. These land tenure changes are important although circumscribed because they involve all actors' spheres and scales and create new frameworks. These changes contribute to express societal demands through new lessor's management right. Where the parties to the PUR share a common reference framework and the same agricultural development objective, the conditions set out in the PUR seem guaranteed. If they do not, a mutual acculturation process seems necessary - beyond the contractual terms - to enable a compromise between the management rationales of a protected area in one hand, and a farm on the other hand.

AB  - Violence against women has gained space in the political agenda, driven by the women's movement, with the making of public policies targeted at assistance for women. We analyze the results of a study carried out in the city of SAO Paulo, Brazil, with professionals from the specialized intersectoral services network, focusing on the changes that have occurred due to the Maria da Penha Law. Data show that, in spite of the expansion of the services that provide assistance, defense and protection for women, there are difficulties concerning integrated work in professionals' actions and interaction, which hinders the outline of a common assistance project the most important principle for a networked action. The conclusion is that overcoming these difficulties is a challenge in the current political context of degeneration of the services and weakening of public policies targeted at women's rights.

AB  - Herein, we present a study of an interesting sample of fossils of the giant amphicyonid Megamphicyon giganteus (Schinz, 1825) from the Spanish middle Miocene (MN6) site of Carpetana (Madrid city), obtained during public works for the Madrid underground in 2008. Although the dentition of this species is known from other sites, the postcranial bones are very poorly known, and the new material provides new data on the locomotor adaptations of this spectacular predator, and allows an estimation of its body mass, which would be around 600 kg. Surprisingly, despite this giant size, the morphology of both femur and tibia shows that this animal exhibited higher cursorial capacity than large extant carnivorans, such as bears, which together with a high degree of pronation/supination movement of the forearm, reveals adaptations of M. giganteus to occupy the niche of active top predator in middle Miocene ecosystems.

AB  - With the radiation sources widely used in the field of industry, agriculture, medicine, and resources all over the world, the occurrences of the lost and theft incidents are not unusual. There will be great threats to human health and environment for uncontrolled sources. It can be even worse when they are used by terrorists as weapons in the city, such as RDD, which would disperse the radioactive substances into the environment and have a long-term negative impact on human society. Besides the security control and surveillance of radiation sources, the source-searching method using radiation detectors is also needed to find the lost or stolen sources. In the case of radiation monitoring in a city, a mass of people with detectors are needed to cover the large area, while radiation dosimeters are appropriate for its portability and economy.
   In this paper, a simple approach to finding and locating unknown radiation sources, which might be in static or mobile condition, using distributed mobile radiation dosimeters is put forward. This approach is able to estimate the time-dependent sources location and the intensity with the dose rate measurements over time periods.
   Random data is introduced to verify the approach. Virtual radiation sources and detectors with random movement are created in the cases and the dose rate measurements are computed accordingly, with which sources location and intensity are estimated, where natural background radiation and the statistical fluctuation of measurements are taken into account. The results of the estimated sources show a good consistency with the assumptions.

AB  - The Niushou landslide is a slow-moving landslide in the Niushou Mountain cultural tourism area, Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province of China. In June 2015, a tension crack appeared on the south side of Niushou Mountain due to the continuous rainfall, which brought great potential safety risk to the scenic area and the construction of the Alila Hotel. From July 2015 to March 2016, emergency rescue works were used to reinforce the south slope of Niushou Mountain. On June 11, 2016, the Niushou landslide occurred on the south side of Niushou Mountain, caused by the heavy rainfall as a result of the 2015-2016 EI Nino event. The movement of the Niushou landslide caused cracks in the land surface, the buildings of Alila Hotel, and reinforced facilities. Field investigations, drilling holes, geophysical prospecting, laboratory tests, groundwater level monitoring, and surface displacement monitoring were carried out to determine the geological features, deformation characteristics, and failure mechanism. Based on analysis of the monitoring data, the main reason for landslide occurrence was the rise of groundwater level, which increased the uplift pressure offered by confined water and decreased the strength in strongly weathered tuff layer, leading to the sliding surface. The construction land of Alila Hotel has been abandoned until now (May 5, 2020) because of the Niushou landslide. The case discussed how the level of groundwater changes would influence landslide deformation and also provided suggestions for the prevention measures of such landslide.

AB  - In reflecting on the human domination of our planet in the Anthropocene, some have argued that concrete is among the most destructive materials created by humans. Here we explore this idea, specifically in the context of what we consider "the concrete conquest of aquatic ecosystems." The ubiquitous use of concrete in transportation and building infrastructure has contributed to alterations in freshwater and coastal marine systems. Yet, in some cases, there are no appropriate alternative building materials such that concrete itself is confounded by its application. For example, as the foundation for most dams, concrete fragments rivers and channelizes streams, often creating unnatural systems, yet dams are necessary for hydropower generation and flood control with few alternative materials for construction. In riparian and coastal environments, concrete harbours and inland canal systems are often used to address erosion or reclaim areas for human development. Even when removed (e.g., dam removal, naturalization of shorelines), concrete dust is a major aquatic pollutant. Instances do exist, however, where concrete has been used to benefit aquatic ecosystems - such as the installation of fish passage facilities at barriers or the development of fish-friendly culverts - though even then, there is a movement towards nature-like fishways that avoid the use of harmful materials like concrete. There are also opportunities to achieve conservation gains in the development of seawalls that include more natural and complex features to benefit biota and allow for essential biogeochemical processes to occur in aquatic environments. There have been several innovations in recent years that increase the permeability of concrete, however these have limited application in an aquatic context (e.g., not relevant to dam construction or erosion control but may be relevant in stormwater management systems). We provide a brief overview of the history of concrete, discuss some of the direct and indirect effects of concrete on aquatic ecosystems, and encourage planners, engineers, developers, and regulators to work collaboratively to explore alternatives to concrete which benefit aquatic ecosystems and the services they offer. The status quo of concrete being the default construction material is failing aquatic ecosystems, so we recommend that efforts are made to explore alternative materials and if concrete must be used, to increase structural complexity to benefit biodiversity.

KW  - Ground floor interfaces
KW  - Uses on the ground floor
KW  - Perception of security
KW  - Occurrence of crimes
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to examine the effects of transformations of the levels of visual and functional permeability and the types of uses on the ground floors of buildings on the perception of security and the occurrence of residential burglary, theft in residence, pedestrian mugging, vehicle robbery, vehicle theft and theft of items inside a vehicle on selected blocks.
   Design/methodology/approach - Nine blocks divided into three groups were selected in Capao da Canoa, a Brazilian city that has been undergoing morphological transformations, including the replacement of buildings with residences and shops on the ground floor, with doors and windows facing the street, by buildings with a predominance of garage doors and blind walls on the ground floors. Data were collected through the application of questionnaires and interviews.
   Findings - The results reveal, for example, that perception of greater security is related to the blocks with a greater number of functional and visual connections between the ground floor interfaces of the buildings and the open public spaces. In addition, the night period records the higher number of criminal occurrences, even on blocks with higher rates of visual and functional connections between the ground floor interfaces and the public open space and higher rates of residential and commercial uses on the ground floor of the buildings.
   Originality/value - It is expected that the results of this paper will allow for greater knowledge and the revision of many urban guidelines regarding the effects of the transformations of ground floor interfaces from traditional to contemporary buildings in the perception of security and the occurrence of crimes in public open spaces and in neighbouring residential units. It is further evidenced the need to recognize the ground floor interface as an element of public interest, even if it belongs to a private property. Nonetheless, further research is needed on the relationships between the quantifications of the levels of visual and functional permeability, the different types of uses on the ground floor of buildings, movement of people and crimes in open spaces and buildings in different periods of the day.

AB  - Welding fume exposure has been associated with structural brain changes and a wide variety of clinical and subclinical outcomes including cognitive, behavioral and motor abnormalities. Respirator use has been shown to decrease exposure to welding fumes; however, the associations between respirator use and health outcomes, particularly neurologic health, have been understudied. In this preliminary study, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the effectiveness of respirator use in protecting workers' white matter (WM) from the harmful effects related to welding fume exposure. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a common DTI measurement of water diffusion properties, was used as a marker of WM microstructure integrity. We hypothesized that FA in brain regions involved in motor and neurocognitive functions would differ between welders reporting respirator use compared to those not using a respirator. We enrolled a pilot cohort of 19 welders from labor unions in the New York City area. All welders completed questionnaires to assess welding history and occupational health. All completed a DTI acquisition on a 3 T Siemens scanner. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a bioinformatic analytical strategy, was used to model the divergence of WM microstructures in 48 regions defined by the ICBM-DTI-81 atlas between respirator users compared to non-users. This yielded an effective discrimination of respirator users from non-users, with the uncinate fasciculus, the cerebellar peduncle and the superior longitudinal fasciculus contributing most to the discrimination of these groups. These white matter tracts are involved in widespread motor and cognitive functions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to suggest a protective effect of respirator on WM microstructure, indicating that the lack of respirator may present unsafe working conditions for welders. These preliminary findings may inform a larger, longitudinal intervention study that would be more appropriate to investigate the potential protective effect of respirator usage on brain white matter in welders.

AB  - Navigation behaviour in nature is based on data obtained from perception of the terrain where movement occurs. The aim of this work is to study the influence of visual factors on the flight of birds over medium distances (about 10 km). In this study, we propose a method for probabilistic analysis of pigeon flights over combined countryside and urban terrain, based on surface flow simulation. Z-value - an altitude analogue that describes the characteristic gradient of the flow - is calculated as a function of "landscape complexity" based on the density of significant landscape objects. The calculated probabilistic model is compared with data on GPS-tracks of untrained and trained pigeons. As a result, significant features of terrain that determine sustainable locations in pigeon flights are identified. In the study, visual characteristics of the territories over which pigeons flew are calculated using remote sensing data from open sources, and spatial data are processed using the geographical information system QGIS.

AB  - Autonomous driving technology has become a hot issue in industry and academia with the development of transportation technology, but there are also some problems, such as traffic congestion and accident. Intersection is the main place where urban road congestion occurs. How to guide vehicles across intersection accurately, quickly and efficiently is an urgent problem to be solved. For intelligent traffic control at intersections, many studies focus on the design of traffic signal timing, which can guide vehicle decision making. However, for autonomous driving technology, setting a fixed traffic light is time-consuming. By properly controlling the movement of vehicles, traffic efficiency can be greatly improved. This paper presents a traffic guidance method based on game theory and dynamic Level-k model. The simulation results show that this method has a good traffic guidance effect. Our study is crucial to the better and more efficient guidance of automotive intersection decision.

AB  - The endangered Asir MagpiePica asirensisformerly occurred in alpine habitat across Saudi Arabia's Asir Mountains but is now restricted to small patches of remnant forest within a 37-km strip of highlands. Perhaps only 100 pairs remain and this tiny population appears to be declining, though the causes of its decline are unknown. We mined published presence/absence data to develop a fuzzy logic habitat model. The model considered six variables that correlate with Asir Magpie presence: elevation, aspect, forested areas, drainage systems, and major urban areas. Our model reveals that only 80 km(2)of prime quality habitat remains across 11 fragmented patches. We tested the model using 38 GPS locations of Asir Magpies from independent birdwatchers. In total, 35/38 magpies were located within the modelled habitat. We suggest that the Asir Magpie may be suffering from limited dispersal between isolated high quality habitat fragments, which could be leading to genetically depauperate subpopulations, thereby enabling an extinction vortex. It may also be suffering from habitat loss through development and construction, habitat degradation through climate change, unregulated grazing, overharvesting of wood, and over-consumption of food scraps. Corrective actions are urgently needed to save this rare and nationally endemic species.

TI  - Efficient Mining of Hotspot Regional Patterns with Multi-Semantic Trajectories

LA  - English
KW  - Multisemantic trajectory
KW  - Hotspot regional pattern
KW  - Location-based social network
AB  - Due to the explosive growth in trajectory data with multi-semantic labels, mining hotspots based on extracted sequential patterns from multi-semantic trajectories are an emerging need in various applications of crowd behavior analysis, such as location-based advertising, business location, and urban planning. However, most existing regional pattern mining methods only focus on temporal continuity, spatial compactness, and a single semantics. Outdated or nonhot regions may be discovered if the timeliness, multi-semantic features, and user activity of trajectory patterns are not taken into consideration. To address this issue, this paper studies a hotspot regional multi-semantic trajectory pattern mining problem, with the aim of identifying the hotspot pattern of a social crowd in the trajectory data. Specifically, 1) we propose a new spatiotemporal density scheme to quantify the frequency and heat of a specific pattern in space, and to discover all regions where movement behaviors occur densely and have high heat; 2) we develop a trajectory mining algorithm, effective hotspot regional multi-semantic trajectory pattern mining (tHRM), which effectively reveals the hot movement patterns in a region that are not necessarily dominant in intensity. Experiments using real trajectory data sets show that tHRM is able to discover regional hotspot regional patterns, which are difficult to discover with state-of-the-art regional pattern mining methods. Furthermore, tHRM runs 3-4 times faster, and the mining quality is an order of magnitude higher than that of the rival methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coexistence between adolescents in educational centres and people outside these centres is increasingly mediated by the use of different technologies. The present study analyses the perceptions of 4,273 students in secondary education in Aragon (Spain) on how the positive relationships that occur in the educational centre (among students and their classmates, teachers, school principals and other staff) and between the family and the school mediate the prevention of bullying and cyberbullying. The study was performed in 20 educational centres of the Autonomous Community of Aragon, considering the stratified representation of the provinces, private and public schools, and rural and urban areas. The study was conducted by applying questionnaires on bullying and cyberbullying, among other questions, and by evaluating the relationship between students and the rest of the educational community. An analysis was elaborated from a structural equation model (SEM), using as exogenous variables the student's assessment of relations with the rest of the members of the educational community and, as endogenous variables, victimization, aggression and perception of bullying situations and cyberbullying (bystanders). This study concluded by exposing aspects related to these protective factors, which are so important for the development of a positive coexistence and personal relationships. Our research brings advances towards a positive and transformative vision for preventing bullying and cyberbullying. From this proposal, we find interesting the importance and necessity to overcome the silence of cyber-victimized adolescents, reinforcing not only the peer network in the educational centre but also teacher and family networks.

TI  - Access, demand, and utilization of childhood immunization services: A cross-sectional household survey in Western Area Urban district, Sierra Leone, 2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
LA  - English
AB  - Background Urban childhood immunization programs face unique challenges in access, utilization, and demand due to frequent population movement between and within localities, sprawling informal settlements, and population heterogeneity. We conducted a cross-sectional household survey in the Western Area Urban district, Sierra Leone, stratified by slums and non-slums as defined by the United Nations Development Program.
   Methods Based on data from child vaccination cards, weighted vaccination coverage was estimated from 450 children aged 12-36 months (household response rate = 83%). Interviews with 444 caregivers identified factors related to accessing routine immunization services. Factors associated with coverage in bivariate analyses were examined in multivariate models using backward stepwise procedure.
   Results Coverage was similar in slums and non-slums for :3-doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenzae type b (pentavalent) vaccine (86%, 92%) and second dose of measles vaccine (33%, 29%). In a multivariate logistic regression model, incomplete pentavalent vaccine coverage was associated with being second or later birth order (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) =4.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) =1.4-14.9), a household member not approving of childhood vaccinations (aOR= 7.55, 95% CI =1.52-37.38), self-reported delay of child receiving recommended vaccinations (aOR=4.8, 95% CI = 1.0-22.1), and living in a household made of natural or rudimentary materials (aOR = 35, 95% CI =1.2-10.6). Overall, the majority (>70%) of caregivers reported occupation as petty trader and <50% reported receiving vaccination information via preferred communication sources.
   Conclusions Although vaccination coverage in slums was similar to non-slums, study findings support the need for targeted interventions to improve coverage, especially for the second dose of measles vaccine to avoid large scale measles outbreaks. Strategies should focus on educating household members via preferred communication channels regarding the importance of receiving childhood vaccinations on time for all offspring, not just the first born. Vaccination coverage could be further improved by increasing accessibility through innovative strategies such as increasing the number of vaccination days and modifying hours.

AB  - In this article, a valuable approach utilizing the relationship between select physical water and soil characteristics and geoelectrical resistivity data was used to recognize and trace groundwater contamination by using the geoelectrical resistivity data of a landfill area. It can reduce uncertainty in geoelectrical resistivity interpretation. By interpreting and calibrating the resistivity model with the lithology and physical characters of water samples, it was possible to identify the unique paths of landfill leachate that occurred throughout a shallow aquifer. The water physical property analysis showed that the landfill area was contaminated by a relatively high amount of total of dissolved solids (TDSs). A scatter plot of TDS values and directly measured resistivity showed that resistivity decreased with increasing TDSs. The movement direction of the landfill leachate in the aquifer system was clearly observed in a depth slice of the resistivity distribution. The aquifer is considered to be contaminated starting from the landfill zone and extending to the northeastern part of the study area.

AB  - With the increasing bandwidth requirements for people and the development of urbanization, the movement of the population in the city (especially the supercity) has an increasing influence on the traffic distribution in both space and time dimensions. The imbalanced distribution results in the regional blocking of different areas in different time periods and reduces the spectrum resource utilization in elastic optical networks. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a tidal traffic model to formulate a kind of tidal traffic phenomenon firstly. Based on the analysis for this model, the area-aware routing and spectrum allocation algorithm that focuses on the traffic adjustment in specific functional areas is proposed. And two benchmark algorithms named min-hop k-shortest path routing algorithm and occupied-slots-as-weight k-shortest path routing algorithm are introduced. The evaluation results show that, compared to the benchmark algorithms, the proposed area-aware algorithm could reduce the blocking probability efficiently from 2 & x0025; to 47 & x0025; with low time complexity.

TI  - Mortality and demographic recovery in early post-black death epidemics: Role of recent emigrants in medieval Dijon
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - SEX
AB  - Objective and methods
   We analyze the influence of population movement on susceptibility to death and resilience during two epidemics occurring in Dijon soon after the Black Death. Using a specific program designed to propose links between entries in annual tax registers, we define tentative heads of household, the elapsed time since their first registration and their ties with other persons within the city.
   Results
   During the 1400 epidemic heads of household who were registered for 1-3 years die in large numbers, whereas during years without epidemics, their death rate is lower than that of heads of household who were registered longer. Recent registration is an epidemic vulnerability factor only in association with a low taxation status, which, when isolated, does not influence mortality. A lack of familial ties within Dijon is another vulnerability factor among the recently registered. This suggests that poor, recent emigrants are more affected by epidemic mortality. In contrast, the mortality of recently registered heads of household is indistinct during a later epidemic occurring after several years of major famine that may have selected the more resistant emigrants and/or excluded the more miserable of them from our analysis. In contrast to the first one, this second epidemic is followed by rapid demographic recovery. This latter recovery is fully explained by the contribution of poor, newly registered heads of household without ties in Dijon.
   Conclusion
   Our results outline the interaction between population movement and low socioeconomic status on death susceptibility in historical plagues and show that poor recent emigrants may also be key players in the resilience of the population after an epidemic.

TI  - The Intersection of Palestine with Ferguson, Missouri
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECUMENICAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Is there intersectionalitybetween the battles waged againststate-sponsored violence and oppression on the streets of Gaza and the streets of Ferguson,Missouri? This essay examines and compares events in Gaza called Operation Protective Edge to a police crackdown on protest movements in Ferguson, both occurring in 2014. The military action in Gaza launched by the Israel Defense Forces was a reaction to the murder of three teens in Hebron. In Ferguson 18-year-oldMichael Brown was shot by white police officer Darren Wilson. The murder of Michael Brown triggereda nationalwakefulness to the ways policing affects communities of color.Brown's death came less than a month after a New York Police Department officer used a chokehold on Eric Garnerin New York City. The deaths of these two black men was a breakingpoint in a summer where telephone video and eyewitness descriptions of police violence drew national attention. In Ferguson,protesters rallied by the Black Lives Matter movement ignited the Ferguson Uprising, a series of protests where residents-thepreponderance of them black, many of them working-class or low-income- called attention to questions that had long been present in parts of the St. Louis suburb: poverty, inequality, and police violence. The protests were met with police who were wearing elite killing gear similar to that of the Israel Defense Force. The Ferguson protests both added momentum to the national Black Lives Matter movement and generated offense from people angered by TV coverage of protesterswho hurled rocks and insults atpolice. The end game ofpolicing in Gaza and Ferguson is the same. The objective is to suppress the right to free assembly, expression, and association.The mission is to stop unarmed people from protesting against their oppression.

AB  - Movement toward gender equality has occurred worldwide for the past century; nevertheless, some people still strongly endorse traditional gender norms. We investigated the associations of societal characteristics (gross domestic product [GDP] per capita and the gender empowerment measure) and cultural characteristics, including Hofstede's, Schwartz's, and Welzel's scores (hierarchy vs. egalitarianism, person vs. social focus, mastery vs. harmony, long-term orientation, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity-femininity), with support for traditional household gender roles. To reveal advantageous or disadvantageous conditions for support for traditional household gender roles, we conducted a secondary data analysis with representative samples (n = 59,713) of 41 societies collected by the International Social Survey Program. According to the multilevel modeling analysis, individuals have lower endorsement of traditional household gender roles in societies that value mastery and enjoy economic development (i.e., GDP per capita), gender equality (measured by the gender empowerment measure), and personal focus. Contrarily, individuals have higher endorsement of traditional household gender roles in societies where hierarchy, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and masculine characteristics are valued. Individual characteristics (women, work experience, education, big-city experience, and younger generations) also predict lower support for traditional household gender roles. In addition, gender differences in traditional household gender roles are larger in societies with greater economic development and personal focus and lower emphasis on hierarchy and long-term orientation. Finally, the national means of traditional household gender roles predict concurrent social movement activities and gender equality at a later time. Potential mechanisms are further discussed.

AB  - Urbanization implies a dramatic impact on ecosystems, which may lead to drastic phenotypic differences between urban and nonurban individuals. For instance, urbanization is associated with increased metabolic costs, which may constrain body size, but urbanization also leads to habitat fragmentation, which may favor increases in body mass when for instance it correlates with dispersal capacity. However, this apparent contradiction has rarely been studied. This is particularly evident in China where the urbanization process is currently occurring at an unprecedented scale. Moreover, no study has addressed this issue across large geographical areas encompassing locations in different climates. In this regard, Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) are a suitable model to study the impact of urbanization on wild animals because they are a widely distributed species tightly associated with humans. Here, we collected body mass and wing length data for 359 breeding individuals of Barn Swallow (H. r. gutturalis) from 128 sites showing different levels of urbanization around the whole China. Using a set of linear mixed-effects models, we assessed how urbanization and geography influenced body size measured using body mass, wing length, and their regression residuals. Interestingly, we found that the impact of urbanization was sex-dependent, negatively affecting males' body mass, its regression residuals, and females' wing length. We also found that northern and western individuals were larger, regarding both body mass and wing length, than southern and eastern individuals. Females were heavier than males, yet males had slightly longer wings than females. Overall, our results showed that body mass of males was particularly sensitive trait to urbanization, latitude, and longitude, while it only showed a weak response to latitude in females. Conversely, while wing length showed a similar geographical pattern, it was only affected by urbanization in the case of females. Further research is needed to determine whether these phenotypic differences are associated with negative effects of urbanization or potential selective advantages.

AB  - This paper outlines adult learning in a rural campaign to prevent mining for coal seam gas in Victoria. In central Gippsland, largely known as the food bowl in the State of Victoria in Australia, a campaign against fracking for coal seam gas has managed to gain a permanent ban on fracking. This policy change would not have been possible without strategic locally based community campaigning that has mobilised protesters in many rural towns across central Gippsland. This paper examines how a diverse movement of circumstantial activists; farmers, tree changers and a small group of experienced environmental activists, have been able to resist coal seam gas exploration and fracking by large mining companies. Situated in the 'pedagogical turn' in new social movements, it examines the strategic educative processes that are involved in building a movement for change and the social conditions which enable informal, incidental learning and non-formal learning to occur as activists learn both individually and collectively from one another in the site of protest. Drawing on qualitative case study data and in-depth interviews, this research embodies the dynamic nature of activists' experiences as they learn to challenge powerful discourses of economic development, in a time of neoliberal economic dominance, by resisting multinational mining companies fracking on their land.

AB  - In this data paper three datasets are described containing GPS tracking and acceleration data of Western marsh harriers (Circus aeruginosus) breeding in Belgium and the Netherlands. The Western marsh harrier is included as a threatened bird species in Annex I of the European Bird Directive due to the steep decline in population densities. In order to collect data of habitat use and migration behaviour, Western marsh harriers were equipped with light-weight solar powered GPS trackers developed by the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) at the University of Amsterdam (University of Amsterdam Bird Tracking System, UvA-BiTS). These trackers automatically collect and store data on the bird's activity and 3D position in time and transmit these data to ground stations. The datasets were collected by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) and the Dutch Montagu's Harrier Foundation. Tracked Western marsh harriers were breeding in the northeast of the Dutch province of Groningen and on the opposite side of the river Ems in Germany (H_GRONINGEN), in the region of Waterland-Oudeman near the Belgian-Dutch border (MH_WATERLAND), and at the left bank of the Scheldt estuary, close to the Belgian-Dutch border and north of the city of Antwerp (MH_ANT WERPEN). Most individuals remained within 10 km from their nesting sites during the breeding season and wintered in West Africa. H_GRONINGEN contains 987,493 GPS fixes and 3,853,859 acceleration records of four individuals since 2012. MH_WATERLAND contains 377,910 GPS fixes of seven individuals. Sampling in this region began in 2013. Three more Western marsh harriers were tagged in the Scheldt estuary near Antwerp more recently in 2018 (one individual) and 2019 (two individuals) for the MH_ANTWERPEN study, which contains 47,917 GPS fixes and 227,746 acceleration records. The three Western marsh harrier datasets were published as separate studies in Movebank (https://www. movebank.org) and archived as data packages in Zenodo (https://www.zenodo.org) to ensure long-term preservation and versioning of the data.

AB  - In kindergarten, pediatric head injuries occur commonly and are being reported in increasing numbers. Among multiple reasons that caused them, balance ability is considered the critical one. In this paper we conduct a study to describe factors that related to balance ability. First we conduct Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC) tests on children between 5-6 from urban and rural areas to collect data, and then we visualize and perform data mining techniques to further explore the data, we utilized state-of-the-art classification models to highlight key factors that influence children balance ability. Experimental results show that balance ability is closely related to the performance of catching beanbag and walking with heels raised. We also found that for balance ability prediction using our dataset, XGBoost and BP neural network perform better than decision tree. The promising results will undoubtedly provide guidance on how to improve children motor skills and assist teachers for reducing injures.

AB  - Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood-onset, chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics. TS poses a considerable burden on both patients and health care providers, leading to a major detriment of educational success, occupation, and interpersonal relationships. A multidisciplinary, specialist-driven management approach is required due to the complexity of TS. However, access to such specialty care is often dramatically limited by the patients' locations and the specialists' geographic clustering in large urban centers. Telemedicine uses electronic information and communication technology to provide and support health care when distance separates participants. Therefore, we conducted this mini-review to describe the latest information on telemedicine in the assessment and management of TS and discuss the potential contributions to care for TS patients with a multidisciplinary approach. We believe that telemedicine could be a revolutionary method in improving medical access to patients with TS.

AB  - This article analyses the interrelation of ethnicity, class and tenure in the gentrification trajectories that have taken place in England in the most recent intercensal period (2001-2011). It argues that the return of the Private Rented Sector has made possible the extension of social change to areas not favored by White British (majority ethnic) middle-class owner-occupiers. This has seen the inflow of White British private renters into White British working-class areas and the arrival of private renting Not White British middle classes - primarily migrants - in working-class areas with a significant proportion of Not White British individuals. There is thus an ethnic dimension to the geographical spread of buy-to-let gentrification and the movement toward property wealth re-concentration it feeds. The middle-class individuals entering gentrifying areas as private renters are however not classical gentrifiers as the closing of rent gaps starts with the supply of private rented units by property investors.

AB  - The Synod of Emden, which took place from 04 to 13 October 1571 in the city of Emden, is of great importance to the reformed churches in South Africa. In this contribution the importance of the Synod is highlighted from three distinct perspectives: Firstly, from a historical perspective, the establishment and growth of Calvinism in the Netherlands up to the Synod of Emden is described. Secondly, from the perspective of church polity, some principles of church governance, which the Synod of Emden has formulated, are discussed. Thirdly, from the perspective of language history, some remarks are made on the use of Netherdutch by the Synod of Emden and the continued use of Neticrdnits in the name of the Dutch Reformed churches in South Africa. The early phase of Dutch reformation was characterised by great diversity. It was a time of fluid and changing reformation movements. Not only did the magisterial reformers such as Luther, Bullinger, Calvin, Beza and Zwingli influenced ecclesia I transformation in the Netherlands, but the Humanism of Erasmus was well-known and influential; the work of the Brothers of Common Life and Geert Groote had much influence through the education of children; the Devotio Moderna and lutitatio Christi of of Kempis influenced a new type of spirituality; the older proto-reformation movements of Cornelis Hoen and Hinne Rode still had some influence; the Anabaptist movements of Melchior Hoffmann, Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt and Menno Simmons were active in many towns and communities. Despite this diversity, it is quite remarkable how the Dutch reformation was influenced fundamentally from the French-speaking south, especially by the theology of John Calvin. The unity between the Dutch and French churches was formalised by the Synod of Emden. The unity in confession and organisation was articulated expressis verbis in the second resolution of the Synod. The reformed churches in the Netherlands were persecuted and disorganised. VVar broke out between Spain and the Netherlands. There existed a great need for direction and structure. One of the remarkable features of the Reformation was its ability to rethink, reorganise and restructure the church. Instruments used in this process of reformation was not only the establishment of the sang ductrina, but also the use of assemblies such as synods and the publication of church orders which articulated the basic principles of reformed church governance. The importance of church orders as instruments of change is often under-valued. It was no different with the Synod of Emden. The Synod and the principles of church governance laid the foundation of the Dutch Reformed Church and gave direction to the reformation movement in the Netherlands, also in terms of language and the use of Nederduitsch, a term which is still used in the names of some reformed churches in South Africa.

AB  - Conflicts between humans and wildlife have become increasingly important challenges for resource managers along the urban-wildland interface. Food conditioning (i.e., reliance by an animal on anthropogenic foods) of American black bears (Ursus americanus) is related to conflict behavior (i.e., being bold or aggressive toward humans, consuming human food or garbage, causing property damage) and often occurs in communities adjacent to Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM or Park), USA. The goal of our study was to evaluate black bear space use in GRSM and in exurban areas on surrounding private lands and to identify factors associated with food conditioning and conflict behavior. We radio-collared 53 bears (29 males, 24 females) from 2015 to 2017 to compare space use characteristics and used carbon isotopic signatures (delta C-13) from bear hair to assess food conditioning. We then performed an integrated step selection function (iSSF) analysis to characterize and compare movement and resource use as related to food conditioning. Based on the stable isotope analyses, 24 bears were classified as food conditioned (FC; 16 males and 8 females) and 37 were not food conditioned (NFC; 14 males and 23 females). Annual 95% kernel density estimate (KDE) home ranges and 50% KDE core area estimates of female and male bears did not differ by level of food conditioning (i.e., mean delta C-13), but 95% and 50% home ranges of FC females were smaller than NFC females when data from 2015, a year of food scarcity and abnormally large home ranges, were excluded. The mean proportion of exurban development (e.g., roads, buildings, openings) within 95% KDE and 50% KDE home ranges of females increased with mean delta C-13 (i.e., greater food conditioning). The iSSF models indicated that FC bears were more likely to use forest openings associated with higher levels of development than NFC bears. We used those models to demonstrate how landscape modifications can reduce bear use of exurban areas, particularly for NFC bears. Our stable isotope, movement, and resource use data indicate that conflict behaviors displayed by many bears within GRSM were learned in areas outside Park boundaries. (c) 2020 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - In 1968, protests against the old order swept the world. From the general strike in France and the student occupations in Paris to the Tet offensive in Vietnam, and from the Black Panthers in the US to the Prague Spring, the movement was contagious. In Britain a wave of student protests and sit-ins took place, most famously at the LSE and Hornsey College of Art but also at a wide range of other campuses and colleges, including at Leeds University. On 31 May 2018, to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of 'May 1968', a meeting jointly sponsored by the Ford Maguire Society, International Socialism and Taking Soundings was held at the Swarthmore Centre in Leeds to remember what radical politics in 1968 in the city was like. The speakers at the meeting were all activists in 1968: Mike McGrath, Sarah Perrigo, Tom Steele, Lou Lavender and Max Farrar, and the meeting was kindly chaired by Gilda Petersen. This article brings together their recollections and reflections, with a transcript of some of the debate which followed. The introduction, editorial work, transcription and additional explanatory notes are by Christian Hogsbjerg.

TI  - Twenty-First Century Afrofuturist Aliens Shifting to the Space of Third Contact
T2  - EXTRAPOLATION

KW  - RACE
AB  - It may seem odd that Afrofuturism, a dynamic movement, still employs alien figures. Sun-Ra's extraterrestrial performances offered foundational alternatives to negative social inscriptions and deletions of African diaspora members. But while the 1970s positioned outer "space [a]s the place" of Black potentiality, I contend twenty-first-century Afrofuturists move beyond extraterrestrial Otherness into a re-engaging "third contact." Extrapolating from Rachel Haywood Ferreira's concept of "second contact" in Latin American SF, where colonial engagement served as first contact and extraterrestrial arrival as second, I posit "third contact" between Earthbound human factions (e.g., communities on opposing sides of the Black Atlantic or city citizens from distinct economic striations). I unearth the potentiality of third contact through literary works by authors Nnedi Okorafor, Tade Thompson, and N. K. Jemisin. Even so, Afrofuturism transcends textual formats. To celebrate this multimodality, I turn to Selly Raby Kane's fashion shows, which offer tangible evidence of the spatial registers of third contact. These societal interventions occur in and revise what Edward Soja termed thirdspace. As such, Afrofuturist writers offer a way to reclaim Black futures on this planet, despite present continued control of violent and discriminatory histories.

AB  - Inspired by the recent social movement of #MeToo, we are building a chatbot to assist survivors of sexual harassment cases (designed for the city of Maastricht but can easily be extended). The motivation behind this work is twofold: properly assist survivors of such events by directing them to appropriate institutions that can offer them help and increase the incident documentation so as to gather more data about harassment cases which are currently under reported. We break down the problem into three data science/machine learning components: harassment type identification (treated as a classification problem), spatio-temporal information extraction (treated as Named Entity Recognition problem) and dialogue with the users (treated as a slot-filling based chatbot). We are able to achieve a success rate of more than 98% for the identification of a harassment-or-not case and around 80% for the specific type harassment identification. Locations and dates are identified with more than 90% accuracy and time occurrences prove more challenging with almost 80%. Finally, initial validation of the chatbot shows great potential for the further development and deployment of such a beneficial for the whole society tool.

AB  - Background: The Saudi healthcare system is mainly staffed by foreign doctors who constitute about 73% of the total medical workforce. But, the high rate of turnover among these foreigners had deposited an additional un-bearable cost and threatens the stability of the provided healthcare services in the country.
   Objectives: This study was conducted to explore the professional and personal challenges that were experienced by foreign medical doctors while working in one of the major governmental tertiary-care hospitals in Riyadh city. The study also seeks to explore the factors that could influence or motivate their retention.
   Methods: A qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews was conducted on January 2018. A total of 16 foreign doctors were recruited purposefully using a maximum variation sampling strategy. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis technique.
   Results: Three primary themes have been emerged based on the data analysis: (1) Work-related challenges such as; communication and discrimination challenges. (2) Living-related challenges such as; supportive services and restricted movement challenges. (3) Factor motivating retention such as providing good children education, of-fering flexible traveling regulations, and providing professional development opportunities.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study have indicated that there are more important motivators than money for improving the retention of foreign doctors in the country. Several policy actions have been recommended to maintain their essential role. For example; implementing an ethical code to protect them from receiving deceptive hiring information, developing a specialized pocket dictionary to overcome language barriers, embracing "workforce diversity management" techniques to minimize discrimination at institutional level, and finally it is also recommended to include the foreign doctors' family needs and other living related challenges in any future retention strategies.

AB  - Introduction. As a social group with its specific features and motivation, students have been long characterized by their active involvement in social and political unrest. However, the behavioral analysis of students in different historical situations has become an independent research topic as late as in the 1960s. Numerous nuances of student activity remain for that reason unexplored. That is true of the process of student politicization and nationalization in the multi-ethnic Austrian empire during the tumultuous year of 1848. In literature, this issue is either pushed aside or based on an image of a radical "Austrian" student helping proletarians to fight against the regime on barricades. The latter is not relevant in view of the diversity of student sentiments and ideas that were present in the vast Habsburg hereditary lands. Methods and materials. This article analyzes students' sympathies and actual participation in the rebellious events of 1848 considering the cases of two universities - that of the capital city of Vienna and the university of provincial Innsbruck. The study is based on students' memoires, pamphlets, letters and newspapers of that time, as well as official documents and appeals by the government. Analysis. The analysis shows that Viennese students had an effective voice in revolutionary events, but their demands were of relatively moderate liberal character, while they largely remained loyal to the emperor. The revolutionary activity of provincial students was much more modest and peaceful than in Vienna. In case of Innsbruck, in particular, an image of a patriotic student fighting with arms for his emperor and fatherland replaced the image of a student fighting for political freedoms. Results. The participation of students in the revolutionary events of 1848 resulted in politicization of the "Austrian" student body and its consolidation as an independent social group.

AB  - Analysis of genetic polymorphism is a powerful tool for epidemiological surveillance and research. Powerful inference from pathogen genetic variation, however, is often restrained by limited access to representative target DNA, especially in the study of obligate parasitic species for which ex vivo culture is resource-intensive or bias-prone. Modern sequence capture methods enable pathogen genetic variation to be analyzed directly from host/vector material but are often too complex and expensive for resource-poor settings where infectious diseases prevail. This study proposes a simple, cost-effective 'genome-wide locus sequence typing' (GLST) tool based on massive parallel amplification of information hotspots throughout the target pathogen genome. The multiplexed polymerase chain reaction amplifies hundreds of different, user-defined genetic targets in a single reaction tube, and subsequent agarose gel-based clean-up and barcoding completes library preparation at under 4 USD per sample. Our study generates a flexible GLST primer panel design workflow for Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasitic agent of Chagas disease. We successfully apply our 203-target GLST panel to direct, culture-free metagenomic extracts from triatomine vectors containing a minimum of 3.69 pg/mu l T. cruzi DNA and further elaborate on method performance by sequencing GLST libraries from T. cruzi reference clones representing discrete typing units (DTUs) TcI, TcIII, TcIV, TcV and TcVI. The 780 SNP sites we identify in the sample set repeatably distinguish parasites infecting sympatric vectors and detect correlations between genetic and geographic distances at regional (< 150 km) as well as continental scales. The markers also clearly separate TcI, TcIII, TcIV and TcV + TcVI and appear to distinguish multiclonal infections within TcI. We discuss the advantages, limitations and prospects of our method across a spectrum of epidemiological research.
   Author summary
   This study details a rapid and cost-effective amplicon sequencing-based approach to measuring genome-wide DNA polymorphism in pathogenic microorganisms. Library preparation is completed in two simple polymerase chain reactions and thus avoids significant costs and biases of cell purification and culturing procedures typically involved prior to the sequencing of obligate parasite genomes. An emphasis on reaction multiplexability during primer panel design enables efficient genome-wide target amplification directly from infection source DNA. We provide proof-of-principle by genotyping hundreds of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the Chagas disease agent Trypanosoma cruzi using metagenomic DNA extracts from infected triatomine (kissing bug) intestinal material collected in Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. We also evaluate method performance using reference clone DNA. Results distinguish T. cruzi population structure and diversity patterns from within-city to cross-country scales and recapitulate ancestral relationships among the sub-lineages TcI, TcIII, TcIV, TcV and TcVI. Unbalanced alternate allele frequency distributions repeatedly measured in a subset of samples also suggest potential to distinguish co-infection by multiple TcI strains. We discuss further applications as well as possibilities for method refinement.

AB  - Background. Blow flies are a family of dipterans of medical, veterinary and sanitary importance. We aim to predict the current geographical distribution of six neotropical blowfly species with different altitudinal ranges of distribution (high, medium, and lowlands) and degree of synanthropy (eusynanthropic, hemisynanthropic and asynanthropic) based on their existing fundamental niche (EA) in Northwestern South America.
   Methods. Geographical records were compiled based on data from museum specimens and literature. The accessible area hypothesis (M) was calculated based on three criteria: (1) Altitudinal range, (2) Synanthropy values deducted based on the Human Influence Index (HII) raster dataset, and (3). The mean dispersal capability of flies. The modeling was performed using the Maxent entropy modeling software. The selection of parameters was made with the R Program ENMeval package.
   Results. The models were assessed using the area under the operator-partial receiver curve (ROCp). The high statistical performance was evidenced in every modeling prediction. The modeling allowed identifying possible taxonomic inaccuracies and the lack of exhaustive collection in the field, especially for lowlands species. Geographical distribution predicted by the modeling and empirical data was remarkably coherent in montane species.
   Discussion. The data obtained evidence that montane elevational ranges affect the performance of the distribution models. These models will allow a more precise predicting of medium and high elevation blow flies than lowlands species. Montane species modeling will accurately predict the fly occurrence to use such biological information for medical, legal, veterinary, and conservation purposes.

AB  - The north-south transitional zone in China mainly consists of the Qinling-Daba Mountains. It is the most important West-East geo-ecological space in China, containing protected areas vital for biodiversity conservation and ecological security of China. The protection and rational development of its natural habitat is of great significance to China's ecological security and integration of protected areas based on mountain forest ecosystems on a global scale. In this study, five important types of protected areas in the transitional zone were selected, and their spatial patterns were analysed. Spatial analysis methods, such as kernel density estimation and accessibility analysis, were employed for both point and areal data, and focused on four aspects: land use scale, shift in the centre of gravity, spatial agglomeration, and accessibility. In addition, policy background and evolution of spatial and temporal characteristics of the protected area system in the transitional zone from 1963 to 2017 were also examined. We analysed the characteristics and geographical significance of the West-east corridor using the spatial pattern of the protected area system from the perspective of ecological and economic spaces. We focused on spatial shape, type intersection, and key areas to analyse the spatial overlap of the protected areas. Protected area establishment was divided into three stages: initial (1956-1980), rapid development (1981-2013), and national park transformation (2014-present). These stages reflected the change in the concept of 'simple protection-sustainable use-integration and upgrade' for protected areas of China. The spatial centre of gravity of the protection zone system was located in the west Qinling-Daba Mountains, and its high-density core exhibited a relatively stable N-shaped structure composed of four gathering areas. Affected by factors such as geographic environment and socio-economic development density, the average access time for protected areas was high (1.56 h); wetland parks and scenic areas are located closer to the city centre. As the West-east corridor in the transitional zone extends from west to east, there is a clear spatial dislocation between the development of protected areas and the intensity of human activities. During development, differentiated goal orientation should be adopted based on the idea of zoning and classified governance. With the advancement of the construction of protected areas, the spatial overlap of protected areas in the transition zone has become more prominent. At present, the spatially overlapped protected areas in the transitional zone remain prominent, with inclusion overlap being the most common, and forest parks exhibiting the highest probability of overlap with other protected areas, we should focus on in the integration process of the corridor-type ecological space based on the mountain forest ecosystem.

AB  - Soil creep is common along the hillslopes of the tropical Andes of Colombia, where very heterogeneous soils develop on old debris flow deposits and are subjected to abundant rainfall with a bimodal annual regime. In particular, the western hillside of the city of Medellin, Colombia, is comprised of a series of debris and earth flow deposits in which landslides and soil creep are common. To explore linkages between soil creep and hydrology, we selected an experimental site in the western hillslope of the Medellin valley to assess the behavior of water within the soil mass, its relationship with rainfall, and its connection with soil displacement. In experimental plots, we systematically measured runoff, percolation, water table levels, and volumetric water content, for a period of almost 2 years; we also conducted several alti-planimetric positioning surveys to estimate relative displacements of the soil surface. Moisture content of the soil remained above field capacity for most of the year (similar to 68% of the time) and active and quasi-permanent lateral subsurface flow occurred within the upper 80 cm of the profile. The shallow flow likely facilitates the downslope movement. Additionally, our results suggest that displacement magnitudes are largest during the wet season of September-October-November, when a highly humid soil experiences changes in water content, so it is during this time that the effects of expansion / contraction of the soil particles (associated to wetting / drying cycles) contribute the most to the movement. This observational study represents a contribution to the understanding of soil creep in tropical hillslopes, where it responds to the wetting / drying cycles, with the particularities of a rainy weather (>1500 mm/year), warm temperatures (similar to 22 degrees C on average), and a bimodal precipitation seasonality.

AB  - The Castle Mountain Fault (CMF) lies less than 50 km from Alaska's most populous city of Anchorage and represents an important seismic hazard to the Anchorage-Matanuska-Susitna Valley region in southcentral Alaska. The character of seismicity varies along the CMF. Although the western CMF (between 149.5 degrees and 151 degrees W) shows evidence for Late Pleistocene or Holocene reverse and dextral movement, it has been seismically quiet over the past similar to 50 years of local seismic network operation. In contrast, the CMF east of 149.5 degrees W is associated with considerable background seismicity, including the M-w 5.81984 strike-slip Sutton earthquake. We have used gravity and magnetic data, constrained with results of previous seismic reflection and seismic tomography studies, to model subsurface structure of the CMF in an effort to determine what may control the variation in its seismic behavior. Our models are consistent with a component of high angle reverse faulting (northwest side up, dip similar to 85 degrees to 87 degrees) that appears to have vertically offset Late Mesozoic rocks 2000 to 2500 m. Lack of data coverage precludes an estimate of its total strike-slip motion. Holocene movement on the CMF appears to be associated with a region where both sides of the fault consist of sedimentary rocks as defined by a gravity and magnetic low. If most of the vertical offset has occurred since the Miocene in response to collision of the Yakutat microplate with North America, then our results are comparable to recent thermochronological and paleoseismic estimates of vertical slip rates. Subduction of the edge of the Yakutat microplate appears to spatially influence seismic behavior along the CMF while the occurrence of the 1964 Great Alaska earthquake has also temporally affected local seismicity.

AB  - In legal courts the right to protest is often demarcated by its infringement on other constitutional rights in a typical illustration of graded absolutism when there is conflict between two overlapping sets of negative civil and political rights, with those of speech, expression, and movement culminating in rights to assembly and association on the one hand, and personal liberty and security on the other. The twentieth century ostensibly saw the end of blunt command and control policing in mature economies, but the practice of negotiated management is often thwarted at the scene. The strengths and limits of this philosophy are demonstrated in the political experiment that is Hong Kong, a postcolonial Chinese capitalist city with a proud legal and policing heritage from Britain. Crowd and riot management experiences have long been confined to festivities and peaceful rallies until the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. With constitutional freedoms of speech and assembly now upheld more explicitly than ever, the free, if less-than-democratically represented, population began to mobilize in discontent. Extraordinarily high public expectations of the police force highlighted its steep, treacherous learning curve as activists deployed, invented, and adapted protest techniques. As with many metropolitan forces, the tug of war between civil rights and public order rubs at the throat of the Hong Kong police. This essay examines these escalating developments in five key protest episodes that occurred after the 2003 Hong Kong mass rally. Police strategies are illustrated through established scholarly systems in police knowledge. Analysis suggests that, after the 2003 rally, the force has employed a passive-adaptive approach to evolving protest practices. The precious equilibrium, however, has been steadily disturbed following the loss of mutual trust between police and protesters, thus explaining the 2014 Umbrella Movement street confrontations.

CP  - 23rd IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)
AB  - In this study, we propose an ad-hoc framework for real-time turn count and trajectory reconstruction for vehicles passing through urban intersections. Our proposed framework utilizes virtual lanes representing the 8 standard National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) movements within an intersection. A Python Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed is utilized to identify entry planes for each NEMA movement, obtaining the trajectories and counts for the vehicles that are detected and identified at those planes which are then used as identifiers for other vehicles detected inside the intersection using a nearest neighbors search algorithm. Our proposed framework runs as an additional layer to any multi-object tracker with minimal additional computation, and the results of this preliminary assessment indicate the high potential that this proposed framework has in obtaining reliable turn count and in mitigating identity switches by resolving the vehicle re-identification that occurs within the intersection due to detection errors and occlusion, resulting in more accurate vehicle trajectories from video data which will aid developing more reliable intersection safety surrogate measures.

AB  - Trench basins preserved along the southern margin of the Lhasa Terrane, Tibet, are sedimentologic records of convergent margin processes preceding Cenozoic India-Asia collision. We present new sedimentologic, petrographic and geochronologic data from the Rongmawa Formation and surrounding strata near Denggar, Tibet, to determine depositional environment, provenance and age. Depositional ages range from ca. 92 to 87 Ma and lithofacies are consistent with deposition by low- and high-density turbidity currents and suspension settling of pelagic detritus in a deep-marine, trench basin setting. Sandstone modal analyses and U-Pb geochronology indicate that trench basin detritus in this region was derived from the Lhasa Terrane. We interpret that the Cretaceous subduction trench received detritus from an axial sediment dispersal system that transported sediment from headwaters in the central-southern Lhasa terrane near Lhasa City directly to the trench and then flowed westwards parallel to the trench. The preservation of trench basin strata deposited during Late Cretaceous time compared with the lack of trench deposits prior to ca. 92 Ma and after ca. 80 Ma suggests the margin experienced a period of significant accretion during this interval. In addition, deposition of trench basin strata occurred during Late Cretaceous adakitic magmatism and high-temperature metamorphism, which are hypothesized to be explained by subduction of an oceanic ridge or subduction zone retreat and related upper plate extension along the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane. Subduction of an oceanic ridge may provide a mechanism to potentially erode forearc basin strata and promote increased sediment delivery directly to the trench.

AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of trends and official monumental practice of preserving the memory of the great Patriotic war in the public consciousness. The Crimean Peninsula (the Republic of Crimea and the city of Federal significance Sevastopol) was chosen as an example. The choice of the object of study is dictated by both a significant memorable date and a high level of saturation of the region places associated with the great Patriotic war in its various forms: events on the fronts, the occupation, guerrilla and underground movement, the feat of home front workers. Drawing on extensive factual material, using the achievements of domestic and foreign research in the study of historical memory, the authors cover various facets of memorial practices in the Crimean land, trace the basic laws of the formation of the monumental-memorial space of the war, its changes over time, using elements of quantitative analysis. In conclusion, conclusions are made about the need for a scientific approach to the further development of the monuments of the great Patriotic war and their use as a resource to strengthen the Patriotic consciousness and civil identity of residents and guests of the Crimea.

AB  - Leishmaniases are a group of infectious diseases caused by protozoan Leishmania parasites and are transmitted by the bites of infected phlebotomine sandflies. The heterogeneity of these diseases is influenced by both parasitic properties and host factors. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a major public health problem in Morocco. where the geographical expansion of a (particularly CL caused by Leishmania tropica), the heterogeneous appearance of lesions and the difficulty in diagnosing CL contribute to late diagnosis of CL and delayed treatment of patients. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical profiles of patients with CL diagnosed in Casablanca (Morocco), which is a non-endemic area for CL. A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2010 and 2016, during which epidemiological and clinical data were collected from patients that met the inclusion criteria through an information sheet. Then, samples were obtained from each patient for parasitological and molecular diagnosis, and only patients with positive polymerase chain reaction and genotyping results were included in the study. Overall, 106 cases of CL were genotyped, of which 61 (57.5%) were caused by L. tropica, 38 (35.9%) by L major and 7 (6.6%) by L. infantum. While all age groups were affected. CL cases wherein L tropica was the causative agent were most frequently diagnosed in children aged 0-9 years (p = 0.005), whereas those caused by L. major were more frequently diagnosed in elderly patients (p = 0.004). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that two clinical variables were significantly associated with CL caused by L. tropica: lesion size (p = 0.002) and occurrence of lesion on the face (p = 0.005). Furthermore, the results of our survey highlighted the association of Leishmania infection when travelling to endemic areas. The high number of endemic foci where patients with CL were infected with L. tropica illustrated the tendency of this form to spread and generate epidemics, exposing young people to a greater degree to the disease. The epidemic status of CL caused by L tropica in Morocco and the increased movement of the population from rural to urban areas indicate a possible introduction of this species to urban areas.

AB  - It is of great necessity to observe Lu Xun from the human-geographical or cultural geographical perspective. Even the couple of corresponding case studies are able to reveal the whole picture. The "memes" of Lu Xun existed in the tie of Lu Xun with Shaanxi province, in the existential and imaginary relationships between him and the two cities of "An" (Xi'an and Yan'an), in Lu Xun studies conducted by Shaanxi's academic community, and in a variety of cultural events and phenomena such as Shaanxi writers' publications, as well as conferences and calligraphy activities in Shaanxi, are hinting from the indirect aspects at the profound impacts of Lu Xun over the modern and contemporary culture in China. The transmission, reception and transformation of Lu Xun in Shaanxi during various historical stages also indicate the changes occurring to political ideology, aesthetic judgment, values and academic paradigms. To discuss Lu Xun's "memes" in the regional culture of Shaanxi, which closely combines the region in the physical sense of cultural geography and Lu Xun study, is an important component of Lu Xun studies, as well as an effective path to delve into the research on the ties of Lu Xun with China, or even with the world, for the further attempt to comprehensively understand the significance and value of Lu Xun to the new culture in China, as well as to the modern and contemporary culture.

AB  - Introduction Bioaerosols play an important role in incidence of infections in indoor and outdoor air of hospitals. Microorganismsplay a critical role in the health ofhuman beings and they are found everywhere in the environment, including different wards of a hospital. So, quantitative and qualitative analysis of microorganisms is highly important in hospital air. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity and density of bacteria and fungi in the air of Shohadaye Mehrab Hospital in Yazd City, Iran. Materials and methods Sampling was performed using a single-stage pump (Quick Take30) at a flow rate of 28.3 l per minute for five minutes. As a result, 288 indoor and outdoor hospital air samples were collected. Numbers and types of bacterial and fungal colonies were identified using colony morphology, gram staining, and standard microbial tests. Chi-square test, PCA and linear mixed model were run by SPSS version 24.0 for data analysis. Results The highest bacterial contaminations were found in the burns ward (294 CFU/m(3)), operating theater (147 CFU/m(3)), and emergency department (124 CFU/m(3)), respectively. Fungal contamination was higher in the derm ward (110 CFU/m(3)) than other sampling sites. The dominant genus of gram-positive bacteria wasStaphylococcus epidermidis(n = 60, 62.5%) and the dominant genus of gram-negative bacteria was Citrobacter freundi (n = 11, 11.5%). The most fungal gens isolated from the hospital air samples were Penicillium (n = 73, 76%), Alternaria (n = 51, 53.1%), Aspergillus niger (n = 40, 41.7%), and Aspergillus flavus (n = 34, 35.4%), respectively. Conclusion Considering that the burn wounds represent a susceptible site for opportunistic microorganisms, even low concentration of fungi/bacteria in air can be considered as arisk factor that facilitates transmission of the infectiousagents in the hospital. Therefore, control measures should be taken to reduce the infection hazard in health staff and patients. These measures include ensuring effective ventilation, cleaning and decontaminating surfaces and equipment, restricting the personnel and patient companions' movement across the wards.

AB  - On 25 March 2019, the Lorestan Province, Iran, suffered a heavy rainstorm. This rainstorm flooded the city of Pol-e-Dokhtar and many villages. To elucidate and monitor the nature of the spatial extent during and after the flood event, and to evaluate flood-induced ground displacement, the time series Sentinel 1 images were analyzed using threshold and SBAS-InSAR techniques. The SAR images were first calibrated, geometrically corrected, and filtered. Then, the threshold method was applied to draw the map of the affected areas. The results showed that flood spatial propagation varies through time. The nature of spatial extent was sinusoidal, so that the flood behavior complied with precipitation periods. Furthermore, the findings of the SBAS-InSAR indicated how an extreme flood can cause ground displacement. Several active movement areas were identified, showing a surface velocity up to -1.1 mm day(-1) away from the satellite. The field observations demonstrated that the landslide phenomenon occurred in some of these areas. Therefore, the other identified areas can also be at risk of landslides. Finally, based on the findings, it is evident that SAR data can effectively be used for flood water mapping, flood monitoring, and flood-induced ground displacement.

AB  - Soil acidification is a major environmental issue associated with intensive agricultural land use. Rapid urbanization has inevitably caused great changes in agricultural land use around urban areas. However, the effects of agricultural land-use change and soil parent material on the pH dynamics of the whole soil profile remain poorly understood. Based on a paired soil resampling campaign in the 1980s and 2010s, this study evaluated the effects of agricultural land-use change and parent materials on the pH dynamics of the soil profile across the Chengdu Plain of China. The results showed that soil pH significantly decreased by 1.20, 0.72, 0.66 and 0.68 units at the 0-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-100 cm soil depths, respectively. Conversions of traditional rice-wheat/rapeseed rotations to rice-vegetable rotations and afforested land significantly increased the magnitude of pH decline at the 0-60cm soil depth. Soils formed from Q4 grey-brown alluvium and Q4 grey alluvium, which had a lower soil bulk density (BD) and higher sand content, showed a much higher magnitude of pH decline than soils formed from Q3 (Quaternary Pleistocene) old alluvium, and significant acidification of deep soils only occurred in soils formed from Q4 (Quaternary Holocene) grey-brown alluvium and Q4 grey alluvium. These results suggested that agricultural land-use change aggravated acidification in the soil profile and the soil acidification degrees were parent material-dependent; in particular, significant acidification of deep soils was more inclined to occur in soils with lower soil BD and higher sand content due to their effects on the downward movement of acids and the penetration resistance of plant roots. More attention should be given to minimizing or preventing acidification of both topsoil and deep soils aggravated by agricultural land-use change across urban agricultural areas.

AB  - A comprehensive modelling approach has been developed to predict population exposure to the ambient air PM2.5 concentrations in different microenvironments in London. The modelling approach integrates air pollution dispersion and exposure assessment, including treatment of the locations and time activity of the population in three microenvironments, namely, residential, work and transport, based on national demographic information. The approach also includes differences between urban centre and suburban areas of London by taking account of the population movements and the infiltration of PM2.5 from outdoor to indoor. The approach is tested comprehensively by modelling ambient air concentrations of PM2.5 at street scale for the year 2008, including both regional and urban contributions. Model analysis of the exposure in the three microenvironments shows that most of the total exposure, 85%, occurred at home and work microenvironments and 15% in the transport microenvironment. However, the annual population weighted mean (PWM) concentrations of PM2.5 for London in transport microenvironments were almost twice as high (corresponding to 13-20 mu g/m(3)) as those for home and work environments (7-12 mu g/m(3)). Analysis has shown that the PWM PM2.5 concentrations in central London were almost 20% higher than in the surrounding suburban areas. Moreover, the population exposure in the central London per unit area was almost three times higher than that in suburban regions. The exposure resulting from all activities, including outdoor to indoor infiltration, was about 20% higher, when compared with the corresponding value obtained assuming inside home exposure for all times. The exposure assessment methodology used in this study predicted approximately over one quarter (-28%) lower population exposure, compared with using simply outdoor concentrations at residential locations. An important implication of this study is that for estimating population exposure, one needs to consider the population movements, and the infiltration of pollution from outdoors to indoors.

AB  - Sao Paulo, a densely inhabited state in southeast Brazil that contains the fourth most populated city in the world, recently experienced its largest yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreak in decades. YFV does not normally circulate extensively in Sao Paulo, so most people were unvaccinated when the outbreak began. Surveillance in non-human primates (NHPs) is important for determining the magnitude and geographic extent of an epizootic, thereby helping to evaluate the risk of YFV spill over to humans. Data from infected NHPs can give more accurate insights into YFV spread than when using data from human cases alone. To contextualise human cases, identify epizootic foci and uncover the rate and direction of YFV spread in Sao Paulo, we generated and analysed virus genomic data and epizootic case data from NHP in Sao Paulo. We report the occurrence of three spatiotemporally distinct phases of the outbreak in Sao Paulo prior to February 2018. We generated 51 new virus genomes from YFV positive cases identified in 23 different municipalities in Sao Paulo, mostly sampled from NHPs between October 2016 and January 2018. Although we observe substantial heterogeneity in lineage dispersal velocities between phylogenetic branches, continuous phylogeographic analyses of generated YFV genomes suggest that YFV lineages spread in Sao Paulo at a mean rate of approximately 1km per day during all phases of the outbreak. Viral lineages from the first epizootic phase in northern Sao Paulo subsequently dispersed towards the south of the state to cause the second and third epizootic phases there. This alters our understanding of how YFV was introduced into the densely populated south of Sao Paulo state. Our results shed light on the sylvatic transmission of YFV in highly fragmented forested regions in Sao Paulo state and highlight the importance of continued surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in sentinel species.

AB  - The presented study is an attempt for a multifaced research the registered prishaltsi (out-comers) in the Ottoman tax inventories - one of the most important indicator of the occurred demographic, ethno- religious, economic and even political changes during 16th - 17th cc. The author's observations are mainly focused on unpublished and just partially published Ottoman register material about sancak of Nikopol, while in the quantitative and statistical analysis is primarily used data from the detailed registered defters of 1516/17, 1541-45, 1579 (1613/14) and 1642/43-1646. One of the highlights is put on the reasons for the preservation of the authentic form of the word prishalets - prishelets (Gamma C Phi(sic)Mu), in the Ottoman registration practice, synonyms of which in Bulgarian language are preselnik (immigrant), chujdenets (foreigner), drugozemets (from another land), immigrant and others. One of the starting concepts in the study is that when registered in such manner they are clearly recognizable - for the local population, as well as for the Ottoman tax officers and clerks - as new settlers compared to permanent residents of the respective town or village. The outlined common characteristics of the discussed by the study prishaltsi, give grounds at least several key aspects of their role and place in the Bulgarian society during 16th - 17th cc. to be pointed out. First of all the so-called prishultsi are within the most important indicators of the demographic situation and the dynamics of migration processes for the period considered. The complex study of the data about them in the context of a number of other explanatory entries (ethnonyms and nicknames such as: surf/serb (serbian), vlach/eflyak, rum/ grak (greek), latin, arbanash/arnavut, etc.; annotations, locating the departure points of the migration; so called " escapes by the taxpaying population (reaya)" and other) gives a real opportunity the basic parameters of the migration processes to be outlined. They mark the intensity of migration processes during 16th - 17th cc. that had led to the depopulation of entire regions and destabilization of the Orthodox community, but along with it had provided the constant "mechanical" growth and economic boom of a number of major urban centers in the Bulgarian lands. The high concentration of prishaltsi in Kazgan Banara (today's town of Kotel), for example, as evidenced by the adduced register data, clearly marks the stages of the enlargement of the town and its transformation into one of the centres of the Bulgarian Revival movement. Among the outlined summaries the conclusion that deserves attention is that the so called prishaltsi are far from belonging to the marginalia of the society - neither at city level nor at village one. The summarized entries on taxes in all the commented registers from the 16th and 17th century do not detect any difference in taxation compared to the rest of the population, even when the prishaltsi are listed within the categories of population with special status and obligations to the central government. Furthermore, many of them are among the prosperous social classes in Bulgarian society throughout the whole period considered, and even afterwards.

AB  - Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are in decline in the western United States and are encountering a range of anthropogenic stressors. Pesticides are among the factors that likely contribute to this decline, although the concentrations of these chemicals in non-crop plants are not well documented, especially in complex landscapes with a diversity of crop types and land uses. In this study, we collected 227 milkweed (Asclepiasspp.) leaf samples from 19 sites representing different land use types across the Central Valley of California. We also sampled plants purchased from two stores that sell plants to home gardeners. We found 64 pesticides (25 insecticides, 27 fungicides, and 11 herbicides, as well as 1 adjuvant) out of a possible 262 in our screen. Pesticides were detected in every sample, even at sites with little or no pesticide use based on information from landowners. On average, approximately 9 compounds were detected per plant across all sites, with a range of 1-25 compounds in any one sample. For the vast majority of pesticides detected, we do not know the biological effects on monarch caterpillars that consume these plants; however, we did detect a few compounds for which effects on monarchs have been experimentally investigated. Chlorantraniliprole in particular was identified in 91% of our samples and found to exceed a tested LD(50)for monarchs in 58 out of 227 samples. Our primary finding is the ubiquity of pesticides in milkweeds in an early summer window of time that monarch larvae are likely to be present in the area. Thus, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that pesticide exposure could be a contributing factor to monarch declines in the western United States. This highlights the need for a greater understanding of both the lethal and sublethal effects of these compounds (individually, additively, and synergistically) and suggests the urgent need for strategies that reduce pesticide use and movement on the landscape.

AB  - Icelandic society has changed rapidly in recent decades. Immigration to Iceland has been growing steadily, and the country has evolved to become a relatively diverse society. In 1998, only 3.8% of preschool children had a mother tongue other than Icelandic. By 2018, this had increased to almost 14% (Hagstofa Islands, 2019 (Statistics Iceland)). In the city of Reykjavik, where the present study was conducted, this number is much higher. Preschools have a significant role to play for young children and their families in Iceland as preschools are where children spend most of their day. Preschools are often the first place where immigrant families meet other children and families. Among other things, children can learn about democracy, solidarity, equality and diversity (Evropuraoio, 2019 (European Commission)). The present study examines how this is put into practice and experienced by a diverse group of children and their educators in one preschool setting in Iceland.
   The study is grounded in the fields of Childhood Studies and the Children's Rights Movement. The study makes use of a model created by Lundy (2007) for the implementation of Article 12 of the UNCRC. The model has four features. The first is space, which means that children must be given a safe space and an opportunity to express their views. The second, voice, indicates that children must be provided with appropriate information and assisted in expressing their views. The third, audience, means that their views must be communicated to someone with the responsibility to listen. And the last is influence, which requires that children's views be taken seriously and acted upon appropriately. The study is also informed by the concept of `belonging' (Yuval-Davis, 2006; Juutinen, 2018). We regard belonging as a fundamental need of all people, one which is closely related to relationships and interconnections with people, social inclusion, and participation. The study also used the lens of multicultural education to analyse the preschool pedagogy. Nine children and four educators participated in the study. Data construction was twofold. First, interviews were conducted with the children using pictures they took on computer tablets. The children walked around the preschool with the researcher and took pictures on the tablets that became the stimulus for conversations that followed. The findings from the study with the children were then introduced to the educators, who reflected on the children's experiences. The findings inform the two themes; friendship and play, independence and self-dependence.
   In the minds of the children, belonging mainly meant friendship with other children in the preschool community. They connected friendship with play. They played mainly with children with similar cultural and language backgrounds. Children with non-Icelandic backgrounds seemed to have less choice of playmates and were more frequently excluded from play than their Icelandic peers. The children with Icelandic background also had more resources when they were excluded from play than children with foreign background. They were able to use Icelandic to express their feelings. The participating children were independent in terms of the daily activities of the preschool and they did not seek the educators' assistance if something came up, but rather retired. The educators reflected on their practices from the perspectives of the children and they had various ideas about how to support their belonging. Such ideas included finding ways to help the children adapt to the school culture and assist them with the Icelandic language. The educators did not seem conscious of the multicultural policy of the city of Reykjavik (Reykja-vikurborg, skola og fristundasvio, 2014) nor the emphasis on multicultural education and pedagogy that Icelandic educational authorities have expressed their will to move towards (mennta- og menningarmalaraouneytio, 2020).
   From the findings of the study we can assume that the discourse about how to support the belonging of children with diverse background is in its beginning phase in the Icelandic preschool community.

AB  - The effects of habitat loss on the distribution of populations are often linked with species specialization degree. Specialist species can be more affected by changes in landscape structure and local patch characteristics compared to generalist species. Moreover, the spatial scale at which different land covers (eg. habitat, cropland, urban areas) affect specialist species can be smaller. Specialization is usually assumed as a constant trait along the distribution range of species. However, for several taxa, there is evidence of higher specialization degree in peripheral populations compared with populations in the core. Hence, peripheral populations should have a higher sensitivity to habitat loss, and strongest effects should be found at a smaller spatial scale. To test these expectations, we implemented a patch-landscape approach at different spatial scales, and compared effects of landscape structure and patch characteristics on occupancy probability among northern peripheral, more specialized populations (Czech Republic) and core populations (Bulgaria) of the eastern green lizard Lacerta viridis. We found that landscape structure and patch characteristics affect differently the occupancy probability of Lacerta viridis in each region. Strongest effects of habitat loss were found at a spatial scale of 150m around patches in the periphery, but at a scale of 500m in the core. In the periphery occupancy probability of populations was principally affected by landscape composition, and the effect of habitat quality was stronger compared to core populations. In the core, persistence of populations was mainly explained by characteristics of the spatial configuration of habitat patches. We discuss possible ecological mechanisms behind the relationship between sensitivity to habitat loss, populations' specialization degree and position in the distribution range, and suggest conservation measures for L. viridis.

AB  - Over 70 million cage-birds are kept across 12 million households on the island of Java, Indonesia, fuelling serious concerns for the health of regional wild bird populations. Understanding the behaviours, preferences and demographic profiles of bird-keepers will guide attempts to reduce demand for wild birds and hence the impact of trade on wild populations and their host ecosystems. We profile three songbird-keeping user-groups based on interviews of nearly one thousand people across Java: hobbyists, who own birds primarily as pets; contestants, who own birds to enter in singing contests; and breeders, who own birds to breed and train for resale or as a pastime. User-groups diverged in their bird-keeping habits and preferences. Hobbyists tended to own small numbers of inexpensive and typically native birds, while contestants and breeders owned larger numbers of often valuable birds. Hobbyists were far less likely to consider origin when buying a bird, owned a larger proportion of both potentially wild-caught and globally threatened birds, but showed no preference for any taxon. By contrast, owning relatively large numbers of lovebirds Agapornis spp. and Zebra Doves Geopelia striata were key characteristics of contestants, while breeders owned the largest number of birds and species, in particular White-rumped Shamas Kittacincla malabarica. Within a 2-year period, user-group membership was fluid, with much transitioning between non-bird ownership and hobbyists, recruitment of non-bird owners to contestants and movement both in and out of the breeder group. Our study provides behavioural change efforts with demographic and geographic profiles to target bird-keepers, who tended to be more affluent and urban and to live in the eastern provinces. Among bird-keepers, hobbyists tended to be middle-aged and lived in the western provinces, contestants were younger urban bird-keepers employed in business and breeders were commoner in the eastern provinces, reflecting the cultural importance of bird-keeping among the Javanese. Efforts to increase the sustainability of bird-keeping in Java should focus on emphasizing the importance of captive-bred birds, in particular to hobbyists, the largest user-group, whose bird-keeping behaviour poses the biggest threat to wild bird populations, whilst also incentivizing legitimate breeding enterprises among contestants and breeders.
   Abstrak
   Lebih dari 70 juta burung dipelihara di sangkar oleh 12 juta keluarga di Pulau Jawa, Indonesia, memicu kekhawatiran mendalam tentang kondisi burung liar di pulau ini. Pemahaman tentang profil perilaku, preferensi dan demografi pemelihara burung.akan menjadi panduan untuk mengurangi permintaan akan burung liar dan karenanya juga dampak perdagangan burung liar dan ekosistem tempat hidupnya. Kami menggambarkan tiga kelompok-pengguna pemelihara burung berdasarkan pada wawancara dengan hampir tiga ribu orang di seluruh Jawa: penggemar, mereka yang memiliki burung sebagai hewan peliharaan; kontestan, mereka yang memiliki burung untuk lomba burung berkicau; dan peternak, mereka yang memiliki burung untuk diternak dan dilatih untuk dijual atau untuk hiburan. Kelompok-pengguna tersebut berbeda dalam kebiasaan dan kecenderungan memelihara burung. Penggemar cenderung memiliki sedikit burung yang tidak mahal dan umumnya jenis burung asli/lokal, sementara kontestan dan peternak memiliki banyak burung dan sering kali burung yang sangat mahal. Para penggemar sangat jarang mempertimbangkan asal-usul ketika membeli burung, sebagian besar memiliki burung yang mungkin berasal dari penangkapan di alam dan terancam secara global, tetapi tidak menunjukkan preferensi pada jenis tertentu. Sebaliknya, ciri utamakontestan adalah memiliki jumlah dan jenis burung paling banyak, terutama burung Kucica hutan Kittacincla malabarica. Dalam periode dua tahun, keanggotaan kelompok-pengguna berubah-ubah, dengan banyak transisi antara yang tidak memiliki burung dan penggemar; penambahan kelompok yang tidak memiliki burung ke konstestandan pergerakan masuk dan keluar dari kelompok peternak. Penelitian kami menyajikan upaya perubahan perilaku dengan profil demografik dan geografik dengan sasaran pemelihara burung, yang cenderung lebih makmur, urban dan tinggal di wilayah bagian timur. Di antara pemelihara burung, penggemar cenderung paruh baya, dan tinggal di Jawa bagian barat, kontestan adalah pemelihara burung yang lebih muda, urban, berwirausaha, dan peternak lebih umum di Jawa bagian timur, menunjukkan pentingnya aspek budaya dalam pelihara burung pada orang Jawa. Usaha-usaha untuk meningkatkan kelestarian pemeliharaan burung di Jawa harus fokus pada penekanan pentingnya burung hasil ternak di kandang, terutama untuk penggemar, kelompok pengguna terbesar, yang perilakunya memelihara burung telah menimbulkan ancaman terbesar pada populasi burung liar. Sementara itu perlu juga memberi insentif kepada para kontestan dan peternak yang berternak burung sesuai peraturan yang berlaku di Indonesia.

AB  - Involuntary migration is the coerced movement of people to a place away from their home of origin. Refugees are protected under international law, and they cross international borders to escape the risk of serious harm in their origin countries (UNHCR, 2019). At the end of 2018, approximately 25 million refugees had crossed international borders. However, there is another type of migrants that is not well defined nor protected by international law, which is the undocumented migrants. UNHCR has reported that refugees and undocumented migrants tend to flee to the nearest neighbouring countries, which are usually low and middle-income countries, rather than first world countries. This paper attempts to examine the effects of involuntary migration on the locals by investigating the widespread impacts that have occurred globally and reflect the situation to South-East Asian countries. A systematic review approach based on the PRISMA Statement was applied in this study. The Web of Science and Scopus scientific databases have identified 34 related studies on the effects of involuntary migrations. Six (6) categories of impacts have been identified, which include i) employment impact, ii) physical and environmental impact, iii) economic impact, iv) social and demographic impacts, v) facilities, welfare and educational impact and lastly vi) safety and security impacts. Reviewing the implications of involuntary migration can be a significant step forward for policymakers to improve their understanding of the issues, opportunity, and challenges faced by host countries in managing its people and resources. Underdeveloped and developing countries in the South-East Asian Region, including Malaysia, can plan to respond and address refugee influx in effective and efficient ways through proper resource planning and regulating legal and administrative framework.

AB  - A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is currently ongoing in Mauritania. Until 1 July 2020, Mauritania health authorities reported 41 862 serologic and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR tests performed, of which 4472 (10.7%) were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Male subjects were significantly more affected (57.1%) than female subjects (42.9%). Individuals of the age groups 15-34 years (35.8%) and 35-54 years (36.6%) were the most affected. There were 129 deaths (2.9%), 1677 recoveries (37.5%) and 2666 active cases (59.6%) of which 2261 (84.8%) were asymptomatic, 394 (14.7%) had mild symptoms and 11 (0.4%) had severe symptoms. A large proportion of fatalities (72%, 85/118) occurred among adults aged >55 years. Of 4472 positive cases, 4241 (94.8%) were infected through contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, 133 (3.0%) had no contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case and 98 (2.2%) were imported. As a response to COVID-19, the Mauritanian authorities announced a set of preventive measures, including closure of land and air borders, night curfew, closure of markets, schools and universities and restriction of movement between cities. Control measures included the systematic testing of symptomatic patients, isolation and management of active cases, contact tracing and quarantine of people who have been in contact with a COVID-19-positive individual. We discuss the efforts of the Mauritanian government to combat this potentially life-threatening pneumonia. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article analyses the labour trajectories of migrants from Central Asia who have come to Russia's largest cities for work. The study offers a contrasting perspective to more sedentary analysis by interpreting the activities of migrant workers through the concept of mobility. For this purpose, I introduce the notion of the 'mobile subject', whose specific features include movement, instability, multiplicity of life projects, planning in 'momentary time', autonomy and rejection of integration. The research was carried out with the use of a qualitative methodology focusing on thirty biographies of migrants observed over an extended period of time. The text examines three cases. Due to structural restrictions at their new place of residence, migrants tend to occupy niche low-skilled labour. By changing national contexts, a mobile subject often starts his or her working career from scratch, without using previous qualifications. According to this research, working migrants are employed in more than one place at the same time; they operate in different professional fields; combine different forms of employment; are not tied to the same job. Migrant labour trajectories do not represent a linear career within a single profession or organisation. The career of a mobile subject is extensive as a migrant accumulates a variety of experiences by changing places of work and professional spheres, which allow them to be mobile, to reactively adapt to the changing labour market and changing structural conditions. The change in interpretative lens to mobile subjectivity in this artcle offers a new perspective in the understanding of migrant labour and makes it possible to see not only the problems (precarity, instability, (self-) exploitation) but also the agency of migrants in choosing of labour strategies.

AB  - A key problem in explaining the mountain landscapes of the Mediterranean region is the relationship between the development of transhumance (seasonal movement of livestock over long distances) and deforestation of the subalpine and upper montane belts at 1350-2200 m above sea level (m a.s.l.). We examined this relationship in the Central Southern Pyrenees using information from multiple proxies-archaeology, pollen analysis, lacustrine sedimentation patterns, historical documents, and geomorphology. Although there is evidence of forest clearing since the Neolithic, and we can infer the presence of shepherds and livestock in mountain areas based on archaeological sites and pollen analysis in some lacustrine records, there is no strong evidence for transhumance between the Ebro Depression and the Pyrenees during the Prehistory. Instead, we found evidence of transterminance (seasonal movement of livestock over short distances) during this time. Growth of human populations and the establishment of large-scale markets favored longer livestock movements during the Roman period, although we only have indirect information on this for other areas of the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean region. A few documents indicate the occurrence of transhumance during the Early Middle Ages, whereas all other proxies indicate a general expansion of livestock and transhumance during the 12th and 13th centuries. This coincides with the Christian conquest of the Central Ebro Depression by the Aragon Kingdom, the organization of large wool markets in Western Europe, and the exemptions conferred by the kings of Aragon to herders in the city of Saragossa. This led to rapid deforestation, in that forests were rapidly logged or burned to expand the summer grasslands. During this period, written documents indicate many conflicts between people in the villages and valleys for control of summer grasslands, pollen analyses show a rapid decline of arboreal pollen, and geomorphology studies indicate greatly increased sedimentation rates following deforestation, suggesting intense erosion. Transhumance has declined since the end of the 18th century, and particularly throughout the 20th century, and this has led to tree re-colonization of less accessible and marginal areas. The hydrological and geomorphological consequences of these recent events are important topics for future studies.

AB  - A global movement is underway to harness the power of coordinated state policy to address the significant and interrelated challenges of environmental degradation, climate change, poverty, and energy insecurity. In May 2019 a grassroots coalition comprising a range of civil society groups-scientists, labour unions, Indigenous peoples, and youth-launched the Pact for a Green New Deal (PGND) in Canada, with more than 150 town hall meetings across the country. Participants called for 100% renewable energy, phase out of the oil sands, a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030, and the creation of 1 million new green jobs and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples [1]. A significant reorientation to the scale and direction of government expenditure, as happened in the American New Deal of the 1930s, can spur technical innovation but can also exacerbate inequalities. A Canadian green transition is significant globally given its high energy production, exports, and internal use. In this perspective piece we examine the transformative potential of a Canadian PGND by focusing on the social and political characteristics of energy infrastructure: the potential for 100% renewable energy, transitions for oil sands, energy democracy, Indigenous energy leadership, gender equity, and energy poverty. The actor coalitions emerging from these then forge specific energy transition pathways, whether just and inclusive, or not. The Canadian case highlights the complexities and opportunities that accompany countries with large geographies, fraught geo-political histories, strong federalism, inequalities of access to clean affordable energy, and an abundance of renewable energy.

AB  - Road accidents involving pedestrians are a reality of urban life. Pedestrian risk is now well known and documented from the perspective of drivers. However, pedestrian behaviour plays a central role in road accidents, notably in terms of illegal road crossing at signalized intersections. This study focuses on pedestrians crossing illegally at a signal light, and specifically investigates uncertainty behaviour, also referred to as hesitation, which occurs when a pedestrian slows down or stops his/her crossing movement then (1) abandons the crossing by returning to the kerb or (2) accelerates to cross the road more quickly. We sought to understand the causes of this behaviour in France and Japan, two countries where interesting differences have already been demonstrated in the way pedestrians behave. The results show a longer period of uncertainty for pedestrians in Japan compared to France. Japanese pedestrians also hesitated longer when they were alone. This study demonstrates a tendency to speed up if there are a number of pedestrians already crossing the road, but abandoning behaviours were more frequently observed than acceleration. This study confirms that pedestrians may misevaluate the moment to cross and hesitate when they realise that they have made a mistake, thus increasing the risk of an accident. These results could help to find solutions that prevent illegal and dangerous road-crossing behaviours.

AB  - Congestion at urban and active railway level crossings leads to non-compliant driver behavior, and scenarios in which road users may enter into the rail corridor with the crossing nearing full closure. Previous research indicates this scenario occurs with alarming regularity during peak periods. However, limited research has investigated whether such non-compliance arises from errors or from deliberate decisions. The objective of this study was to better understand driver decisions when approaching a level crossing during activation. Vehicle movements and crossing activation were continuously recorded for 2 months at a congested active level crossing close to Melbourne, Australia. Each movement corresponding to a vehicle approach to the level crossing during onset of activation was extracted with traversals counted, and the ability to stop safely modeled with linear motion equations, using the position and speed of the vehicle at activation. The probability of entering the level crossing was then modeled with generalized linear models. Analysis revealed that much of the non-compliance was involuntary and linked to a dilemma zone in the absence of sufficient warning time for drivers to react to and safely stop before proceeding through the crossing. However, deliberate non-compliance was also an issue, and independent of the time of day. Findings are discussed in relation to the ideal grace period for road users at such crossings, and consideration is given to enforcement as a viable treatment for reducing deliberate non-compliance.

AB  - Bifenthrin is a pyrethmid insecticide commonly used in agricultural and urban sectors, and is found in watersheds worldwide. As a sodium channel blocker, at sublethal concentrations it causes off-target effects, including disruption of calcium signaling and neuronal growth. At the whole organism level, sublethal concentrations of bifenthrin cause behavioral effects in fish species, raising concerns about the neumtoxic properties of the compound on fish populations. Here we describe the application of a high-throughput behavioral system to evaluate contaminant impacts on the sensitive early-life stages of Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a critically endangered teleost species endemic to the San Francisco Bay Delta (SFBD), California, USA.
   Leveraging the natural behavior of early-larval Delta smelt, whereby they increase movement in bright light and decrease movement in the dark, we developed a test using a cycle of light and dark periods in a closed chamber to test hyper- or hypoactivity for this species. We show that early-larval Delta smelt have a significant preference to move toward light, and utilized the behavioral test to evaluate the impact of exposure to bifenthrin at concentrations found in habitats where Delta smelt reportedly spawn, ranging up to concentrations detected in tributaries to these habitats. All tested concentrations of bifenthrin (nominal 2, 10, or 100 ng/L) caused hyperactivity, over a 96 h exposure, with noted significance determined during the light period of the test. To further understand the impact of bifenthrin exposure, expression of a suite of genes relevant to neurodevelopment, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and biotransformation in exposed larvae were also measured. Following exposure to picomolar concentrations of bifenthrin, expression of genes in the mTOR signaling and neurogenesis pathways were altered alongside behavior. This study demonstrates how light and dark cycle behavioral tests can be used to assess sensitive alterations in swimming activity in Delta smelt at early developmental stages and how gene expression can complement these assays. This approach can be used to assess the impact of multiple compounds that occur within the restricted habitat of Delta smelt, thus having the potential to greatly inform conservation management strategies for this critically sensitive life stage.

AB  - The article explores Chinese migrants in the Southern Urals in the 1920s. At this historical stage, Chinese migration to the USSR was not regulated by requests of factories and coal mines for cheap labor, as was the case in tsarist Russia. Chinese migrants came to the Soviet Union to earn money, engage in trade in part in the social and cooperative movement, and study at Soviet universities. Prerequisites for the emergence of a stable Chinese community, including in southern regions of the Urals, were born. However, the complication of relations between the USSR and China and conflict over the CER in 1929 worsened the situation of the Soviet Chinese and led to a reduction of further migration. For several decades, the formation and development of the Chinese diaspora was stopped. Based on archival documents first identified and put into circulation, the approximate sociocultural appearance of the Chinese in the South Urals is reconstructed. These materials make it possible to get an idea of such important characteristics as: total number, distribution in urban and rural areas, gender, age, place of birth, migration, marital status, occupation, change of residence and work, military service, level of education, and participation in public life. The article describes a number of details in the biography of the Chinese in the Southern Urals and shows features of migration waves of the late imperial and early Soviet periods of Russian history.

AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug Halyomorpha halys is one of the most harmful invasive insect species worldwide. Originating from Asia, this species invaded first North America and later the European continent, where it has soon become widely spread. There have been no official data of the presence of H. halys on territory of the Republic of North Macedonia, although the species was recorded in the neighbouring countries: Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece and most recently in Albania. This paper reports the first record of H. halys in two regions of R. North Macedonia: in the town of Gevgelija, situated close to the Greek border and in the capital Skopje. The transport as a stowaway and natural dispersal across borders are discussed as potential pathways of introduction of the pest species in this country. The establishment and further spread of H. halys in R. North Macedonia could be expected in the future.

AB  - The increase in the frequency of natural disasters in recent years and its consequent social, economic and environmental impacts make it possible to prioritize areas of risk as an essential measure in order to maximize harm reduction. This case study, developed in the city of Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, aims to identify and evaluate areas susceptible to mass movements, through the development of a model based on logistic regression, associated to Geographic Information System (GIS). The construction of the model was based on the use of only four independent variables (slope, geological aspects, pedological aspects and land use and coverage) and a binary variable, which refers to the occurrence of mass movements. In total, 123,308 pixels were used as samples for the logistic regression modeling in SPSS software. As a result, we have the spatialization of a mass movement probability map with 87.3% of the correctly sorted pixels. A validation with the landslide susceptibility map built by the Brazilian Geological Survey was also performed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, indicating a prediction accuracy of 82.5%. This research showed the efficiency of the integrated use of GIS and logistic regression, with emphasis on the relative simplicity of the model, speed of application and good ability to identify areas susceptible to landslides. The proposed model allowed the determination of the probability of occurrence of landslides with good predictive capacity, surpassing the usual model used by the Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM).

AB  - The tidal flat in the coastal region of the East China Sea between the Yangtze estuary and Hangzhou Bay in China, interlinked with sediment transport/dispersal and sea level changes since the Last Glacial Maximum, has been a matter of rigorous research for decades. Here we focused on the evolution of the tidal flat at the western most extend of former marine influence in response to early Holocene sea level rise. We used sediment composition, ostracods, minerals, organic matter and carbonate contents in combination with endmember modelling analyses and principal component analysis from two sediment cores and an archaeological site close to the western boundary of former marine influence north of the Hangzhou city. The tidal flats at these sites were very sensitive to morphological changes and to sea level variation during the early Holocene. Our data show two major phases of tidal flat formation: i) an early formation stage (9.5-8.0 cal ka BP) with low sediment supply and related slow-down of the mean relative sea level rise (MRSL), followed by ii) the expansion phase with increased sediment supply, storm occurrence as well as fast depositional processes (8.0-7.5 cal ka BP) under a strong MRSL rise close to its present level. A stillstand/decline of MRSL was recorded for the last episodes (7.6-7.5 cal ka BP). The inferences match previously published local to regional sea level curves but differ from the global and modelled regional ones. We propose a connection with early Holocene unstable climatic conditions with intensified storm events and stronger variations in summer monsoon rainfall that affected river discharge and related sediment transport to the inner shelf of the East China Sea between 9.5 and 7.6 cal ka BP. Sedimentary sequences of bayhead areas in tidally-drowned coastal embayments are sensitive to sea level rise episodes and the relevant climate changes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - On July 23, 2019, a large-scale landslide occurred in Jichang town, Shuicheng County, Liupanshui City, Guizhou Province in China. The landslide, which moved along two gullies, resulted in strong punching-shear, induced scarping on vegetation and large destruction of houses, and finally formed a deposit with a volume of 2 x 10(6) m(3). This research aims to understand the effect of topography on landslide kinematics. To achieve this aim, a detailed field investigation was first carried out with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial photography survey, resident interviews, and field sampling. The rainfall analysis indicates the effective rainfall within 7 days before landslides was 70.14 mm which exceeded the rainfall threshold of 54.3 mm in this region, which finally triggered the landslide. Traditional soil mechanic tests were then performed to identify the soil properties of the source material. Combined with numerical simulation using the nonlinear shallow water equation, the whole process of landslides was divided into four stages: instability stage, acceleration stage, transformation stage, and impact and accumulation stage. The simulations results show the landslide block slid with a low velocity of 8 m/s for about 100 m. Then, Froude number of landslide increases from 2 to 3 when passing the high and steep terrain, indicating that landslide change to inertial dominated with potential same Froude behavior of classic debris flow. The rupture mass slid with the peak velocity of 23 m/s and diverged in two gullies and ran out for about 600 m. The maximum velocity is 23 m/s in east gully while only 15 m/s in west gully. Compared with deep and incised valleys in the west, shallow and straight valley in the east decreases the deposit depth and further increases the velocity of landslide material with increased runout distance. This research may provide a fast flow path of back analyzing geo-hazards on complex terrain and serve as a basis for future research on long runout landslides.

AB  - Identifying the realized thermal habitat of animals is important for understanding life history and population processes, yet methods to estimate realized thermal use are lacking for many small-bodied organisms, including imperilled fishes. Analysis of oxygen isotopes provides one solution, but requires the development of species-specific fractionation equations. To date, such equations have generally been limited to commercial or game fish species. Here, we developed a field-based fractionation equation for the threatened silver shiner Notropis photogenis to better understand the thermal ecology of the species in an urban watershed. Archived otoliths were analyzed for oxygen isotope values (delta O-18). There was a significant linear relationship between otolith isotope fractionation and water temperature, described by delta O-18(otolith(VPBD)) - delta O-18(water(VPBD)) = 32.03 - 0.21(degrees C). Results indicate that otolith isotope techniques can be used to identify the average relative temperature occupied by silver shiner, representing the first investigation of oxygen isotopes to understand thermal occupancy of the species. This field-based equation provides an opportunity to understand how silver shiner may respond to alterations in stream temperatures resulting from urbanization and climate effects and may be useful in identifying thermal refugia for the species. Field-based, species-specific fractionation equations can provide insights into the thermal ecology of many small-bodied fishes, which are increasingly imperilled due to thermal stressors.

AB  - An unequivocal link exists between human population density and environmental degradation, both in the near field (local impacts) and far field (impacts due to teleconnections). Human population is most widely predicted to reach 9-11 billion by 2100, when the demographic transition is expected in all but a handful of countries. Strongest population growth is in the tropics, where coral reefs face dense human population and concomitant heavy usage. In most countries, >50% will be urbanized but growth of rural population and need for food in urban centres will not alleviate pressure on reef resources. Aquaculture will alleviate some fishing pressure, but still utilizes reef surface and is also destructive. Denser coastal populations and greater wealth will lead to reef degradation by coastal construction. Denser populations inland will lead to more runoff and siltation. Effects of human perturbations can be explored with metapopulation theory since they translate to increases in patch-mortality and decreases in patch-colonization (=regeneration). All such changes will result in a habitat with overall fewer settled patches, so fewer live reefs. If rescue effects are included, bifurcations in system dynamics will allow for many empty patches and, depending on system state relative to stable and unstable equilibria, a part-empty system may either trend towards stability at higher patch occupancy or extinction. Thus, unless the disturbance history is known, it may be difficult to assess the direction of system trajectory-making management difficult. If habitat is decreased by destruction, rescue effects become even more important as extinction-debt, accumulated by efficient competitors with weaker dispersal ability, is realized. Easily visible trends in human population dynamics combined with well-established and tested ecological theory give a clear, intuitive, yet quantifiable guide to the severity of survival challenges faced by coral reefs. Management challenges and required actions can be clearly shown and, contrary to frequent claims, no scientific ambiguity exists with regards to the serious threat posed to coral reefs by humankind's continued numerical increase.

AB  - This paper presents a case study in the town of Boo (Asturias, Spain), where land subsidence due to underground coal mining has been observed in the past along with landslides and natural ground settling. The confluence of these phenomena represents a liability for mining companies. Any property damage caused by ground movements is considered by those affected to be a direct result of mining-induced subsidence. This has led to numerous property damage liability claims against mining companies even many years after the mining activities have stopped.
   Based on the analysis of geotechnical studies, subsidence simulations developed with HUNDEF and 3DEC software and ground movement measurements, together with research developed within the Research Fund for the Coal and Steel MERIDA project, the authors investigated the landslide and slope instability phenomena that are occurring in the town of Boo. Moreover, they determined the geographical and temporal limits to distinguish damages for which mining activity may be responsible from natural or human-induced damages unrelated to mining.
   This research will allow underground coal mining companies to manage property damage liability claims from a clearer perspective and may help researchers reconsider some studies that focused only on mining-induced subsidence to explain ground movements within similar environments.

AB  - The Majiagou Bridge comprising four sub-bridges is adjacent to the Weiqiang coal mine, Yulin City, Shaanxi Province, China. The mining of the longwall panel No. 1307 may damage the Majiagou Bridge. In this study, we predicted the mining-induced bridge movements using the finite element method (FEM) to examine whether the progressive mining of the longwall panel will pose a negative impact on the Majiagou Bridge. We reconstructed detailed three-dimensional models of the four sub-bridges by considering the superstructures and substructures. The input mechanical properties of the strata are estimated by calibrating with available field monitoring data. Effect of traffic load on the bridge subsidence is also accounted. The numerical predictions are: (1) after the panel No. 1307 is mined, the maximum vertical and horizontal displacements of the four bridges are 61.2 mm and 84.8 mm respectively, which occur on the sub-bridge D that is closest to the longwall panel, (2) traffic load has much less pronounced effect on the Majiagou Bridge than that due to mining, and (3) the maximum tilt and horizontal strain of the sub-bridges are 3.42e(-5) m/m and 2.19e(-5) m/m, which occur on sub-bridge B and sub-bridge A, respectively. In terms of tilt, the Majiagou Bridge is safe whereas it is to be damaged in terms of horizontal movement that is more critical in causing structural damage. Therefore, we suggest that a reasonably wider protective coal pillar should be set if the panel No. 1307 is to be mined, to ensure the safety of the Majiagou Bridge.

AB  - Domestic violence is known to be one of the most prevalent forms of gender-based violence in emergency contexts and anecdotal data during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that related restrictions on movement may exacerbate such violence. As such, the purpose of this study was to measure differences in domestic violence incident reports from police data in Atlanta, Georgia, before and during COVID-19. Thirty weeks of crime data were collected from the Atlanta Police Department (APD) in an effort to compare Part I offense trends 2018-2020. Compared with weeks 1-31 of 2018 and 2019, there was a growth in Part I domestic crimes during 2020 as reported to the APD. In addition, trendlines show that 2020 domestic crimes were occurring at a relatively similar pace as the counts observed in previous years leading up to the pandemic. A spike in domestic crimes was recorded after city and statewide shelter-in-place orders. The rise of cumulative counts of domestic crimes during the COVID-19 period of 2020 compared with the previous 2 years suggests increased occurrence of domestic violence. The co-occurring pandemics of COVID-19 and domestic violence come amidst a period of racial justice reckoning in the United States; both have a disproportionate impact on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color. As the country grapples with how to deal with health and safety concerns related to the pandemic, and the unacceptable harms being perpetrated by police, a public health approach is strongly warranted to address both universal health care and violence prevention.

AB  - Background Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen with a notorious reputation of being resistant to antimicrobial agents. The capability of A. baumannii to persist and disseminate between healthcare settings has raised a major concern worldwide. Methods Our study investigated the antibiotic resistance features and molecular epidemiology of 52 clinical isolates of A. baumannii collected in Pakistan between 2013 and 2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined by the agar disc diffusion method. Comparative sequence analyses of the ampC and bla(OXA-51-like) alleles were used to assign the isolates into clusters. The whole genomes of 25 representative isolates were sequenced using the MiSeq Desktop Sequencer. Free online applications were used to determine the phylogeny of genomic sequences, retrieve the multilocus sequence types (ST), and detect acquired antimicrobial resistance genes. Results Overall, the isolates were grouped into 7 clusters and 3 sporadic isolates. The largest cluster, Ab-Pak-cluster-1 (bla(OXA-66) and ISAba1-ampC-19) included 24 isolates, belonged to ST2 and International clone (IC) II, and was distributed between two geographical far-off cities, Lahore and Peshawar. Ab-Pak-clusters-2 (bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-2), and -3 (bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-20) and the individual isolate Ab-Pak-Lah-01 (ISAba1-bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-2) were also assigned to ST2 and IC II. On the other hand, Ab-Pak-clusters-4 (bla(OXA-69), ampC-1), -5 (bla(OXA-69), ISAba1-ampC-78), and -6A (bla(OXA-371), ISAba1-ampC-3) belonged to ST1, while Ab-Pak-cluster-6B (bla(OXA-371), ISAba1-ampC-8) belonged to ST1106, with both ST1 and ST1106 being members of IC I. Five isolates belonged to Ab-Pak-cluster-7 (bla(OXA-65), ampC-43). This cluster corresponded to ST158, showed a well-delineated position on the genomic phylogenetic tree, and was equipped with several antimicrobial resistance genes including bla(OXA-23) and bla(GES-11). Conclusions Our study detected the occurrence of 7 clusters of A. baumannii in Pakistan. Altogether, 6/7 of the clusters and 45/52 (86.5%) of the isolates belonged to IC I (n = 9) or II (n = 36), making Pakistan no exception to the global domination of these two clones. The onset of ST158 in Pakistan marked a geographical dispersal of this clone beyond the Middle East and brought up the need for a detailed characterization.

AB  - The Daguangbao landslide was the largest landslide triggered by the "5.12" Wenchuan Mw 7.9 earthquake. This landslide is among the few superlarge-scale landslides of 1 billion m(3) magnitude worldwide. As the landslide accumulation represents a potential hazard, long-term monitoring and geological interpretation of the Daguangbao landslide is important to reveal the postsliding deformation characteristics and laws of this landslide type. To study the kinematic characteristics 10 years postearthquake, the landslide accumulation deformation was monitored in two stages using different data sets and processing methods. First, regarding the deformation 2 years postearthquake, we selected PALSAR-1 data (21 October 2008 to 14 March 2011) and obtained the LOS (line of sight) direction time series deformation of the landslide using the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) algorithm. Second, for the last 4.5 years of deformation, Sentinel-1 data sets (26 November 2015 to 8 June 2020) in two ascending and one descending path are experimentally used. The vertical and east-west deformations during this period are obtained. Thickness, topography, precipitation, and other factors are combined to analyze the landslide accumulation deformation. The landslide accumulation volume decreases under gravitational influence, shrinkage is accelerated under precipitation influence, and periodic fluctuations occur, which lag precipitation changes. The maximum vertical direction deformation rate is below 80 mm/year, and the deformation magnitude in the east-west direction is approximately +/- 35 mm/year. Local deformation is still affected by the surface slope and aspect, and the overall landslide accumulation movement trend involves gathering of the eastern and western parts toward the middle. In the observation window, with the stabilization of accumulation, the deformation tends decrease.

AB  - Dechlorane Plus (DP) is an unregulated, highly chlorinated flame retardant. It has been manufactured from past 40 years but its presence in the environment was initially reported in 2006. Later, it has been found in various biotic and abiotic environmental matrices. However, little attention has been paid to monitor its presence in Asia. Many studies have reported the occurrence of DP in the environment of Asia, yet the data are scarce, and studies are limited to few regions. The objective of present review is to summarize the occurrence, distribution, and toxicity of this ubiquitous pollutant in various environmental matrices (biotic and abiotic). DP has also been reported in the areas with no emission sources, which proves its long-range transport. Moreover, urbanization and industrialization also affect the distribution of DP, i.e., high levels of DP have been found in urban areas relative to the rural. Tidal movement also incorporates in transport of DP across the aquatic system. Further, bioaccumulation trend of DP in various tissues is kidney > liver > muscle tissues, whereas, blood brain barrier resists its accumulation in brain tissues. Additionally, gender-based accumulation trends revealed high DP levels in females in comparison to males due to strong metabolism of males. Furthermore, methodological aspects and instrumental analysis used in previous studies have also been summarized here. However, data on biomagnification in aquatic ecosystem and bioaccumulation of DP in terrestrial food web are still scarce. Toxicity behavior ofsyn-DP andanti-DP is still unknown which might gain the interest for future studies.

AB  - Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the United States for agricultural and non-agricultural weed control. Many studies demonstrate possible effects of glyphosate and its degradate AMPA on human and ecological health. Although glyphosate is thought to have limited mobility in soil, it is found year-round in many rivers and streams throughout the world in both agricultural and developed environments. It is vitally important to continue to increase the knowledge base of glyphosate use, distribution, transport, and impacts on human health and the environment. Here we show that glyphosate and AMPA are found in nearly all of 70 streams throughout the United States at concentrations far below human health or ecological benchmarks, with less occurrence in the Northeast and that undeveloped land, classified as such by land use near the sampling station, has lower concentrations compared to other types of land. Results also show that sites with large watersheds tend to have more AMPA than glyphosate and the opposite is true for small watersheds . Travel times and opportunity for glyphosate to degrade to AMPA and for reservoirs of AMPA to grow are greater in large watersheds. Factors that promoted quick movement of glyphosate to streams, such as subsurface tile or storm drains, sewers, overland flow from developed landscapes, and arid landscapes were associated with sites that had greater concentrations of glyphosate compared to AMPA. These results contribute contemporary information and generalized interpretations adding to the knowledge base of the fate of glyphosate on a national scale and provide a springboard for further exploration of technical processes controlling transport to streams.

AB  - In this study, a series of full-scale fire tests are performed in a tunnel with large cross-sectional vertical shafts. The heat release rates and fire locations are considered, and the general smoke development, smoke flow pattern in the shaft, smoke temperature distribution, and smoke front velocity are analysed. It is found that complete plug-holing occurs in the tunnel with large cross-sectional vertical shafts. The smoke flows into the shaft from the bottom sides and spreads out along the shaft sidewalls. The smoke cannot fill the shaft cross-section, even at the shaft outlet. In the early and full-development stages of a fire, a well-stratified smoke layer exists, whereas in the decay stage and after burning out, the visibility significantly reduces. The smoke can be controlled within 80-125 m on each side of the fire source, and it takes approximately 10 min for the visibility to self-recover naturally for common car fires after burning out. The results of the full-scale experiment indicate that the shaft has acceptable performance in smoke control for the test scenario investigated. According to an analysis of the tunnel environment during a common car fire, as well as the evacuation movement, it can be concluded that the occupants can escape safely. The experimental results are used to verify the smoke control performance of the vertical shaft and provide guidance for the design of naturally ventilated tunnels with vertical shafts.

AB  - Background The East Route Project (ERP) of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) stretches across schistosomiasis endemic and non-endemic areas in China, which may lead to the dispersal of Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum, from permissive areas along the Yangtze River Basin to non-permissive areas in northern China. A previous survey demonstrated that O. hupensis could survive and breed for 13 years (12 generations) after being transferred to a non-permissive area, and could be infected by S. japonicum. However, it is not clear if the migrated snails will change their ability to transmit S. japonicum.
   Methods We infected mice with the cercariae released from the infected transferred snails bred in Jining city of Shandong Province (non-permissive areas) for 13 years. The mice in the control group were infected with cercariae derived from the snails collected in their original habitat (Jiangdu county of Jiangsu Province, permissive areas). Then, we explored the pathogenicity to mice including worm burden, liver egg count and pathology. Additionally, the gene expression profiles of the adult male and female worms recovered from the infected mice were analyzed by RNA sequencing.
   Results The worm burden, liver egg count and pathology of the mice infected with cercariae released from transferred snails bred in non-permissive areas for 13 years showed no significant differences, when compared with the control cercariae. Slight changes occurred at the transcription level between adult male and female worms recovered from mice infected with cercariae derived from snails bred in permissive and non-permissive areas. Only fourteen genes were significantly differentially expressed in the comparison of adult female worms, and no significantly differentially expressed gene was found in the comparison of adult male worms.
   Conclusions Our findings strongly suggest that transferred snails did not change their schistosomiasis transmission ability and the worms derived from them retained the original pathogenicity, even after migrating from permissive to non-permissive areas for 13 years. Therefore, a long-term surveillance system of snails along the SNWDP is urgently needed to prevent the diffusion of O. hupensis and reduce the risk of transmission of schistosomiasis.

AB  - Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) control is mainly based on wide vaccine administration. Although effective, its efficacy is not absolute, the viral circulation is not prevented and some side effects cannot be denied. Despite this, the determinants of IBV epidemiology and the factors affecting its circulation are still largely unknown and poorly investigated. In the present study, 361 IBV QX (the most relevant field genotype in Italy) sequences were obtained between 2012 and 2016 from the two main Italian integrated poultry companies. Several biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches were used to reconstruct the history of the QX genotype in Italy and to assess the effect of different environmental, climatic and social factors on its spreading patterns. Moreover, two structured coalescent models were considered in order to investigate if an actual compartmentalization occurs between the two integrated poultry companies and the role of a third "ghost" deme, representative of minor industrial poultry companies and the rural sector. The obtained results suggest that the integration of the poultry companies is an effective barrier against IBV spreading, since the strains sampled from the two companies formed two essentially-independent clades. Remarkably, the only exceptions were represented by farms located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. The inclusion of a third deme in the model revealed the likely role of other poultry companies and rural farms (particularly concentrated in Northern Italy) as sources of strain introduction into one of the major poultry companies, whose farms are mainly located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. Accordingly, when the effect of different environmental and urban parameters on IBV geographic spreading was investigated, no factor seems to contribute to IBV dispersal velocity, being poultry population density the only exception. Finally, the different viral population pattern observed in the two companies over the same time period supports the pivotal role of management and control strategies on IBV epidemiology. Overall, the present study results stress the crucial relevance of human action rather than environmental factors, highlighting the direct benefits that could derive from improved management and organization of the poultry sector on a larger scale.

AB  - On July 23, 2019, a large catastrophic landslide was triggered by heavy rainfall at Jichang Town, Shuicheng County, Guizhou, China. This high-speed landslide was characterized by a short slip time, long slide distance, and great destructiveness. In less than 2 min, about 2 million m(3) of cataclastic basalt soil failed with a runout of about 1.25 km over a total vertical distance of about 465 m. The landslide destroyed 21 houses and caused 42 fatalities with 9 people missing. To understand the possible mechanisms for the high-speed and long-runout behavior of the landslide, a detailed field survey was conducted. A preliminary analysis was performed on the movement characteristics and formation mechanism of the landslide based on combining data from multitemporal optical satellite remote sensing images, aerial photography from an unmanned aerial vehicle, and InSAR. The historical remote sensing images, InSAR results, and geological monitoring data indicated no obvious deformation signs before the landslide, which implies that it occurred suddenly. The landslide was probably primarily induced by heavy rainfall, while the direct impact of road excavation was small. The terrain controls motion characteristics of the landslide and air blast effect is still visible at the leading edge of the landslide. The results of this study may provide basic data for further research on the mechanisms for landslide initiation and movement.

AB  - Water soluble inorganic chemical ions of PM1 and PM2.5 and atmospheric trace gases were monitored simultaneously on hourly resolution at Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA), Delhi during 8 December 2017-10 February 2018. Monitoring was made by MARGA (Monitoring AeRosol and Gases in ambient Air) under winter fog experiment (WIFEX) program of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India. The result based on the analysis of the data so generated reveals that Cl-, NH4+, NO3- and SO42- were dominant ions in order which collectively constituted 96.8 and 97.3% of the of the total measured ionicmass in PM1 and PM2.5 respectively. Their overall average concentrations in PM1 were 19.5 +/- 19.7, 18.4 +/- 10.5, 16.6 +/- 8.7 and 10.3 +/- 5.7 mu g/m(3) and in PM2.5 were 36.0 +/- 33.9, 32.7 +/- 17.2, 28.5 +/- 13.6 and 19.9 +/- 13.9 mu g/m(3). Average concentrations of HCl, HNO3, HNO2, SO2 and NH3 trace gaseswere 0.7 +/- 0.3, 2.7 +/- 1.1, 6.6 +/- 4.7, 22.0 +/- 12.3 and 25.7 +/- 9.1 mu g/m(3) respectively. Weather parameters along with low mixing height played significant role in the occurrence of high concentration of these chemical species. NH4+ was the prime neutralizer of the acidic components and mostly occurred in (NH4)(2)SO4/NH4HSO4, NH4NO3 and NH4Cl molecular forms. Major sources of these chemical species were fossil fuel combustion in aviation activity and transportation, coal burning in thermal power plants, industrial processes and emissions from biomass burning and agro-based activity.
   The quality of air with respect to PM2.5 always remained deteriorated. It became alarming during low visibility period mainly due to high concentration of Cl-, NO3-, SO42 - and NH4+. Both meteorological and chemical processes interactively fed each other which occasionally resulted in fog development and visibility degradation. The knowledge gained by this study will help in simulation of atmospheric processeswhich lead to fog development and dispersal in the Delhi region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Radar rainfall nowcasting, the process of statistically extrapolating the most recent rainfall observation, is increasingly used for very short range rainfall forecasting (less than 6hr ahead). We performed a large-sample analysis of 1,533 events, systematically selected for 4 event durations and 12 lowland catchments (6.5-957km(2)), to determine the predictive skill of nowcasting. Four algorithms are tested and compared with Eulerian Persistence: Rainymotion Sparse, Rainymotion DenseRotation, Pysteps deterministic, and Pysteps probabilistic with 20 ensemble members. We focus on the dependency of nowcast skill on event duration, season, catchment size, and location. Maximum skillful lead times increase for longer event durations, due to the more persistent character of these events. For all four event durations, Pysteps deterministic attains the longest average decorrelation times, with 25min for 1-hr durations, 40min for 3hr, 56min for 6hr, and 116min for 24hr. During winter, with more persistent stratiform precipitation, we find three times lower mean absolute errors than for convective summer precipitation. Higher skill is also found after spatially upscaling the forecast. Catchment location matters too: Given the prevailing storm movement, two times higher skillful lead times are found downwind than upwind toward the edge of the domain. In most cases, Pysteps algorithms outperform the Rainymotion benchmark algorithms. We speculate that most errors originate from growth and dissipation processes which are not or only partially (stochastically) accounted for.
   Plain Language Summary Early warning systems are a key instrument for timely responses to flood risk. These warnings depend on accurate weather forecasts. Most numerical weather prediction models have trouble to accurately forecast the timing and especially the location of rainfall on time scales of less than 6hr. This time frame is important for decisions in small, mountainous, polder, and urban basins, where river discharge responds quickly to rainfall. Radar rainfall nowcasting, the process of statistically extrapolating the most recent rainfall observations, has the potential to provide forecasts up to 6hr. We considered 1,533 rainfall events to evaluate the quality of five nowcasting methods. Nowcasts are better for longer-lasting rain storms with relatively low intensity, which typically occur in winter, than for short, intensive storms, which typically occur in summer. Forecasts are useful up to 2hr ahead for events of 1day, while this is only 25min for 1-hr events. Moreover, nowcasts are better for larger basins and in the downwind direction with respect to the prevailing storm movement. Hence, nowcasts are useful, but improvements are needed to be able to forecast longer ahead.

AB  - The world is passing through the unprecedented crisis of COVID 19 pandemic. A large section of the global population has been living under mandatory mass quarantine, the lockdown, as a strategy towards slowing down the expansion of the pandemic. This lockdown is being eased out across world in a phase wise manner. India being one of the most populous countries is hardest hit by the pandemic and soon the number of positive cases is likely to touch one million mark. One of the most significant phenomenons observed during the Indian lockdown, has emerged as the long march of migrant workers from cities to their native places. Bihar, one of the Indian provinces is the major provider of migrant labourers for Indian agriculture and the industry sectors. As depicted on social media and television, the plight of migrants was disturbing and exposed modern Indian democracy's vulnerabilities. Many of them had to walk on foot for thousands of kilometers, with their hungry families, from the industrial cities to their native places. Nothing has changed for the migrant workers through the past three centuries, including the first century of postcolonial India. Why are they called migrant workers? Are they not citizens of India? How come being Bihari-a native of Bihar province, one of the primary sources of migrant workers in India, become a stigma? So how did the historical symbol of the most significant accomplishments of Indian history, literature, science, and culture come to be identified with poor migrant workers' image? Bihar's underdevelopment is often blamed on corrupt local politicians and caste politics. However, the history of migrant workers from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh states of India is worth a closer attention for possible solutions. The phenomenon has a historical linkage with the fall of once upon a time the great Indian civilization; centuries of occupation, colonization, slavery, and indentured servitude. India has made steady progress in economic terms since 1947, India's independence from the British empire. The economy's size and rise in gross domestic product (GDP) are meaningless if ordinary citizens continue to be disfranchised, not protected, and liberated from the colonial processes. For India's sovereign economic development, there is no option but to invest in long-term and rebuild the civilization and build a system of the indigenous Indian knowledge economy based on the core principles and values of the Indian civilization.

AB  - Maps are an ordinary part of the work of the ethnomusicologist; nevertheless, it seems that the relationship between blues and cartography is somehow unique. An important source of information for the study of blues music, maps inform about natural conditions, roads and railroads, changes in demography, migration streams, and vanished communities and buildings. They range from linguistic maps to those made for the needs of insurance companies. As a result of research in the field of blues music, there are special maps on the dissemination of regional styles of music and their transfer to other regions. Then there are maps of the sites of folklore collecting, recording studios, radio stations, gramophone companies, and places of entertainment in cities. The contribution of blues music for cartography may be the emergence of unusual map signs for music sites, music studios, and the occurrence of musical instruments. Long play (LP) record covers provide a frequent display for maps, both as a source of scholarly information and as a means of decoration. Maps are also used in promotional materials that highlight the blues traditions of a specific region or serve as inspiration for artwork that combines numerous elements of cartography and blues archetypes. Evidently, the movement of bluesmen across the USA in the first half of the 20th century has been an extraordinarily rewarding cartographic topic. There could hardly be another music area in which we can observe changes that are so visible and noticeable as those that took place in such a vast area and simultaneously within such a short time span. Song titles would emphasize not only toponyms, but also road numbers, with some geographical names even serving as nicknames of bluesmen. Since the 1960s, many maps in blues album designs have stressed the visual impact of a certain authenticity, allowing contemporary listeners to become oriented not only in the real space of the American (U.S.) South, but even more in the imaginary world of blues mythology.

AB  - The Neogene marine sedimentary rock area in the eastern marginal region of the Japan Sea is an area with some of the highest landslide densities in Japan. Some of the landslides in this area have been known to involve saline groundwater, which can be the cause of these landslides. In order to demonstrate the relationships between landslides and saline water, topographic, geological, groundwater, and electromagnetic surveys were performed in the eastern marginal region of the Japan Sea. Many landslides and gravitational slope deformations with linear depressions and small scarps were recognized in the study area. The resistivity profile obtained by an electromagnetic survey suggests that there is a wide zonal distribution of saline water with salt concentrations equivalent to seawater at depths of 50-100 m or more and that the groundwater shallower than 50 m has an electrical conductivity of less than 100 mS/m. The shallow resistive groundwater is inferred to be meteoric water that replaced the saline groundwater, which likely weakened the bedrock, resulting in landslides. A ridge of competent tuff overlying mudstone has many linear depressions from gravitational slope deformation and low-resistivity water to a depth of 600 m, which suggests that the mudstone was weakened by water replacement and deformed under the tuff caprock. The saline groundwater is inferred to be fossil seawater trapped in pores during sediment deposition, which is brought near the ground surface along with rocks by tectonic movement in the hills. Thus, the saline water and its fresh water replacement are among the important basic causes of the landslides. The oil well data obtained in the eastern marginal region of the Japan Sea suggest that such saline water replacement has occurred widely and that replacement is likely one of the predispositions for the frequent landslides there.

AB  - Objectives: In Italy, a recent irregular movement of people raised concerns among the host population on possible introduction of diseases that have long been controlled in the host countries. This study evaluates the health conditions of illegal immigrants landed on the north-eastern Sicilian territory, to provide information on the clinical and epidemiologic burden of infectious diseases among migrants and how the local population feel about these landings.
   Study design: The study design is a cross-sectional study.
   Methods: The study considered all migrants landed illegally in the city of Messina, Sicily, between January 2014 and July 2018. Analysing the data of hospital admissions and disease notifications, we calculated the frequency of infectious diseases among migrant population. Furthermore, through a survey conducted by a well-known online newspaper, we analysed the perception that the local population has about the health risk represented by migrants.
   Results: In the considered five-year period, 108 landings, for a total of 38,608 migrants occurred at the Messina port. The percentage of hospitalisation was rather low (3.5%), and it concerned mainly pregnant women. The notifications of infectious diseases were contained, with exception of scabies and tuberculosis. Finally, from the online survey, resulted that there is a large part of local population that considers migrants a potential danger to community health.
   Conclusions: Our data show that the presence of migrants should not have to date any impact on the health conditions of the resident population. However, monitoring over time the health of migrants and screening for infectious diseases as soon as possible after landing are advantageous for both migrants and host country.

AB  - The present study examined the occurrence and concentration of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) measured in game ducks (13 compounds), water, sediment, and soils (33 compounds) in waterways in Victoria, Australia. The study aimed to identify potential ecological and human health risks from measured PFAS concentrations. Four species of duck and samples of water, sediment, and soil were collected from 19 wetlands, which were chosen based on their popularity as hunting locations. The risks posed by 3 PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid [PFHxS], and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid [PFOS]) to the environment and human health were assessed using available national ecological and human health guidelines. A diverse range of short- and long-chain carboxylic and sulfonic acids were found in the environment and in ducks. Concentrations were generally low and varied between wetlands, duck species, tissue analyzed (breast or liver), and environmental compartment (water, sediment, soil). Higher PFOS concentrations in water and sediments were observed at wetlands near sources of contamination (i.e., a defense base or urban environment). Elevated PFOS and PFOS + PFHxS concentrations in ducks were observed near local point sources but also at wetlands with no known point sources of contamination. There were clear differences in PFAS concentrations detected in duck tissues versus the environment, highlighting complexities of bioaccumulation, movement of animals, and spatiotemporal variation and raising questions about the relevance of using abiotic criteria to assess risk to biota. Human health risk assessment showed that only ducks inhabiting wetlands near local sources of PFAS were likely to pose a risk to consumers. Further studies are required to improve our knowledge of PFAS toxicokinetics and chronic impacts in biota to guide management decisions.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-13. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB  - The depopulation of rural areas by humans (or rural exodus) in southern Europe, and the associated abandonment of cropland, had marked ecological consequences on wildlife, which became evident approximately fifteen years ago. Shrub and tree encroachment, and the expansion of forest birds and the formerly persecuted mammalian ungulates and carnivores, were highlighted as the major consequences of the rural exodus in Italy. In this report, we provide a more integrative view, and show that a rural exodus also explains other ecological phenomena that are usually treated independently. After reviewing the ecological consequences of the rural exodus that has been affecting a large part of Spain during the last six decades, we suggest that this set of ecological consequences also includes the movement of shy-selected predators and large, big game species out of their former ecological refuges, as well as increased frequencies of individuals with bolder-behaviours in recovering populations. We develop a tentative conceptual model linking the increasing approach of wildlife to anthropogenic habitats and human depopulation of rural areas. These links are created by the increasing difficulty to survive and reproduce in recovering, high-predation wild areas, due to mesopredator release and the loss of fear to humans, among other factors. We acknowledge that the recovery of formerly persecuted wildlife in depopulated landscapes has been helped by conservation policies, but we suggest that policies alone cannot explain the observed changes. Finally, we propose that the processes we analyse on a national scale could be taking place in Europe on a continental scale as well, and will most likely occur in the future in other regions of the world, with the current growth in economies.

AB  - As the environment continues to aggravate, it has become a purposeful public concern in developed countries and has recently stirred developing countries to join the green movement. Hence, this study examines green environmental awareness, green product value and environmental attitude by applying the measurement of effects on green culture. The study applied a quantitative research approach where a cross-sectional survey designed with 267 respondents' green consumer who lived in the urban area of Abuja and employed partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS3 to examine the developed path model. The results indicated that all constructs were empirically supported showing significant impact on green culture while examining direct relationships. The resulting (Q(2)) value is larger than zero (0) in the path model, this specifies that exogenous constructs have a good index for predictive relevance on the endogenous construct being investigated. Among the construct, awareness is the most important predictor and green product value tends to show a modest impact on environmental attitude. The study suggests that policymakers should place emphasis on environmental values to boost environmental awareness among young consumers in the process of making purchases. Specifically, environmental attitude was found to have full mediation on the relationship between green product value and green culture. However, no mediation occurs in the relationship between environmental awareness and green culture. The study concluded that awareness regarding going green activism in Nigeria among young consumers is still a matter of concern despite its impact and therefore, practitioners and collaborators in the green industry need to apply aggressive efforts to achieve this pathway, to ensure the design and implementation of effective policies that will promote going green and enhance the green circular economy.

AB  - Traffic operations vary drastically before-, during- and after natural disasters due to several reasons, such as the movement of affected populations, road failures, and heavy precipitation. The disaster-induced effects on road links and their subsequent recovery to the pre-disaster state are functions of the designed network resilience. Thus, the investigation of traffic operations including speed and volume fluctuations during such disasters can provide useful insights into the resilience of the roadway network. Furthermore, identifying road links and corridors which are most affected during natural disasters and estimating the extent of the effect on traffic are crucial steps in devising traffic management strategies for mitigating future hazards. A key challenge to the realization of the above objectives is the lack of data pertaining to roadway and traffic conditions during natural disasters. While modern sensing technologies based on non-Dedicated Short-Range (wireless) Communications such as Bluetooth (R) have been widely adopted to track traffic performance, they need to be corroborated with supplementary data for a complete characterization of the prevalent traffic conditions. In this study, an alternative method is presented for identifying the traffic fluctuations induced by a natural disaster (Hurricane Harvey) on an urban traffic network (Houston) by studying the characteristics of extreme travel time observations. The study relies on time series decomposition and anomaly detection algorithms to investigate the spatiotemporal effects of the hurricane on the traffic conditions. The results of the case study suggest that the metrics developed are effective in quantifying the resilience of traffic networks against natural disasters by capturing both the initial impact and recovery. The study showed that the Houston freeway network was not completely recovered from the effects of Hurricane Harvey, even three weeks after the occurrence of the hurricane.

AB  - War is often an amalgamation of various objectives and occupation a realization of one core aim, that is, the suppression of the identity of an occupied population. Thus, warfare not only affects people but also the collective narrative of their environments, history, culture, and identity. Consequently, deliberate destruction of cultural heritage becomes part of any political struggle. Once political struggles infringe on a nation's history, both local and global institutions and entities must take responsibility for preserving the authenticity of the global narrative. Deprioritizing urban conservation policies, especially during times of war, is known to inflict sheer, and sometimes irreversible, damage on a national and global scale. Despite the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) regulations on protecting cultural heritage during war, the enforcement of such responsibilities on the ground remains questionable.
   The Palestinian experience is among the rare existing narratives of cultural heritage and architectural conservation becoming the crux of resistance against loss of land and identity. Lacking a central authority and having only been operational for the last three decades, the conservation movement has nonetheless succeeded in conserving a considerable part of Palestinian architectural heritage. The quality of work produced by these efforts has received international recognition and various accolades, despite ongoing difficulties faced under occupation.
   This paper highlights the role of non-governmental organizations in Palestine, particularly of Riwaq, and details their internationally recognized conservation efforts in several locations, such as Jerusalem and Hebron. These examples are presented to foster the argument that architecture is intrinsic to preserving historical authenticity and local identity. A dependable future rests on preserving the cultural heritage of all places, requiring universal compliance among nations that transcends physical borders and boundaries to promote the continuity of shared legacy.

AB  - Kashmir Valley has witnessed a catastrophic flood in 2014, which led thousands of people homeless and devastated the agricultural lands. In the present study, the impact of 2014 flood occurred during the month of September was analysed in the vicinity of Dal lake using the pre- and post-flood periods satellite observations. The study exhibited an inundation of 42.50 km(2) area (52.47% of total area) during September 2014 flood period, which is primarily topographical low-lying area (i.e. below 1530 m). The land use/land cover (LULC) analysis during pre- and post-flood periods exhibited significant impact over the built-up land with 20.4% decrease in the built-up (from 25.44 to 20.25 km(2)), which was mostly evident in the western, southern and eastern parts of Dal lake. It has also severely affected the road network with inundation of 220.84 kms (55.62% of total road network). The road network in the lower elevation (< 1530 m) not only disrupted but also acted as a carrier for the flood water dispersal in the region. The long-term impact and recovery of flood inundation were assessed using spatio-temporal built-up growth during 2014, 2015 and 2018 within the flooded zone through geospatial overlay analysis. The flood (September 2014) affected a total 10.42 km(2) of built-up, wherein the built-up was reduced to 7.50 km(2), due to the low-lying topography and nearest proximity to flow path of Jhelum river. Later, the built-up was increased to 9.60 km(2) within the flooded zone during 2018 primarily in the southern parts, representing the long-term recovery after the flood aftermath. Although the impact of flood (2014) was evident in both the flooded and non-flooded zones, the built-up growth was reduced significantly in the flooded zone (-25.18% change) as compared to non-flooded zones (-17.32% change). Also, the long-term recovery was comparatively higher in the non-flooded zone (31.84% growth) as compared to the flooded zone (28.03% growth). The study necessitates towards implication of effective urban planning method primarily along the major lakes in order to reduce the increasing impact of catastrophic flood.

AB  - Before mass settlement occurred in Western Canada at the turn of the twentieth century, Indigenous people used treaty monetization and town spending to subvert the very forces of liberalism encouraged with the expansion of a colonial market economy. After 1880, the Cree of Treaty 6, in particular, chose to collectively spend their annuities in new towns to support traditional dances and ceremonies and, especially, to join together in large multiband gatherings. Despite increasingly restrictive government policies, particularly the pass system that limited Indigenous movement beyond reserves, town "Treaty Days" spending only declined in prevalence in the late 1890s when treaty annuities began quickly losing their extraordinary spending power.

TI  - DISTANCING REFUGEES
T2  - DENVER LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - ASYLUM
KW  - LAW
AB  - Today, two systems exist for addressing the humanitarian claims of persons fleeing persecution. One system consists of refugees living in host countries, often in large camps, who ideally are then resettled in other countries or repatriated when it is safe to do so. The other system involves refugees arriving in a country and seeking asylum-a right with ancient religious roots. The first "encampment model" is fundamentally broken, as most refugees are housed in the developing or least developed world in terrible conditions for extended periods of time, with little or no realistic hope of resettlement elsewhere or repatriation. The developed world, which takes in only a tiny percentage of refugees worldwide, has tacitly acquiesced to this humanitarian catastrophe occurring outside its borders. Yet it has been forced in recent years to confront the worldwide refugee crisis as the number of persons traveling to wealthy countries to seek asylum has increased. Rather than respond with policies that address the roots of refugee flows, many developed nations have pursued a variety of strategies to interdict and otherwise distance asylum seekers.
   Refugee distancing is a way to import the encampment model into the asylum systems of the developed world. This blurring of the lines between encampment and asylum is strikingly clear, for example, in the tent cities that have cropped up along the U.S.-Mexico border under the Trump Administration's "Migrant Protection Protocol" (MPP), which requires asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. The overreaching impact of such policies is to dismantle the normative force of asylum by creating physical, psychological, and legal distance between the public and the asylum seekers who make a moral claim on them.
   This Article assesses refugee distancing policies-offering a history and analysis of their causes, as well as a commentary on their future. It contends that current policies may have unintended consequences, as did the U.S. government's efforts to thwart asylum for Haitian and Central American claimants in the 1980s-1990s. These efforts led to legal precedent allowing for the extraterritorial reach of the Constitution and to a political movement that created new immigration benefits for many asylulu applicants. The Article sketches out the legal challenges to one prominent refugee distancing policy, the MPP, and describes how a transnational legal process might contest refugee distancing over the long term.

KW  - eHealth
AB  - Background: During the last decade, more research has focused on web-based interventions delivered to support caregivers of people with dementia. However, little information is available in relation to internet use among caregivers in general, especially those caring for people with dementia.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the dementia-related internet use and factors that may be associated with its use among caregivers of people with dementia in Greece.
   Methods: Secondary data from the Greek Dementia Survey of the Athens Association of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders were collected from April to June 2017. A total of 580 caregivers of people with dementia participated in the study.
   Results: The majority of the caregivers reported that they had used the internet in the previous 3 months (84.1%, 488/580). Nearly half of the caregivers (47.5%, 276/580) reported that they had received dementia services online. Bivariate analysis showed that a dementia-specific search of information was associated with age, education, kinship, and years of care. Age (odds ratio [OR] 2.362, 95% CI 1.05-5.33) and education (OR 2.228, 95% CI 1.01-4.94) were confirmed as predictors, with younger caregivers and those with higher educational attainment being more likely to search for dementia-specific information. Use of the internet to search for dementia information was only related to hours of care. The internet use by caregivers within the previous 3 months was associated with variables such as age, education, occupation, kinship, years of care, and self-reported impact on physical and social health.
   Conclusions: Caregivers of people with dementia in Greece, as in the other southern European countries, are essential agents of the national health system. The existing short- and long-term respite care services are limited or nonexistent. Currently, caregivers receive mostly support and education from memory clinics and municipality consultation centers, which are mainly based in central cities in Greece. Despite the dementia awareness movement in Greece, there is still space to integrate the role of technology in the support and education of caregivers. Development of training programs for enhancing electronic health literacy skills as well as web-based services provision could support Greek caregivers in their everyday caring tasks.

AB  - The article analyzes the data of sociological research obtained by the Life Line (LL) method among schoolchildren and students of secondary vocational education in small mono-towns of the Sverdlovsk region. Particular attention is paid to the heuristic capabilities of this method in the study of mobility and the construction of narratives of the past, present, and future of young people. The article pursues a twofold goal: first, to subject the experience of using LL to methodological reflection, and secondly, to discuss some research findings obtained using this method. A total of 230 drawings from students and schoolchildren from Krasnoturinsk, Revda, and Pervouralsk are included in the analysis. A brief review of the method's development is given, along with the rationale for the authors' (less-formalized) version. The typology of LL, constructed according to the criteria of a formal structure, helps to analyze the meanings of (non) linearity, paying attention to both the prevailing logic and the variety of configurations. Classical and modern sociological theory has firmly-rooted ideas about the linearity of social change. At the biographical level, movement and the course of life are also described, taking linearity and direction into account. Most of the drawings of our participants adhere to linear logic; however, a great variety is found inside of it, and various options for deviations from the standard arrow from the past to the future are considered separately. Elements of the sketches testifying to territorial identity are of interest. The use of local names and toponyms gives the drawings a specificity and richness, and demonstrates the local competence of the participants. The life line method allows, in the authors' opinion, to demonstrate the diversity and the relative isomorphism of biographical visualizations at the same time, placing it in wider social contexts across a region, country, or even the world.

Cases were included if there was indication of sex or labor exploitation initiated by an IP, family member, or other in the domestic setting via elements of abuse; 59 cases of 213 met this criteria. Most cases included the IP as the trafficker, followed by family members, then others in the domestic setting. Abuse was more commonly used than the threat of abuse. From the Power and Control Wheel, the most frequent types of abuse were using privilege, physical abuse, economic abuse, isolation, and sexual abuse. Case typologies included: those with elements of sex trafficking, specifically forced commercial sex by an IP or family member; those with elements of labor trafficking such as domestic servitude (with or without childcare provision abuse), exploitation in a family business by an IP or family member, or work environments by family and non-family; those with elements of sex and labor trafficking included servile partnerships and forced marriage. Trafficking exploitation by an IP, family member, or in the domestic setting is not uncommon. Intimate relationships with a trafficker, psychological coercion, and threats may reduce reporting of abuse, subsequent provision of services, and result in misclassification as victims of IP violence. This study sheds light on various typologies of trafficking and exploitation in the domestic setting, further expanding the anti-trafficking movement's evidence base for intervention and prevention and adding complexity and nuance to the pathways to trafficking exploitation.

AB  - Human infrastructure development has increased particularly rapidly in the past 20 years in China. Some of these areas have coincided with the distribution areas of some endangered species in China, such as Reeves's pheasant (Syrmaticus reevesii). As a nationally protected animal and as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, it is a flagship species in some of the mountainous massifs of central China and is important in maintaining some natural forest reserves. If uncontrolled, development will threaten survival of this rare wild animal. Understanding the spatial-temporal response of Reeves's pheasant to habitat changes will be useful for providing information and improving habitat quality when making decisions on the use and management of land-use resources. To elucidate the impacts of human infrastructure development on changing the potential habitat of Reeves's pheasant between 2001-2002 and 2018-2019, we compared three different distribution models: a model with topographic and land cover variables, a model with topographic and human infrastructure development, and a model with all variables. Then we estimated the relative strength of land use/land cover (LULC) factors contributing to these changes by integrating Geo-Information technology and Markov analysis. Finally, we evaluated habitat fragmentation between the two periods.
   We found that the distribution of suitable habitat decreased from 2001 to 2002 to 2018 - 2019. Moreover, the directional distribution became more elongated and the mean center moved to southeast, which is closer to the highest peak in the Dabie Mountains. During 2000 - 2015, cultivated land and grassland area declined, while artificial surface area increased. Detailed examination of the LULC changes suggested that desertification had also occurred. Importantly, functional categorization revealed that all the different habitat area types predicted for Reeves's pheasant had decreased from 2001 to 2019. With the likely movement of the pheasant to higher elevations, human infrastructure development and environmental goals must both be considered to ensure the survival of this charismatic species.

AB  - Landslides are major hazards that may pose serious threats to mountain communities. Even landslides in remote mountains could have non-negligible impacts on populous regions by blocking large rivers and forming dambreached mega floods. Usually, there are slope deformations before major landslides occur, and detecting precursors such as slope movement before major landslides is important for preventing possible disasters. In this work, we applied multi-temporal optical remote sensing images (Landsat 7 and Sentinel-2) and an image correlation method to detect subpixel slope deformations of a slope near the town of Mindu in the Tibet Autonomous Region. This slope is located on the right bank of the Jinsha River, similar to 80 km downstream from the famous Baige landslide. We used a DEMderived aspect to restrain background noise in image correlation results. We found the slope remained stable from November 2015 to November 2018 and moved significantly from November 2018. We used more data to analyse slope movement in 2019 and found retrogressive slope movements with increasingly large deformations near the riverbank. We also analysed spatial-temporal patterns of the slope deformation from October 2018 to February 2020 and found seasonal variations in slope deformations. Only the foot of the slope moved in dry seasons, whereas the entire slope was activated in rainy seasons. Until 24 August 2019, the size of the slope with displacements larger than 3 m was similar to that of the Baige landslide. However, the river width at the foot of this slope is much narrower than the river width at the foot of the Baige landslide. We speculate it may continue to slide down and threaten the Jinsha River. Further modelling works should be carried out to check if the imminent landslide could dam the Jinsha River and measures should be taken to mitigate possible dam breach flood disasters. This work illustrates the potential of using optical remote sensing to monitor slope deformations over remote mountain regions.

AB  - Landslide is a geo-hazard phenomenon that has been taking lives and causing severe property damages all over the world mostly in mountainous areas. The Main Ethiopian Rift has a unique tectonic setting with complex geological and geomorphological features, coupled with continuously deteriorating environmental conditions, which made its escarpments vulnerable for landslides. The study area is located near the Debre Sina town, within the Yizaba Wein locality, which has been severely affected by frequent landslide problems. This work was carried out using a multidisciplinary approach based on geological, geomorphological, kinematic analysis and geophysical survey. Seismic refraction investigations were carried out along the Yizaba Wein landslide main scarp to determine the depth to the bedrock and to the failure plane, to assess the stability of the slope, to locate possible structural features and to identify the extent of recent landslide activity, and to study the subsurface situation. The seismic measurements were made along three nearly orthogonal survey lines in the recently affected area. A high-resolution 2D P-wave survey was conducted using a 24-channel seismic unit. The seismic refraction results revealed four layers of geomaterials with distinct physical characteristics that contained a subsurface landslide anomaly within the layers. The layers were interpreted according to the major lithological units, from top to bottom: (i) clay, loosely cemented colluvial sediments and highly weathered agglomeratic basalt; (ii) highly to moderately fractured porphyritic basalt, ignimbrite-volcanic ash and rhyolite/trachyte; (iii) moderately to slightly fractured ignimbrite, rhyolite/trachyte and basalt and (iv) very strong, massive, fresh rock/bedrock. Faults and weak zones have also been identified in the bedrock based on the abundance of fractures and subsidiary faults resulting from damage of rocks and change of lithology due to variable fault rock formation strongly influencing the wavefield distribution which usually causes a local decrease of the velocity value. The main findings show that the landslide in the Yizaba Wein locality was caused by its complex geological-structural setting and downslope movement of the underlying pyroclastic sediment facilitated by heavy rainfall. Considering the similar geological and tectonic settings, similar mechanisms can be assumed for other landslides along the rift margins and associated highlands of Ethiopia. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Originating in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019, COVID-19 has emerged now as a global health emergency with a high number of deaths worldwide. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in pandemic conditions around the globe. We are in the battleground to fight against the virus by rapidly developing therapeutic strategies in tackling SARS-CoV-2 and saving human lives from COVID-19. Scientists are evaluating several known drugs either for the pathogen or the host; however, many of them are reported to be associated with side effects. In the present study, we report the molecular binding mechanisms of the natural alkaloid, noscapine, for repurposing against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, a key enzyme involved in its reproduction. We performed the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in an explicit solvent to investigate the molecular mechanisms of noscapine for stable binding and conformational changes to the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. The drug repurposing study revealed the high potential of noscapine and proximal binding to the Mpro enzyme in a comparative binding pattern analyzed with chloroquine, ribavirin, and favipiravir. Noscapine binds dosely to binding pocket-3 of the Mpro enzyme and depicted stable binding with RMSD 0.1-1.9 angstrom and RMSF profile peak conformational fluctuations at 202-306 residues, and a Rg score ranging from 21.9 to 22.4 angstrom. The MM/PB (GB) SA calculation landscape revealed the most significant contribution in terms of binding energy with Delta PB -19.08 and Delta GB -27.17 kcal/mol. The electrostatic energy distribution in MM energy was obtained to be -71.16 kcal/mol and depicted high free energy decomposition (electrostatic energy) at 155-306 residues (binding pocket-3) of Mpro by a MM force field. Moreover, the dynamical residue cross-correlation map also stated that the high pairwise correlation occurred at binding residues 200-306 of the Mpro enzyme (binding pocket-3) with noscapine. Principal component analysis depicted the enhanced movement of protein atoms with a high number of static hydrogen bonds. The obtained binding results of noscapine were also well correlated with the pharmacokinetic parameters of antiviral drugs.

AB  - Objective: To explore whether long-term Taijiquan exercises affect the memory and executive function of the elderly with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Method: 108 elderly aged 65-85 with MCI were selected from two communities in Changsha City. They were randomly divided into experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) with 54 people in each group. They were instructed about the knowledge related to MCI and handbooks were distributed to them. The CG received health education and maintained regular exercise, while the EG received Taijiquan exercises at least four times a week for at least 45 minutes each time for a total of four months. The Auditory Vocabulary Learning Test (AVLT) and Trail Making Test-A (TMT-A) were used to evaluate the changes of memory and executive function before and after the experiment. SPSS18.0 software was used to analyze the general data of the subjects, AVLT long-delay recall score and TMT-A time-consuming. Results: Before the experiment, the scores of long delayed recalls of AVLT and TMT-A were no significant difference between EG and CG (p = 0.479, 0.814 > 0.05). After the experiment, the scores of the EG were significantly higher than those of the CG (p = 0.006 < 0.01; p = 0.034 < 0.05). The analysis shows that: The significant improvement of AVLT and TMT-A means the improvement of memory and executive function, so that long-term Taijiquan exercise can improve the cognitive ability of elderly with MCI. Conclusion: Taijiquan belongs to systemic aerobic exercise, which is very beneficial to cardiovascular system. Taijiquan emphasizes "using mind not power" and "combination of mind, breath and body," which can continuously stimulate the central nervous system and promote the establishment of intracerebral nervous network collateral and nerve synapses. Long-term Taijiquan exercises improve memory and executive function in elderly with MCI by affecting cardiovascular system and nervous system, and improve their cognitive ability. Because of its gentle and slow movement, rich and changeable forms, not limited by equipment and venues, it is helpful to promote widely in the community and play a role in delaying or reducing the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - We developed a method to assess heat-stroke risk during exercise in the outdoor environment based on the potential effective sweating (PES). The PES indicates the minimum effective sweating required to maintain a constant body temperature when undertaking an activity in the outdoor environment. It can be calculated easily using observed meteorological data, body size, clothing, and exercise intensity. Additionally, we propose the concept of globe PES (PESg) and PESWBGT, which can be measured using portable equipment, such as a wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) meter. Especially, PESWBGT can be estimated by only WBGT observations. We performed a thermal-load exposure experiment with human subjects in an outdoor urban environment, and compared the three kinds of effective sweating and actual potential sweating. The calculated PES values had deviations of 33.3-42.7% from actual potential sweating. We assessed the risk of heat stroke based on the decrease in a runner's weight using routine meteorological data observed in recent decades. Calculations were made for start times set at 30-min intervals from 05: 00 to 19: 00 on August 2 and 9, the dates of the marathon event in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. When the start time was set from 9: 30 to 11: 00, a runner's weight was estimated to decrease by an average of 7.37-7.40% and a maximum of 8.09-8.20% by the end of the race. A postural movement or convulsion is likely to occur if the runner did not drink water. When the start time was set to 06: 00, the weight decrease was predicted to be 6.18-7.15%; the thermal load at this time was equivalent to that of a 15: 00 or 15: 30 start time. Thermal loads may be smaller in the early evening than in the early morning. The average wind speed is weaker in the morning than in the afternoon, thereby decreasing the effect of wind on cooling the surfaces of the human body and the road in the morning. Hence, a change in the start time to early morning may not significantly decrease the thermal load.

AB  - This article intends to think about the power -past and present- of Peronism as a political-cultural movement, based on an analysis of the sculptures entitled Los derechos del trabajador and La razon de mi vida, originally intended as part of the so-called Monumento al Descamisado, designed by the government in 1951, and currently part of the heritage of the Museo Historico 17 de octubre, located in the town of San Vicente, Province of Buenos Aires. Addressing them from the point of view of the biographical approach of the material culture, a tour of the different moments that the sculptures went through to the place (physical, historical and symbolic) that they occupy today is realized, thus understanding not only that they have managed to transcend enormously to its creators, but have also been resignified and transformed into various instances, as the product of changing social and power relations.

AB  - The Hyuga-nada Sea, south-eastern Kyushu, Japan, is located between a strong (Nankai Trough) and a weak interplate coupling zone (Ryukyu Trench). Over the past 400 years this area has only experienced Magnitude 7 center dot 5 earthquakes or smaller and associated small-scale tsunamis. However, this short historical record most likely does not include the full range of high magnitude, low frequency giant earthquakes that might have occurred in the region. Thus, it is still unclear whether giant earthquakes and their associated tsunamis have occurred in this region. This paper reports on a prehistoric tsunami deposit discovered in a coastal lowland in south-eastern Kyushu facing the Hyuga-nada Sea. There is a reddish-brown pumiceous layer preserved in a non-marine, organic-rich mud sequence obtained from onshore sediment cores. This layer is recognized as the ca 4600 year old Kirishima-Miike tephra (that is now placed around 4500 years ago) sourced from Mount Kirishima, southern Kyushu. Another whitish pumiceous layer is evident below the Kirishima-Miike tephra in almost all of the sediment cores. A relatively high percentage of marine and brackish diatoms is recorded within this lower pumiceous layer (but not in the surrounding muds or in the overlying Kirishima-Miike tephra), indicating a marine or beach sediment source. Plant material obtained from organic-rich mud immediately below the event layer was dated to ca 4430 to 4710 cal yr bp, providing a limiting-maximum age for this marine incursion event. The presence of marine diatoms below the event layer is probably explained by pre-seismic subsidence. An absence of the resting spore of the planktonic brackish diatom Cheatoceros and the appearance of the freshwater diatom Eunotia serra immediately above the event layer probably represents a marked change to a relatively low-salinity environment. Assuming that there were no significant local geomorphological changes, such as drainage obstruction caused by formation of a new barrier spit, it is considered that co-seismic or immediate post-seismic uplift are the most likely explanations for this notable environmental change. Based on the crustal movements noted before and after the marine incursion, this event is interpreted here as an earthquake-generated tsunami. Moreover, because of these notable seismic crustal movements the tsunamigenic earthquake probably occurred immediately offshore of the study site.

AB  - (1) Background: There is increasing awareness that the quality of the indoor environment affects our health and well-being. Indoor air quality (IAQ) in particular has an impact on multiple health outcomes, including respiratory and cardiovascular illness, allergic symptoms, cancers, and premature mortality. (2) Methods: We carried out a global systematic literature review on indoor exposure to selected air pollutants associated with adverse health effects, and related household characteristics, seasonal influences and occupancy patterns. We screened records from six bibliographic databases: ABI/INFORM, Environment Abstracts, Pollution Abstracts, PubMed, ProQuest Biological and Health Professional, and Scopus. (3) Results: Information on indoor exposure levels and determinants, emission sources, and associated health effects was extracted from 141 studies from 29 countries. The most-studied pollutants were particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10); nitrogen dioxide (NO2); volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene, toluene, xylenes and formaldehyde; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including naphthalene. Identified indoor PM2.5 sources include smoking, cooking, heating, use of incense, candles, and insecticides, while cleaning, housework, presence of pets and movement of people were the main sources of coarse particles. Outdoor air is a major PM2.5 source in rooms with natural ventilation in roadside households. Major sources of NO2 indoors are unvented gas heaters and cookers. Predictors of indoor NO2 are ventilation, season, and outdoor NO2 levels. VOCs are emitted from a wide range of indoor and outdoor sources, including smoking, solvent use, renovations, and household products. Formaldehyde levels are higher in newer houses and in the presence of new furniture, while PAH levels are higher in smoking households. High indoor particulate matter, NO2 and VOC levels were typically associated with respiratory symptoms, particularly asthma symptoms in children. (4) Conclusions: Household characteristics and occupant activities play a large role in indoor exposure, particularly cigarette smoking for PM2.5, gas appliances for NO2, and household products for VOCs and PAHs. Home location near high-traffic-density roads, redecoration, and small house size contribute to high indoor air pollution. In most studies, air exchange rates are negatively associated with indoor air pollution. These findings can inform interventions aiming to improve IAQ in residential properties in a variety of settings.

AB  - An earthquake of magnitude M5.7 occurred in Yamutu village, Songyuan City, Jilin Province, NE China (45 degrees 16 ' 12 '' N/124 degrees 42 ' 35 '' E) on May 28, 2018, with a focal depth of 13 km. The epicenter is located at the intersection of the Fuyu/Songyuan-Zhaodong Fault, Second Songhua River Fault and Fuyu North Fault which lies northwest of Tancheng-Lujiang Fault (Tan-Lu Fault). The earthquake-induced widespread liquefaction structures and ground surface fissures within 3 km from the epicenter, caused serious disasters to the local surroundings. The visible liquefied structures include sand volcanoes, liquefied sand mounds, sand dikes and sand sills. Sand volcanoes can be divided into sand volcano with a crater, sand volcano without a crater and water volcano (no sand). Other soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDS) induced by the earthquake include deformation lamination, load and flame structures, deformation folds, dish structures, convolute bedding and water-escape structures. The formation process of the sand volcanoes comprises three stages: (1) building up excess pore-fluid pressure in the liquefied layer, (2) cracking of the low-permeable overlying layer, and (3) mixture of sand-water venting out of the ground surface. During the upward movement, the liquefied sand is injected into the low-permeable layer to form sand veins, sand sills and various types of deformation structures. Vertical distribution of seismic liquefaction structure can be divided into four zones: the thoroughly liquefied zone, the lower liquefied zone with SSDS, the upper liquefied zone with SSDS, and the ground surface liquefied zone. The liquefaction occurred at a burial depth of 2-5 m, and the thickness of liquefied sand is 2 m. NE-SW (35 degrees-215 degrees) trending compressive stress is possibly the seismogenic trigger of the Songyuan M5.7 earthquake that caused the fault (Fuyu/Songyuan-Zhaodong Fault) to reactivate. The study of the Songyuan seismic liquefaction structures gives insight into the prediction of modern earthquakes and disaster-prone areas. Meanwhile it provides abundant basic material for studying earthquake-induced SSDS in both ancient and modern sediments. The research is obviously of great significance to reveal that the northern Tan-Lu Fault has entered a stage of active seismic activity since the twenty-first century.

AB  - The problem of collisions on local roads has received little specific attention despite the considerable number of such collisions that occur each year. First part of this study identifies the factors that influence local road collision frequency at traffic analysis zone (TAZ) level with a particular focus on the planning and policy related variables. The City of Calgary is used as a case study, where we focus on the impacts of land use, demographic characteristics, and travel characteristics. We also investigate the effects of some key transportation planning parameters for which there have been very limited studies, including the number of personal and commercial trips and the employment numbers in various categories. This study examines the impact of the number of trips made by automobile versus more sustainable transport modes like transit, walking, and biking for personal travel. It also examines the impact of commercial truck movement on the number of collisions on local roads in a TAZ. The impact of transit-oriented development zone initiatives is explored, as is the relationship between the predominant land use type (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial) and the number of collisions on local roads. In the second part, collision prediction models were linked with regional transportation model (RTM), which is calibrated and modeled in EMME. Since the choice of transportation mode is explicitly modeled through utility functions in the RTM, the proposed approach will allow us to do scenario analysis for planning and policy level issues proactively such as impact on local collisions due to change in fuel price, parking cost, transit headway, and transit fare. Results showed that property damage only (PDO) and fatal and injury (FI) collisions decreased by 13% and 6%, respectively, when fuel price was doubled. It was also observed thatPDOand FI collisions decreased by 8% and 5%, respectively, whenparking cost was doubled. PDO and FI collisions decreased by 7% and 4%, respectively, when transit headway was reduced to half. When transit fare was reduced to half, PDO and FI collisions decreased by 5% and 2%, respectively. PDO and FI collisions decreased by 10% and 5%, respectively, when transit fare was set to zero. These scenario analyses demonstrate how the impact of transportation planning or policy level issues on the collision count on local roads can be incorporated in our proposed model.

AB  - Background Plasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic in the southern sahelian zone of Mauritania where intense internal and trans-border human and livestock movement occurs. The risk of importation and spread of drug-resistant parasites need to be regularly assessed in this region. The objective of the study was to assess the recent malaria situation near the Mauritania-Mali border. Methods Between February 2015 and December 2017, patients with fever or history of fever during the previous 48 h, presenting at the health centre of Kobeni city, were screened for malaria using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and microscopic examination of blood smears. The diagnosis was later confirmed by PCR. Cohen's kappa statistics was used to estimate the degree of agreement between diagnostic methods. Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions. The odds ratio was calculated to measure the association between the use of bed nets and malaria infection. Results A total of 2326 febrile patients (mean age, 20.2 years) were screened for malaria. The presence of malaria parasites was detected by RDT and microscopy in 53.0% and 49.3% of febrile patients, respectively, and was confirmed by PCR in 59.7% (45 missing data). Of 1361 PCR-positive samples, 1205 (88.5%) were P. falciparum, 47 (3.5%) P. vivax, and 99 (7.3%) P. falciparum-P. vivax mixed infection. Malaria transmission occurred mostly during and shortly after the rainy season. The annual rainfall was relatively low in 2016 (267 mm) and 2017 (274 mm), compared to 2015 (448 mm), and coincided with a decline in malaria prevalence in 2016-2017. Although 71.8% of febrile patients reported to possess at least one bed net in the household in our questionnaire, its reported use was not protective against malaria infection (odds ratio: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.91-1.32). Conclusions Our study confirmed that P. falciparum is the dominant species in the sahelian zone and that malaria transmission is seasonal and associated with rainfall in this zone. The application of the current national policy based on rapid and reliable malaria diagnosis, case management with artemisinin-based combination therapy, intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women, distribution and use of long-lasting insecticide impregnated bed nets, and the planned introduction of seasonal malaria chemoprevention for all children under 6 years old is expected to sustainably reduce malaria transmission in this zone.

AB  - Background/Context: Research links advanced mathematics course-taking to important later outcomes, including college graduation and earnings, yet many students fail to progress into higher math courses as they move through high school. Black and Hispanic high school students are less likely than their white peers to take advanced math courses. A complex set of factors inform decisions about student course-taking, but teachers play key roles, including providing information about courses, giving students encouragement, helping students form aspirations (e.g., through role modeling), and serving as gatekeepers via grade assignment and formal recommendations. At the same time, growing empirical evidence suggests that students from different racial/ethnic groups benefit from being taught by teachers with similar demographic backgrounds, which motivates an analysis connecting math teacher-student racial or ethnic congruence with progression into higher math courses in high school.
   Purpose: We investigate the degree to which having a math teacher of the same race or ethnicity predicts subsequent enrollment in more advanced high school math courses, as well as in honors and Advanced Placement (AP) math courses. We also investigate potential mechanisms, including impacts of student-teacher congruence on course grades and standardized test performance, which may in turn predict a higher likelihood of advanced math course enrollment.
   Setting: We examine student-level administrative data from high schools in Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the fourth largest school district in the United States.
   Research Design: We estimate the likelihood that a student will take a higher level math course as a function of student-teacher racial/ethnic congruence, plus student, teacher, and classroom characteristics, and school fixed effects. This research design compares later math course-taking between students with and without race/ethnicity-congruent teachers within the same school, holding a variety of other factors constant. We estimate similar models for honors and AP course-taking. We also estimate models for math course grades and end-of-course (EOC) exam scores using school-by-course and student fixed effects.
   Findings/Results: We find that high school students with a same-race or same-ethnicity teacher are more likely to take a higher math course in the next year than other students taking the same course in the same school. Associations are largest for Black students, who are 2 percentage points more likely to advance to a higher math course when taught by a Black teacher. Having a demographically similar teacher is also associated with movement into honors and AP courses in the next term, on average, though results vary by student subgroup. Students receive higher EOC scores and higher grades when taught by a demographically similar teacher, with higher grades even than what would be predicted by their EOC score, particularly in algebra.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Our analysis contributes to growing evidence on the importance of teacher diversity for outcomes for students from minoritized groups and is among only a very small set of studies that demonstrate teachers' impacts on student outcomes not just for one year, but also in subsequent years. Our results underscore the importance of efforts to recruit and retain teachers of color, particularly in high schools. We recommend future research to better understand the mechanisms linking diverse teachers to student course-taking outcomes.

AB  - A number of archaeological salvage excavations conducted in Alexandria (Lower Egypt) by the Centre d'Etudes alexandrines have provided a corpus of around 2000 fragments of marine, freshwater and terrestrial invertebrates. These archeomalacological remains come from several occupation layers of the same district within the town, the Brucheion, dating from the end of the 4th century BC until the 6th century AD. After macroscopic observations and through a binocular microscope, the analysis of the malacofauna vestiges has provided previously unknown information regarding the exploitation of the aquatic environment by Alexandrians during antiquity. In addition, some residues of mineral material preserved on the shells have been analysed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). This study sheds light on both consumption choices and on the variety of uses for shells (container, decoration, raw material) within the Alexandrian domestic context. Certain species from the Red Sea and the Western Mediterranean Sea provide new data on the movement of products of marine origin within Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt.

AB  - The north of La Pampa (Argentina) has been exploited by intense agricultural activity for more than a century. These activities generated a strong anthropic modification of the landscape through the intervention of several agricultural technologies. Its effect on the archaeological record is undeniable, although it has not been deeply discussed. In this work, we review the studies related to the effect of plowing and farming activity. We also propose an experimental design to evaluate the effect of these activities in the northern region of the province of La Pampa, specifically at the Mariano Miro site (Dpt. Chapaleufu, Province of La Pampa). Miro was a town of approximately 500 inhabitants founded in 1901 next to the homonymous station of the Ferrocarril Oeste. The town was abandoned in 1911. The objective of the proposed experiment is aimed at generating frames of reference for the study region that allows us to evaluate the site formation processes (natural conditions and anthropic factors) that have occurred in similar contexts at the regional level.

AB  - This article presents a reflection on two interrelated topics: the modification of eating habits in Spain, a key aspect of everyday life, through the presence of a substantial migration movement that started in the 1990s, and the intervention of migrant workers into the food economy, particularly in rural areas with heavy agriculture development such as seen in Lleida and its surrounding towns. It will provide a reading of two recent texts (a film and a book) that engage with issues of immigration and food. Both El proximo Oriente (2006) directed by Fernando Colomo, and La pell de la frontera (2014) authored by Francesc Seres offer evidence about contemporary Spain's transformation through food. In these texts food is a powerful weapon of social and physical control, and encapsulates some of the many adjustments that have occurred in Spanish society. The kitchen, at home or in a restaurant, as a private or as a public space, becomes a setting to display the fine line between the familiar and the uncanny, between a domestic (safe) and a hostile environment.

AB  - At the town of Ilirska Bistrica in Slovenia, in the hinterland of Istria, a large rotational landslide occurred at the end of the Pliocene (Img. 1, Img. 2, Img. 3) (Placer & Jamsek, 2012). It has a semicircular crown with a semicircular body below it measuring some 5 km in diameter. In the Early Middle Ages, the Slavs established a mythical landscape dedicated to the goddess Mokosh around the semicircular crown. This landscape involves the peaks of Velika Milanja, Mala Milanja, Milanka and two hills named Devin (Devin 2, Devin 3), while another Devin 1 lies outside the landslide area. The semicircular ridge also includes a rocky pyramid named Baba, the special significance of which is a continuation of the pre-Slavic cult that the Slavs incorporated into their own mythical world (Img. 4) (Hrobat Virloget, 2012, 2014). In Slavic lands, Devin is the geographic names for numerous elevations, which have one geomorphological feature in common: they share one gentle and one steep or precipitous slope (Img. 5, Img. 6. Img. 7, Img. 8, Img. 9, Img. 11). According to Tille, Devin is a place of worshipping cults of nature (Smitek, 2006). As for Baba, Hrobat Virloget (2014) notes that the Slavs ascribed certain traits to her similar to those of Mokosh and hence included Baba into the goddess' circle of mythical objects (Img. 14a, Img. 14b). The mythical landscape of Mokosh is composed of two elements. One is the ritual polygon of Mokosh consisting of three peaks on the semicircular ridge and Devin 1 outside it (Img. 11). The other is the semicircular ridge itself with the semicircular body below it (Img. 17). The ritual polygon of Mokosh is determined so that a circle may be drawn around Velika Milanja that crosses all other three points of the polygon. These three points form an isosceles triangle, the sides of which make up an angle that is the sum of two ritual angles (23.5 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees x 2). The two angles together symbolize the annual movement of the Sun (Img. 12). Velika Milanja ( Mokosh) lies on the axis of symmetry and balances the oscillation of the Sun between the summer and the winter solstice (Img. 17, 3). The circle with Mokosh in the centre is called the "Solar Circle". The semicircular crown with the semicircular slope below it symbolises a crescent, hence it is called the " Moon Crescent" (Img. 15, Img. 16, Img. 17).Mokosh is, among others, the protectress of water, cattle and shepherds; she is ambivalent and belongs to both the lunar and the solar sphere. Her ambivalence is reflected in the geometry of the mythical landscape, with Mokosh (Velika Milanja) lying in the centre of the "Solar Circle" and on the " Moon Crescent" (Img. 17). Mokosh's lunar character is underscored by a slope on the semicircular ridge called Volovja reber ('ox rib' in translation); ox is an important lunar animal. Milanka and Baba also lie on the " Moon Crescent", though their role in the mythical landscape dedicated to Mokosh remains unexplained. The broader significance of the mythical landscape of Mokosh is illustrated in Img. 18. She cared for the sources of life (water and cattle, apparently also the Sun), but also watched over the settlements that formed the centre of administration: Knezak as the seat of the prince, and Zemono as evidence of fortified posts. All this reveals an example of how the centre of an early medieval Slavic principality.

AB  - James J. Saxon sought to transform American banking as Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator of national banks, from 1961 to 1966. As a regulatory entrepreneur, he attempted to unleash what he perceived as overly regulated national banks in order to stimulate the American economy. Saxon impacted many small towns by chartering new banks and breaking up 'Rotary Club cartels.' He loosened many regulations, induced numerous banks to switch to national charters, and sparred with fellow regulators and Congress, but ultimately failed to implement much of his agenda. The half century that followed saw his vision realized as the American financial sector occupied a historically disproportionate fraction of the economy. Saxon marks an inflection point between aggressive New Deal financial regulation and the deregulatory movement leading up to the Great Recession. Saxon serves as an example of the dangers in zeal outstripping tact in efforts to effect organizational change. He also provides an anomalous example of a bureaucrat breaking from the stereotype of colorless evenhandedness. As memories of the Great Recession fade, Saxon serves as an example of the risks of a deregulatory process and the importance of a delivery mechanism for ideas for today's bankers, regulators, and public officials.

AB  - High-locality landslides primarily occur in the upper zone of the failed slope, in which the slip surface is considerably higher than the foot of the slope. This paper discusses a high-locality landslide that occurred on August 8, 2017, on the left bank of Zagunao River in Tonghua Town, southwest China. The landslide, called the Tonghua landslide, originated on a 716-m-high hillslope, which was formed by preexisting glacial deposits. The main body of the landslide is currently suspended on hillslope, with a relative relief of 353 m and is undergoing progressive failure. The town of Tonghua is located downslope of this landslide, and hence, the landslide could cause severe damage, including casualties and the destruction of infrastructure. Very few mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce the potentially devastating consequences due to the high locality and continuous movement of the landslide. We conducted comprehensive studies including field investigations, aerial photographic interpretations, pluviometric regime analysis, and superficial displacement monitoring to understand the failure mechanism and evolutionary process of this ongoing landslide. Considering that a Ms 7.0 earthquake occurred in Jiuzhaigou, approximately 220 km northeast of Tonghua Town, on the same day as the landslide, and that sporadic but persistent rainfall occurred before slope failure, we believe that both the rainfall and the earthquake were potential triggers for this landslide. However, further studies are necessary to better understand the characteristics and to develop hazard mitigation strategies for this type of landslide.

AB  - This study investigates the potential for seismic seiches in Lake Tekapo, New Zealand, triggered by ground shaking from an Mw8.2 Alpine Fault earthquake. Synthetic ground motions are used as a forcing boundary to drive lake water motions by further developing a tsunami simulation model-COMCOT-and coupling it with earthquake simulation model outputs. Our modelling results reveal that lake water oscillations are mobilised immediately by the ground movement and further amplified by cross-lake seiches. Amplitudes of lake oscillations can reach up to 4.0 m in the lake's narrow southern arm, over 1.0 m along the shore of Lake Tekapo township, and about 1.5-2.5 m along many other parts of the lake shore. Large-amplitude water oscillations quickly attenuate in the first 5-10 min after the earthquake due to their relatively short periods, while long-period oscillations continue for a long time, albeit with much smaller amplitudes. Spectral analysis clearly reveals that the ground motions trigger both fundamental and higher modes in the lake whose oscillation periods are consistent with theoretical estimates. We find that large-amplitude lake water oscillations are better correlated with low-frequency, less energetic ground motion content than with high-frequency large-amplitude ground motions. Ground motion-triggered lake oscillations are large enough to pose potential threat to tourists, residents, boats and infrastructure both in the lake water and onshore near the waterfront. In contrast, vertical co-seismic displacements in the lake area, the conventional mechanism for tsunami generation, are too small to trigger tsunami waves of concern.

AB  - The Great Artesian Basin (GAB) in Australia underlies semi-arid and arid regions across 1.7 million km(2) or one-fifth of Australia. The basin's groundwater resources were discovered around 1880 and their development allowed pastoral activities, homestead and town water supplies, and petroleum and mining ventures to exist. The GAB is a multi-layered confined aquifer system, with aquifers in Jurassic and Cretaceous continental sandstones and intervening confining beds of siltstone and mudstone of the constituent Eromanga, Surat and Carpentaria sedimentary basins. The basin is up to 3,000 m thick and forms a large synclinal structure, uplifted and exposed along its eastern margin and tilted southwest. Recharge to the exposed aquifers occurs in the eastern margin, an area of relative high rainfall. The western margin in Australia's arid centre receives minor recharge. Regional groundwater flow is towards the southern, south-western, western and northern margins. Flowing artesian springs discharge in the southwest margin and have produced carbonate mounds. Although lateral groundwater movement dominates, vertical upwards leakage is considered important. Potentiometric surfaces of the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous aquifers are still above ground level throughout most of the basin, though pressure drawdowns of up to 100 m have been recorded in recent decades in highly developed areas, and consequently some artesian water boreholes and springs have ceased flowing. Government borehole rehabilitation programs have led to groundwater pressure recovery in some areas. This paper outlines the history of GAB exploration, scientific investigations (hydrogeology, hydrochemistry, isotope hydrology, groundwater modelling) and management, summarising the recent knowledge on the GAB.

AB  - Author summary
   Over half of the world's population is at risk of infection by dengue virus (DENV) from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. While most infected people experience mild or asymptomatic infections, dengue can cause severe symptoms, such as hemorrhage, shock, and death. A vaccine against dengue exists, but it can increase the risk of severe disease in people who have not been previously infected by one of the four DENV serotypes. In many places, therefore, the best currently available way to prevent outbreaks is by controlling the mosquito population. Our study used a simulation model to explore alternative strategies for deploying insecticide in the city of Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon. Our simulations closely matched empirical patterns from studies of dengue's ecology and epidemiology in Iquitos, such as mosquito population dynamics, human household structure, demography, human and mosquito movement, and virus transmission. Our results indicate that an insecticide that has a long-lasting, residual effect will have the biggest impact on reducing DENV transmission. For non-residual insecticides, we find that it is best to begin spraying close to the start of the dengue transmission season, as mosquito populations can rebound quickly and resume previous levels of transmission.
   Recent years have seen rising incidence of dengue and large outbreaks of Zika and chikungunya, which are all caused by viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In most settings, the primary intervention against Aedes-transmitted viruses is vector control, such as indoor, ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying. Targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) has the potential to more effectively impact Aedes-borne diseases, but its implementation requires careful planning and evaluation. The optimal time to deploy these interventions and their relative epidemiological effects are, however, not well understood. We used an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission calibrated to data from Iquitos, Peru to assess the epidemiological effects of these interventions under differing strategies for deploying them. Specifically, we compared strategies where spray application was initiated when incidence rose above a threshold based on incidence in recent years to strategies where spraying occurred at the same time(s) each year. In the absence of spraying, the model predicted 361,000 infections [inter-quartile range (IQR): 347,000-383,000] in the period 2000-2010. The ULV strategy with the fewest median infections was spraying twice yearly, in March and October, which led to a median of 172,000 infections [IQR: 158,000-183,000], a 52% reduction from baseline. Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days). For TIRS, the best strategy was threshold-based, which led to the fewest infections of all strategies tested (9,900; [IQR: 8,720-11,400], a 94% reduction), and required fewer days spraying than the equivalent ULV strategy (280). Although spraying twice each year is likely to avert the most infections, our results indicate that a threshold-based strategy can become an alternative to better balance the translation of spraying effort into impact, particularly if used with a residual insecticide.

AB  - The sharp different in lithology and microfauna between Nurolskaya and Tavdinskaya suites of Western Siberia have been explained the interruption in sedimentation. This interruption may be created by action of the Alpien tectonic movement. The quartzsiliceous of foraminiferal shells in Nurolskaya suite have been changed on calcareous ones in Tavdinskaya suite. Radiolaria have absent not only in this suite of Western Siberia but in the different stratons of Northern Europe. On the base of characteristic foraminiferal species the age of Tavdinskaya suite was dated as Rupelian one. The uppermost layers of Nurolskaya suite have included single and less diversity Foraminifera. They have been remained from distraction in single depressions of Western Siberia. These layers may be offer to the beginning of Latdorfien stage. Upper layers of Latdorphien stage have taken out from Oligocenian section. On the base of foraminiferal species Tavdinskaya suite correspond to Rupelian stage of Middle Oligocenian. The Foraminifera from Tavdinskaya suite are the same as ones in many other regions: Europe, Atlantic Ocean, USA and other regions. Lower Oligocenian (Latdorfien stage) including zone or layers with characteristic foraminifera has been observed in Middle, South Europe, Crimea and Middle Asia. Nevertheless Latdorfien stage was excluded from Comman Stratigraphic Scheme. In Tavdinskaya Suite of Western Siberia in jeneral secretic - calcareous Foraminifera spread as Cibicidoides pseudoungerianus, Evolutononian Assemblage [Podobina, 1998, 2009]. This Assemblage includes characteristic Bentic and Plantonic species. Among them are Cibicidoides pseudoungerianus (Cushman), Nonionellina oligocenica (Cushman et Mc Glamary), N. ovata Brotzen, Evolutononium decoratum (Cushman et Mc Glamary), Cribroelphidium perrarum Uschakova, C. parainvolutum Uschakova, Elphidiella vegrandia Uschakova, E. nitida Podobina, E. cosmica Uschakova. Among of planktonic species are Paragloborotalia postcretacea (Mjatliuk), P. anguliofficinalis (Blow), Turborotalia perfecta Podobina, Globigerina ouachitaensis Howe et Wallace gnaucki Blow et Banner, G. angustiumbilicata Bolli, G. ampliapertura Bolli, G. senilis Bandy, G. prasaepis Blow, G. officinalis Subbotina praesentata Podobina [Podobina, 1998]. Foraminifera from stratotipe of Rupelian stage have been studied from specimens of Belgium quarries. Author have took part in field excursion (Symposium on Paleogene, August, 25-30, 2003 years, t. Leven, Belgium). Foraminifera Assemblage has been established by auther in stratotype of Rupelian Stage (near town Boom). Common and characteristic in West Siberian and Belgium species are Cibicidoides pseudoungerianus (Cushman), Evolutononion decoratum (Cushman et Mc Glamary), Nonionelina oligocenica (Cushman et Mc Glamary) and species from Globigerina genera. Among them auther have defined Globigerina ouachitaensis Howe et Wallace, G. juvenilis (Bolli), G. officinalis Subbotina praesentata Podobina, G. amliapertura Bolli. Elphidium and Bulimina have not been established in Belgium Assemblage [Podobina, 2009]. Many of Planktonic species of Middle Oligocenian know in the same deposits, except Belgium, in Poland, Prekarpatie, Trinidad, South Atlantic Ocean and Western Siberia. The findings of Globigerina ampliapertura Bolli in Tavdinskaya suite of Western Siberia have big impotence, because have been included in known Middle Oligocenian zone. This species in Tavdinskaya suite shows on the presence of such zone of Middle Oligocenian (Rupelian Stage).
   West Siberian Cibicidoides pseudoungerianus, Evolutononion decoratum Zone correspond to age of Belgien Rupelian one. Also this West Siberian zone correspond to Rupelian Globigerina ampliapertura one of Trinidad, Atlantic Ocean and other Regions.

AB  - Although the tectonic evolution of the southern Himalaya has been extensively studied, relatively few studies have focused on potential neotectonic activity in the most hinterland part of Himalaya, north of the region that separates the southern edge of the Tibetan plateau from the peaks of the Higher Himalayan Range. Here we use a combination of new structural and geomorphic field data, Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) chronology, as well as previously published seismicity and denudation rate dataset, to suggest that the Trans-Himalaya within the region of the Indus Suture Zone (ISZ) is neotectonically active. Based on fault gouge, tilted paleolake deposits, and the chronology of deformed fluvial gravels constrained by OSL dating, the present study provides evidence for the tectonic activity along the ISZ between 78 and 58 ka. The occurrence of two earthquakes of Mw > 4.0 and the focal mechanism solution of a shallow focus earthquake (Mw: 3.0, depth similar to 8 km) near the town of Upshi, shows a pure thrust mechanism. We suggest that this earthquake was likely associated with the Upshi-Bazgo thrust, a major structure which separates the mid-Miocene Indus Molasse from the Cretaceous Ladakh Batholith. It is envisaged that the fault and fold systems in the Ladakh region such as the Upshi-Bazgo thrust originated due to (1) acceleration in the northward movement of Indian plate relative to the Eurasian plate, and (2) post-collisional shortening parallel to plate convergence. On account of this, the Eocene to Miocene post-collisional sedimentary sequences, such as the Indus Molasse, rode over the now-extinct Ladakh Arc, as it acted as a rigid body, and formed a system of backthrusts, which are neotectonically active.

AB  - The expediency of transportation on the TRANS-Siberian railway is not in doubt for any of our contemporaries now, and its importance for development of Siberia and the Far East is quite obvious. However, this attitude to this transport artery was not formed immediately. Let us recall at least the fact that the Tomsk merchant class insisted that the road passed through Aleksandrovsk (now Novosibirsk). The decision of Tsar Alexander III on construction of the railway played crucial role. The built road contributed to the development of the cities through which it was laid. The situation with the decision on organization of the free movement from the mainland to Sakhalin seems to us similar to the one that was in front of laying of the line across Siberia. The issue will have to be addressed sooner or later. The laying of the highway to the island will give a powerful impetus to the social and economic development of the territories adjacent to the road and railway, which will pass through the bridge. In this article, we research specifics of climatic and hydrological factors that determine choice of type of hydraulic structures in the Nevelskogo Strait.
   The relevance of the research is dictated by the need for comprehensive review of the conditions that determine the choice of the Tatar Strait crossing line by the bridge. After taking into account the influence of geological and geomorphological factors, we turn our attention to climatic, weather and hydrological processes that will have a permanent impact on construction and operation.
   The aim of the research is to link together and analyze the data that characterize features of atmospheric and hydrosphere processes in narrow part of the Tatar Strait and conduct scientific research that will complement for engineering research and help identify based on simulation safest opening for construction of hydro-technical utilities that will connect opposite banks.
   Materials and methods. The materials for the study were cartographic materials, data of remote sensing of the Earth, information on climatic and weather conditions, data of hydrological, meteorological, Oceanographic observations, information obtained as a result of research works and engineering surveys in which the authors participated, as well as information from literary sources. Mapping in the geographic information environment allowed creating thematic maps reflecting the dynamics of hydrometeorological processes. The obtained information was used in construction of models of water circulation, formation and degradation of ice cover in the Nevelskoy Strait with the use of geoinformation technologies. The authors took a direct part in research of the leading line "Novy" in 2001. As result of the research of the features of hydrometeorological conditions within the water area of the Nevelskogo Strait and its coasts, based on satellite monitoring data, observations at nearby weather stations, as well as confirmed by information obtained during engineering surveys, it was found that in area of the Nevelskoy Strait, adverse natural phenomena should be taken into account when choosing technical design solutions for selecting type of bridge or tunnel construction from mainland to Sakhalin. The spatial and temporal distribution of radiance in the area is due to astronomical reasons, decrease in duration of the sunshine in De-Kastri and Pogibi compared to Nikolaevsk-on-Amur is associated with frequent fogs that occur during atmospheric processes on border of land and sea. Extreme values of air temperature in Pogibi were registered at the Pogibi weather station - maximum of 27,3 degrees C and a minimum of -44,0 degrees C. Index of continentality is very high (amplitude - 71,3 degrees C), which can be explained by the influence of air masses removal from mainland in winter period. The important indicator for projecting - duration of frost-free period-ranges in Pogibi from 88 to 186 days (average - 137). Daily precipitation totals during warm period reached maximum values of 88 mm in October, 81 mm in August, and 78 mm in July. Snow cover in Pogibi lasts from 153 to 216 days. Winds of >= 30 m/s occur annually in spring and autumn, sometimes exceeding 40 m/s. Fogs in described area are observed throughout year. Snowstorms in strait and on its coastal are very common. Any increase in wind in winter is accompanied by blizzard transfer of snow. Thunderstorms occur 4-5 times a year. Dust storms are rare. Horizontal water circulation in the Northern part of strait is anticyclical in winter, and cyclonic circulation is active from May to September. In general, in spring water movement speed on surface is 2-7 cm/s and in summer it decreases to 1-4 cm/s. Changes in sea level in the Tatar Strait are in the range of 3,2-4,0 m. Duration of ice period at time moderate types of winters is 201 days. Collar ice in Pogibi in late March - early April averages 160 cm and varies from 119 to 190 cm depending on type of winter. Due to the strong tidal currents, the solid ice cover in channel of the middle part of strait is formed very rarely and on short time. The result of the increased ice cover dynamics is multiple layers of young ice up to 30 cm thick. Coastals in southern part of Strait are resistant to abrasion processes and practically do not collapse. The area enclosed between liding lines Lazarev cape - cape Pogibi in the North and cape South - cape Tyk - in the South has the most favorable conditions for the construction of bridge.
   Climatic and hydrological conditions throughout have relative similarity, which allowed us distinguish it when zoning as independent unit. The performed research allows us give an advantage to leading line "Novy" (cape Nevelskogo - cape Lakh).

AB  - The global burden of cholera is increasing, with the majority (60%) of the cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. In Zambia, widespread cholera outbreaks have occurred since 1977, predominantly in the capital city of Lusaka. During both the 2016 and 2018 outbreaks, the Ministry of Health implemented cholera vaccination in addition to other preventative and control measures, to stop the spread and control the outbreak. Given the limitations in vaccine availability and the logistical support required for vaccination, oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is now recommended for use in the high risk areas ("hotspots") for cholera. Hence, the aim of this study was to identify areas with an increased risk of cholera in Zambia. Retrospective cholera case data from 2008 to 2017 was obtained from the Ministry of Health, Department of Public Health and Disease Surveillance. The Zambian Central Statistical Office provided district-level population data, socioeconomic and water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) indicators. To identify districts at high risk, we performed a discrete Poisson-based space-time scan statistic to account for variations in cholera risk across both space and time over a 10-year study period. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression model was employed to identify the district level risk factors for cholera. The risk map was generated by classifying the relative risk of cholera in each district, as obtained from the space-scan test statistic. In total, 34,950 cases of cholera were reported in Zambia between 2008 and 2017. Cholera cases varied spatially by year. During the study period, Lusaka District had the highest burden of cholera, with 29,080 reported cases. The space-time scan statistic identified 16 districts to be at a significantly higher risk of having cholera. The relative risk of having cholera in these districts was significantly higher and ranged from 1.25 to 78.87 times higher when compared to elsewhere in the country. Proximity to waterbodies was the only factor associated with the increased risk for cholera (P<0.05). This study provides a basis for the cholera elimination program in Zambia. Outside Lusaka, the majority of high risk districts identified were near the border with the DRC, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. This suggests that cholera in Zambia may be linked to movement of people from neighboring areas of cholera endemicity. A collaborative intervention program implemented in concert with neighboring countries could be an effective strategy for elimination of cholera in Zambia, while also reducing rates at a regional level.
   Author summary
   Zambia has experienced cholera outbreaks since 1977. It is a landlocked country bordered by the DRC and Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the south; all of which experience regular cholera outbreaks. The Zambian Ministry of Health included cholera vaccination, in addition to standard cholera control measures, e.g., clean water, improving sanitation and promoting hygiene to counter a cholera outbreak in 2016. The implementation of these control measures is in line with Zambia's National Cholera Eliminating Plan (NCEP) by 2025 and is also consistent with guidance by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control's (GTFCC) global roadmap to end cholera by 2030. In both plans, the identification of high risk areas known as cholera "hot-spots" is necessary to prioritize OCV deployment while also key in identifying areas where improvements are needed including surveillance systems and effective WASH improvements. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed district-level cholera data from 2008 to 2017. Sixteen of 72 districts were identified to have an increased risk of cholera using a geostatistical model. Outside of Lusaka district, which is a primary hotspot, the additional hotspot districts share borders with Zambia's neighboring countries. To achieve cholera elimination in Zambia by 2025, a regional strategy involving each of the countries bordering will be needed.

AB  - A large-scale loess landslide occurred in Xiaozhuang Village, Changjiahe Town, Tongwei County, Gansu, at approximately 11:00 am on September 14, 2019. A volume of 774 x 10(4) m(3)of a historical sliding mass was reactivated by rainfall and slipped down along a weak interface. The sliding mass accumulated in the valley of the Kushui River, blocking the channel for a distance of similar to 1000 m and destroying several roads and the Yangpo Bridge. This landslide is a typical case of rainfall-induced revival of a historical seismic landslide in the loess region of Northwest China. On the basis of site investigation, Google satellite image, unmanned aerial vehicle photography, and numerical simulation, the deformation and failure characteristics of this landslide are described in detail, and the possible inducing factors and failure mechanism are preliminarily assessed. The Tongwei earthquake in 1718 and the Haiyuan earthquake in 1920 caused the slope to slide multiple times in history. Due to continuous rainfall, the existing softened layer (previous sliding surface) was highly saturated due to the perched water on the top of the relatively impervious mudstone and formed the critical weak zone. Therefore, previous sliding mass in the lower and middle slope was reactivated along the softened layer on September 14, 2019. We suggest that the perched water mainly came from the dominant seepage channels such as sinkholes and underground rivers. In addition, sinkholes on the previous sliding body are the key factors controlling the boundary of the landslide. The movement of the landslide lasted for 12 h, and the main landslide lasted for only 60 s, with a runout distance of 60 m and an average velocity of 5 m/h. Study of the formation conditions and failure mechanism of the Changhe landslide is of great significance for the early identification and risk prevention of this kind of landslide in the loess region of Northwest China.

AB  - NP van Wyk Louw is the only Afrikaans writer whose work has been awarded the Hertzog Prize, the most prestigious Afrikaans literary prize, five times. This is an indication of his stature in the Afrikaans cultural community. Karel Schoeman called him South Africa's greatest poet and one of the few world-renowned figures the country has ever produced. The historian Hermann Giliomee believes that Louw 's equal as author ofessays on cultural politics has not been seen in this country yet.
   Nicolaas Petrus van Wyk Louw, born on 11 June 1906, was the second of four sons of Bismarck von Moltke Louw (1874-1949), a lawyer of Sutherland, and Martha Hendrina Johanna Frederika (Poppie) van WA (1882-1970). The youngest son was the poet WEG Louw (1913-1980).
   Their home language and the colloquial language was Afrikaans, but early on Louw became acquainted with English and Dutch. The Dutch Statenbijbel ("State Bible') and the Dutch hymn book were still in use in the church and in households, and his grandfather Lim Ifj/k was able to pray in almost flawless Dutch. Louw later said he remembered that, by analogy of the hymn book, he wrote two lines in very poor Dutch. Even before he was eight years old, Louw felt that what he wanted to do above all was to write poetry.
   English was the language of instruction when Louw started school in 1911. He regularly visited the town library and from his tenth year consulted the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The well-equipped libraty housed only English books, apart from WJ Conradie's Kinderbybel ("Children .'s Bible'). Louw "devoured" history books and literary works.
   In December 1920, the Louw family relocated to Cape Town. Louw attended the South African College School (SAC'S), and after finishing school he enrolled at the University of Cape Town, majoring in Latin, German, Dutch and Afrikaans. Next, he completed a master's degree in German and, after teaching for a year in the small Eastern Cape village of Steynsburg, completed a BEd degree. In 1930, Louw was appointed as a lecturer in the bilingual Faculty of Education at UCT, and in the same year he married Joan Wessels (1906-1975).
   By 1930 some of Louw 's poems had been published in the Kwartaalblad, but his first manuscript for a volume of poetry had been rejectedfbr publication by a literary critic. This criticism was such a blow to Louw 's confidence that he temporarily stopped writing poetry. When his youngest brother, Gladstone, set eyes on those poems, he realised their value. After four years, Louw started to write again. His debut poetry collection, Alleenspraak ("Monologue"), was published in 1935.
   Even before the publication of Alleenspraak, Louw, as a public intellectual, started to write more and more about matters affecting Afrikaans and the Afrikaner. From 1935, he started writing about Afrikaans authors and their national aspiration. For Louw, politics was an essential aspect of the language struggle, but for a national movement by the people it was, in his view, merely a technical means to achieve a set goal. Without the creation of a meaningful literature, the language movement and the accompanying political movement would have made no sense. His articles were collected in the volumes Berigte to velde ("Reportsfrom the field") and Lojale verset ("Loyal resistance') in 1939. The latter includes the well-known slogan that revolt is as essential to a nation as loyalty. It is not really dangerous when a rebellion fails; what is dangerous is that an entire generation might pass without protest. These two volumes had a major influence on the intellectual life of Afrikaners.
   Some of Louw's major nationalistic poems were included in his second anthology, Die halwe kring ("The half-circle"; 1937), and in his choral drama Die dieper reg ("The deeper right"; 1938), which has a nation's right to continued existence as theme. The Dutch-born HA Mulder was of the opinion that the volume Die halwe kring ranks with the major Dutch lyrical collections of poems as their equal. It was awarded the Hertzog Prize. His following works, Raka (1941) and Gestaltes en diem ("Figures and animals"; 1942), were received very well and are regarded as high points of Afrikaans poetry. Literary critics such as AP Grove highlight the spectacular development of Louws poetry since Alleenspraak. In the 1940s, he started writing his verse drama Gennanicus as well (1956; in 1960 it was awarded the Hertzog Prize) and later he also wrote several radio dramas. Since 1937, Truida Pohl had been an inspiration in his life. They were married in 1941 after his divorce from his first wife. Two children were born of this marriage: Reinet (1946) and Peter (1950).
   During the 1940s, Louw wrote numerous literary articles; he and Truida worked for Afrikaans radio, and, together with his brother Gladstone, they founded the literary journal Standpunte ("Points of view "), in which he also published articles. Although he later became an outspoken critic ofapartheid, in 1946 he pointed out the powerlessness into which Afrikaners and English speakers would sink and the danger of cultural suicide that could result if liberal principles were introduced unqualifiedly in South Africa.
   In 1948, the Rijksuniversiteit of Utrecht awarded him an honorary doctorate to acknowledge the interest in and great appreciation of the Dutch humanities for the developments in the latest Afrikaans literature, of which, the commendation read, he was the leader and symbol.
   In 1949, Louw accepted an appointment as professor in "Zuidafrikaanse taal- en letterkunde" (South African language and literature) at the Gemeentelijke Universiteit of Amsterdam. His wife and children could not leave with him, and while on his own in Amsterdam a love affair developed between him and the poet Sheila Cussons. This relationship was not always close, but for Louw it was a creative stimulus. Without Sheila Cussons many of the poems in Nuwe verse ("New poems"; 1954) and Tristia (1962) would never have been written.
   During his years in Amsterdam, he also wrote the series "Die oop gesprek" ("The open conversation"), which appeared in the popular weekly Die Huisgenoot from 20 July 1951 until 18 December 1953. Many of the essays in that magazine dealt with literary themes, the most influential of which being the series "Die Inens' agter die boek" ("The 'person 'behind the book'). They were aimed at psychologism in literary views and criticism.
   In "Kultuur en krisis" ("Culture and crisis"), he explains the crises that can befall a nation. The first is that of physical annihilation; the second, the crisis of despair. This latter crisis occurs when many members of a community feel that it is not worthwhile to continue as a group with its own language. Finally there is an ethical crisis, which entails the belief that mere survival is preferable to survival in justice.
   The articles in Die Huisgenoot and other essays were published in 1955 under the title Maskers van die ems ("Masks of earnestness') and in 1958 in three further volumes: Swaarteen ligpunte ("Centres of gravity and luminosity'), 'n Wereld deur glas ("A world through glass) and Liberale nasionalisme ("Liberal nationalism'). The first-mentioned and Die mens agter die boek (1956) formed part of the collection of critical prose and essays that earned him the Hertzog prize in 1958.
   Louw received this news in June 1958, shortly before he departed for South Africa to take up the position of head of the Department of Afrikaans and Dutch at the University of the Witwatersrand.
   In 1962, Tristia was published This title refers to a volume by the Roman poet Ovid, written during his exile. Gerrit Olivier points out what he called the unbelievably complex richness of Louws Tristia According to Grove, Tristia contains some of the most mature and profound poems in Afrikaans. His inaugural address at Wits, "Oor moeilike literatuur: die 'verwysingsmoeilikheid- ("On difficult literature: the problem of reference') in 1959 is virtually a theoretical guide to Tristia The volume was awarded the Hertzog prize for poetry in 1965. In his address of commendation at the award ceremony, TT Cloete stated that with Tristia Louw 's mastery as poet, which again and again proved to be surprising, once again took a new direction. He added that Louw remained, together with much younger poets, one of the "youngest" poets in the country.
   Cloete referred to the work of the new literary generation: the authors of the 1960s ("die Sestigers"). Louw went to great lengths to combat misconceptions about prose and innovation. His articles are contained in Vernuwing in die prosa ("Renewal in our prose"; 1961). Etienne Leroux stated that Louw s treatment of his first books was an incentive for him to continue his writing.
   In 1965, Louw stepped into the breach for another poet of the 1960s, Breyten Breytenbach. The government had refused a visa for Breyten's wife, Yolande, to visit South Africa because she was born Vietnamese. In a letter to a newspaper Louw criticised the government "as an Afrikaner", but also on behalf of the Afrikaans literature, which, he said, had its own honour and dignity. He was pained and ashamed because the Afrikaans nationalism in which he grew up and in which he hoped to die was, for him, the greatest movement in our history and a sign of growth, of an increasingly full life. Had this, he asked, turned into a petrified ideology that officials could measure with a carpenter's rule?
   Louw wrote various pieces for special occasions. The most controversial was Die pluimsaad waai ver ("The plume seeds are blown far'), which was performed during the Republic Festival in 1966. It starts with the question of what a nation is. In Pluimsaad all those who in the Anglo-Boer War participated on the side of the Free State belonged to the Free State Afrikaners. They included, apart from the Afrikaners, also English speakers, Cape rebels, Dutchmen and coloured people. The literary critic Merwe Scholtz regarded the drama as a "broad democratic definition of the Afrikaner nation". The performance elicited much criticism in 1966 in a Republic Festival speech from the Prime Minister, Dr HF Verwoerd, as well. Most of the letters to newspapers were pro-Louw, however, and some important personages came to his defence.
   On 13 November 1961, Louw had a serious heart attack and from then on suffered heart trouble. Early on the morning of 18 June 1970 he died a week after his 64th birthday and three weeks after the death of his eldest brother, Koos, to whom he was very close. Their mother, the 88-year-old Poppie, who was bedridden after a stroke, died on 28 July.
   Louw remains relevant in the literary and cultural lift of South Africa. His works remain alive in intertextual references, citations, parodies and titles, for instance in the works of Breyten Breytenbach, Sheila Cussons, Johan van Wyk and Joan Hambidge.
   After 1970, "Kultuur en krisis" was a theme in the political debate. Giliomee writes that Louw's phrases regarding continued existence in justice and loyal resistance were freely used in the public debate during the 1970s in his opinion often opportunistically. Breyten Breytenbach quoted the former phrase during his trial in 1975. Even before Breytenbach came to South Africa to establish a structure for an underground movement, certain ANC leaders informed the security police. He was arrested, and during his trial he invoked Louw in a desperate plea: "It may be paradoxical, but for me the very point was the survival of our people, survival in justice as Van Wyk Louw put it, it was about the quality and content of our civilization" [own translation]. The judge did not take any note of this.
   Afrikaners nowadays find themselves amidst the second kind of crisis that Louw distinguished: the crisis of despair, despair which is the result of emigration and Anglicisation, of the ideology of "transformation" and of the disregard for language rights by antagonistic authorities. In the discourse about this situation, Louw views on such a crisis and on the response of people of culture to that crisis gain new significance and relevancy.

TI  - OEDIPAL PACT AND SOCIAL PACT (FROM THE GRAMMAR OF DESIRE TO BRAZILIAN SHAMELESSNESS)
T2  - PSYCHOANALYSIS AND HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - In 1964, a military coup deposed President Joao Goulart, a labour representative who tried to implement basic reforms in the fiscal, administrative, university and, mainly, agrarian areas. His proposals, especially those concerning agrarian reform, were opposed by large landowners and parliamentarians with the support of conservative sectors of Brazilian society, among them businessmen and a significant part of the urban middle classes. In this period of the Cold War, marked by intense political polarization, the Brazilian military coup was supported by the United States, which feared the hegemony of Soviet socialism in Latin America, especially after the 1958 Cuban Revolution. The successive governments of the dictatorial period imposed a series of institutional acts that constrained the Constitution and guaranteed that the military stayed in power. The first, AI-1, enacted in 1964, ended direct elections; AI-2, in 1965, closed political parties, maintaining only two, the National Renovating Alliance (ARENA) and the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), the latter representing the permitted opposition that gave the government a facade of democratic legitimacy.
   Helio Pellegrino presented the first version of his article 'Oedipal Pact and Social Pact' at a psychoanalytical congress in Chile in 1966. In 1968, AI-5 was enacted. This was the most terrible of the institutional acts of the dictatorial governments, closing the National Congress, prohibiting meetings and decreeing a state of siege. AI-5 inaugurated the period known as 'the years of lead', marked by intense repression, persecution, violence, torture, disappearance, and the death of those considered to be opponents of the regime. In reaction to this, protests grew throughout Brazilian society. The 'March of the Hundred Thousand' in Rio de Janeiro in 1968, in which Pellegrino spoke as a representative of the intellectual class, was one of the most significant demonstrations. Pellegrino was also part of a group of political activists who tried to negotiate with the General in the Presidency of the Republic, Costa e Silva, for the release of political prisoners, without immediate success. In 1969 he was imprisoned for two months.
   In 1973, Pellegrino, with Kattrin Kemper, founded the Social Clinic of Psychoanalysis in Rio de Janeiro to offer psychoanalytic treatment in various formats to people who could not otherwise afford it. The clinic was a centre for psychoanalysts and artists who developed different forms of creative therapeutic interventions. In the early 1980s, at a congress at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro entitled 'Psychoanalysis and Its Insertion in the Capitalist Model', Pellegrino denounced the apoliticism of the Rio de Janeiro Psychoanalytic Society (affiliated to the International Psychoanalytic Association [IPA]) of which he was a member, as well as the presence in it of a psychiatrist, Amilcar Lobo, who in the same period served as an army doctor in the worst dungeons of the military dictatorship. Pellegrino also denounced in the mainstream press in Rio de Janeiro those he called 'Barons of Psychoanalysis', the members of IPA-affiliated societies who offered psychoanalysis only to wealthy people who could pay absurdly high fees. All this led to his expulsion from the psychoanalytic society.
   On 11 September 1983, Pellegrino published the final version of this article in Folhetim, a cultural weekly newsletter of the highly influential Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. The text, which had a profound impact on psychoanalysts and intellectuals, is written in the form of a denunciation, interweaving psychoanalysis and politics in an urgent reading of Brazilian society of the period, particularly in its transgressive and violent aspects. The intention of offering a psychoanalytically engaged account of Brazilian society to a large public may explain both its didacticism and its emphatic tone.
   Pellegrino was not afraid to mention repressive and illegal acts that had occurred during the period in which he wrote the text and which went unpunished, such as the failed attempt by the military to place a bomb on Workers' Day, in 1981, at the Riocentro Convention Centre in Rio de Janeiro; corruption involving the army and financial groups, for instance the 1982 Delfin case; attempted electoral fraud by the army with a large communications network, Rede Globo, to favour the candidate supported by the military for the Rio de Janeiro government in 1982 (known as the Proconsult case); the assassination and disappearance of a journalist, Alexandre Baumgarten, in 1982 along with the burning of files documenting a money laundering scheme involving the military government, private companies and Cruzeiro, a large-circulation magazine of Catholic origin that supported the regime; or the scandal involving the Agropecuaria Capemi, a company run by the military that traded wood and diverted millions of dollars to military agents from the National Intelligence Service.
   The article became a landmark in the political struggle against the dictatorship. Since then, it has been reprinted in collections by Brazilian psychoanalysts (Py, 1987; Rivera et al., 2018); it is widely cited and is included in academic courses. Pellegrino's reading of the Brazilian society of the period, governed dictatorially by an association between the military, savage financial capital and American interests with the support of conservative sectors of the middle classes and parts of the Catholic Church, is unfortunately of renewed relevance at the present time. Once again there is the imminent threat of a 'self-coup' by the elected president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has the support of an important part of the military, of the police, financial capital, a significant contingent of the middle classes and, in this new context, urban militias and sectors of evangelical churches. The current government operates even more intensely against Brazilian workers by removing all social protection, by ending the labour rights that have been in place since the 1930s, and by throwing the population into informal work and precarity following rigidly a neoliberal programme that promotes unemployment, 'uberization' and the profound vulnerability of Brazilian society. Today in the country there is what might be called a fascist necropolitics that promotes the extermination of thousands of Brazilians - as has been made disturbingly visible during the Covid-19 crisis. The psychoanalytic reading offered by Helio Pellegrino contributes to understanding this violent catastrophe that unceasingly assaults the social fabric.

AB  - Objective The integration of various senses with each other in the form of perceptual-motor activities can lead to the promotion of different aspects of physical, perceptual, cognitive, and psychosocial development. Decreased visual acuity in children with visual impairment makes it difficult to develop motor skills, including gross motor skills. A few studies have used perceptual-motor interventions in these children with no specific framework. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a perceptual-motor intervention based on Johnstone and Ramon's method on the gross motor skills of children with visual impairment.
   Materials & Methods In this randomized controlled trial, the study population consisted of children aged 7-10 years with visual impairment (blind or with low vision) studying in three schools of Narjes (Girls' school), Shaid Mohebbi, and Shahid Khazaeli (Boys' schools) in Tehran City, Iran in 2018 (n=140). Of these children, 24 who had met inclusion criteria were selected and randomly assigned into two intervention (n=12) and control (n=12) groups. The perceptual-motor program was designed based on Johnstone and Ramon's method and validated by a panel of experts that included four members of the Department of Occupational Therapy, the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, and one optometrist from the Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences. The intervention group received the perceptual-motor program for two months, three 45-min sessions per week (24 sessions in total). The gross motor skills of both groups were measured by the second edition of Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC-2) test (aiming/catching and balance subscales) and the second edition of Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD-2) (locomotor and object control subscales) in three stages: Pre-test, post-test, and 1-month follow-up. Data analysis was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, Friedman test, Bonferroni test, and generalized estimating equation in SPSS V. 22. The significance level was set at 0.05.
   Results The Mean +/- SD ages of children in the intervention and control groups were 9.2 +/- 1.1 and 8.3 +/- 1.2 years, respectively. The Mean +/- SD scores of aiming/catching skill in the intervention group reached from 4.17 +/- 2.82 in the Pre-test phase to 11.17 +/- 1.95 in the post-test and 10.92 +/- 1.62 in the follow-up phases. In the control group, the Mean +/- SD scores were 3.83 +/- 2.79 in the Pre-test, 4.25 +/- 3.08 in the post-test, and 4.67 +/- 2.93 in the follow-up. The Mean +/- SD scores of the balance skill increased from 6.25 +/- 2.42 in the Pre-test to 10 +/- 2.13 in the post-test and 9.92 +/- 2.19 in the follow-up phase. In the control group, the scores were 3.50 +/- 3.09) in the Pre-test, 3.83 +/- 3.46) in the post-test, and 4 +/- 3.36) in the follow-up phase. The Mean +/- SD score of the locomotor skill was 40.92 +/- 9.34 in the Pre-test, 47.58 +/- 1.17 in the post-test, and 47.42 +/- 1.08 in the follow-up phase. In the control group, these scores increased from 35.83 +/- 12.92 in the Pre-test to 36.83 +/- 13.17 and 37.67 +/- 13.24 in the post-test and follow-up phases, respectively. The Mean +/- SD scores of object control skill increased from 32.50 +/- 14.74 in the Pre-test to 47.50 +/- 1.24 in the post-test and 47.66 +/- 1.15 in the follow-up, while in the control group, the scores were 29.25 +/- 12.93 in the Pre-test, and 30.17 +/- 12.89 and 30.08 +/- 13.34 in the post-test and follow-up phases. The aiming/catching, balance, and object control skills of children were significantly improved after the intervention (P<0.05), and continued after one month. In contrast, the locomotor skill was not improved after the intervention (P>0.05).
   Conclusion The perceptual-motor interventional program can be useful in promoting the gross motor skills of children with visual impairment. It is suggested that this program be used in other studies on visually-impaired children.

AB  - Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64 years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations. Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150 minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant. Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6% were women. No significant differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5 points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.
   Background: Tourism represents 45% gross domestic product in Balearic Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication, poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10 semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS: 1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7 years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7). HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2% (IC 95% 65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9% (IC 95% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands; 55.3% (IC 95% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6% and 35.1% self-reported regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker than women from the same social class do.
   Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51%), repetitive and having a severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost. Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection. Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge, improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least 20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months. In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults: Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There was a 63.5% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion: Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV in primary care.
   Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented. Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results: First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000 unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population. Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics, drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge.
   Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort included 561 patients, women were 56%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03) years and 31.5% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were 54%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV, saturation of oxygen lower than 90% or an increase in the dyspnoea at the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart failure decompensation.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial: qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data. Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31 CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate, compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and 11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We identified the constructs that explain the variation in the effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut), Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes: Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5%) were lost to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to reduce BZD prescription in primary care.
   Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP) frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP, proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of 2733 (11%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7% for 14 intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED. Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93%, in 6% of the cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention. More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn.
   Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll. Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical, psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy) through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial, conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona. Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188, PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10 hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity. Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369 enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0%) provided data at the three months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2%) at 12 months. Mean age of study subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2% were women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at work.
   Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need. This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice. The stability of policies for community participation in primary healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of exclusion whereby so-called 'hard to reach' groups are not adequately involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice. This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community participation in primary healthcare, for all.
   Background: Community participation is essential for effective implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete collaboration and communication between communities and other parties involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods: Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers, collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers, champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members, patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion: Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal, synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating findings into appropriate actions.
   Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial, implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones. Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension, socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population, albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate and culturally adapt decision aids.
   What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care, Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms, the value is the perception that people have about clinical effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response, we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model: 1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5. Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6. Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality of community life, political systems require economic, housing, education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health. 2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their actions to the social reality of each territory.
   Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results: Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old increased by 70% vs. a 2% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region. Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19% in Borgholm vs. 9% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital care episodes decreased 7% in Borgholm vs. 13% increase for the rest of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8% in Borgholm vs. 21% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75 years old decreased 4% in Borgholm vs. a 10% increase for the rest of Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural Swedish jurisdiction.
   Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a critical role for early identification and care of patients with dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from 20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450 (3.5%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over 65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3%) followed by vascular dementia 27.11%. The average age of respondents in the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50% patients under the age of 79 years, 65.6% were female and 68.4% were with elementary school. In the entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3%) said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor was hypertension (85.1%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic attacks (29.3%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4% of patients had high levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8%) acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77 (17.1%) memantine, while 247 (54.9%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4%) reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the majority of these patients (more than 50%) the reason for not receiving therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6%). Conclusion: This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare needs people with dementia.
   Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills is certain. Research question: 'What is the emotional experience of second and third-year medical students during their first clinical internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12 students in their second or third year of medical training at the University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often ignored and was not taken into account in the development of professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher. Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion: Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive internships and tutoring); and training supervisors.
   Background: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce the risk for stroke and death from all causes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Research question: To explore adherence rates to OAC among patients with NVAF and to compare head-to-head adherence rate of different medications in long-term chronic use. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study Clalit Health Services, Israel. All patients, 30 years and over, with a diagnosis of NVAF before 2016 and were treated with OAC were included. We included patients that filled at least one prescription per year in the three consecutive years 2016-2018. We analysed all prescriptions that were filled for the medications from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. We considered purchasing of at least nine monthly prescriptions during 2017 as 'good medication adherence.' Results: Twenty-six thousand and twenty-nine patients with NVAF who were treated with OAC were identified. Ten thousand and two hundred and eighty-four (39.5%) were treated with apixaban, 6321 (24.3%) were treated with warfarin, 6290 (24.1%) were treated with rivaroxaban 3134 (12.0%) were treated with dabigatran. Rates of good medication adherence were 88.9% for rivaroxaban, 84.9% for apixaban, 83.6% for dabigatran and 55.8% for warfarin (p<.0001). Good adherence with OAC was associated with lower LDL cholesterol and glucose levels. Advanced age was associated with higher adherence rates (p<.001). SES was not associated with medication adherence. Conclusion: Adherence rates to DOAC among patients with NVAF are high and are higher than the adherence rate to warfarin. It should be taken into consideration when choosing OAC treatment for NVAF.
   Background: In France, cervical cancer screening by pap-smears should be conducted triennially. Screening statistics are based on the number of cytology examinations of smears reimbursed by the Health Insurance appearing in the claim databases. The percentage of screened women is lower based on these data than on declarative surveys. If surveys are overestimating the number of screened women, it is likely that claim databases underestimate it. Research question: The primary objective was to determine the underestimation of screened women in claim databases. The secondary purpose was to estimate the proportion of female patients not reachable by their GP for a cervical cancer screening in an organized screening trial. Methods: The population was the 6327 female patients aged 30-65 years of the 24 GP investigators of the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial. We compared the lists of their female patients that had no cytology of Pap test reimbursed during the three prior years, extracted from the Health Insurance claim databases in 2015 and 2018. We selected the patients appearing on both lists meaning they had not responded to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the trial. We searched in the GPs' records valid reasons not to be screened (hysterectomy, history of cervical lesion, pregnancy, other conditions making screening irrelevant) or evidence of screening. Results: The total number of 'unscreened' women in 2018 was 2731, 1737 patients appeared on both lists, 1522 could be included for analysing, 65 had been screened, 95 had hysterectomy, three had a history of cervical lesion, nine were pregnant and 10 had other conditions making screening irrelevant, 166 patients were lost to view. Conclusion: Based on GPs' records, health insurance claim databases underestimate the number of screened women by 7.6%. The percentage of patients not responding to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial is 24.18%.
   Background: Over the past decade, the amount of digital data created by humans with or without connected tools has grown exponentially. The field of primary care (PC) did not escape this digitization, nor the use of Big Data algorithms. To evaluate the results of Big Data research in PC it seemed useful to identify which algorithms are used. Research question: What are the algorithms used for Big Data research in PC research and how are they described? Methods: Systematic review of the literature according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guide. A search equation using the following MeSH terms 'big data, data mining, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks Natural Language Processing, general practice, electronic health records, health records' has been applied to the PUBMED database. After a selection of the titles and article summaries according to the inclusion criteria, the full versions of the eligible articles were read and analysed. Referenced articles of the sources articles were added to the analysis. The algorithms described in the articles were extracted and analysed. Results: In total, 778 articles were identified, 169 were eligible for full reading and 26 articles were finally selected. The algorithms listed in the articles are poorly described. The description is usually limited to a general explanation about how the algorithm works. Seven articles gave a partial description of the algorithm; a logic diagram was given in four articles and the codes in only two. Actually, only one article fully describes the algorithm with its mathematical description, its code and its logic diagram. Conclusion: Big Data algorithms in PC are not satisfactorily described. The lack of reproducibility is not compatible with a consistent scientific approach. Researchers should provide more information about the way they extract and analyse their data to give their readers more confidence in Big Data.
   Background: As a collaborative project of the Family Practice Depression and Multimorbidity group of European General Practice Research Network, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scale was identified as valid, reproducible, effective and easy to use. Subsequently, it has been translated and adapted to 13 languages, including Castilian. Currently, the scale is being validated in different languages. Research question: What are the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of HSCL-25 (HSCL-25e) for depression detection in Primary Care? Methods: HSCL-25e was administered to outpatients recruited by their physicians in six health centres involved in Spanish EIRA3 study, a trial to promote healthy behaviours in people aged from 45 to 75. Patients complimented HSCL-25 themselves. Sample size was calculated with R package (pROC). Statistical analysis: responsiveness was analysed with missing data and detecting ceiling and floor effects for the items. Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to determine the dimensions of HSCL-25e. Item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha (global and dimensions coefficient) and squared multiple correlation were carried out to calculate internal consistency. Results: Seven hundred and sixty-nine patients out of 806 complimented HSCL-25e, 738 answered to all of the items. No patterns of missing answers were found. No ceiling effects, expected floor effect in item 18. Item 17 was the most consistent one and item 24 was the lower one. All items showed positive discrimination index for both cut-off points (1.55 and 1.75). PCA indicated two factors; 13 items corresponding to depression dimension and the other 12 items corresponding to anxiety subscale. Global Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 (0.88 calculated for depression dimension and 0.84 for anxiety dimension). Conclusion: The HSCL-25e has excellent psychometric properties when applied to Primary Care population. It has two dimensions as the original version, although the items included are not exactly the same. There are more item coincidences with the French version.
   Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first mortality cause worldwide with 17.5 million death in 2012. Spices (Scaling-up Packages of Interventions for CVD prevention in selected sites in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa) gathered five countries around CVD primary prevention interventions, especially for populations with low access to prevention and health care system. In France, a rural area where people were more deprived and with a low settlement of general practitioners (GPs) fitted with the project. Research question: What are the barriers and the facilitators for cardiovascular primary prevention implementation from caregivers and patients' point of view of a deprived rural area? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until theoretical saturation of data. Purposive samplings of GPs, patients, patients' families, nurses and pharmacists were designed. Five interview guides explored cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular health promotion in the setting, actors of CVD prevention, capacities for CVD prevention, patients' and healthcare professionals' representations, barriers and facilitators in implementing CVD prevention, possible solutions. Guides were adapted concurrently to the analysis. A blinded thematic analysis and a mind-mapping were achieved for each group. Results: Thirteen GPS, 11 pharmacists', 14 nurses, 12 patients' and 12 patients' family members' interviews were achieved. Professionals highlighted a disconnection between them and national prevention programs, lack of time, payment and training for CVD prevention. Countryside was either protective or aggressive regarding CVD risk balancing gardening and space against isolation and lack of structures. GPs had poor connections with the community. Patients described their recklessness and feeling of invulnerability until their CVD appeared. Families could be a barrier to CVD prevention and lifestyle change. Risky behaviours were handed down from one generation to another. Conclusion: Innovative interventions for Spices should focus on these community specificities and individual behavioural strategies in contrast with the six national plans addressing CVD in France. These plans solely concentrate on dissemination of prevention messages and knowledge, which is of little use according to this survey.
