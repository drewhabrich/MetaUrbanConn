AB  - Functional connectivity is essential for the long-term persistence of populations. However, many studies assess connectivity with a focus on structural connectivity only. Cityscapes, namely urban landscapes, are particularly dynamic and include numerous potential anthropogenic barriers to animal movements, such as roads, traffic or buildings. To assess and compare structural connectivity of habitats and functional connectivity of gene flow of an urban lizard, we here combined species distribution models (SDMs) with an individual-based landscape genetic optimization procedure. The most important environmental factors of the SDMs are structural diversity and substrate type, with high and medium levels of structural diversity as well as open and rocky/gravel substrates contributing most to structural connectivity. By contrast, water cover was the best model of all environmental factors following landscape genetic optimization. The river is thus a major barrier to gene flow, while of the typical anthropogenic factors only buildings showed an effect. Nonetheless, using SDMs as a basis for landscape genetic optimization provided the highest ranked model for functional connectivity. Optimizing SDMs in this way can provide a sound basis for models of gene flow of the cityscape, and elsewhere, while presence-only and presence-absence modelling approaches showed differences in performance. Additionally, interpretation of results based on SDM factor importance can be misleading, dictating more thorough analyses following optimization of SDMs. Such approaches can be adopted for management strategies, for example aiming to connect native common wall lizard populations or disconnect them from non-native introduced populations, which are currently spreading in many cities in Central Europe.

AB  - Understanding the factors contributing to maintaining biodiversity is crucial to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic disturbances. Representing large proportions of green area in highly modified landscapes, residential gardens are often seen as local habitats that can contribute to larger networks of suitable environments at the landscape scale.
   We investigated the impact of the landscape context on butterfly communities observed in residential gardens, taking into account garden characteristics, land-use types and presence of linear features in the surrounding landscape. We examined how species traits affected butterflies' response to landscape context and habitat quality.
   We performed a cross-scale study, based on citizen science data documenting butterfly species composition and abundance in 920 gardens across France. We examined the effect of garden quality, the area of different land-use types and the length of linear elements measured at three scales within the surrounding landscape. Species were grouped according to their habitat preference and mobility.
   Urbanization negatively affected total species richness and the abundance of butterfly in each group. This was related to declining habitat quality and reduced area of suitable habitat in the surrounding landscape. The magnitude of this effect, however, was negatively correlated with mobility, a trait related to habitat preference. The spatial scale at which landscape context best explained variation in butterfly abundance changed with species' habitat preference.
   This study highlights the importance of preserving high quality habitats in altered landscapes and considering species' mobility and habitat preference when assessing the impact of landscapes on butterfly communities.

AB  - Urbanisation is a leading process on the Globe causing a massive loss of natural habitats. In parallel variety of habitats were created in urban environments, which may also support species diversity. Our aim was to identify urban green areas and their connections with the Regional Ecological Network surrounding the city of Debrecen (East-Hungary), and to explore the biodiversity potential of the network of these parks. We found that whilst industrial areas, airport and mixed land covered a relatively large area, parks and other functional green spaces had a relatively small extent. However the green space system of the city is well connected to the Regional Ecological Network. We also surveyed the functional and potential green spaces in the city and in the studied patches of the Regional Ecological Network in and around the city. We found that 65% of the functional green spaces are potentially connected thus there is a possibility for species typical to semi-natural open habitats to disperse between the green spaces of the city. Based on the survey of the spontaneous flora and planted ornamentals we found that the ratio of native species was high in the studied urban parks. We found that native species were the most typical (>50%) in the spontaneous flora of the studied urban parks, although the ratio of archaeophytes and neophytes were also high. Among ornamental plants, both the proportion of native species and neophytes were considerable in each park, and the proportion of archaeophytes was low. Our results suggest that the studied urban habitats have some biodiversity conservation potential; they mostly harbour species which can cope with the local environmental conditions of the city parks, such as increased temperature, drought and nutrient enrichment.

AB  - Ponds are important elements of green areas in cities that help counteract the negative consequences of urbanization, by providing important habitats for biodiversity in cities and being essential nodes in the overall landscape-scale habitat network. However, there is relatively little knowledge about the impacts of pond management intensity, function and environmental variables on urban pond biodiversity. In this study we addressed this gap by investigating which factors were correlated with the level of biodiversity in urban ponds, indicated by species richness of aquatic insects, in Stockholm, Sweden. Our study did not confirm any direct link between the perceived intensity of management or function of ponds and overall biodiversity. However, it seems that management can influence particular groups of species indirectly, since we found that Trichoptera richness (Caddisflies) was highest at intermediate management intensity. We suggest that this is caused by management of vegetation, as the amount of floating and emergent vegetation was significantly correlated with both the overall species richness and the richness of Trichoptera (Caddisflies). This relationship was non-linear, since ponds with an intermediate coverage of vegetation had the highest richness. Interestingly, the amount of vegetation in the pond was significantly affected by pond function and pond management. The overall species richness and richness of Trichoptera were also positively correlated with pond size. Since we found that the pattern of relations between species richness and environmental variables differed between the insect groups we suggest that it will be difficult to provide overall design and management recommendations for ponds in urban green areas. Therefore, it is recommended that to provide high aquatic diversity of species in urban areas one should aim at promoting high diversity of different types of ponds with differing management and environmental factors that shape them.

AB  - Private gardens provide vital opportunities for people to interact with nature. The most popular form of interaction is through garden bird feeding. Understanding how landscape features and seasons determine patterns of movement of feeder-using songbirds is key to maximising the well-being benefits they provide. To determine these patterns we established three networks of automated data loggers along a gradient of greenspace fragmentation. Over a 12-month period we tracked 452 tagged blue tits Cyantistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major moving between feeder pairs 9,848 times, to address two questions: (i) Do urban features within different forms, and season, influence structural (presence-absence of connections between feeders by birds) and functional (frequency of these connections) connectivity? (ii) Are there general patterns of structural and functional connectivity across forms? Vegetation cover increased connectivity in all three networks, whereas the presence of road gaps negatively affected functional but not structural connectivity. Across networks structural connectivity was lowest in the summer when birds maintain breeding territories, however patterns of functional connectivity appeared to vary with habitat fragmentation. Using empirical data this study shows how key urban features and season influence movement of feeder-using songbirds, and we provide evidence that this is related to greenspace fragmentation.

AB  - Urbanization affects amphibian communities through habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat quality. The effects of these changes in habitat at different scales vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. We assessed the breeding distribution of anurans along an urban-rural gradient in Shanghai, China, a region experiencing intensive urbanization. Our results showed that urban density had a significantly negative influence on the overall anuran abundance and diversity and that the responses of individual species to urbanization varied. Pond age was an overall predictor in models describing the responses of Pelophylax nigromaculatus, Fejervarya multistriata, and M. fissipes and total anuran abundance. The quality of habitat at a pond was also important, and the high abundance of Bufo gargarizans and Pelophy lax plancyi was associated with ponds with aquatic vegetation coverage. Urban density showed strong negative effects on B. gargarizans, total anuran abundance, and species richness. The broad-scale landscape variables associated with forests, agricultural fields, and wetlands surrounding breeding ponds have been shown to affect anuran abundance and species richness. The response of individual species, total abundance, and species richness to urbanization reflected differences in their ecological requirements. We quantified the effects of urbanization on frogs in a rapidly urbanizing region, and our results demonstrated that both multi-spatial and temporal variables affect anurans in Shanghai. Our results emphasized the importance of anuran conservation planning in urbanized areas to preserve and/or restore terrestrial habitat and to improve connectivity between ponds and other wetlands.

AB  - The impacts of urban growth on biodiversity vary according to the form and the intensity of urbanisation. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the consequences of the type of urban structure (e.g. mono centric vs polycentric), the shape of urban boundaries, the local density of residential development, on the habitats of wildlife species. In this context, this paper focuses on the relationship between forms of urbanisation and functional connectivity of ecological habitats. In the urban region of Besancon (eastern France), three emblematic protected species were selected to represent forest mammals. From the initial state describing current land cover, five prospective residential development scenarios were simulated, corresponding to the form currently most commonly found (e.g. compact development, transit-oriented development, polycentric development). For each scenario, we also simulate the volume of traffic on the road network to allow for the barrier effect of roads on habitat connectivity. Then, for each development scenario, we model the functional connectivity of habitats of the various target species using landscape graphs. Results show that compact city maintains more functional connectivity for all the species considered whereas urban sprawl leads to much more marked impacts. Moderately compact and regulated periurban scenarios have intermediate levels of impact. The transit-oriented development scenario produces specific impact values according to the species. An interesting point is that the decline in functional connectivity of forest habitats is more due to increased traffic than residential development proper. This outlines the relevance of integrated models for simulating both land use and transport at a fine scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetation corridors, such as street trees in urban areas, which connect patchy woodland and mitigate habitat isolation, are expected to enhance the persistence of birds in urban landscapes. However, the effectiveness of urban corridors on birds remains equivocal because vegetation corridor is often managed for human use with little consideration of wildlife. Here we compared the effects of three major corridors of varying vegetation structures (trees with a dense understory, trees with a sparse understory, and grassy areas with sparse trees) on the species richness and abundance of birds in 21 wooded patches in the center of Tokyo, Japan, during wintering and breeding seasons. Using generalized linear models and Akaike's information criterion, we found that the effectiveness of corridors depended on the tolerance of birds to urbanization. Urban avoider species, having low tolerance to urbanization, demonstrated lower species richness and abundance in patches close to the corridor with a sparsely vegetated understory as compared with patches close to the understory-richer corridors during winter, although such an effect disappeared during the breeding season. The corridors did not have a significant effect on suburban adapter species with a high tolerance to urbanization. Our results suggest that corridors with scarce understory vegetation may limit the persistence of birds avoiding urban areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanisation development influences surrounding landscape processes, which are reflected by landscape structural patterns. Forest areas are often regarded as a spatial reserve for present and future urbanisation needs, while at the same time they often represent the last remnant of natural environment. In the present research we analysed (1) the change in forest cover in the area of suburban forests of Ljubljana between 1975 and 2012, (2) the connectivity and conservation buffers as one of the foundations for the assessment of biodiversity functions. Between 1975 and 2012, all the forests with important cores were subject to clearings for settlement- and agricultural purposes, but clearing usually did not extend beyond forest edges. The real fragmentation occurred during the construction of the highway beltline.
   In the area of Ljubljana, connectivity changes and connectivity loss in two different time periods are presented by a spatial model based on the Graph Theory which can also be used in spatial planning.
   Due to the high percentage of forest cover and the favourable distribution of forest patches and cores around the city of Ljubljana, no connection is currently in danger; the weakest link is stretching from the centre of Ljubljana towards the southeast.
   In the process of evaluating the biodiversity of urban forests, it will be necessary to add connectivity among forest cores as an important index while evaluating the favourable conditions of different habitat types. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban expansion and human migration from rural to urban locations have complex relationships with environmental change. Habitat fragmentation, loss of biodiversity and vegetation changes are some of the most common impacts of urbanisation. In many Indian cities, the urban core is characterised by historical human settlements with narrow lanes and packed commercial establishments, while urbanisation that occurred after 1970s preferred spacing between the dwellings with more greenery or urban forestry. As urbanisation progresses, the urban fringes have more scope for incorporating environmental concerns and conservation. In this study, we measured species richness and abundance of birds within varied urban habitats and landscapes along the urban-rural gradient in Tiruchirappalli, India. We also tried to determine the linkage between bird diversity and landscape attributes including anthropogenic factors. Our observations showed that within urban areas, certain landscapes favoured species richness while many habitats are unfriendly for species but encouraged homogenisation. As we move from urban core towards rural gradient, the species richness increased; however, it is not uniform in all peripheral directions. Interestingly, the urban fringes at certain pockets had richness equivalent to rural locations. Species richness positively correlated with vegetation cover while built cover, noise, vehicular movement and pedestrians had negative impacts. As the urban fringes are in various stages of development, they have more scope for integrating ecological and biodiversity considerations and in this aspect wetlands, riverine farmlands and urban forests may play a crucial role in retaining native birds and also supporting migratory bird species.

AB  - During the 20th century, a variety of concepts were developed aimed to provide frameworks for green space planning and design in urban areas. Both China and Scandinavia represent important experience in green space planning and management. However, none of the current concepts is generated based on the explicit combination of both a Western and Eastern context. In this paper, based on the analysis of various green space planning concepts and their development, a novel "hybrid' approach is introduced. This "Green Network' concept focuses on green and blue connectivity in urban areas and comprises the network of green spaces and the surface water system within and around settlements. The concept offers a platform for integrating best practices from Scandinavian and Chinese open space planning and can provide a guiding tool for sustainable urban development.

AB  - Trees in urban landscapes provide a range of ecosystem services, including habitat, refugia, food, and corridors for other fauna and flora. However, there is some debate whether the richness and abundance of other biodiversity supported is influenced by the provenance of trees, i.e., native or non-native. This study assessed the presence of mistletoes and birds (and nests) in 1261 street trees. There were marked differences between native and non-native street trees, with the former having a significantly higher prevalence of birds (and nests) and supporting more species and in greater densities, whilst the latter supported a higher prevalence of mistletoes. Additionally, for birds, the proximity to green space, tree size and species were also important, whilst for mistletoes, the proximity to green space, slope aspect, and tree species were significant. Preference ratios indicated that some tree species had a higher than random occurrence of birds or mistletoes, whilst others had a low abundance. The indigenous tree species, Acacia karroo Hayne was the only reasonably abundant street tree species that was important for birds, nests, and mistletoes. At the street scale, there was a positive relationship between street tree species richness and bird species richness. These results emphasise the importance of selecting appropriate tree species if biodiversity conservation is a core outcome.

AB  - The urban matrix was recently shown to be a mosaic of heterogeneous dispersal habitats. We conducted a playback experiment of mobbing calls to examine the probabilities of forest birds to cross a distance of 50 m over urban matrix with different land-cover types in an urban area. We treated the reciprocal of the crossing probabilities as a movement resistance for forest birds. We drew resistance surfaces based on the land-cover maps of urban Sapporo. We applied a circuit theory to examine the relative role of a detour route consisting of a riparian corridor and urban matrix for dispersing forest bird individuals from continuous forest to an isolated green space in the midst of an urban area. Our results showed that wood cover had the highest crossing probability, while open land (grassland and pavement) had the lowest probabilities. Buildings and water surface displayed an intermediate probability. Resistance surfaces and flow maps at 25- and 50-m resolutions were very similar and suggested that dispersing individuals are likely to use the intervening building areas that dominate the urban matrix rather than detour through riparian corridors. Our results showed the useful combination of experimental approaches and circuit theory, and the importance of the spatial configuration of corridors, as well as the composition and management of dispersal habitats, to landscape connectivity.

AB  - 1. Urbanisation and agricultural intensification cause the replacement of natural ecosystems but might also create novel habitats in urban and rural ecosystems promoting some insect communities by providing food and nesting resources.
   2. This study investigated how host natural enemy communities change in urban and rural landscapes and their transitional zone, the urban rural interface, by using trap nests for cavity-nesting Hymenoptera in gardens and rapeseed fields that were either isolated or paired in the urban rural interface.
   3. Host dynamics were important for natural enemy occurrence, species richness and parasitism rates, and landscape effects were evident for natural enemy variables except for the richness of bee natural enemies. The number of parasitised brood cells was at its highest in the urban rural interface, but the highest parasitism rates of bees were observed in isolated gardens. Parasitism rates of bees were negatively affected by host abundance, while parasitism rates of wasps were positively affected.
   4. Higher specialisation and lower connectivity of host natural enemy interactions were found in paired habitats than in isolated habitats. This indicates that paired habitats comprise more specific natural enemies and vulnerable interactions, while isolated habitats comprise more generalist natural enemies, and thus interactions appear more stable.
   5. These results confirm that host dynamics play an essential role in the abundance and richness of natural enemies and drive parasitism. However, high habitat heterogeneity found in the urban rural interface can also have an effect on host natural enemy communities. This highlights that the provisioning of resources in the urban rural interface can benefit insect communities in these areas.

AB  - Urban-rural landscape planning research is nowadays focusing on strategies and tools that support practitioners to design local areas where human and natural pressures interfere. A prominent framework is provided by ecological network studies, whose design regards the combination of a set of green areas and patches (nodes) interconnected through environmental corridors (edges). Ecological networks are key for biodiversity protection and enhancement, as they are able to counteract fragmentation, and to create and strengthen relations and exchanges among otherwise isolated elements. Biodiversity evolution, indeed, depends on the quantity and quality of spatial cohesion of natural areas. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework based on network modelling for the study and modelling of ecological networks. We use network properties and centrality measures (degree, clustering coefficient, and betweenness centrality) and take into account the intensity of the dispersal capacity by introducing the corresponding weighted centrality measures. We simulate the dynamics of ecological networks by monitoring the residual dispersal capacity and the number of connected components from three perspectives: random attacks, deterministic attacks according to decreasing betweenness centrality and influence of master plans. We demonstrate that spatial network analysis is useful to monitor the performance of ecological networks and support decision-making, management, and planning.
   The proposed methodology is applied to the case study of the pen-urban and urban areas of the town of Nuoro (Italy). Patches (nodes) have been selected among the ecosystems with target vegetal species Holm oak and cultivated and wild Olive while the connecting corridors (links) enable for seed dispersal.

AB  - The history of the landscape directly affects biotic assemblages, resulting in time lags in species response to disturbances. In highly fragmented environments, this phenomenon often causes extinction debts. However, few studies have been carried out in urban settings.
   To determine if there are time lags in the response of temperate natural grasslands to urbanization. Does it differ for indigenous species and for species indicative of disturbance and between woody and open grasslands? Do these time lags change over time? What are the potential landscape factors driving these changes? What are the corresponding vegetation changes?
   In 1995 and 2012 vegetation sampling was carried out in 43 urban grassland sites. We calculated six urbanization and landscape measures in a 500 m buffer area surrounding each site for 1938, 1961, 1970, 1994, 1999, 2006, and 2010. We used generalized linear models and model selection to determine which time period best predicted the contemporary species richness patterns.
   Woody grasslands showed time lags of 20-40 years. Contemporary open grassland communities were, generally, associated with more contemporary landscapes. Altitude and road network density of natural areas were the most frequent predictors of species richness. The importance of the predictors changed between the different models. Species richness, specifically, indigenous herbaceous species, declined from 1995 to 2012.
   The history of urbanization affects contemporary urban vegetation assemblages. This indicates potential extinction debts, which have important consequences for biodiversity conservation planning and sustainable future scenarios.

AB  - Estimating the abundance or density of populations is fundamental to the conservation and management of species, and as landscapes become more fragmented, maintaining landscape connectivity has become one of the most important challenges for biodiversity conservation. Yet these two issues have never been formally integrated together in a model that simultaneously models abundance while accounting for connectivity of a landscape. We demonstrate an application of using capture-recapture to develop a model of animal density using a least-cost path model for individual encounter probability that accounts for non-Euclidean connectivity in a highly structured network. We utilized scat detection dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a means of collecting non-invasive genetic samples of American mink (Neovison vison) individuals and used spatial capture-recapture models (SCR) to gain inferences about mink population density and connectivity. Density of mink was not constant across the landscape, but rather increased with increasing distance from city, town, or village centers, and mink activity was associated with water. The SCR model allowed us to estimate the density and spatial distribution of individuals across a 388 km(2) area. The model was used to investigate patterns of space usage and to evaluate covariate effects on encounter probabilities, including differences between sexes. This study provides an application of capture-recapture models based on ecological distance, allowing us to directly estimate landscape connectivity. This approach should be widely applicable to provide simultaneous direct estimates of density, space usage, and landscape connectivity for many species.

AB  - Understanding the factors that influence the characteristics of avian communities using urban parks at both the patch and landscape level is important to focus management effort towards enhancing bird diversity. Here, we investigated this issue during the breeding season across urban parks in Beijing, China, using high-resolution satellite imagery. Fifty-two bird species were recorded across 29 parks. Analysis of residence type of birds showed that passengers were the most prevalent (37%), indicating that Beijing is a major node in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Park size was crucial for total species abundance, but foliage height diversity was the most important factor influencing avian species diversity. Thus, optimizing the configuration of vertical vegetation structure in certain park areas is critical for supporting avian communities in urban parks. Human visitation also showed negative impact on species diversity. At the landscape level, the percentage of artificial surface and largest patch index of woodland in the buffer region significantly affected total species richness, with insectivores and granivores being more sensitive to the landscape pattern of the buffer region. In conclusion, urban birds in Beijing are influenced by various multi-scale factors; however, these effects vary with different feeding types.

AB  - Under climate change many species may need to shift polewards to track suitable bioclimatic conditions. This movement is likely to be impeded by intensively modified landscapes, but little is known in practice about how species undergo range expansion in these conditions. Using biological record data, this paper explores the occurrence of five butterfly species undertaking range expansion in the UK through an urbanised landscape to better understand the pathways' or landscape features used to expand their distributions. The findings demonstrate that the two most adaptable species were able to navigate well through the urban matrix. Significantly, the remaining three species used more rural pathways, with two using stepping stones of habitat patches and landscape corridors and the final, most specialised species using near-connected chains of woodland habitat. These findings emphasise the importance of retaining corridors of open land around hostile matrices and in this instance, a planning designation Green Belt' proved to be particularly effective in providing broad pathways of open land for range expansion through a heavily urbanised landscape.

AB  - Urban landscapes are characterized by an urban matrix often unfavorable for biodiversity, interspersed with remnant corridors such as riparian areas. Those are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. We investigated the effect of the two components, matrix versus corridor, by comparing the riparian plant diversity and the community-level ecological traits along an urbanization gradient. Species distribution was surveyed at a local-scale along an urban riparian corridor in Strasbourg, eastern France. Ninety plots were sampled along an urbanization gradient. Several plant metrics were measured using both plant richness (R) and mean ecological trait values of species weighted by their abundance (CWM). The surroundings of each plot were first described by selecting representative variables of matrix and corridor. Secondly, the distribution of plant species according to a given i ecological trait was analyzed in relation with different levels of urbanization. Using mixed effects models, we verified whether matrix or corridor variables best explain the distribution of traits. Three levels of urbanization were detected, termed urban, suburban and pen-urban, based on landscape composition. Neither the pen-urban nor the suburban level affected plant metrics. At the urban level, and whatever indicator value was considered, the CWMi metrics clearly decreased, whereas species richness Ri increased. The upstream distance to the nearest natural area and tree cover were the most influential variables on CWMi metrics, whereas Ri metrics were mainly driven by built component and landscape heterogeneity. Matrix variables were more important in explaining Ri metrics while corridor features affected CWMi metrics. These results highlight the preponderance of the corridor effect on plant ecological types and the importance of the matrix on the selection and/or the implantation of novel species. Thus, the urbanization gradient may operate simultaneously on the abundance of local species and impose the recruitment of new co-existing species. This study suggests that ecological type responds to the urbanization gradient and may be an alternative tool to understand plant distribution rather than plant diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - AimDisturbance and connectivity shape the structure and spatial distribution of animal populations in all ecosystems, but the combined effects of these factors are rarely measured in coastal seascapes. We used surf zones of exposed sandy beaches in eastern Australia as a model seascape to test for combined effects of coastal urbanization and seascape connectivity (i.e. spatial links between surf zones, estuaries and rocky headlands) on fish assemblages.
   LocationFour hundred kilometres of exposed surf beaches along the eastern coastline of Australia.
   MethodsFish assemblages were surveyed from surf zones of 14 ocean-exposed sandy beaches using purpose-built surf baited remote underwater video stations.
   ResultsThe degree of coastal urbanization and connectivity were strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of fish species richness and abundance and were of greater importance to surf fishes than local surf conditions. Urbanization was associated with reductions in the abundance of harvested piscivores and fish species richness. Piscivore abundance and species richness were lowest on highly urbanized coastlines, and adjacent to beaches in wilderness areas where recreational fishing is intense. By contrast, seascape connectivity was correlated with the spatial distribution of omnivore and planktivore abundance. Spatial linkages between surf zones and estuaries were also important to two globally threatened guitarfish that are of international conservation significance.
   Main conclusionsWe show for the first time how vulnerable and iconic fish species in surf zones are affected by the presence of coastal cities and the attributes of seascapes in which these cities are embedded. It is possible that greater connectivity may lessen urbanization' impacts for species with broad diets and strong ecological links to other ecosystems - this offers new perspectives in coastal conservation, for fishes and beyond.

AB  - The extreme fragmentation of natural habitats due to urbanisation can influence the evolution of dispersal strategies in species persisting in cities. The brown garden snail Cornu aspersum is an anthropophilic species, capable of maintaining its populations in highly fragmented habitats despite a high cost of movement. In this species, we studied the variation of dispersal-related behaviours and traits along an urbanisation gradient characterised at two biologically relevant spatial scales (10 and 50 m), in order to identify the effects of habitat fragmentation on movement. The olfactory perceptual range was low, between 1 and 2.5 m, meaning that snails should perceive a large range of landscapes as fragmented. In line with previous results, subadults were more prone to explore than adults in the least urbanised populations. The boundary-crossing behaviour of subadults was not affected by urbanisation, while exploration propensity of adult snails increased with urbanisation at the 50 m (long-distance dispersal) scale, to reach subadult levels in more urban sites. Foot mass (a correlate of movement speed) and perceptual range were not affected by urbanisation. These results are interpreted in relation to the different levels of competition snails are likely to experience in different environments, the high risk of local extinction in urban fragmented landscapes, and the available opportunities for reproduction. They indicate that benefits of dispersal still need to be considered even in situations where movement costs are extremely important. The maintenance of relatively high mobility and its extension to the adult stage in response to anthropogenic changes may thus play a major role in the success of Cornu aspersum in urban habitats.

AB  - Small parks in cities are important to support overall urban biodiversity and ecological network. The aim of this paper is to introduce a method of identifying and assessing the ecological characteristics and anthropogenic factors of small urban parks. We developed a framework that combined structured observation and field measurement. The method suggests an integrative assessment that is practical and understandable to the park planners and managers to enhance small parks to support overall urban biodiversity and ecosystem services. High biodiversity can provide opportunities for humans to experience nature and wildlife in cities, thus contributing to the quality of life of urban dwellers. (C) 2016. The Authors.

AB  - Together with other signatories of the Ramsar Convention, Australia is obliged to seek to halt wetland loss, which may include farm ponds/dams and other constructed wetlands. Since European arrival in Australia, extensive clearing of native ecosystems for agriculture and urbanisation has resulted in a concomitant loss of natural wetlands. However, there is limited information on changes in physical characteristics of wetlands with the transition to agriculture and urbanisation. In North-western Sydney, we investigated changes in wetland surface area, distance to nearest neighbour (connectivity), and shape complexity with transition from natural to agricultural and urban landscapes. There were significant differences amongst land use types for these three waterbody parameters. Wetlands in natural areas were larger and further apart from each other. Half the wetlands in agricultural and urban landscapes had small surface areas, but wetlands in agricultural areas were closer together, so connectivity for biota was potentially greater. Most wetlands in all land use classes were simple or irregular in shape, though urban areas had a higher proportion of irregular wetlands. We predict that on the current trajectory of increasing urbanisation, native biodiversity will continue to decline unless more emphasis is placed on the importance of wetlands - natural and constructed.

AB  - The decisions of the central Chinese government have been a key driver of the urbanization process in large cities in eastern China, however their influence on the later-urbanizing cities in central China is unclear. The objective of this study was to use remote sensing data and spatial metrics to identify the relative influence of planning policies at various levels (relative to socioeconomic influences) on trends in landscape patterns in the rapid urbanization process of Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan Province and the core city of central China. Our results revealed that Zhengzhou's rapid urbanization process started about a decade after the eastern coastal cities due to the national development strategy (the Preferential Regional Development Strategy in 1980s and the Hinterland City Opening Policy in 1992), but boomed after 2000 due to increasing national support along with an increased number of planning policies at multiple levels. After 2004, the city experienced a critical landscape transition from a primarily agricultural to an urban-dominated landscape (which has not yet occurred over the whole region). Planning for an inter-city railway network and construction between cities increased the connectivity of urban space, but fragmented other land use types. Urban and green space expanded primarily into agricultural areas, reducing them in extent, simplifying their boundaries, and increasing their fragmentation; these changes likely reduce food production capacity. Trends in construction sites illustrate the exhaustion of land resources in Zhengzhou city and forecast a new round of urban growth in the adjacent cities (Xinzheng, Zhongmou and Xingyang). High-level policy intervention and scientific planning will be very important to urban-rural sustainable development for the region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanisation and agriculture dramatically modify the landscapes available for use by wildlife, affecting key aspects of their ecology such as survival, foraging, predation, competition and reproductive success. Relatively little is known about the effects of urbanisation and agriculture on the genetic structure, gene flow and genetic diversity of wild species. Here, landscape genetic techniques were applied to compare local genetic diversity and gene flow between wood mouse populations in urban and arable landscapes. Using nine microsatellite markers, individuals were genotyped from six arable and seven urban sample sites. Inter-population genetic differentiation was significantly greater in urban than arable habitat, while allele richness, private allele richness and heterozygosity were higher for arable sample sites, with varying degrees of significance. These suggest that urban habitat was sufficiently fragmented to limit gene flow. To test the effect of landscape features on gene flow, several cost-distance measures were generated. Overland distance and Euclidean distance correlated best with inter-population genetic differentiation in arable habitat, whereas distances that accommodated differences in habitat quality better explained differentiation in urban habitat. There was no evidence that margins adjacent to roads, rivers or railways facilitated gene flow. Together, the results indicate that urban landscapes expose wood mice to greater fragmentation in habitat quality than arable areas, leading to greater population isolation that is not mitigated by the presence of dispersal corridors.

AB  - Urbanization results in habitat loss and habitat fragmentation concurrently, both influencing biodiversity and ecological processes. To evaluate these impacts, it is important to understand the relationships between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se (HLHF) during urbanization. The objectives of this study were two-fold: 1) to quantify the different forms of the HLHF relationship during urbanization using multiple landscape metrics, and 2) to test the validity of the HLHF relations reported in the literature. Our analysis was based on a long-term urbanization dataset (1800-2000) of 16 large cities from around the world. Habitat area was represented as the percentage of non-built-up area in the landscape, while habitat fragmentation was measured using several landscape metrics. Our results show that the relationship between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation during urbanization is commonly monotonic-linear, exponential, or logarithmic, indicating that the degree of habitat fragmentation per se increases with habitat loss in general. We compared our results with 14 hypothesized HLHF relationships based on simulated landscapes found in the literature, and found that four of them were consistent with those of urbanization, whereas the other ten were not. Also, we identified six new HLHF relationships when fragmentation was measured by total core area, normalized total core area, patch density, edge density and landscape shape index, respectively. In addition, our study demonstrated that the "space-for-time" approach, frequently used in ecology and geography, generated specious HLHF relationships, suggesting that this approach is largely inappropriate for analyses of urban landscapes that are highly heterogeneous in space and unusually contingent in dynamics. Our results show both generalities and idiosyncrasies of the HLHF relationship, providing new insights for assessing ecological effects of urbanization.

AB  - To balance the needs of people and biodiversity in cities, local governments are increasingly incorporating green spaces and urban greening initiatives into urban planning frameworks. Despite this, there is little information on which vegetation features or management actions are most useful in supporting biodiversity within these green spaces. We assess the effect of three vegetation management approaches that are commonly suggested to improve outcomes for urban biodiversity, including: (1) increasing the proportion of native vegetation; (2) increasing the density of trees, and (3) increasing the volume or complexity of understorey vegetation. We use a network of 39 urban green spaces (including golf courses, public parks and residential neighbourhoods) to assess how these vegetation management approaches impact urban bird and bat communities. The richness of both birds and bats increased with an increase in the proportion of native plants, bird species richness increased with increasing volume of understorey vegetation, and increasing large tree density led to increased bat activity. Our study suggests that increasing native vegetation composition and understorey vegetation volume, and the retention of large trees are practical vegetation management approaches that improve outcomes for urban birds and bats. Our data also suggests that as urbanisation and infill development proceeds, retention of large green spaces (such as golf courses) will be critical for urban biodiversity conservation, as these areas supported a component of the bird and bat fauna which was not recorded in other green space types.

AB  - Urbanization and agriculture growth are some of the major causes of natural ecosystems depletion and biodiversity loss. Conservation efforts can be developed through the prioritization of areas for forest conservation in order to minimize this process. Here, we establish conservation strategies based on a spatial analysis of forest fragments in an urban landscape at the transition between two important Brazilian biodiversity hotspots: Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. A high-resolution mapping of forest patches was used to quantify forest cover and to provide spatial analysis. We developed a Forest Conservation Priority Index (FCPI) derived from landscape metrics to select priority areas for forest conservation efforts. We used area, shape and proximity metrics as landscape structure indicators. Landscape metrics were classified and we attributed a rank and weights for them to calculate the FCPI. Forest covers 17% of the study area. 60% of the forest patches comprise less than one hectare, 95% less than 10 ha and only 1% more than 50 ha. The largest fragments (> 100ha) are all long and narrow. Also, fewer than half the patches are connected to others. Regions classified as high and very high priority for forest conservation are localized at greater slopes, along rivers and on private lands. Our index allowed the prioritization of forest fragments in an urban landscape, directing efforts of conservation. Creating protected areas and restoration plans are necessary for the better situation of the natural ecosystem. Land-use planning must resolve human demands and conservation of this important ecosystem.

AB  - Rapid urbanization is now being experienced in China's third-and fourth-tier cities, raising questions of how to balance urban development with natural resources protection. The integration of nature into expanding urban environments is one of the largest challenges facing those cities. Weishan Lake National Wetland Park is an example of how low-impact design strategies can protect wetlands and purify water while functioning as a natural buffer for the city. Conserving the existing wetland and enhancing service facilities can also provide educational experiences and ecological tourism that will help communicate the city's identity. Meanwhile, the project moves the wetland into urban public spaces in order to build an integrated regional network of ecological and green infrastructure that will contribute to regional ecological improvement while transforming the city into a unique wetland destination.

AB  - Urban sprawl is a widely recognized phenomenon in many major cities worldwide and is a significant land use planning and management issue. This process has many impacts on the ecological function and structure of the landscape. In this article, we analyze the effects of urban sprawl on the ecological patterns and processes in the Montreal Metropolitan Region (MMR) between 1966 and 2010. The dispersed sprawl of low-density urban areas within the territory during this period sharply increased the fragmentation of the territory, isolating the few remaining natural spaces and decreasing their ecological connectivity and, ultimately, biodiversity. The results obtained clearly show that land-use changes that occurred in the MMR have caused profound changes in landscape properties, both structurally and functionally, and especially from 1981 to 2010. In 1966, around 45% of the land had a high or very high level of connectivity, and almost 38% in 1981. By 2010 only 6.5% of the landscape was connected and 73% of the territory possessed no or low connectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Saproxylic Beetle Biodiversity in Golf Course Habitats
T2  - CROP FORAGE & TURFGRASS MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Saproxylic beetles are a diverse group of insects that use deadwood as food or habitat at some stage of their life. While a few species of saproxylic beetles are considered to be pests, the majority of species perform important ecological roles such as decomposition, nutrient recycling, pollination in the mobile adult form, or act as food sources for other organisms. Their diversity and variable responses make them good biological indicators. Promoting biodiversity in managed areas, such as golf courses, may be relatively easy by creating saproxylic habitat. We examined the influence on saproxylic beetle communities of habitat type, log type, and distance from a fairway. Sentinel logs were provided for colonization for one season, and emergence was monitored over the following 2 years. We found that beetle species richness increased with log volume but did not change with distance from the fairway playing surface. Our findings suggest that although species richness may be low compared with that in less fragmented habitats, a diverse assortment of saproxylic beetles can be supported in golf course wooded habitats. This may be accomplished by leaving fallen trees in place when they do not pose a hazard or interfere with play. In particular, the provision of large woody debris that is more difficult to remove may maximize the benefit to superintendents and the saproxylic beetle community. Findings also support the idea that golf courses containing woody patches may increase habitat connectivity for these insects, and possibly other organisms, in otherwise highly fragmented urban areas.

AB  - Tehran city has been subject of critical environmental challenges during the course of 20th century namely: massive population growth, broad expansion, reduction in urban open/green spaces, increasing in energy consumption and waste production. Releasing industrial wastewater into river valleys have led to considerable changes in structure of city's natural landscape. The natural structures of river valleys in northern Tehran that historically function as ecological corridors for transferring surrounding air and water into city, helping urban sustainability, have been gradually turned into large concrete canals for urban wastewater to downstream land, damaging ecosystems balances and biodiversity needs. The eradication of green spaces on the river banks accelerated the rivers environmental degradations. This research aimed at examining the structure of northern Tehran landscape and the influential factors which play role in the river valleys' landscape destruction. The contributing parameters to restoration of these ecological corridors were investigated based on a tree structure. Using FAHP-Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process-the questionnaires distributed among experts, and factors were classified. Then Chang's methodology employed and finally ranked by degree of importance. Outcomes of FAHP were used as input for Arc GIS 9.3 to export the analytical maps of Tehran's urban landscape enhancement through river valleys' restoration. Evidence from this research show that alteration in environmental structures(vegetation cover, micro climate, urban infrastructures, hydrology) comes with greatest importance in shaping existing changes. Restoration of river valleys' structures are therefore, possible through improving their natural functions i.e. biological structures, urban green patches and enhancing network connectivity among patches.

AB  - Especially in urbanized landscapes, habitat fragmentation and increasing numbers of infrastructural features may limit genetic exchange among wildlife populations. Yet, whether this results in genetic differentiation among individuals in different habitat fragments will depend on both the species studied and the composition of the landscape. European pine martens (Martes martes) show clear spatial structure at a Europe-wide scale, but whether gene flow among habitat patches can be maintained at a more local scale in intensively urbanized areas remained unclear. Here, we analysed genotypic data from 270 pine martens sampled from locations scattered across the Netherlands, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Using Bayesian clustering models we show that most likely maximum two large subpopulations exist in the Netherlands. We observed relatively low levels of genetic differentiation and genetic evidence of regular long-distance dispersal by juveniles that must have crossed one or multiple major highways. Our results suggest that genetic exchange among Dutch pine martens has, until 2010, not been impacted severely by the countries' dense infrastructural network. Furthermore this species seems to have maintained its genetic diversity despite a recent demographic bottleneck. These conclusions support the idea that the effects of habitat fragmentation may strongly differ between (groups of) species, and that prioritization and optimization of management decisions thus requires direct study of the targeted species.

AB  - As urban habitats vary in composition and structure along the urban to rural gradient, different degrees of urbanization likely result in a diversity of landscape responses from wildlife. We investigated this relationship with the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), an urban adapted species that is both common and understudied in highly metropolitan landscapes. We investigated which landscape factors affect opossum occupancy, colonization, extinction, and detection by using a large system of motion-triggered camera traps in the Chicago metropolitan area over 10 seasons from spring 2010 to summer 2012. Opossum patch occupancy rates were highest near natural water sources regardless of urbanization, whereas occupancy rates in patches >= 1000 m from natural water sources decreased with increasing urbanization. Our results suggest opossums have relaxed habitat needs at intermediate levels of disturbance, as the ability to locate anthropogenic water sources may allow them to occupy previously uninhabitable patches.

AB  - Farm ponds provide a home for birds and numerous species of aquatic animals in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Urbanization and development of infrastructure resulted in the gradual disappearance of these ponds. Currently, only 3800 ponds originally approximately 15.4 % remain, and 84.6 % of the surface area of the ponds has vanished. Aiming to protect avian diversity, this study used logistic regression analysis and the geostatistical approach to analyze the relationship between avian diversity and landscape structure, in an effort to elucidate the spatial driving force of avian diversity. We detected that regression-kriging (RK) was even more accurate than logistic regression (LR). In addition, the value of diversity (H') measures may decrease instead of increase when evenness (J') is increased. The results of this study also indicated that an exceedingly strong relationship existed among avian diversity and landscape scale, agricultural landscape indices, and pond landscape indices. The models predict that preservation of large areas of waterscapes and paddy landscapes result in greater diversity of avian species. Spatial estimation of the research area indicated that human activity substantially affected avian ecology, leading to reductions in avian diversity. Thus, the reduction of the area of ecological corridors due to urban development is expected to further reduce avian diversity in the Taoyuan region. Our approach can be used to effectively analyze the correlations between characteristics of ecosystems and the environmental landscape, to ensure that pondscapes can be appropriately maintained and ecological reserves designated to prevent further decline in avian diversity.

AB  - Forested urban areas provide many important ecosystem services and their preservation is considered of paramount importance. Although urban forest are known to host a high diversity of saproxylic beetles (i.e. those associated with dead wood), contributions dealing with the role of urban green spaces for their conservation are lacking. We investigated the importance of urban green spaces for saproxylic and non-saproxylic tenebrionid beetles in urban Rome. Based on species vulnerability scores we calculated two indices of area prioritisation, the Biodiversity Conservation Concern (BCC) and the Biodiversity Conservation Weight (BCW) for saproxylic and non-saproxylic species. Site area and forest surface correlated positively with saproxylic richness, whereas site isolation correlated negatively with non-saproxylic richness. BCC and BCW values for saproxylic species were positively correlated with distance from the city centre. For non-saproxylic species, BCW values were negatively correlated with distance from adjacent areas. These results suggest that saproxylic beetles require large areas covered by forest, but are not strongly influenced by isolation, which is important for non-saproxylic species. Non-saproxylic tenebrionids have limited dispersal capabilities, which explains their sensitivity to isolation, but are generally eurytopic species frequently found even in the city centre. By contrast, most saproxylic species are able to fly, but are mainly found in peripheral areas with large and relatively well preserved forest fragments. Maintaining and possibly enhancing connectivity among green spaces is important for the conservation of non-saproxylic species, whereas preserving large forest surfaces, especially in peripheral areas, is needed for the conservation of saproxylic species.

AB  - Seoul City, as the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea, has high population density, and its remaining forests are extremely fragmented as a result of intensive development. The purpose of this study is to analyze the distribution of the great tit (Parus major) and develop a habitat model. Tits have been known as forest birds that inhabit urban forests in Seoul City. A Seoul biotope map and land cover map were combined, and the urban forest areas were delineated on these maps. As factors affecting the distribution of the great tit, landscape indices were calculated by separating them into intrapatch indices, namely logged patch area (PA), area-weighted mean patch shape index (PSI), tree rate (TR), and tree area (TA), and interpatch indices, namely patch degree (PD), patch betweenness (PB), patch proximity (PP), and difference probability of connectivity (DPC), to analyze the internal properties of the patches and their connectivity by tit occurrence data. The results of a t test analyzing the differences of habitat variables by great tit presence/absence and distribution showed differences in PA (p < 0.05), PSI (p < 0.001), TR (p < 0.01), TA (p < 0.001), PD (p < 0.05), PB (p < 0.01), PP (p < 0.05), and DPC (p < 0.1). In the results of logistic regression modeling, in most cases, more than one model had Delta AICc less than 2.0, suggesting that multiple models may be the best model. In the comprehensive models, the TR, PB, and DPC metrics were the best predictors. Among all variables in the intrahabitat model, PSI was the best predictor of species occurrence. Within the interhabitat model, DPC was the best predictor and had a positive relationship with species occurrence, which is the most important of all the factors. In other words, the great tit is more likely to be found in a large circular forest patch than a small and long-shaped forest patch, and connectivity in the threshold distance is the most important factor in predicting great tit occurrence. These results suggest that ecological potential, not only "location potential" but also "supply potential," should be considered in fragmented urban forests.

AB  - 1. Aquatic ecosystems are degraded by a variety of pressures as a result of the growing human population. Global-scale impacts include homogenization of biological communities, removal of top predators and ecosystem engineers, chemical pollution by excess nutrients and contaminants as well as deteriorating structural diversity, connectivity and process dynamics. There is a pressing societal need to reverse the decline in biodiversity and replace lost ecosystem functioning and services in aquatic ecosystems by enabling natural recovery or by active restoration.
   2. Common concepts and approaches for conservation, recovery and restoration in freshwater and marine ecosystems, aided by recent advances in ecological theory, include decision criteria on priorities for conservation, harnessing natural recovery by cessation of impacts, restoring connectivity and meso-habitat diversity as well as the geomorphological structural template including hydrodynamic processes. Re-oligotrophication at catchment or regional sea-scale benefits from integrating freshwater and marine restoration. Species or assemblages that convey biogenic structure or act as ecosystem engineers and keystone species should be given priority. Top-down control can be reinstated in closed systems.
   3. Differences between freshwater and marine ecosystems include the greater spatial restriction of many species in fresh water, the importance of rooted vegetation and insects in freshwater, and the much greater dispersal and connectivity in marine systems. These differences dictate different approaches, with more scope for active restoration work in fresh water and harnessing natural recovery in marine systems.
   4. Restoration schemes need clearly defined target states. They should generally take a process-oriented and stepwise adaptive management approach judging success against reference or control sites. Societal and political expectations need to be managed and restoration schemes should not promise too much. Even minor rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems can put back some biodiversity and key services. Sometimes 'Ersatz'-ecosystems are better than nothing and the best that can be achieved, especially in urban settings. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - On-going fragmentation of tropical forest ecosystems and associated depletion of seed dispersers threatens the long-term survival of animal-dispersed plants. These threats do not only affect biodiversity and species abundance, but ultimately ecosystem functions and services. Thus, seed dispersers such as the straw-coloured fruit bat, E. helvum, which traverse long distances across fragmented landscapes, are particularly important for maintaining genetic connectivity and colonizing new sites for plant species. Using high-resolution GPS-tracking of movements, field observations and gut retention experiments, we quantify dispersal distances for small-and large-seeded fruits foraged by E. helvum during periods of colony population low (wet season) and high (dry season) in an urban and a rural landscape in the forest zone of Ghana. Gut passage time averaged 116 min (range 4-1143 min), comparable to other fruit bats. Movements were generally longer in the urban than in the rural landscape and also longer in the dry than in the wet season. As the majority of seeds are dispersed only to feeding roosts, median dispersal distances were similar for both large (42-67 m) and small (42-65 m) seeds. However, small seeds were potentially dispersed up to 75.4 km, four times further than the previous maximum distance estimated for a similar-sized frugivore. Maximum seed dispersal distances for small seeds were almost twice as long in the rural (49.7 km) compare to the urban (31.2 km) landscape. Within the urban landscape, estimated maximum dispersal distances for small seeds were three times longer during the dry season (75.4 km) compared to the wet season (22.8 km); in contrast, distances in the rural landscape were three times longer in the wet season (67 km) compared to the dry season (24.4). Dispersal distances for large seeds during the dry season (551 m) in the rural landscape were almost twice that in the wet season (319 m). We found no influence of food phenology on dispersal distances. The maximum likelihood for seed dispersal beyond feeding roosts (mean distance from food tree 263 m) was 4.7%. Small seeds were dispersed over even longer distances, >500 and >1000 m, with a likelihood of 3.0 % and 2.3 % respectively. Our data show that E. helvum retains ingested seeds for very long periods and may traverse large distances, probably making it an important long distance seed disperser in tropical Africa. We suggest E. helvumis important for ecosystem functioning and urge its conservation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest network development in urban areas faces the challenge from forest fragmentation, human-induced disturbances, and scarce land resources. Here, we proposed a geotechnology-based modeling to optimize conservation of forest network by a case study of Wuhan, China. The potential forest network and their priorities were assessed using an improved least-cost path model and potential utilization efficiency estimation. The modeling process consists of four steps: (i) developing species assemblages, (ii) identifying core forest patches, (iii) identifying potential linkages among core forest patches, and (iv) demarcating forest networks. As a result, three species assemblages, including mammals, pheasants, and other birds, were identified as the conservation targets of urban forest network (UFN) in Wuhan, China. Based on the geotechnology-based model, a forest network proposal was proposed to fulfill the connectivity requirements of selected species assemblages. The proposal consists of seven forest networks at three levels of connectivity, named ideal networks, backbone networks, and comprehensive network. The action priorities of UFN plans were suggested to optimize forest network in the study area. Additionally, a total of 45 forest patches with important conservation significance were identified as prioritized stepping-stone patches in the forest network development. Urban forest conserve was also suggested for preserving woodlands with priority conservation significance. The presented geotechnology-based modeling is fit for planning and optimizing UFNs, because of the inclusion of the stepping-stone effects, human-induced pressures, and priorities. The framework can also be applied to other areas after a sensitivity test of the model and the modification of the parameters to fit the local environment.

AB  - Question: It is often assumed, but poorly tested, that patterns of phylogenetic diversity reflect 'v sity plant curnnrurlifies. Here we test whether phylogeny can be used as a proxy for functional diversity in general and specifically for diversity in plant niche preferences, dispersal strategics and competitiveness-related traits.
   Location: Central Fu rope,Belgium and the Netherlands.
   Methods: We used a species composition data set from seven urban habitats, each sampled in 32 large cities of ten countries, and combined this with information about species phylogeny and functional traits, the latter divided into categories representingniche preferences, dispersal strategies and co SS
   Results: We found positive significant, yet very weak, relationships between phylogenetic diversity and overall functional diversity, and between phylogenetic diversity and diversity in both species dispersal strategies and competitiveness. The relationship between phylogenetic diversity and diversity in species niche preferences was not significant.
   Conclusions: We suggest that the combination of multiple trait states that coexist in urban plant communities and even within the same lineages weakens the phylogeny function relationship. Phylogenetic diversity is a weak proxy for functional diversity of urban plant communities. For sonic facets of functional diversity, the phylogeny function relationship may not apply at all.

AB  - AimWe propose and test a climate tolerance and trait choice hypothesis of urban macroecological variation in which strong filtering associated with low winter temperatures restricts urban biodiversity while weak filtering associated with warmer temperatures and irrigation allows dispersal of species from a global source pool, thereby increasing urban biodiversity.
   LocationTwenty cities across the USA and Canada.
   MethodsWe examined variation in tree community taxonomic diversity, origins and production of an aesthetic ecosystem service trait in a cross-section of urban field surveys. We correlated urban tree community composition indicators with a key climate restriction, namely mean minimum winter temperature, and evaluated alternative possible drivers: precipitation, summer maximum temperature, population size and the percentage of adults with a college education.
   ResultsSpecies accumulation curves differed substantially among cities, with observed richness varying from 22 to 122 species. Similarities in tree communities decreased exponentially with increases in climatic differences. Ordination of tree communities showed strong separation among cities with component axes correlated with minimum winter temperature and annual precipitation. Variation among urban tree communities in richness, origins and the provisioning of an aesthetic ecosystem service were all correlated with minimum winter temperature.
   Main conclusionsThe urban climate tolerance and trait choice hypothesis provides a coherent mechanism to explain the large variation among urban tree communities resulting from an interacting environment, species and human decisions. Reconciling the feedbacks between human decision making and biophysical limitations provides a foundation for an urban ecological theory that can better understand and predict the dynamics of other linked biotic communities, associated ecosystem dynamics and resulting services provided to urban residents.

AB  - Forest fragmentation constitutes one of the main consequences of land cover change worldwide. Through this process gaps in habitat coverage are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban (10.6%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4%). Although the land cover class "wood sites" increased, the data of SIR revealed that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able to use this model to determine local patches of high value for conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding the factors that drive population dynamics is fundamental to species conservation and management. Since the golden-cheeked warbler Setophaga chrysoparia was first listed as endangered, much effort has taken place to monitor warbler abundance, occupancy, reproduction and survival. Yet, despite being directly related to local population dynamics, movement rates have not been estimated for the species. We used an integrated population model to investigate the relationship between immigration rate, fledging rate, survival probabilities and population growth rate for warblers in central Texas, USA. Furthermore, using a deterministic projection model, we examined the response required by vital rates to maintain a viable population across varying levels of immigration. Warbler abundance fluctuated with an overall positive trend across years. In the absence of immigration, the abundance would have decreased. However, the population could remain viable without immigration if both adult and juvenile survival increased by almost half or if juvenile survival more than doubled. We also investigated the response required by fledging rates across a range of immigration in order to maintain a viable population. Overall, we found that immigration was required to maintain warbler target populations, indicating that warbler conservation and management programs need to be implemented at larger spatial scales than current efforts to be effective. This study also demonstrates that by using limited data within integrated population models, biologists are able to monitor multiple key demographic parameters simultaneously to gauge the efficacy of strategies designed to maximize warbler viability in a changing landscape.

AB  - The importance of macroclimate and dispersal limitation in the broad-scale variation of European urban land snail assemblages is likely to differ between native and non-native species because of the southern origin of many non-native snails, often spread by humans. We sampled land snails in each of 32 European cities and compiled from the literature a list of land snail species reported from the surroundings of each city. To quantify the predictive power of climate and local species pools, beta-sim dissimilarity matrices of both native and non-native species were explored using MDS and RDA ordination methods, Mantel tests with bootstrapping of each dataset, and multivariate homogeneity analysis of group variances. We observed no significant relation between the numbers of non-native species found in the cities and their surroundings (p > 0.133), while the percentage of native species in the cities derived from their local species pools decreased significantly with the increasing species richness of local faunas (r(S) = -0.75, p < 0.001). Assemblage variation of urban native species was explained mostly by the difference between mean January and July temperatures (21.3 %), with the major role of July temperature (18.0 %). In contrast, variation of non-native species assemblages was mainly explained by January temperature (19.9 %). The congruence in faunal similarities between the cities and the surrounding areas was higher in native (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) than in non-native species (r = 0.36, p < 0.001). Overall native faunas were significantly more homogeneous than the non-native faunas. Our results suggest that recent climate warming may foster geographical expansions of many non-native land snail species as their distributions are controlled mainly by January temperature.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity (the composition and configuration of different landcover types) plays a key role in shaping woodland bird assemblages in wooded-agricultural mosaics. Understanding how species respond to landscape factors could contribute to preventing further decline of woodland bird populations.
   To investigate how woodland birds with different species traits respond to landscape heterogeneity, and to identify whether specific landcover types are important for maintaining diverse populations in wooded-agricultural environments.
   Birds were sampled from woodlands in 58 2 x 2 km tetrads across southern Britain. Landscape heterogeneity was quantified for each tetrad. Bird assemblage response was determined using redundancy analysis combined with variation partitioning and response trait analyses.
   For woodland bird assemblages, the independent explanatory importance of landscape composition and landscape configuration variables were closely interrelated. When considered simultaneously during variation partitioning, the community response was better represented by compositional variables. Different species responded to different landscape features and this could be explained by traits relating to woodland association, foraging strata and nest location. Ubiquitous, generalist species, many of which were hole-nesters or ground foragers, correlated positively with urban landcover while specialists of broadleaved woodland avoided landscapes containing urban areas. Species typical of coniferous woodland correlated with large conifer plantations.
   At the 2 x 2 km scale, there was evidence that the availability of resources provided by proximate landcover types was highly important for shaping woodland bird assemblages. Further research to disentangle the effects of composition and configuration at different spatial scales is advocated.

AB  - The state of environment and the development of transport network are related with the impact that transport network exerts on the habitat, migration routes and reproduction conditions for wildlife. Such impact has spatial character, and eventually results in the extinction of certain species or communities and fragmentation of biogeocoenotic cover. Preliminary general assessment of the effect of fragmentation and a pilot region case are presented. The produced map, which reflects the impact of the highways and settlement network (including urban areas) on biocoenoses in Ukraine, was used for correction of planning the eco-corridors.

AB  - Urbanization substantially changes the physicochemical and biological characteristics of streams. The trajectory of negative effect is broadly similar around the world, but the nature and magnitude of ecological responses to urban growth differ among locations. Some heterogeneity in response arises from differences in the level of urban development and attributes of urban water management. However, the heterogeneity also may arise from variation in hydrologic, biological, and physicochemical templates that shaped stream ecosystems before urban development. We present a framework to develop hypotheses that predict how natural watershed and channel attributes in the pre-urban-development state may confer ecological resistance to urbanization. We present 6 testable hypotheses that explore the expression of such attributes under our framework: 1) greater water storage capacity mitigates hydrologic regime shifts, 2) coarse substrates and a balance between erosive forces and sediment supply buffer morphological changes, 3) naturally high ionic concentrations and pH pre-adapt biota to water quality stress, 4) metapopulation connectivity results in retention of species richness, 5) high functional redundancy buffers trophic function from species loss, and 6) landuse history mutes or reverses the expected trajectory of eutrophication. Data from past comparative analyses support these hypotheses, but rigorous testing will require targeted investigations that account for confounding or interacting factors, such as diversity in urban infrastructure attributes. Improved understanding of the susceptibility or resistance of stream ecosystems could substantially strengthen conservation, management, and monitoring efforts in urban streams. We hope that these preliminary, conceptual hypotheses will encourage others to explore these ideas further and generate additional explanations for the heterogeneity observed in urban streams.

AB  - This study investigates the relative importance of dispersal- and niche-related mechanisms structuring the assemblages of vascular epiphytes in a 10-ha secondary Atlantic Forest patch in So Paulo city, Brazil. We tested for the effect of characteristics of host trees (species, height, trunk diameter, presence of lianas, and distance to a near stream) and of space on epiphyte abundance, species richness, and species composition of vascular epiphytes. Inside a 0.2-ha plot, all 86 trees with diameter at breast height > 13 cm (27 species) were recorded, as well as all epiphytes larger than 15 cm in length on those trees (380 individuals, 22 species). Twenty-eight trees (32.6 %) did not carry epiphytes. On individual trees, tree species showed a significant effect on epiphyte abundance, richness, and species composition. The bark-shedding Piptadenia gonoacantha carried less epiphytes than other tree species. Distance to the stream showed effects on abundance and species composition, with lower abundance farther from the stream. Tree height had a positive effect on abundance, richness, and species composition, but trunk diameter had none, supporting the importance of vertical stratification in controlling epiphyte richness. Variation partitioning analyses showed little or no effect of "pure space" on abundance, richness, and species composition (explaining 6.7, 4.5, and 0.7 % of variation, respectively), as compared to environmental effects (26, 30, and 14.5 %), generally supporting a higher importance of niche-based processes in structuring epiphytic assemblages on host trees in the plot.

AB  - It is in cities where people are most strongly confronted with diversity in an 'age of migration'. However, comparisons of local integration contexts usually take ethnic boundaries as given or assume that they are constituted by the nation state. Our analysis of local discourses challenges this methodological nationalism. Departing from the 'distinctiveness of cities' approach, we scrutinise how Frankfurt, Dortmund, Birmingham and Glasgow differ in how diversity is discursively constructed. We maintain that the discourses not only reflect different frames in dealing with diversity but also serve as a proxy for debating the self-image of the city.

AB  - The vertical surfaces of walls accommodate diverse plants in urban areas. Characterizing species composition and distribution of plants growing in these habitats is of great significance towards a better understanding and management of urban ecosystems. Here we focused on the City Wall of Nanjing (CWN), one of the biggest and best reserved ancient masonry city walls in the world. Through detailed field survey, we investigated species composition, richness and cover of the vascular plants on the CWN, and examined their relationships with a set of local habitat factors including aspect, position, height of the wall and ground vegetation status, using canonical correspondence analysis and multiple regression models. In total we found 67 plant species on the CWN. They are mostly widespread ruderal plants, with a conspicuously high proportion of vine species. Surprisingly, we found that the investigated habitat factors generally have weak correlations (R-2 < 10 %) with species composition, species richness and plant cover. The relationships remain weak when specified in different species groups in terms of life forms and seed dispersal traits. However, these species groups appear to have distinct responses to particular micro-habitat conditions such as light and intensity of human activities. Our results provide useful implications for protecting the walls and enhancing ecosystem services of their associated vegetation.

AB  - Educational services provided to various stakeholders need to be actively developed to accommodate the diversity of learning models and to get the advantages of available resources (e.g. data) in smart cities governance. Despite the substantial literature on smart cities, for Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) and its related domains such as learning analytics and big data, little effort has been given to the creation of connectivity to smart cities governance to meet stakeholders' demands, even though this connection may generate various challenges arising from conflict of interests between stakeholders and organisations. This paper proposes a structural framework for successful application of smart learning environments in the context of smart city governance. It reflects on selected challenges and proposes some future directions.

AB  - Social media check-in data, one type of crowdsourcing open data about individual activity-related choices, provides a new perspective to sense people's spatial and temporal preference in urban places. In this paper, through the analysis of the interaction between these scored places on streets, we aim to advance our knowledge of network accessibility with social media check-ins to portray urban structure and related socioeconomic performance more explicitly. By conceptualising an interface graph to reflect the interplay between land-use points and the co-visual paths, we propose a novel framework to characterise the urban streets with land-use connectivity indices that are measured with a new type of place-function signature. A "3-Ds" model is introduced to package three principal dimensions of urban function network, including accessible density, accessible diversity and delivery efficiency, as one integrated index that works towards a comprehensive understanding of function connectivity from each street's midpoints to all reachable land-use points. Streets are further partitioned to the annotated function regions based on function connectivity in different types of active land-use. The results of preliminary studies in the city of Tianjin, China show that the proposed metrics can explicitly describe the inherent function structure and the regions' typology across scales. Compared with space syntax measurements at the same radius for describing the variation of empirically observed house price, the integrated metric can improve the predictability of statistic models sufficiently, and each specified index is confirmed to be statistically significant by controlling other factors. Overall, this research shows that the usage of ubiquitous big social media data can enrich the current description of the urban network system and enhance the predictability of network accessibility on socioeconomic performance.

AB  - The invasive black rat Rattus rattus has established commensal populations in most cities of the world. Known as a reservoir of numerous zoonotic diseases, this species is considered as an urban pest and may have major consequences on human health. However, little is known about the genetic structure of urban populations, although it could help to design the scale of appropriate control strategies (at the city or at the district level). In this study, we characterize the genetic structure of R. rattus within Franceville (Republic of Gabon), an African tropical city that has undergone a recent growth, like many other cities of the developing countries. Sampling was conducted in six different districts of the city, chosen to represent variable levels of connectivity and building aggregation. Genetic structure was assessed using 16 microsatellite markers. Our results suggest the occurrence of a large population of R. rattus that is continuously distributed at the scale of the city, with no impact of urban characteristics or putative barriers on genetic differentiation. Isolation by distance analyses show that effective dispersal of R. rattus is, however, spatially limited to a few hundred meters. Regarding management strategies, our results suggest that rodent control should be envisaged at the scale of the city.

AB  - Background Green infrastructure is a strategic network of green spaces designed to deliver ecosystem services to human communities. Green infrastructure is a convenient concept for urban policy makers, but the term is used too generically and with limited understanding of the relative values or benefits of different types of green space and how these complement one another. At a finer scale/more practical level, little consideration is given to the composition of the plant communities, yet this is what ultimately defines the extent of service provision. This paper calls for greater attention to be paid to urban plantings with respect to ecosystem service delivery and for plant science to engage more fully in identifying those plants that promote various services.
   Scope Many urban plantings are designed based on aesthetics alone, with limited thought on how plant choice/composition provides other ecosystem services. Research is beginning to demonstrate, however, that landscape plants provide a range of important services, such as helping mitigate floods and alleviating heat islands, but that not all species are equally effective. The paper reviews a number of important services and demonstrates how genotype choice radically affects service delivery.
   Conclusions Although research is in its infancy, data are being generated that relate plant traits to specific services, thereby helping identify genotypes that optimize service delivery. The urban environment, however, will become exceedingly bland if future planting is simply restricted to monocultures of a few 'functional' genotypes. Therefore, further information is required on how to design plant communities where the plants identified (1) provide more than a single benefit (multifunctionality), (B) complement each other in maximizing the range of benefits that can be delivered in one location, and (3) continue to maintain public acceptance through diversity. The identification/development of functional landscape plants is an exciting and potentially high-impact arena for plant science.

AB  - Often used as a mitigation tool to landscape fragmentation, urban riparian corridors also suffered from the effects of the urban expansion. This study explored the relationships between plant riparian communities and two major environmental variables (land cover, soil characteristics) and analyzed the floristic change along an urbanization gradient. Fifteen sites were surveyed on both riverbanks of two riparian corridors characterized by contrasting water regimes in Strasbourg, North Eastern France. Data of spontaneous species abundance was collected from 180 quadrats using (i) all plant species, (ii) herbaceous stratum and (iii) ligneous stratum (bush and tree). The diversity and compositional patterns of riparian plant species were analyzed within each corridor according to three levels of urbanization (urban, suburban, peri-urban). Relationships between riparian communities, land cover and soil chemical properties (pH, nitrogen and carbon content, moisture) were established by between-class co-inertia analyses. Land cover emerged as the main factor explaining changes in riparian communities along the rural-urban gradient while soil chemical properties discriminate water stress and fluvial dynamics of the two corridors. Similar compositional patterns were found within the most urbanized sites with the establishment of ubiquitous species. The herbaceous stratum is best linked to the level of urbanization, whereas the tree stratum is primarily correlated with corridor attributes (hydrological regime, soil properties). Although riparian species and communities are mainly determined by land cover, urban riparian corridors maintain native biodiversity up to the urban center.

AB  - The city and the watershed are distinct systems of flow that generate shape and structure across the landscape to maximize their intrinsic objectives. How can city form fix the watershed? The framework plan is a U.S. EPA-funded initiative to mitigate severe water management problems in the sub-watershed incorporating Conway, Arkansas. The sub-watershed contains polluted headwater streams exhibiting advanced urban stream syndrome contributing to the decline of Lake Conway downstream.
   The framework plan employs green infrastructure incorporating urban rain terrains (based on holding water) and riparian corridors ( based on drainage) that deliver ecosystem services. A portfolio of modulated infrastructural retrofits are value-added to conventional infrastructure. The approach provides a novel set of transferable planning tools for urban watersheds, combining a sponge city gradient, a water treatment technologies spectrum, the 17 ecosystem services, and six adaptive infrastructure types. The approach builds a representative cityscape expressive of place-based urban water management.

AB  - The "Grenelle de l'Environnement" forum outlined the importance of taking into account the dispersion of species across territories and therefore proposed the identification and protection of ecological networks with reservoirs of biodiversity and connecting corridors: the "Trames vertes et bleues" (TVB). In urbanized areas, these TVB are difficult to define not only because of the mosaic of land uses and the importance of the barriers constituted by built elements, but also because of land pressures and urban practices. The approach cannot be reduced to a naturalist study. The sustainability of a green city network is highly dependent on its perception and acceptance by the inhabitants. In this context and at the request of local communities, we have been led to propose plans of TVB which gradually strengthened an interdisciplinary methodology. Through the example of Plaine Commune's TVB plan(north of Paris), we deliver here this methodology based on a complementarity of diagnoses (regarding ecology, landscapes, projects, green space practices) and a consultation with main actors. This method results in a map of global actions (conception of local objectives, landscape guidelines ... ) and local actions (space management advice, projects development ... ).

AB  - The article examines the presence of water in the city. It confronts its existence with the notion of threat, but also natural capital. It also outlines the relationship of cities with water from the antiquity until present. The issue of the reintegration of degraded water channels in urban areas is dealt with as well. Rapidly progressive anthropogenic processes, mainly occurring at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, associated with industrialisation and rapid urbanisation have led to the deep degradation of the existing, largely natural watercourses. They were transformed into sewage channels, often used under the developing needs of the urban centres, included in underground structures, and lost their aesthetic values. Large rivers of the (")founder" cities, i.e. Thames, Seine or Rhenium, became equally large sewers.
   The article highlights the history of the disappearance of networks of smaller streams that do not withstand competition with technocratic approach, particularly in large cities. Cities, where industry greatly reduced the aquatic resources of cities, polluted waters and completely rejected the landscape recreational, as well as compositional function of watercourses in the forming of the urban structure, which develops very dynamically. Fully regulated streams have been channelled not to harass residents with unpleasant odor. Spaces associated with the water began to be seen as peripheral areas of cities. Moreover, the article examines the arguments for stopping sealing of the city which halts the flow of water in the city Although water is a renewable resource, overexploitation and the ignorant management within the basin causes its dramatic shortage, especially in the cities. The lack of integrated thinking about the problem of water makes cities turn their back on the issue.
   The authors focus their attention on the multi-functionality of the water infrastructure and recovery of the "space for the river", as well as on the projects in line with the principle of decoupling. The article describes successful projects, in which water is not treated as a raw material, but rather as a natural, factor necessary for life, boasting limitless possibilities that must be protected. The examples of reintegration removed from urban watercourses, which again become the basis for the composition of the city and part of restoring sustainable water management for urban areas are also presented and analyzed. Thinking about the problem of lack of the integration of water, shortage of water as a resource should be dealt with in a comprehensive way, rather than selectively. The article presents the historical and contemporary examples of integrating urban design with water engineering.

AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem processes yet globally is highly restricted by anthropogenic actions. Anthropogenic barriers are common in aquatic ecosystems; however, the effects of smallscale barriers such as floodgates have received relatively little study. Here we assess fish communities in ten tributaries over the spring-summer season of the lower Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada), five with floodgates and five reference sites without barriers, located primarily in agricultural land use areas. While the Fraser River supports the largest salmon runs in Canada, the lower Fraser river-floodplain ecosystem has numerous dikes and floodgates to protect valuable agricultural and urban developments. Floodgate presence was associated with reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, threefold greater abundance of invasive fish species, and decreased abundances of five native fish species, including two salmon species. These findings provide evidence that floodgates decrease suitable habitat for native fishes, and become hotspots for non-native species. Given climate change, sea-level rise, and aging flood protection infrastructure, there is an opportunity to incorporate biodiversity considerations into further development or restoration of this infrastructure.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has induced numerous ecological and environmental issues seriously threatening the ecological security. The ecological security pattern (ESP), an effective way for protecting the ecological security, is becoming increasingly important in reconciling the rapid urbanization and ecology protection in urban planning practices. Based on the cost-distance analysis method, we constructed a three-rank (basic, moderate and strict-rank) composite ESP of Gaoming (Guangdong, China) aiming at protecting the survivals and habitat securities of rare vegetations, wild animals and human beings. The proposed composite ESP is established on five equal-weighted individual ESPs (namely Geology-ESP, Hydrology-ESP, Atmosphere-ESP, Biodiversity-ESP and Farmland-ESP) for geologic disasters prevention, flood prevention and drinking water protection, air pollution prevention, biodiversity conservation and farmland protection, respectively. Our results show that under the basic, moderate, and strict-rank ESPs, the integration and connectivity of the ecological components are constantly improved, but the connectivity between neighboring urban patches decline gradually. The moderate-rank ESP proves to be the optimal spatial pattern for balancing the conflicts between urban development and ecological protection. Notably, the ESP that considers the security of atmosphere and farmland securities, which protects the regional farmlands better and well balance the expansions of industrial and residual lands, proves to be much more reasonable.

AB  - Home to over half the world's population, cities are the drivers of the global economy and the primary influencers of the Earth's sustainability. Thus, the burden of sustainable economic development falls ever more on cities, with many global organizations and governments calling for the promotion of green' economies. Yet how does a city move from its current economic structure to a green economy? Using detailed occupational data for US cities, we develop a green jobs index based on the network of interdependencies between occupational specializations. Using this index we quantify how close a city's current economy is to the green economy. We further show that movement or transition through this occupation space' toward a green economy is a slow and difficult process, with the average annual movement towards a green economy across all US cities being close to zero. Such difficulty is uncorrelated with a city's current population size, density, per capita GDP, per capita income, or even the city's current green jobs index. Furthermore, the structure of occupational interdependencies gives rise to suboptimal movements towards the green economy.

AB  - Using document analysis and ethnographic field work, this article examines the debate within the LGBTQ community of Kansas City over the decision to hold its Pride festival in the Power and Light District (P&L), a renewed downtown area with a controversial dress code. Despite the developers' and city's goals of creating a cosmopolitan urban space that welcomed diverse populations, the P&L acquired a reputation as an anti-Black, anti-queer space due to its dress code and redevelopment history. I argue that the debate surrounding this controversy reveals limits to notions of diversity and diverging approaches to sexual politics within the LGBTQ community that are normally obscured by political actors within the movement but that work to create symbolic boundaries that exclude non-respectable members of the LGBTQ population. Recovering queer perspectives allows us to imagine a more capacious definition of diversity and inclusion, both within the LGBTQ movement and in urban space.

AB  - In the contemporary age of international migration, the mobilities of people into and out of cities are increasingly diverse. Correspondingly, it has been claimed that forms of belonging are becoming increasingly flexible, strategic and characterised by multiple place attachments. This paper examines these claims in empirical detail by investigating how different scales of belonging and mobility come together in the context of migrant incorporation processes in a hyperdiverse, transitional suburban locality in Sydney, Australia. Drawing on several migrant biographies, I flesh out the lived dimensions of mobility and emplacement and the various routes and roots that characterise cities of diversity. This article uses grounded portrayals of individual experiences of place and everyday mobility across a range of migration statuses and ethnic backgrounds to examine the spatial practices of belonging for mobile (and relatively immobile) migrant subjects in the city. As such, this work contributes to research that highlights the mutual constitution of place and movement, by considering the role of migrants in the everyday production of urban space.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is of paramount importance not only in maintaining both functionality and resilience of social-ecological systems, but also in providing Ecosystem Services (ESs). Despite recent efforts, several issues still need to be faced to fully integrate ESs evaluation relating to landscape connectivity into effective plans and environmental assessment procedures. Choosing an appropriate scale of analysis is one of the most problematic topics, since it can profoundly affect the evaluation of single patch contribution to global connectivity. Moreover, the effect of different scales on ESs assessment based on spatial modelling has not yet been investigated.
   In this paper, an innovative approach to the assessment of Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity (BELC) and related ESs for Biodiversity conservation, is presented, based on the PANDORA 3.0 landscape evolution model. A new index (dMtot) for the evaluation of each patch's contribution to global BELC is proposed and employed to build a new formulation for the assessment of ESs in monetary terms. A set of Non Urbanized Areas (NUAs) is therefore analyzed in the Metropolitan area of Bad (Southern Italy) across three planning scales commonly adopted in planning practice.
   The results bring to light the sensitivity of evaluation to the choice of scale, underlining the need to consider a higher level of analysis when local plans are drawn up for land use decision making. A thorough evaluation of this larger extension could therefore require more resources. As a result, modelling approaches that are less data and time consuming would become even more necessary. In this view, the PANDORA 3.0 model could provide a valid and reliable support, since it uses data that are usually available to land managers (e.g. land cover/land use maps, soil maps, Digital Elevation Models). Moreover, it could also be employed to assess land use scenarios at different scales relatively quickly.
   Limits of the current approaches and research challenges are then discussed. The final goal of the article is to provide an additional tool, which will allow ESs and Landscape Ecology concepts to be integrated not only into assessment procedures (e.g. EIA, SEA) but also into landscape and urban planning practice.

AB  - Although biological invasion often alters ecosystem properties and community composition at different scales, considerable uncertainty still exists regarding the underlying mechanisms that regulate the spread of alien species into new habitats. An alien invasion is generally achieved through multiple processes from multiple sources; this type of invasion often prevents us from understanding of the dispersal mechanisms. Here, we aim to disentangle the processes of alien invasion by focusing on a single migration source. We surveyed the distribution of alien and native plant species in Shiretoko National Park, located in northern Japan. We measured the coverage of each species and the environmental and spatial factors in 362 quadrats established along roadsides. We found 101 native species and 35 alien species (gamma-diversity) throughout the quadrats. The local species richness (alpha-diversity) was higher for the alien species (6.1 species) than for the native species (3.2 species). There was a significant negative correlation in alpha-diversity between native and alien species. Moreover, the alpha-diversity and distance from the nearest town (migration source) showed a negative relationship for alien assemblages while the native assemblages showed the opposite trend. These results suggest that the alien species are expanding their distribution outward from the town, resulting in a decrease in the alpha-diversity of native species in localities close to the migration source. Overall, our results emphasize that roadsides could unintentionally act as corridors for alien species, even in protected areas. Careful consideration is thus needed for utilizing these human-created habitats even though they were designed for conservation and management purposes.

AB  - The New Urbanism (NU) planning movement aspires to create socially diverse neighborhoods. It is unclear, however, whether this movement lives up to its aspirations in practice. In an effort to systematically examine this aspect of the movement, this paper analyzes age, family type, income, and race data of 70 NU neighborhoods in the United States. The paper uses a diversity index to compare the NU neighborhoods with control sites. Findings show that NU neighborhoods have lower racial diversity, but may have higher income diversity. Consideration of variations within the way NU is implemented reveals that the low racial diversity is associated with a single approach, but higher income diversity is associated with all variants. This paper argues that NU generates places that are more socially diverse than what is described in the literature and uses two case studies to explore the ways in which diversity is produced and its relation to gentrification.

AB  - Urban movements, borne out of civic activism in the first decade of the twenty-first century, function beyond the frameworks of official Polish urban development institutions and policies.
   In the recent years they have managed to enter the political debate, some of them morphing into a clearly political form of activism, often in reaction to controversial decisions taken by local governments. Becoming increasingly aware of the number and diversity of existing organisations active in the field, they decided to form a communication and exchange platform under the name of Congress of Urban Movements. There have been already four editions of this event and as a movement they have still to clarify what directions they want to develop and what organisational form to build in order to bridge city residents' needs with current development policies in Polish cities. They elaborated a set of 15 Urban Theses that define the basic themes that characterise their activities. However, the question remains concerning the future direction of these movements and what role will they play in the urban policies of the coming decades.

AB  - Urban planning is a tool, which enables in managing changes within a spatial approach. It helps in conducting planning activities where the economic, environmental, and social goals are taken care of holistically. Planning process involves studying past trends, learning from past and present, and then preparing a proposal for future. This process mostly assesses the trend of growth and plans for development. A trend follows change in a defined rate. An indefinite or unexpected change spoils the planning process, by breaking the trend of growth. City is known for its resources, geography, population, social-culture structure, economy etc. Whenever there is an unexpected change in any of these parameters, the city undergoes remarkable changes. Disaster also brings hasty changes in all these, which is indeed a challenge to urban planning and design. The fast modernization and adoption of western culture leads to significant changes in socio-cultural and economic spheres. City also changes, when rapid movement of people and resources occur. Tourism industry in this decade brought many changes is Indian cities. It diversifies social and cultural identity of the city and generates tremendous opportunity for economic development. Therefore cities having tourism potential are facing urban planning problems. Exploring these issues and reasons behind it will be helpful to minimize its impact. Tourism cities have tremendous potential of research in this direction. The need of the decade for urban planners and designers is to be prepared for the changes in a tourist city.

AB  - Questions: What are the spatial processes structuring plant trait composition in urban riparian forest communities at different spatial scales? What arc the relative roles of local conditions (including historical aspects), landscape context and spatial processes in the community assembly of these forests?
   Location: Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: Species plant composition was inventoried in 57 riparian forests located along a gradient of urbanization. To analyse plant communities in terms of their trait composition, community-weighted means were calculated using eight functional traits. Forests were characterized by local (physical.features, hydrological regime and historical disturbances) and landscape (surrounding land use) variables. Spatial processes stnicturing comm unities were assessed using Moran's eigenvector maps and asymmetric eigenvector maps. The relative importance of these three subsets (local, landscape and spatial variables) on tree, shrub and herb functional composition was quantified by variation partitioning using redundancy analyses.
   Results: Functional patterns in riparian forests resulted primarily :front environmental filtering (local and landscape variables). Local conditions, especially flood intensity, exerted an overriding selection pressure on functional composition of riparian plant communities. Urbanization seemed to act indirectly on trait patterns through the alteration of hydrological disturbances caused by ongoing and historical land transformation. Nevertheless, dispersal along rivers was also a significant structuring force, while overland dispersal was negligible.
   Conclusions: Our study highlights that under severe natural disturbance regimes, the effect of natural filters outweighed the negative effects of urban filters. However, the alteration of natural flooding processes by human activities is also a major mechanism influencing plant trait composition in urban riparian communities as forests subjected to reduced flooding intensity experienced a greater effect of urbanization, The effects of urbanization and of past land uses on plant communities were greater for trees than for shrubs and herbs due to the high turnover rate of the latter. Finally, our results showed the importance of dispersal along rivers for biodiversity even in fragmented urban landscapes.

AB  - Fragmentation, degradation and loss of natural habitats are now recognised as major threats to wildlife conservation and mobile pastoralism in East African savannas. These processes are driven primarily by land tenure and policy, increasing human population, expansion of settlements and agricultural farms, road networks, urban development and fencing. To understand and characterise the forces driving habitat fragmentation, we analyse how biophysical (soils, slope, rainfall, rivers) and human-created (roads, towns, parks, quarries) features influence where people choose to fence the land in the Athi-Kaputiei ecosystem of Kenya. We also explore the consequences of land fragmentation through fencing on the abundance and distribution of wildlife and livestock populations. We show that fences are most highly concentrated along the major roads and around the major urban centres. Movements of migratory wildebeest and zebra between the Nairobi National Park and the pastoral Kitengela Plains adjoining the park on the south are getting increasingly impeded by increasing concentration of fences. Populations of wildebeest and other herbivores have collapsed to a small fraction of their former abundance largely owing to destruction of their habitats and obstruction of their movements between the park and the pastoral lands by fences and other land use developments. Conserving the key seasonal wildlife dispersal areas in the Athi-Kaputiei Plains is critical to ensuring the future viability of several key wildlife species in Nairobi National Park. Several initiatives, including a conservation land lease program has been launched, but their spatial coverage and funding levels would need to be greatly expanded to secure sufficient open spaces for both wildlife and livestock.

AB  - Land-use change associated with human development can alter aquatic habitat and imperil aquatic species. Fish are challenged when urban streams are altered, for example for stormwater conveyance, but little is known about how such activities influence the space use of individual fish. Electronic tagging and experimental displacement of fish can be used to explore site fidelity and homing behaviour of fish and can therefore be useful for testing hypotheses about space use and habitat selection. In this study, we used experimental displacement to determine how longnose dace (LND, Rhinichthys cataractae) utilize reaches within a watershed that have varying degrees of degradation. LND were tagged using passive integrated transponders (PIT tags), transported upstream, and released either into the natural stream reach, impaired stormwater drain reach, or at their confluence. Fixed PIT antennas were used to monitor movement of the PIT-tagged fish among the three reaches for a period of 3 weeks. LND exhibited dramatic and rapid selection against the stormwater drain. No LND moved into the drain and 97% of fish transported to the drain left within 24 h. LND were actively avoiding the stormwater drain, emphasizing the need for enhancement work to improve the biological connectivity of the system.

AB  - Passive wind dispersal is one of the major mechanisms through which organisms disperse and colonise new areas. The detailed understanding of which factors affect this process may help to preserve its efficiency for the future. Despite its interest, the analysis of factors affecting the aeroplankton dispersal in urban environments is rare in literature. We sampled the aeroplankton community uninterruptedly every 4 hours from 17 May to 19 September 2011 in the urban garden of Parco d'Orleans, within the campus of the University of Palermo (Sicily). Sampling was performed by means of a Johnson-Taylor suction trap with automatised sample storing. Weather variables were recorded at a local meteorological station. Overall, 11,739 insects were caught during the present study, about 60% of which belonged to the order Hymenoptera, with particular presence of families Agaonidae and Formicidae. The suction trap also captured specimens of very small size, and in some cases, species caught resulted in new records for Italy. Composition and abundance of the aeroplankton community was influenced by alternation of day/night, as well as by daily fluctuations of climatic variables, for example fluctuating temperature. The taxonomic diversity of the samples was also studied, and was higher when the wind blew from the nearby green area. Our findings confirm that passive transport of arthropods strictly depends on weather conditions, and that the presence of natural areas within the urban environment significantly contributes to raising aeroplankton diversity, eventually fuelling overall biodiversity at a local scale.

AB  - In ancient China, urban administration did not emphasize its urban property. The government administrated the cities and rural areas together. This kind of urban administration that is suitable for the agricultural society met a great challenge in modern China. Since modern age, with the communication between other countries among the world, the development gap between China and the rich countries emerged immediately. In big cities, there were administration deficiencies because Chinese people and foreigners lived together, which mocked by other countries. This most obvious gap focus directly showed how the country decline. As for this phenomenon, the government strived for the change of city administration from the beginning of the Westernization Movement, and hoped to change the cities' appearance, however the urban administrative system innovation occurred in the 20th century.

AB  - In face of a dramatic decline of wild bee species in many rural landscapes, potential conservation functions of urban areas gain importance. Yet effects of urbanization on pollinators, and in particular on wild bees remain ambiguous and not comprehensively understood. This is especially true for amenity grassland and extensively managed wastelands within large-scale residential housing areas. Using Berlin as a study region we aimed to investigate (a) if these greenspaces are accepted by wild bee assemblages as foraging habitats; (b) how assemblage structure of bees and individual bee species are affected by different habitat (e.g., management, flower density) and urban matrix variables (e.g., isolation, urbanization); and (c) to what extent grassland restoration can promote bees in urban environments. In summer 2012, we collected 62 bee species belonging to more than 20% of the taxa known for Berlin. Urbanization significantly affected species composition of bees; 18 species were affiliated to different levels of urbanization. Most bee species were not affected by any of the environmental variables tested, and urbanization had a negative effect only for one bee species. Further, we determined that restoration of diverse grasslands positively affected bee species richnesss in urban environments. We conclude that differently structured and managed greenspaces in large-scale housing areas can provide additional foraging habitats and refuges for pollinators. This supports approaches towards a biodiversity friendly management within urban regions and may be of particular importance given that anthropogenic pressure is increasing in many rural landscapes.

AB  - Identifying causes of structural ecosystem shifts often requires understanding trophic structure, an important determinant of energy flow in ecological communities. In coastal pelagic ecosystems worldwide, increasing jellyfish (Cnidaria and Ctenophora) at the expense of small fish has been linked to anthropogenic alteration of basal trophic pathways. However, this hypothesis remains untested in part because baseline description of fish-jellyfish trophic dynamics, and the environmental features that influence them are lacking. Using stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15), we examined spatiotemporal patterns of fish and jellyfish trophic structure in greater Puget Sound, an urbanizing fjord estuary in the NW United States. We quantified niche positions of constituent species, niche widths and trophic overlap between fish and jellyfish assemblages, and several community-level trophic diversity metrics (resource diversity, trophic length, and niche widths) of fish and jellyfish combined. We then related assemblage- and community-level measures to landscape gradients of terrestrial-marine connectivity and anthropogenic influence in adjacent catchments. Relative niche positions among species varied considerably and displayed no clear pattern except that fish generally had higher delta N-15 and lower delta C-13 relative to jellyfish, which resulted in low assemblage-level trophic overlap. Fish assemblages had larger niche widths than jellyfish in most cases and, along with whole community trophic diversity, exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns across oceanographic basins, which was positively correlated to landscape variation in terrestrial connectivity. In contrast, jellyfish niche widths were unrelated to terrestrial connectivity, but weakly negatively correlated to urban land use in adjacent catchments. Our results indicate that fish-jellyfish trophic structure is highly heterogeneous and that disparate processes may underlie the trophic ecology of these taxa; consequently, they may respond divergently to environmental change. In addition, spatiotemporal variation in ecosystem connectivity, in this case through freshwater influence, may influence trophic structure across heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - To better understand how plant-frugivore interactions change in relation to forest stand development, we investigated the abundance and species composition of frugivorous bird assemblages, and their fruit removal over several years in three warm-temperate forest stands. All stands were located in an urban forested area of western Japan, and each was at a different developmental stage: a secondary deciduous broad-leaved forest stand (DB), an evergreen broad-leaved forest stand where an evergreen oak became dominant recently (EB-I), and a well-developed evergreen broad-leaved forest stand (EB-II). Although the species richness and Shannon diversity indices of frugivorous birds did not vary among the three stands, the abundance of birds was almost always greatest in the EB-II stand, lowest in the DB stand, and intermediate in the EB-I stand. Generalized linear mixed model analyses using data on monthly fruit availability and the number of frugivorous birds observed in censuses showed that forest stand differences had a significant effect on the abundance of frugivorous birds, whereas fruit availability had no significant positive influence on bird abundance. Fruit removal was most intensive in the EB-II stand, where both fruit and bird abundance were highest, followed by the EB-I stand, where bird abundance was intermediate but fruit abundance was lowest. Our study demonstrates that increasing structural complexity during forest stand development likely had positive effects on the abundance of frugivorous birds, which in turn influenced fruit removal in this urban forested area. Hence, a positive feedback mechanism of plant-bird interactions would exist for the development of forest stands.

AB  - This study addresses the processes related to the transformation of the territory in which the Roman city of Bracara Augusta was founded, in order to establish an interaction between the urban context and the new rural landscape that emerged from the integration of this region into the Roman Empire. This paper will discuss the context of pre-Roman occupation in which the city developed, the context of its foundation and the key features of its urban planning, proceeding finally to an appreciation of the new sites and findings that help us to define the Roman presence in the surrounding rural area, with an emphasis on the main road network, cemeteries and settlement remains. It will then focus on data associated with the analysis of the roman rural centuriation that marked a profound change of the landscape and occupation of the territory.

AB  - As deforestation and urbanization continue at rapid rates in tropical regions, urban forest patches are essential repositories of biodiversity. However, almost nothing is known about gene flow of forest-dependent tree species in urban landscapes. In this study, we investigated gene flow in the insect-pollinated, wind-dispersed tropical tree Koompassia malaccensis in and among three remnant forest patches in the urbanized landscape of Singapore. We genotyped the vast majority of adults (N = 179) and a large number of recruits (N = 2103) with 8 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. Spatial genetic structure of the recruit and adult cohorts was significant, showing routine gene dispersal distances of similar to 100-400 m. Parentage analysis showed that 97% of recruits were within 100 m of their mother tree, and a high frequency of relatively short-distance pollen dispersal (median similar to 143-187 m). Despite routine seed and pollen dispersal distances of within a few hundred meters, interpatch gene flow occurred between all patches and was dominated by pollen movement: parentage analysis showed 76 pollen versus 2 seed interpatch dispersal events, and the seedling neighborhood model estimated similar to 1-6% seed immigration and similar to 21-46% pollen immigration rates, depending on patch. In addition, the smallest patch (containing five adult K. malaccensis trees) was entirely surrounded by 42.5 km of 'impervious' substrate, yet had the highest proportional pollen and seed immigration estimates of any patch. Hence, contrary to our hypothesis, insect-mediated gene flow persisted across an urban landscape, and several of our results also parallel key findings from insect-pollinated canopy trees sampled in mixed agricultural-forest landscapes.

AB  - Spontaneous vegetation established on the city wall constitutes a characteristic greenspace within the urban matrix. Nanjing city wall of the Ming Dynasty (NJCW), as an extraordinary huge defensive masonry project, was built in 1393, the extant, basically intact ancient city wall is 25.09 km long, 9-26 m high, and is protected now as a key national cultural relic. Species composition and life forms of the vascular plants established on the vertical or inclined wall surfaces of NJCW were investigated, and its diaspore sources and dispersal modes were also analyzed. Totally, 159 species in 125 genera of 70 families were found inhabiting the joints between bricks or between block stones, trees, shrubs and woody lianas accounts for 51.57% of the species assemblage, while herbaceous plant species makes up 48.43% of them. Fifteen alien species were found colonizing NJCW, including 12 invasive species. Six 100-m-long quadrats were sampled in different segments of NJCW, each quadrat contained 39-77 species, and 755-3006 individuals. In total, 10785 individuals of vascular plants were recorded, consisting of 104 species in 89 genera of 56 families. 65.25% of the total individuals, and 53.85% of the total species are adapted to the primary dispersal of diaspores by wind, whereas 34.75% of the individual assemblage, and 46.15% of the species assemblage are adapted to the primary dispersal of seeds by birds. A bird-dispersed, native pioneer tree, Broussonetia papyrifera, was the most abundant species among the six quadrats, even developed coppices on the vertical wall surface. Location and aspect of the quadrats may have affected the species diversity of vascular plants established on its wall surfaces. A diversity of vascular plants established on NJCW, as a valuable urban ecological heritage, is worthy of sustainable wall management, while management priorities should be given to those large trees inhabiting the walls made of bricks, and to the invasive alien species to prevent them from further spreading over the adjacent urban habitats.

AB  - Human population migrations, as well as long-distance trade activities, have been responsible for the spread of many invasive organisms. The black rat, Rattus rattus, has colonized most of the world following ship-mediated trade. Owing to its tight association with human infrastructures, this species has been able to survive in unfavourable environments, such as Sahelian Africa. In this work, we combined interview-based and population genetic surveys to investigate the processes underlying the ongoing invasion of south-western Niger by black rats, with special emphasis on the capital city, Niamey. Our trapping and interview data are quite congruent, and all together point towards a patchy, but rather widespread, current distribution of R. rattus. Genetic data strongly suggest that road network development for truck-based commercial flow from/to international harbours located in neighbouring countries (Benin, Togo, and Nigeria) facilitates the passive dispersal of black rats over a long distance through unfavourable landscapes. Another potentially, more ancient, invasion route may be associated with boat transport along the Niger River. Human-mediated dispersal thus probably allows the foundation of persisting populations within highly anthropized areas while population dynamics may be more unstable in remote areas and mostly depends on propagule pressure.

AB  - The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed gorse (Ulex europaeus, Fabaceae), a heliophilous evergreen shrub, as one of the world's 100 worst invasive species. Over the years, multiple attempts have been made for controlling gorse, including biological methods, but they have not been fully successful. This study aims to investigate some aspects that still remain unexplored such as the relationship between anthropogenic disturbances with the spatial mechanisms of species spread. We aimed to fill this gap by analyzing the role of transportation network configurations and landscape context on gorse propagation. We surveyed the presence of gorse in southern Brazilian forest-grassland mosaics by completing landscape-level road transects coupled with remote sensing, to evaluate land use and landscape structure. A binary logistic regression model was performed to test the influence of independent variables (e.g., road orientation, type and category in addition to distance to the nearest habitat patch of forest, grassland and anthropogenic area) on gorse occurrence. Our results showed that the structure of road networks can facilitate the spread of heliophilous taxa like gorse. Specifically, local, paved, NWSE and NS-oriented (which exhibited high light exposure) roads had the highest probability of finding gorse. This suggests that human transportation activity (traffic, road construction, and maintenance) constitutes a significant dispersal agent for the species. In addition, the landscape matrix context also played a significant role; gorse was most prevalent along roadsides close to urban or agricultural areas than to forests and grasslands. No area was completely free from disturbances, such as fire, livestock grazing, and silviculture, in these seminatural landscapes. We concluded that, disturbances affecting small-scale processes, at roadside and adjacent habitat patches, were probably as important factors explaining gorse occurrence as the urban impact. Furthermore, the current work also emphasizes the need of understanding the complexity of interacting factors. Our work has important implications for ecosystem conservation and habitat management, and consequently should be considered a prior step in establishing new approaches for gorse control.

AB  - In this article, the laws since 1923 regarding urban, urbanization, zoning and applications on these areas are elaborated. Up until 1950's, there was not a significant urbanization movement in Turkey except the city of Ankara. Ankara, which was declared as the new capital city, began to develop rapidly and started to receive migration after the date of being the capital. Laws and plannings regarding the cities as well as construction activities and other applications in urban planning firstly started in the Ankara district and these applications have been a model for other cities.
   Just after the end of World War II, the squatter housing phenomena intitially started in Ankara before the squatter housing trend in Turkey which is occured as a result of the internal migration from rural to urban that is stimulated by the mechanization in agriculture, expansion of the highway network, the transition to multiparty regime and other factors. The ones who came to Ankara to work initially built buildings called "baraka" (shanty) in the neighborhoods which are mentioned in a law dated 1924, they were close to business centers and settled areas, and they were located in the areas without building permission, these jerry-built houses can be considered as the pioneers of squatter houses. Squatter houses became prevalent in Ankara and in other big cities of Turkey before 1950's.

AB  - Rapid urbanization is a growing threat to biodiversity, causing wide-scale extirpation of species from their natural habitats. Some species such as rock agamas, Psammophilus dorsalis, seem to be sufficiently tolerant and continue to persist in urban environments. Given that urbanization alters species composition at multiple trophic levels, we expect a shift in the diet composition and hunting modes of populations across rural and urban areas. Based on identified contents from stomach flushes, we found that P. dorsalis are generally myrmecophagous, and their diet is mainly composed of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Diet of males and females in each area overlapped highly (80-91%), even though males were significantly larger than females. Dietary overlap between urban and rural populations also was high (80.3%). Surprisingly, rural lizards had lower body mass indices than did urban lizards, despite the greater diversity of prey types and the larger volume of food consumed. This species uses a sit-and-wait hunting strategy, but we found that the rate of movement of males was higher in rural areas compared to urban areas, which likely results in higher energy expenditure. Individuals of P. dorsalis do not seem to be negatively affected by urbanization but instead manage to hunt in and around the small patches of vegetation that remain, enabling them to maintain a higher body condition than that of lizards in undisturbed rural habitats.

AB  - Invasive mammalian carnivores contribute disproportionately to declines in global biodiversity. In California, nonnative red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have significantly impacted endangered ground-nesting birds and native canids. These foxes derive primarily from captive-reared animals associated with the fur-farming industry. Over the past five decades, the cumulative area occupied by nonnative red fox increased to cover much of central and southern California. We used a landscape-genetic approach involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 13 microsatellites of 402 nonnative red foxes removed in predator control programs to investigate source populations, contemporary connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics. Both markers indicated high population structuring consistent with origins from multiple introductions and low subsequent gene flow. Landscape-genetic modeling indicated that population connectivity was especially low among coastal sampling sites surrounded by mountainous wildlands but somewhat higher through topographically flat, urban and agricultural landscapes. The genetic composition of populations tended to be stable for multiple generations, indicating a degree of demographic resilience to predator removal programs. However, in two sites where intensive predator control reduced fox abundance, we observed increases in immigration, suggesting potential for recolonization to counter eradication attempts. These findings, along with continued genetic monitoring, can help guide localized management of foxes by identifying points of introductions and routes of spread and evaluating the relative importance of reproduction and immigration in maintaining populations. More generally, the study illustrates the utility of a landscape-genetic approach for understanding invasion dynamics and metapopulation structure of one of the world's most destructive invasive mammals, the red fox.

AB  - Urbanization has been linked to amphibian population declines globally. Habitat fragmentation can negatively impact gene flow among populations but what role artificially constructed wetlands have in maintaining gene flow in urban amphibian populations remains uncertain. We assessed gene flow in a population of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) inhabiting both constructed and natural wetlands located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We genotyped 10 microsatellite loci in 182 frogs from eight wetlands and tested for genetic differentiation between wetlands. We tested if bottlenecks had occurred at constructed wetlands and if there were differences in allelic richness between natural wetlands and constructed wetlands. We found no evidence of bottlenecks, no differences in allelic richness among subpopulations, and no genetic structure within the population. Although significant differences in pair-wise comparisons of allele frequency distributions between wetlands were detected, all F-ST values were low (0.003-0.053) and Bayesian clustering indicated the presence of a single genetic cluster. Despite extensive urbanization within our study area, genetic homogeneity has been preserved indicating that it may be possible to use constructed wetlands to maintain amphibian populations and preserve gene flow among subpopulations living within urbanized landscapes.

AB  - Urban landscapes can be transformed by widespread abandonment from population and economic decline. Ecological assembly, sometimes referred to as greening, following abandonment can yield valuable ecosystem services, but also can pose a risk to public health. Abandonment can elevate zoonotic vector-borne disease risk by favoring the hyperabundance of commensal pests and pathogen vectors. Though greater biodiversity in abandoned areas can potentially dilute vector-borne pathogen transmission, greening can elevate transmission risk by increasing movement of pathogen vectors between fragmented areas and by giving rise to novel human-wildlife interfaces. Idled and derelict infrastructure can further elevate disease risk from vector-borne and water-borne pathogens, which can build up in stagnant and unprotected water that maintenance and routine use of delivery or sanitation systems would otherwise eliminate. Thus, framing greening as inherently positive could result in policies and actions that unintentionally exacerbate inequalities by elevating risks rather than delivering benefits. As counter-urbanism is neither a minor pattern of urban development, nor a short-term departure from urban growth, homeowner and municipal management of abandoned areas should account for potential hazards to reduce health risks. Further socioecological assessments of public health risks following abandonment could better ensure the resilience and well-being of communities in shrinking cities.

AB  - 1. Invertebrates inhabiting marine and freshwater ecosystems make important contributions to global biodiversity and provide significant services that have cascading effects across ecosystems. However, this group is grossly under-represented in assessments of conservation status and often neglected in targeted aquatic conservation efforts.
   2. In global assessments of 7857 freshwater invertebrates and 2864 marine invertebrates, 30-34% were considered Data Deficient highlighting the paucity of information for making such assessments. Of the invertebrate groups that could be assessed, those with poor dispersal abilities and high local endemism, such as many gastropods, crayfish and mussels, are the most threatened.
   3. Springs and subterranean hydrological systems support the highest proportions of threatened freshwater species, while in marine environments coral reefs, lagoons and anchialine systems are particularly vulnerable.
   4. Key agents of biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems are water pollution, overexploitation and harvesting, habitat degradation and destruction, alien invasive species, and climate change. Effects of dams and water management along with pollution from urban, agricultural and forestry sources are the main threats in freshwater ecosystems, whereas a broad range of factors have impacts on marine invertebrates, including biological resource use.
   5. Significant impediments facing conservation of aquatic invertebrates are limited knowledge of their diversity, the need for broadscale actions to account for connectivity within and across ecosystems, lack of political will and investment, and the prospect that conditions may get worse before they improve, possibly not in time to save some already highly imperilled invertebrate species from extinction.

AB  - Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) were extirpated from most of the continental United States by widespread use of the pesticide DDT in the 1960s. Populations have rebounded with banning of the pesticide and successful implementation of captive breeding and hacking programs. An essentially new population of Midwestern peregrines now exists that is comprised almost entirely of urban-nesting birds. The new population is considered to be of mixed ancestry, occurs at relatively high densities, and has nest sites in close proximity, factors that could influence breeding behaviors including mate fidelity, nest-site fidelity, extrapair paternity, and natal dispersal. We investigated these behaviors using a combination of field observations and DNA microsatellite genotyping. Data for eleven microsatellite DNA markers, including eight newly developed for the species, were analyzed from a total of 350 birds from nine Midwestern cities, representing 149 broods collected at 20 nest sites. To document breeding behavior, parentage was inferred by likelihood techniques when both parents were sampled and by parental genotype reconstruction when only one parent was sampled. In cases where neither parent was sampled, a sibship reconstruction approach was used. We found high mate fidelity and nest-site fidelity in urban peregrines; in 122 nesting attempts made by long-term breeders, only 12 (9.8%) mate changes and six (4.9%) nest-site changes occurred. Only one brood (of 35 tested) revealed extra-pair paternity and involved a male tending two offspring of a recently acquired mate. Natal dispersal patterns indicated that female peregrines dispersed on average 226 km, almost twice the distance of males (average 124 km). Despite the novel environment of cities, our results suggest that monogamous breeding, nest fidelity, and female natal dispersal are high in urban peregrines, not unlike other raptors living in non-urban habitats.

AB  - Urban green space provides health benefits for city dwellers, and new evidence suggests that microorganisms associated with soil and vegetation could play a role. While airborne microorganisms are ubiquitous in urban areas, the influence of nearby vegetation on airborne microbial communities remains poorly understood. We examined airborne microbial communities in parks and parking lots in Eugene, Oregon, using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina MiSeq platform to identify bacterial taxa, and GIS to measure vegetation cover in buffer zones of different diameters. Our goal was to explore variation among highly vegetated (parks) versus non-vegetated (parking lots) urban environments. A secondary objective was to evaluate passive versus active collection methods for outdoor airborne microbial sampling. Airborne bacterial communities from five parks were different from those of five parking lots (p = 0.023), although alpha diversity was similar. Direct gradient analysis showed that the proportion of vegetated area within a 50 m radius of the sampling station explained 15% of the variation in bacterial community composition. A number of key taxa, including several Acidobacteriaceae were substantially more abundant in parks, while parking lots had higher relative abundance of Acetobacteraceae. Parks had greater beta diversity than parking lots, i.e. individual parks were characterized by unique bacterial signatures, whereas parking lot communities tended to be similar to each other. Although parks and parking lots were selected to form pairs of nearby sites, spatial proximity did not appear to affect compositional similarity. Our results also showed that passive and active collection methods gave comparable results, indicating the "settling dish" method is effective for outdoor airborne sampling. This work sets a foundation for understanding how urban vegetation may impact microbial communities, with potential implications for designing neighborhoods and open space systems that foster better human health.

AB  - Changes in land cover during urbanization profoundly affect the diversity of bird communities, but the demographic mechanisms affecting diversity are poorly known. We advance such understanding by documenting how urbanization influences breeding dispersal-the annual movement of territorial adults-of six songbird species in the Seattle, WA, USA metropolitan area. We color-banded adults and mapped the centers of their annual breeding activities from 2000-2010 to obtain 504 consecutive movements by 337 adults. By comparing movements, annual reproduction, and mate fidelity among 10 developed, 5 reserved, and 11 changing (areas cleared and developed during our study) landscapes, we determined that adaptive breeding dispersal of sensitive forest species (Swainson's Thrush and Pacific wren), which involves shifting territory and mate after reproductive failure, was constrained by development. In changing lands, sensitive forest specialists dispersed from active development to nearby forested areas, but in so doing suffered low annual reproduction. Species tolerant of suburban lands (song sparrow, spotted towhee, dark-eyed junco, and Bewick's wren) dispersed adaptively in changing landscapes. Site fidelity ranged from 0% (Pacific wren in changing landscape) to 83% (Bewick's wren in forest reserve). Mate fidelity ranged from 25% (dark-eyed junco) to 100% (Bewick's wren). Variation in fidelity to mate and territory was consistent with theories positing an influence of territory quality, asynchronous return from migration, prior productivity, and reproductive benefits of retaining a familiar territory. Costly breeding dispersal, as well as reduced reproductive success and lowered survival cause some birds to decline in the face of urbanization. In contrast, the ability of species that utilize edges and early successional habitats to breed successfully, disperse to improve reproductive success after failure, and survive throughout the urban ecosystem enables them to maintain or increase population size.

AB  - The first decade of the 21st century was a period of economic and demographic expansion and impressive urban development in Spain's big cities, including Barcelona and Valencia. This growth came along with a great effort to develop new territorial, sectoral and urban plans which would direct it, but which were not always successful. Nevertheless, these planning endeavors were not without critiques from social agents. In fact, throughout that decade we observed a growing distrust towards the institutional forms of citizen representation, and the ways and procedures of urban governance and spatial planning. This paper shows some important results of a systematic analysis based on print-media of urban conflicts related to land-use changes that emerged during a critical time period in two Spanish metropolitan areas: Barcelona and Valencia. The aim of this paper is to compare the evolution of urban conflicts in both cities that occurred between 2002 and 2012, from the point of view of social movements and their activists. The analysis of conflict activity between both cities gives interesting clues about where and why conflicts emerge and adds some pertinent reflections on the increasing problems of metropolitan governance in Spanish cities. During the mentioned period a deep transformation was witnessed in the types of conflicts that tend to emerge in these cities: from the reactive and isolated not in my back yard-like campaigns to broader protest movements like the 15 movement in the 2010s. The new movements appear to be participating actively in land-use or locational conflicts, but in fact reach far beyond these specific plans. They criticize not only the specific plans, but use this criticism to launch broader critiques of how their city is ruled and for whom.

AB  - Assessing the status and monitoring the trends of land cover dynamics in and around protected areas is of utmost importance for park managers and decision makers. Moreover, to support the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)'s Strategic Action Plan including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, such efforts are necessary to set a framework to reach the agreed national, regional or global targets. The integration of land use/cover change (LULCC) data with information on habitats and population density provides the means to assess potential degradation and disturbance resulting from anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and urban area expansion. This study assesses the LULCC over a 20 year (1990-2000-2010) period using freely available Landsat imagery and a dedicated method and toolbox for the Udzungwa Mountains National Park (UMNP) and its surroundings (20 km buffer) in Tanzania. Habitat data gathered from the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA)'s eHabitat+ Web service were used to perform ecological stratification of the study area and to develop similarity maps of the potential presence of comparable habitat types outside the protected area. Finally, integration of the habitat similarity maps with the LULCC data was applied in order to evaluate potential pressures on the different habitats within the national park and on the linking corridors between UMNP and other protected areas in the context of wildlife movement and migration. The results show that the UMNP has not suffered from relevant human activities during the study period. The natural vegetation area has remained stable around 1780 km(2). In the surrounding 20 km buffer area and the connecting corridors, however, the anthropogenic impact has been strong. Artificially built up areas increased by 14.24% over the last 20 years and the agriculture area increased from 11% in 1990 to 30% in the year 2010. The habitat functional types and the similarity maps confirmed the importance of the buffer zone and the connecting corridors for wildlife movements, while the similarity maps detected other potential corridors for wildlife.

FX  - The study was accomplished within the framework of the BIOPAMA (Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management) project, a four year initiative (2012-2016) funded by resources from the intra-ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) envelope of the 10th European Development Fund (EDF). BIOPAMA aims to address threats to biodiversity in the ACP countries, while reducing poverty in communities in and around protected areas [70]. It is also the first step towards supporting a new European Union (EU) strategy for wildlife conservation in Africa, focusing on key conservation landscapes [69] rather than on individual, independent protected areas.

AB  - The western area of Naples is characterized by the forestal landscape of the Camaldoli hills, the territory of which builds a system of cultural and environmental values that are very important. The Camaldoli woods are one of the city's most important landscape areas; conterminous with the Campi Flegrei Regional Park, the woods is in the perimeter of the Parco Metropolitano delle Colline di Napoli (Napoli Hills' Metropolitan Park) that includes the Selva di Chiaiano, Vallone San Rocco, Scudillo and the Conche dei Pisani. As residual green areas, these forestal systems work as diaphragm between the inner city and the suburbs, offering a wide-range eco-system service. The valorization of the Bosco dei Camaldoli has to be aimed at matching, in eco-friendly terms, the imbalance of the metropolitan area whose demographic increase has determined an incredible destruction of natural resources generating several problems in the territory; to remedy the problem, the management of the city will have to consider the priority of the safeguard of biodiversity and the landscape heritage inserting within the planning processes the environmental and natural factors.

AB  - Mammalian carnivores have suffered the biggest range contraction among all biodiversity and are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Therefore, we identified priority areas for the conservation of mammalian carnivores, while accounting for species-specific requirements for connectivity and expected agricultural and urban expansion. While prioritizing for carnivores only, we were also able to test their effectiveness as surrogates for 23,110 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles and 867 terrestrial ecoregions. We then assessed the risks to carnivore conservation within each country that makes a contribution to global carnivore conservation. We found that land use change will potentially lead to important range losses, particularly amongst already threatened carnivore species. In addition, the 17% of land targeted for protection under the Aichi Target 11 was found to be inadequate to conserve carnivores under expected land use change. Our results also highlight that land use change will decrease the effectiveness of carnivores to protect other threatened species, especially threatened amphibians. In addition, the risk of human-carnivore conflict is potentially high in countries where we identified spatial priorities for their conservation. As meeting the global biodiversity target will be inadequate for carnivore protection, innovative interventions are needed to conserve carnivores outside protected areas to compliment any proposed expansion of the protected area network.

AB  - Urban expansion and associated habitat fragmentation are expected to be detrimental to global biodiversity. Natural habitat that is extensively modified often poses challenges to native fauna that must adapt to new conditions to survive. While some species decline in numbers or become locally extinct, the Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) successfully inhabits cities. Because squirrels are sensitive to habitat fragmentation and their space-use patterns are influenced by the distribution and abundance of major food resources, their movement patterns are likely to be modified in response to changes in environmental conditions brought about by urbanization. Therefore, to investigate whether supplementary food resources are key to its success, the home ranges of squirrels inhabiting a large city park were related to both natural food sources (NFS) and anthropogenically-provided food sources (PFS) in 3 seasons. The combination of home ranges that were relatively small, year-round food availability and the lack of a seasonal body mass change indicates that the semi-urban environment can be high-quality habitat. The squirrels' home ranges encompassed areas with a year-round NFS supply, but they shifted their home range core areas closer to PFS in seasons where they were more reliable, even though NFS were also abundant at the time. Additionally, heavier individuals' core areas were located closer to PFS. Consequently, our results show that human activity (i.e., via PFS) had a direct, measureable effect on squirrels' feeding habits and movement patterns even though NFS were available. However, the consequences of urbanization are not always detrimental for native animal species and an improved knowledge of energy resources and their effect on habitat use is important for understanding and minimizing the long-term impacts of humans on urban wildlife.

AB  - Contemporary germplasm conservation studies largely focus on ex situ and in situ management of diversity within centers of genetic diversity. Transnational migrants who transport and introduce landraces to new locations may catalyze a third type of conservation that combines both approaches. Resulting populations may support reduced diversity as a result of evolutionary forces such as genetic drift, selection, and gene flow, yet they may also be more diverse as a result of multiple introductions, selective breeding and cross pollination among multiple introduced varietals. In this study, we measured the amount and structure of maize molecular genetic diversity in samples collected from home gardens and community gardens maintained by immigrant farmers in Southern California. We used the same markers to measure the genetic diversity and structure of commercially available maize varieties and compared our data to previously reported genetic diversity statistics of Mesoamerican landraces. Our results reveal that transnational dispersal creates an opportunity for the maintenance of maize genetic diversity beyond its recognized centers of diversity.

AB  - Urban landscapes are a mixture of built structures, human-altered vegetation, and remnant semi-natural areas. The spatial arrangement of abiotic and biotic conditions resulting from urbanization doubtless influences the establishment and spread of non-native species in a city.
   We investigated the effects of habitat structure, thermal microclimates, and species coexistence on the spread of a non-native lizard (Anolis cristatellus) in the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida (USA).
   We used transect surveys to estimate lizard occurrence and abundance on trees and to measure vegetation characteristics, and we assessed forest cover and impervious surface using GIS. We sampled lizard body temperatures, habitat use, and relative abundance at multiple sites.
   At least one of five Anolis species occupied 79 % of the 1035 trees surveyed in primarily residential areas, and non-native A. cristatellus occupied 25 % of trees. Presence and abundance of A. cristatellus were strongly associated with forest patches, dense vegetation, and high canopy cover, which produced cooler microclimates suitable for this species. Presence of A. cristatellus was negatively associated with the ecologically similar non-native A. sagrei, resulting in reduced abundance and a shift in perch use of A. cristatellus.
   The limited spread of A. cristatellus in Miami over 35 years is due to the patchy, low-density distribution of wooded habitat, which limits dispersal by diffusion. The presence of congeners may also limit spread. Open habitats-some parks, yards and roadsides-contain few if any A. cristatellus, and colonization of isolated forest habitat appears to depend on human-mediated dispersal.

AB  - The dynamics of fauna in coastal ecosystems are influenced by seasonal patterns in the oceanographic environment. It is well known that the monsoon along south-west coast of India influences the movement and spawning of fishes. Thus, they have direct effect on the richness, abundance and evenness of fish diversity in the ecosystem. This study investigates how the monsoon affects the commercial gillnet fishery along the coast of Goa. Fishing experiments were conducted in popular gillnet fishing grounds and the temporal pattern in diversity indices between October 2013 and September 2014 was assessed. A total of 124 fish species (40 families), 16 crustacean species (4 families) and 9 molluscan species (8 families) were recorded. The species diversity was found to be significantly different during the monsoon season and the species abundance distribution followed a geometric series during this period indicating signs of ecosystem perturbations. The economic and biological aspects of gillnet fishing in relation to the monsoon season in Goa are also discussed.

AB  - Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) forests provide unique riparian zones that can influence adjacent streams, but increasing mortality from the invasive Adelges tsugae (Hemlock Woolly Adelgid) is eliminating this distinctive landscape component in some regions. The objective of this study was to determine if a stream section within a hemlock ravine harbored a unique benthic community as compared to other sections of the stream that could be threatened in the event of a Hemlock Woolly Adelgid outbreak. We sampled benthic algae and macroinvertebrates in an unnamed tributary of Sugar Creek within Beach City Wildlife Area, OH, in April and September 2015. The stream flows through 3 riparian habitats: beech-maple upland forest, hemlock ravine, and lowland forest dominated by Acer saccharinum (Silver Maple), A. negundo (Box Elder), and Platanus occidentalis (American Sycamore). Our results show that Chironomidae, Navicula, Caloneis, and Nitzschia were the dominant taxa across all 3 stream sections, but that benthic macroinvertebrate richness and density were significantly lower in the hemlock ravine when compared to the lowland habitat. Periphyton community metrics were not significantly affected by riparian habitat. Overall, seasonality was more influential than riparian habitat on benthic community composition; specific taxa were indicative of either the spring or summer season. Connectivity between stream sites and/or the abundance of sandstone bedrock substrate at many sample locations might account for the similarity in benthic communities across these 3 habitats.

AB  - Calls for a transformation towards more sustainable consumption and production (SCP) have been intensifying. As urban populations swell across the planet, cities are faced with increasing pressure on infrastructure, economic and ecological systems. Yet, with their high population densities and ubiquity of information and communication technologies, cities are becoming breeding grounds for a new, circular economy driven by emerging and long-standing sharing activities. This research provides a comprehensive view of SCP systems in cities by integrating and examining sharing economy activities in the context of two continuums, i.e. SCP and private/public orientation. Based on these two analytical dimensions, the paper evaluates and plots five groups of 18 sharing activities to create a Sharing Cities-SCP Typology comprised by five ideal types. Each of these five types represents a unique form of SCP activity, with the potential to directly impact SCP systems in the context of urban environments. By enabling diversity and hybridity in the SCP analysis, we allow for a theoretical expansion of SCP models and a new way of understanding how they may play out in cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Landscape ecology is a discipline that explicitly considers the influence of time and space on the environmental patterns we observe and the processes that create them. Although many of the topics studied in landscape ecology have public policy implications, three are of particular concern: climate change; land use-land cover change (LULCC); and a particular type of LULCC, urbanization. These processes are interrelated, because LULCC is driven by both human activities (e.g., agricultural expansion and urban sprawl) and climate change (e.g., desertification). Climate change, in turn, will affect the way humans use landscapes. Interactions among these drivers of ecosystem change can have destabilizing and accelerating feedback, with consequences for human societies from local to global scales. These challenges require landscape ecologists to engage policymakers and practitioners in seeking long-term solutions, informed by an understanding of opportunities to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic drivers on ecosystems and adapt to new ecological realities.

AB  - The spread of alien plant species by vehicles profoundly affects the roadside vegetation. Roads with high traffic densities in urban regions may facilitate the invasion of alien plants. The present study examined the effects of road type and distance to the city centre on native and alien plant species in both the aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank of road verges in originally dry steppe grasslands in the surroundings of Pavlodar, Western Siberia, Kazakhstan. This region is characterized by a recent change of land use and rapidly expanding urbanization. Vegetation surveys were conducted at 12 sites distributed along roads with different traffic densities (national and local roads) and at two distances to the city centre (city edge and rural surroundings). The seedling-emergence method was used to examine the soil seed bank at each site. We found a larger percentage of alien species along national roads (42 % in the aboveground vegetation, 57 % in the soil seed bank) than along local roads (20 and 44 %, respectively), which can be explained by differences in traffic density, location from which the vehicles come and habitat conditions. More alien species were found in the road verges at the city edge than in the rural surroundings along both road types, probably due to the spread of propagules from residential areas. Our study demonstrates that national roads are important pathways for the introduction of alien species in this Western Siberian region.

AB  - With increasing urbanization, urban-fragmented landscapes are becoming more and more prevalent worldwide. Such fragmentation may lead to small, isolated populations that face great threats from genetic factors that affect even avian species with high dispersal propensities. Yet few studies have investigated the population genetics of species living within urban-fragmented landscapes in the Old World tropics, in spite of the high levels of deforestation and fragmentation within this region. We investigated the evolutionary history and population genetics of the olive-winged bulbul (Pycnonotus plumosus) in Singapore, a highly urbanized island which retains <5% of its original forest cover in fragments. Combining our own collected and sequenced samples with those from the literature, we conducted phylogenetic and population genetic analyses. We revealed high genetic diversity, evidence for population expansion, and potential presence of pronounced gene flow across the population in Singapore. This suggests increased chances of long-term persistence for the olive-winged bulbul and the ecosystem services it provides within this landscape.

AB  - In the last years, public spaces in urban centers have been the focus of attention of professionals in architecture, urban planning, sociology, anthropology, geography and, also, the users who frequent them. Squares occupy a central place in the network of public spaces in the city center and offer a unique landscape that is defined by relationship between their land they occupy and the buildings that outline them. But this landscape is deteriorating due to the renovation of historic buildings and aggressive action on the ground. The analysis of the level of deterioration of the buildings and ground of the 79 squares in the historic center of Madrid shows the intensity of this phenomenon, points to the explanatory factors and attempt to diagnose the current quality of these areas. The results of this empirical study seek to contribute to the understanding of the current crisis of public spaces and the legal initiatives which aim to restrict it.

AB  - Dams, levees, and water withdrawals disrupt hydrologic regimes and associated floodplain forests. Because these forests are also responding to changes in land use, species invasions, and climate change, the relative effects of these factors are hard to disentangle. Most studies of floodplain forests lack historic data, requiring us to rely on recent data or contemporary spatial relationships to these drivers to infer those causes of vegetation dynamics. Here, we use survey data from the 1950s to reconstruct plant community changes across 40 floodplain forests in Wisconsin. We applied two partial least squares regression (PLS) models to evaluate how current site and landscape scale conditions and changes in these conditions since the 1950s influence contemporary patterns of community diversity and composition. Local site variables were among the most important in explaining current composition metrics and their changes, but historic landscape variables and changes in these were also important. Current local diversity () was the highest at sites prone to frequent flooding, even at sites in fragmented landscapes. Sites along sinuous rivers in large watershed areas with more contiguous forest had the highest abundance of wetland indicator plants in the re-survey and had the largest increases in diversity since the 1950s, despite having the highest presence of exotic species then. These same sites have converged in composition, reflecting increases in wetland indicator plants and common native species. These patterns of increasing diversity coupled with declines in community distinctiveness are uncommon among long-term studies. Increases in wetland plants may indicate that sites have become wetter with hydrologic changes, but these increases may also reflect improved colonization and establishment processes involving a robust regional pool of generalist wetland taxa. Woody and exotic plants typical of upland forests increased at rarely flooded sites in fragmented and urbanizing landscapes, indicating shifts towards a later-successional conditions and a dampened disturbance regime. This has reduced local species diversity and increased regional distinctness at some sites. As hydrologic connections appear to best maintain native species diversity and composition, even in fragmented landscapes, managers should seek to recreate these whenever feasible.

AB  - Special conditions are required for genetic differentiation to arise at a local geographical scale in the face of gene flow. The Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, is the most widely distributed and abundant rodent in sub-Saharan Africa. A notorious agricultural pest and a natural host for many zoonotic diseases, it can live in close proximity to humans and appears to compete with other rodents for the synanthropic niche. We surveyed its population genetic structure across a 180-km transect in central Tanzania along which the landscape varied between agricultural land in a rural setting and natural woody vegetation, rivers, roads and a city (Morogoro). We sampled M. natalensis across 10 localities and genotyped 15 microsatellite loci from 515 individuals. Hierarchical STRUCTURE analyses show a K-invariant pattern distinguishing Morogoro suburbs (located in the centre of the transect) from nine surrounding rural localities. Landscape connectivity analyses in Circuitscape and comparison of rainfall patterns suggest that neither geographical isolation nor natural breeding asynchrony could explain the genetic differentiation of the urban population. Using the isolation-with-migration model implemented in IMa2, we inferred that a split between suburban and rural populations would have occurred recently (<150 years ago) with higher urban effective population density consistent with an urban source to rural sink of effective migration. The observed genetic differentiation of urban multimammate mice is striking given the uninterrupted distribution of the animal throughout the landscape and the high estimates of effective migration (2N(e)M = 3.0 and 29.7), suggesting a strong selection gradient across the urban boundary.

AB  - Latin America is one of the world's most urbanised regions, with more than 80% of inhabitants living in urban areas and over 50 cities with at least 1 million inhabitants. The concept of urban structure types (UST) allows the dynamics of a growing urban environment to be captured in its quantity and quality. They are defined as areas of homogenous appearance in the urban matrix with a recognisable mixture of built-up areas and open spaces. We used the vegetation-impervious-soil (V-I-S) model approach to classify and monitor different types of USTs in Santiago (similar to 800 km2), Chile between 1985 and 2015. The V-I-S model is based on a simplification of the large diversity of urban land cover types in three general categories: vegetation, impervious surfaces and soil. These categories were obtained by processing Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI images. First, we applied standard radiometric calibration and co-registration methods to all datasets. Second, using a linear spectral unmixing algorithm we performed a soft classification of urban land cover types (end members): trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants, soils, buildings, roads and water bodies. All end members were validated using a combination of photointerpretation on high-resolution images (similar to 1 m) and field data collection (only for 2015). In each pixel we used the resulting probability scores, logically grouped, to obtain final values for each V-I-S component. Third, we used statistical clustering of V-I-S values to create a set of eight pixel groups, which we interpreted as USTs and mapped them for each date. The overall accuracy for V-I-S components in 1985 and 2015 were 78% and 82%, respectively, and errors did not exhibit any spatial correlation. The main sources of differentiation between USTs were the trade-off proportions between vegetation and impervious components, whereas soil proportions remained near 5% across the city in both dates. To analyse the change in UST spatial configuration between dates, we used a set of selected landscape metrics and discussed their use as indicators for sustainable urban development. These indicators relate to the dispersion pattern of urban growth, the connectivity of open green space and the complexity in the composition of the UST types within the different sectors of the city. We were able to identify, using the dynamics exhibited by the USTs, three main zones: (1) city centre, where USTs of high-intensity development predominate, (2) eastern high-income areas whose spatial structure is marked by a relatively high urbanisation intensity with a very large proportion of vegetated spaces, and (3) peripheral areas, with significant changes in composition and configuration of USTs, in recent decades, showing high rates of urbanisation, shifting from low-medium to high densities. We concluded that these patterns and their dynamics are mainly determined by the spatial socio-economic stratification of the population.

AB  - The German cockroach is one of the world's most widespread invasive species. From uncertain origins, it appears in historical records in Europe over 300 years ago, with the first records in China date from 100 years ago. Since the 1990s, the German cockroach has dominated indoor environments across China. A genetic analysis of 599 individuals from nine cities across China found two genetic clusters; one dominant in the North and the other dominant the in South of the country. Weak but significantly positive isolation by distance was observed for the entire country; however, when broken into different geographical scales, the significantly positive correlation can be only observed in between cities or city to suburb range (10-221 km). Two factors may have contributed to the spread of the German cockroach in China, which correspond to these two clusters: central heating systems in the north built during the 1960s, and air-conditioning systems in the south built during in the 1990s. The spread of modern, long distance transport systems, such as railways, may have contributed to the lack of geographic patterns, yet it is likely that other factors have been important in determining patterns.

AB  - The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is considered highly adaptable to anthropogenic disturbances; however, the genetic effects of disturbance on this marsupial have not been studied in wild populations in Mexico. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity of D. virginiana at sites with different levels of disturbance within the Highlands and Central Depression regions of Chiapas in southern Mexico. Twelve microsatellite loci were used and the results demonstrated moderate mean heterozygosity (H-e = 0.60; H-o = 0.50). No significant differences in heterozygosity were found among sites with different levels of disturbance in both regions (range H-o = 0.42-0.57). We observed low but significant levels of genetic differentiation according to disturbance level. The inbreeding coefficient did not differ significantly from zero, suggesting that low genetic differentiation in these environments may be associated with sufficient random mating and gene flow, a result associated with the high dispersal and tolerance characteristics of this marsupial. Our results for D. virginiana in this particular area of Mexico provide a foundation for exploring the impact of human disturbance on the genetic diversity of a common and generalist species.

AB  - The paper focus on the concept of food and agriculture as an infrastructure - which is both spatial and relational -, within the context of the urban Mediterranean phenomenon, where, with all its political, cultural, economical, social and environmental differences, there is a common relationship with food and food production in an urban setting. The aim of this paper is to explore the agricultural context of Rome, focusing on its relationships with development in the metropolitan area, within the framework of sustainable food planning. Starting from the relationship between food and city, we have mapped the foodscape, identifying a number of representative conditions - typologies - in the metropolitan area of Rome. Through a of criteria - relationships with the urban fabric, production patterns, flows, services, infrastructures, environmental characters, social behaviour linked with the production - the study tries to summarise Roman agriculture. We focus on a set of recurring elements, involving both criticalities and opportunities, that bring together city and food production.
   Rome has what we could call a compact structure compared to the dispersed urban model and this has encouraged the development of local agricultural systems, where both flows and landscapes involve the city. While production is organised into wedge-shaped areas, the places where exchanges occur are mainly within the municipal area of Rome, with the exception of farms involved in direct sales. Despite a strong urbanization pressure caused a reduction of 42% of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) between 1990 and 2000, this trend was reverted back between 2000 and 2010, with an increase of the UAA of 14%. The analysis of land use (CLC, 2006) reveals a system of wedge-shaped agricultural areas, where short supply chain models can be used efficiently to manage and promote the use of land and landscape. In synthesis, in terms of their production systems, there is a high number of short supply chain farms in Rome (over 40%), mostly with mixed production systems linked to multifunctional farming.
   The role played by the local food network in Rome is remarkable, particularly in case of farmers' market, SPG' and those linked to box schemes experiences have seen significant success. The increasing importance of Alternative and Local Food Networks is showed in the data: the 60% of Rome municipalities farms sell directly (Istat, 2010) it was registered an increase of + 57% Farmers' market at municipality level and of + 64% in Rome's province (2010/13) (Marino et al., 2013). The local food network behind agriculture in the city, within a number of integrated social agrarian cooperative, who represented an alternative food production system and landmark for many initiatives carried out by the civil society, associations, cooperatives, volunteer and school sectors, community supported agriculture (CSA) initiatives. This account of short supply chains in Rome is inevitably the account of an urban phenomenon. It is indeed the city that determines its special characteristics for both physical and relational aspects. The mapped farms are mostly located near the main routes that radiate from the city to the countryside, underlining the centrality of the flow of exchanges that take place with the city.
   The processes of transformation affecting the primary sector in urban and suburban environments reflect an agriculture that forms (and produces) new landscape and functions, typically reconnected to the historical value of agriculture in and around the Mediterranean cities. Food, because of its cultural and historical place in Mediterranean tradition, has a significant role in configuring the areas where exchanges takes place, which are, therefore, specific places for meeting and forming relationships within the public spaces of a city. The system identified by the paper configures the set of all the different forms of agriculture and food in Rome as a device of resilience for the city, made up of places where flows, relationships and processes become increasingly more sustainable, and where both physical and intangible spaces act as an infrastructure in their exchange with the city.

AB  - Hurricanes can significantly influence urban populations. The understanding of human movements in urban areas plays a key role in improving our disaster response, evacuation, and relief plans. However, there is a lack of research on human mobility perturbation under the influence of hurricanes. Furthermore, limited simulation studies have had access to empirical human travel data in urban areas during natural disasters. In this paper, we develop a computational model to simulate human mobility during the approaching and strike of hurricanes. Inspired by animal movements in a fragmented habitat, we examined human movements in New York City and its adjacent areas during the striking of Hurricane Sandy. We found that while the urban travels within New York City did not experience strong perturbation, the movements crossing the boundaries of the city decreased dramatically during Hurricane Sandy. Based on the patterns observed, we proposed a data-driven agent-based GIS model to simulate human movements during hurricanes. The model simulates human mobility patterns in three different scenarios: (1) the imposition of evacuation zones; (2) the occurrence of flooding; (3) and the abrupt failure of certain infrastructures. The research effort aims to inform policy-makers and support decision-making under different emergency situations that can arise during hurricanes.

AB  - Karachi Metropolitan Corporation has been extensively planting few species along the streets over the last few decades. However, the suitability of the species was not properly studied before planting them in Karachi. This is evident from the fact that many species were profusely planted in Karachi during different decades, which were later removed for various reasons. For instance, Eucalyptus was extensively planted during 1980s and 1990s along the streets in Karachi, which was later removed due to their fast growing roots and shoots that damaged many civic services. Therefore, the current study investigates (i) the changes in taxonomic diversity and the composition of the species growing along a major roadway of different land uses in Karachi, (ii) causes and implications due to the changes in their diversity and composition. This study reveals that monoculture plantings were commonly practiced in Karachi. Currently, Conocarpus erectus is the most frequent species, which alone has 83.55% individuals on the street under study. Earlier, the same street was extensively planted with Eucalyptus and Guaiacum officinale. In 1993, the street under study was represented by 32.04% native plants and 67.96% exotic plants from 67 different species. Currently, the same street is represented by 53 species. The target-based 10:20:30 heuristic guidelines and non-target based Shannon and Inverse Simpson Diversity indices have been applied to analyze the flora of the street. Inverse Species Diversity index of the plants along the corridor has declined substantially from 8.75 to 1.41 over the last two decades that shows an increase in monotonous landscaping along the street under study, which make them vulnerable to diseases and pests. The changes in species richness along different land uses have also been analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Identifying the priority habitats of endangered species is crucial to implementing effective conservation actions. We characterize the key habitats used by Bonelli's Eagle Aquila fasciata, an umbrella and flagship species that is endangered in Mediterranean countries. We radiotracked 17 breeding individuals (10males and seven females) in Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula) and used compositional analysis to determine the key habitats in home-ranges of both sexes. The main habitats identified within the home-range area were scrubland, coniferous forests, cropland, sclerophyllous forests, rock outcrops and urban areas, with little difference in habitat use between the sexes. Bonelli's Eagles preferred rocky habitats as breeding areas and scrubland as foraging areas, as these hold the highest abundance of their main prey, Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa. Habitat selection varied seasonally in foraging areas: scrubland was the most preferred habitat type during the breeding season, whereas rocky areas were preferred during the non-breeding season (although scrubland was also highly selected). Urban areas were avoided both as breeding and as foraging areas. Home-range size was inversely correlated with the proportion of scrubland, suggesting that this is a key habitat for Bonelli's Eagle. To conserve this species effectively, policies that ensure the preservation of the cliffs used as breeding sites, as well as suitable management of the scrubland used for foraging, should be implemented in the areas inhabited by this species. The promotion of traditional land uses and management techniques that will enhance open areas in Mediterranean landscapes should in the future play an essential role in the conservation of Bonelli's Eagle in Mediterranean habitats.

AB  - The Movement of Occupants and Tenants (MOI by its Spanish acronym) is currently one of the best examples of the revindication of the right to the city in Buenos Aires, as well as the capacity of grassroots organizations to create and re-create the urban space. The struggle of the Movement in this city has characterized for the revindication of the permanence of the popular sectors in the central areas, in a context where these spaces are being revaluated and, urban development projects targeting the urban renewal with clear neoliberal orientation are being designed. This article, which starts from fieldwork carried out with cooperative housings that make up the organization, presents the dispute for the urban centre between the capital and grassroots organizations paying attention to both, the material fight specifically for high demanded land, and the ideological struggle for legitimacy of the different uses and ways of life in the central spaces.

AB  - We used microsatellites and mtDNA sequences to examine the mixed effects of geophysical, habitat, and contemporary urban barriers on the genetics of threatened Alameda Striped Racers (Coluber lateralis euryxanthus), a species with close ties to declining coastal scrub and chaparral habitat in the eastern San Francisco Bay area of California. We used cluster assignments to characterize population genetic structuring with respect to land management units and approximate Bayesian analysis to rank the ability of five alternative evolutionary hypotheses to explain the inferred structure. Then, we estimated rates of contemporary and historical migration among the major clusters and measured the fit of different historical migration models to better understand the formation of the current population structure. Our results reveal a ring-like pattern of historical connectivity around the Tri-Valley area of the East Bay (i.e., San Ramon, Amador, and Livermore valleys), with clusters largely corresponding to different management units. We found no evidence of continuous gene flow throughout the ring, however, and that the main gap in continuity is centered across the Livermore Valley. Historical migration models support higher rates of gene flow away from the terminal ends of the ring on the north and south sides of the Valley, compared with rates into those areas from western sites that border the interior San Francisco Bay. We attribute the break in ring-like connectivity to the presence of unsuitable habitat within the Livermore Valley that has been reinforced by 20th century urbanization, and the asymmetry in gene flow rates to spatial constraints on movement and east-west environmental gradients influenced by the proximity of the San Francisco Bay.

AB  - Contemporary era is characterised by unprecedented movement of goods, capitals, people and ideas. Living and working in such an era, citizens' everyday communication activities are challenged by the struggle to understand different cultural groups who share different viewpoints and perceptions. In such a context, many policy makers and university researchers call attention to the need to understand how intercultural communication occurs. With this in mind, this study builds up a picture of how communication occurs in various aspects of life in an under-researched city, Limassol, Cyprus with regard to multilingualism and plurilingualism. More specifically, it explores issues pertaining to multilingualism and plurilingualism in education, the public sphere, economic life, the private sphere, and urban spaces. Drawing from both the primary and secondary data collected during the two phases of the research, the study examines certain aspects of multilingualism, such as good practice in language learning for immigrants, the role of linguistic support in social inclusion, provision for communication and cultural exchange with neighbouring languages, promotion of intercultural dialogue, and the changing face of migration in the Limassol civic context. The study also addresses more specific research questions such as language visibility and invisibility, affordances at the level of governance or policy, as well as challenges and obstacles involved in creating and managing multilingualism in the city of Limassol. Findings demonstrate policies and practices implemented in the various aspects of city life in order to promote intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding. As a result of the findings, suggestions for best practices, introduction or improvement of policies and visions of the multilingual cities are put forward.

AB  - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an effective tool for assessing hydrodynamics in complex environments. This paper reports on a CFD study of navigation-induced flows in a shallow, wave-protected, littoral habitat of the urban Spree River. It was constructed as a rehabilitation structure for aquatic organisms and subject to abundant growth of aquatic and riparian vegetation. This study aims to quantify the hydrodynamics induced by vessel movements and its consequences for water exchange and lateral connectivity between the habitat and the main channel with three representative, natural densities of aquatic plants. The simulations revealed both high efficiency of the rehabilitation structure in reducing hydrodynamic forces in the littoral and a superimposed reduction of hydrodynamic forces, and increase of flushing time with increased plant cover. Higher vegetation density resulted in lower wave propagation and lower connectivity of the rehabilitation structure with the fairway. Thus, natural succession of aquatic vegetation in the shallow habitats leads to increasing isolation and finally to terrestrialization. Maintaining the functionality of the rehabilitation structure as habitat for other aquatic organisms requires either plant removal or preferably adaptive modification, e.g. by successively increasing the openings to the main channel and letting the plants take over the protective function of the technical facilities. The developed CFD model helps to find hydrodynamically optimized solutions and to support decision-making process for maintaining littoral refuges for plants and weak swimming organisms in navigable waterways.

AB  - Shanghai is a metropolis that sees itself as the cradle of Chinese modernity', the birthplace of the revolutionary movement, and a hub of cultural and religious diversity - a multilayered identity enshrined in a number of sacred spaces'. This article focuses on the way sacredness continues to be engineered in today's Shanghai, mapping the religious landscape through the exploration of four dimensions - namely, landmarks', compounds', privacy', and waterways'. The article assesses the role played by churches, temples, and mosques, by home and working spaces, by waterways and virtual networks, in the shaping of an urban sacred space satisfying a variety of needs and traditions while being symbolically organized into a consistent territory. In the context of a religiously vibrant global city, locating sacredness' means understanding it as a process of ceaseless dislocation and relocation.

AB  - Fostering ecosystem services in urban road corridors is an important challenge for urban planning and governance because residents are often exposed to environmental pressures in these ubiquitous open spaces. We here aim at illustrating multiple ecosystem services that may be underpinned by roadside vegetation. Previous work is broadly scattered in papers from the natural and social sciences and biased by a focus both on regulating services (temperature regulation, air filtration, carbon sequestration) and also on trees. We provide a first synthesis that illustrates (i) the multi-functional capacity of green elements in streetscapes to deliver various ecosystem services; (ii) the relevance of planted and wild grown herbaceous vegetation as well as trees; and (iii) trade-offs between certain ecosystem services as well as risks related to disservices. Trees and herbaceous road vegetation can mitigate adverse environmental conditions in road corridors, which is particularly important in vulnerable neighborhoods that are undersupplied with green spaces. Enhancing the amenity value of streetscapes might also positively influence public health by promoting physical activity. However, significant knowledge gaps exist, e.g. on the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem services and on the valuation of green street components by different sociocultural groups. Our synthesis illustrates management options that can support planning and governance approaches toward more livable streetscapes by fostering ecosystem services and counteracting disservices.

AB  - Food webs in riparian corridors are increasingly viewed as embedded in complex riverine landscapes characterized by an amalgam of aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats. However, the influence of riverine landscape pattern on trophic dynamics of riparian consumers remains largely unknown. We used naturally abundant stable isotope ratios (N-15) to compare trophic structure of ants (Formica subsericea) among riparian patch types (crop, grass/herbaceous, gravel bar, lawn, mudflat, shrub, swamp, and woody vegetation) at 12 riverine landscapes distributed along an urban-rural landscape gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. We expected that the diet of F. subsericea, a common generalist consumer, would reflect local prey availability and thus differences in trophic dynamics among patch types. Mean ant N-15 was higher in crop patches than in any other patch type, and was lowest in grass/herbaceous, lawn, shrub, and woody vegetation patches, suggesting that patch type was associated with trophic position of F. subsericea. We also found that the range of N-15, and thus trophic breadth, was significantly different by patch type, with woody vegetation exhibiting the greatest spread. Variability in canopy, tree and shrub cover, and the degree of urban development was positively correlated with N-15 range (R-2=0.78), pointing to the role of habitat structure in mediating trophic breadth of riparian ants. These findings provide evidence that riverine landscape pattern can strongly influence trophic dynamics of riparian arthropods. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper explores the movement of bodies in urbanising landscapes. In particular, it looks at the bodily practice that unfolds at a bus stop made by stopping buses' in peri-urban Mexico City. Doing so, I pursue three questions: What are the specificities of bodily practice in the peri-urban realm and out of what socio-material conditions do they emerge? How does this practice sit within notions of informality and cityness? And what urban imaginaries do peri-urban practitioners grow' out of their direct engagement with the material environment, that is, in this case, when taking buses? The bus stop in question is located in the municipality of Tecamac, State of Mexico, in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City (ZMVM). It is a site of pure activity, social occurrence without being forged into built form; a site with nothing there' but the encounter of travellers and buses along the Mexico City-Pachuca highway. Carefully examining the seemingly banal activity of flagging down and boarding buses, however, allows us to take seriously the bodily and material dimensions of urban life and to acknowledge their influence on how city is made and thought. The paper draws on ethnographic research with a focus on visual and sensory methods.

AB  - Mangrove forests of Mexico have been threatened by the effects of anthropogenic activities during the last decades, mostly related to aquaculture, agriculture, livestock and urban development. Genetic diversity and fine-scale genetic structure of two generations of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn were investigated in perturbed and preserved sites from three lagoon systems in Sinaloa, Mexico. Genetic diversity and overall genetic structure were similar between perturbed and preserved sites. However, lower levels of fine-scale spatial genetic structure were observed in two of the younger (sapling) generations. We attribute this to differences in local dynamics of each lagoon system, their status of conservation and levels of fragmentation. Also, low connectivity and the effects of disturbance could restrict the movement of pollinators and seed dispersal capabilities, resulting in low levels of genetic diversity and signs of inbreeding. Perturbed populations of A. germinans may play an important role in in situ conservation of this complex ecosystem.

AB  - Walking is an everyday practice that shapes urban space and is shaped by the space in which it occurs. It can create new subjects, new forms of public space and provide alternate readings of the city. This essay examines the significance of walking in the Olmsted Brothers' 1904 'Valley Parks and Parkways' plan for Baltimore. The transformation of the urban stream valleys into public parks assumed and promoted the concept of recreational walking in a scenic setting, rooted in the tradition of picturesque travel that William Gilpin had popularized in his famous printed tours. The Olmsted Brothers' 1904 plan gave value to previously overlooked natural corridors and new legibility to the city's natural systems. Rural scenic values were embraced as part of a larger urban vision. The Baltimore plan illustrates the key role of the landscape in the emergence of comprehensive planning principles, and how it shaped-and was shaped by-everyday social practices.

AB  - Social capital and social support are two key constructs in the study of social networks and health. Despite their importance, little research has sought to examine the characteristics of those social ties by which individuals access social capital and support resources. Network diversity - a key structural feature in accessing social capital - refers to a person's broad but generally weak and heterogeneous social ties; core network size - a key structural feature in accessing social support - refers to the close, strong ties in personal networks. Our study examines whether the tie strength composing network diversity and core network size varies according to age-, psychosocial-, or health-related characteristics. Data came from the Montreal Neighbourhood Networks and Healthy Aging (MoNNET-HA) study, a representative sample of 2707 Montreal, Canada adults. Position and name generators were used to collect data on network diversity and core networks, and whether access to social resources was through kin, friends, or acquaintances. Multilevel negative binomial regression was used to account for the counts of different tie strengths nested within individuals and tracts. Network diversity and core network size both declined with older age groups, with those declines being more noticeable in not having ties at all or fewer ties with friends. Psychosocial and health factors altered the relative contribution of kin, friends and acquaintances to network diversity and core network size in similar patterns. Understanding the tie composition of network diversity and core network size can contribute to our knowledge of the social mechanisms linking social capital and support to health outcomes.

AB  - Rich herbaceous layers supply important ecosystem functions and amenity values in urban woodlands. However, due to poor dispersal and recruitment, typical woodland herbs often remain absent in woodlands established on post-agricultural and post-industrial sites, especially in fragmented urban landscapes. Efficient methods for active restoration of the herbaceous layer are therefore needed. In a plantation experiment in an 11-year-old oak stand established on post-agricultural land just outside Malmo City, southern Sweden, this study investigated the effects of compost addition and weed control on post-planting survival, growth and flowering of three typical shade-tolerant woodland herb species: Galium odoratum, Lamiastrum galeobdolon and Stellaria holostea. Removal of competing weed vegetation did not affect plant performance, but compost addition dramatically increased growth and flowering of all three species during the first two growing seasons, and also increased survival in S. holostea. This positive treatment effect probably derived from a more suitable top soil structure and a higher soil moisture in the compost treatment. We conclude that combined use of planting and composting is an effective method for rapid achievement of profusely flowering carpets of summer-green woodland herbs, which can provide important amenity values in the many woodlands established in and around cities in north-west Europe in recent decades. The method may also be applicable in other woodland restoration projects, where it can promote colonisation by typical shade-tolerant woodland herb species. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - An awakening interest in public space in Brazilian cities is emphasising the value of existing civic areas. Guilherme Wisnik, a critic, curator and professor at the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism of the University of SAo Paulo, looks at the history and potential future of Brazil's urban spaces. He highlights how despite the introduction of innovative Modernist design in the mid-20th century, which forged a new relationship between architecture, urbanism and landscape design', more recently the country's cities have been subject to the vicissitudes of market and political forces.

AB  - Dengue fever is a major public health issue affecting billions of people in over 100 countries across the globe. This challenge is growing as the invasive mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, expand their distributions and increase their population sizes. Hence there is an increasing need to devise effective control methods that can contain dengue outbreaks. Here we construct an epidemiological model for virus transmission between vectors and hosts on a network of host populations distributed among city and town patches, and investigate disease control through vaccination and vector control using variants of the sterile insect technique (SIT). Analysis of the basic reproductive number and simulations indicate that host movement across this small network influences the severity of epidemics. Both vaccination and vector control strategies are investigated as methods of disease containment and our results indicate that these controls can be made more effective with mixed strategy solutions. We predict that reduced lethality through poor SIT methods or imperfectly efficacious vaccines will impact efforts to control disease spread. In particular, weakly efficacious vaccination strategies against multiple virus serotype diversity may be counter productive to disease control efforts. Even so, failings of one method may be mitigated by supplementing it with an alternative control strategy. Generally, our network approach encourages decision making to consider connected populations, to emphasise that successful control methods must effectively suppress dengue epidemics at this landscape scale.

AB  - Background: Dengue is a common mosquito-borne viral disease epidemic especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions where water sanitation is not substantially controlled. However, dengue epidemics sometimes occur in non-tropical urban cities with substantial water sanitary control. Using a mathematical model, we investigate what conditions can be important for a dengue epidemic to occur in an urban city such as Tokyo, where vectors are active only in summer and there are little number of vectors around hosts.
   Methods: The model, which is a modified Ross-Macdonald model, consists of two sets of host-vector compartments. The two sets correspond to high-risk and low-risk areas, and only hosts can move between them. Assuming that mosquitoes have constant activity for only 90 days, we assess five potential countermeasures: (1) restricted movement between the two areas, (2) insecticide application, (3) use of repellents, (4) vector control, and (5) isolation of the infected.
   Results: The basic reproduction number R-0 and the cumulative number of infected hosts for 90 days are evaluated for each of the five countermeasures. In the cases of Measures 2-5, the cumulative number of the infected for 90 days can be reduced substantially for small R-0 even if R-0 > 1. Although R0 for Measure 1 monotonically decreases with the mobility rates, the cumulative number of the infected for 90 days has a maximum at a moderate mobility rate. If the mobility rate is sufficiently small, the restricted movement effectively increases the number density of vectors in the high-risk area, and the epidemic starts earlier in the high-risk area than in the low-risk one, while the growth of infections is slow.
   Conclusions: Measures 2-5 are more or less effective. However, Measure 1 can have the opposite effect, depending on the mobility rates. The restricted movement results in the formation of a kind of core population, which can promote the epidemic in the entire population.

AB  - Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) ecosystems are declining due to biological invasions and changes in fire regimes. Understanding how ecosystem changes influence functionally important animals such as ecosystem engineers is essential to conserve ecological functions. American badgers (Taxidea taxus) are an apex predator and ecosystem engineer in that they redistribute large amounts of soil within sagebrush ecosystems. Piute ground squirrels (Urocitellus mollis) are also an ecosystem engineer as well as an essential prey resource for many predators, including badgers. Our research objective was to evaluate the relative importance of biological invasions and fire, abiotic factors, and biotic factors on badgers and ground squirrels. We sampled 163 1-ha plots during April-June across a gradient of burn histories within a 1962 km(2) study area in southern Idaho, USA. At each plot, we characterized occupancy of ground squirrels and badgers and relative abundance of ground squirrels. Additionally, we characterized soil texture, climate, connectivity and dispersal potential, fire frequency, grazing, and cover of many plant species including a highly invasive exotic annual grass (cheatgrass; Bromus tectorum). We used an integrated approach to evaluate competing hypotheses concerning factors influencing occupancy and abundance. Results suggested that occupancy of ground squirrels was positively associated with long-term precipitation, dispersal potential, and fine-grained soil. Abundance of ground squirrels was positively associated with fine-grained soil, but negatively associated with cheatgrass, fire frequency, agriculture, and shrub cover. Badger occupancy was positively associated with ground squirrel occupancy and agriculture, which indicated affinity to prey. Our results provide insight into the relative influence of abiotic and biotic factors on predator and prey, and highlight how effects change across different population parameters. Our research suggests that widespread environmental change within sagebrush ecosystems, especially the fire-cheatgrass cycle (e.g., invasion of cheatgrass and increased fire frequency) and human land disturbances, are directly and indirectly influencing ground squirrels and badgers. However, we also found evidence that efforts to mitigate these stressors, for example, establishing bunchgrasses postfire, may provide targeted conservation strategies that promote these species and thus preserve the burrowing and trophic functions they provide.

AB  - Hedges and lines of trees (woody linear features) are important boundaries that connect and enclose habitats, buffer the effects of land management, and enhance biodiversity in increasingly impoverished landscapes. Despite their acknowledged importance in the wider countryside, they are usually not considered in models of landscape function due to their linear nature and the difficulties of acquiring relevant data about their character, extent, and location. We present a model which uses national datasets to describe the distribution of woody linear features along boundaries in Great Britain. The method can be applied for other boundary types and in other locations around the world across a range of spatial scales where different types of linear feature can be separated using characteristics such as height or width. Satellite-derived Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) provided the spatial framework for locating linear features and was used to screen out areas unsuitable for their occurrence, that is, offshore, urban, and forest areas. Similarly, Ordnance Survey LandForm PANORAMA (R), a digital terrain model, was used to screen out where they do not occur. The presence of woody linear features on boundaries was modelled using attributes from a canopy height dataset obtained by subtracting a digital terrain map (DTM) from a digital surface model (DSM). The performance of the model was evaluated against existing woody linear feature data in Countryside Survey across a range of scales. The results indicate that, despite some underestimation, this simple approach may provide valuable information on the extents and locations of woody linear features in the countryside at both local and national scales.

AB  - Understanding urban growth spatiotemporally is important for landscape and urban development planning. In this study, we examined the spatiotemporal pattern of urban growth of the Colombo Metropolitan Area (CMA)Sri Lanka's only metropolitan areafrom 1992 to 2014 using remote sensing data and GIS techniques. First, we classified three land-use/cover maps of the CMA (i.e., for 1992, 2001, and 2014) using Landsat data. Second, we examined the temporal pattern of urban land changes (ULCs; i.e., land changes from non-built-up to built-up) across two time intervals (1992-2001 and 2001-2014). Third, we examined the spatial pattern of ULCs along the gradients of various driver variables (e.g., distance to roads) and by using spatial metrics. Finally, we predicted the future urban growth of the CMA (2014-2050). Our results revealed that the CMA's built-up land has increased by 24,711 ha (221%) over the past 22 years (11,165 ha in 1992 to 35,876 ha in 2014), at a rate of 1123 ha per year. The analysis revealed that ULC was more intense or faster during the 2000s (1268 ha per year) than in the 1990s (914 ha per year), coinciding with the trends of population and economic growth. The results also revealed that most of the ULCs in both time intervals occurred in close proximity to roads and schools, while also showing some indications of landscape fragmentation and infill urban development patterns. The ULC modeling revealed that by 2030 and 2050, the CMA's built-up land will increase to 42,500 ha and 56,000 ha, respectively. Most of these projected gains of built-up land will be along the transport corridors and in proximity to the growth nodes. These findings are important in the context of landscape and urban development planning for the CMA. Overall, this study provides valuable information on the landscape transformation of the CMA, also highlighting some important challenges facing its future sustainable urban development.

AB  - In recent years, pollinosis has been considered a "national disease" with the big social problems in urban areas of Japan. In this study, the airborne behavior of cedar pollen in the Kanto plain of Japan was observed by a real time pollen automatic measuring instrument during the 2014 pollination season. For calculating cedar pollen source contribution, the backward trajectory analysis was used for calculating 72 hours of trajectories of air mass with the altitude of 500 m from the urban of Saitama city to different areas. It was found that cedar pollen grains transported to Saitama city were mainly derived from the forest of Gunma prefecture located on the north side of Saitama city and the forest of Kanagawa prefecture located on the south side of the city. Transportation of cedar pollen grains depends on the weather conditions, habitat density of cedar trees and transportation distance. The variations in daily pollen counts among different transporting times showed three pollen dispersal peaks observed in the morning, the day time and the night time, while these occurrence rates were different in each month. The peak pollen counts in the day time correlated positively with the daily maximum temperature. The highest pollen counts were observed in the night time within three pollen dispersal peaks. At the same time, the size-segregated allergenic particles were also collected using Andersen high-volume air samplers at the roadside of urban residential zones of Saitama city and on the 10th floor of the research building in Saitama University. Allergenic concentrations were measured by the surface plasmon resonance method with a Biacore J system. The highest airborne allergenic concentrations were observed in fine particles below 1.1 mu m. Moreover, the forward trajectory analysis was used for calculating 72 hours of trajectories of air mass with the altitude of 500 m from different cedar pollen source areas including the rainfall events. It was suggested that not only cedar pollen grains but also its allergenic particles were transported from different cedar forests as the source areas.

AB  - Understanding how biological communities respond to global change is important for the conservation of functioning ecosystems as anthropogenic environmental threats increase. National parks within the United States provide unique ecological and cultural resources that can help conserve biodiversity and maintain ecological integrity, especially in heavily urbanized environments. Parks within the National Capital Region (NCRN) and Mid-Atlantic (MIDN) Networks, representing federally protected areas located within a mixed landscape of rural to urban areas, have been monitoring forest and grassland birds annually to evaluate long-term trends in bird community dynamics. Given increasing rates of decline in forest-and grassland-breeding songbirds in North America, understanding community-level trends in parks will help their preservation for future generations. We used point count data collected between 2007 and 2015 from 640 sampling locations to calculate a bird community index (BCI) to infer relative estimates of ecological integrity. Our objectives were to (1) quantify BCI in 17 national parks in the mid-Atlantic region, (2) test for relationships between BCI and the proportion of forest and developed land cover types, (3) assess temporal variation in BCI, and (4) additionally test for differences in estimates of species detection probability between volunteer citizen scientists and paid observers. Mean BCI scores and ecological integrity ranks among parks ranged between 33.5 (low integrity) and 58.3 (high integrity), while the majority of parks had BCI scores ranging between 40.1 and 52.0 (medium integrity). For both networks, we found that BCI was positively related to the extent of forest cover, and for NCRN, the more heavily urbanized network, we found that BCI was negatively related to developed land cover. Assessment of temporal changes in BCI within parks indicated that BCI was stable for 12 parks, increased in four parks, and decreased in one park within our study. Lastly, we detected no differences in species detection probability between citizen scientist-and paid observer-collected data which lends support for the future comparison of bird monitoring data in regional analyses across NPS I&M Networks. The continued evaluation of ecological integrity, through measuring bird community dynamics at regional scales, is important for conserving biological diversity.

AB  - Despite a large body of literature that reports habitat use in non-urban areas, we lack a fundamental understanding of how American black bears (Ursus americanus; hereafter, black bear) use habitats in the urban-wildland interface in the eastern United States. This lack of information is problematic for bear managers in areas where bear populations are large and adjacent to urban areas. To better understand characteristics of urban-wildland habitat occupied by black bears, we conducted a study to understand habitat use of black bears in 7 urban areas in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. We fit data from 77 individual black bears with Global Positioning System-Global System for Mobile Communications collars during 2010-2012 in Johnstown, State College, and Scranton, Pennsylvania; northwestern New Jersey; and Beckley, Charleston, and Morgantown, West Virginia. We fit resource selection functions using generalized linear mixed models in R with different combinations of study area, human impact (human density and housing density), habitat (distance to roads, patch size), land cover (deciduous forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, shrubland, grassland, pasture, barren, open-, low-, medium-, and high-intensity development, woody wetlands, and herbaceous wetlands), topographic (elevation and slope), and other variables (year, period of day [night or day], age and sex of the individual bear). Black bears used habitat similarly among study areas and between sexes. Black bears used forested slopes and riparian corridors in the urban-wildland interface. Black bears on the urban-wildland interface selected habitats similarly to wildland bears within the body of literature. Habitat selection was similar for males and females, regardless of study area, time of day, season, or year. Our results indicate that managers can employ the same suite of management tools to reduce human-bear conflicts at the urban-wildland interface that they use to deal with black bear conflicts in wildland areas.

AB  - Choosing a suitable low-risk location by multi-criteria methods is commonly accepted in landscape planning. However, the low risk place demonstrated on spatial patterns may not completely satisfy the urbanization requirement. In this article, we consider that except for avoiding the risks by site selection on the map, risk adaptation methods should be adopted at landscape scale. Eight ecological risk indicators were defined under the hilly construction land exploitation policy in the southwest of China. Spearman's rank correlation was then used to ascertain if there were contradictions between hilly construction land exploitation induced ecological risk and present construction land distribution. The results showed a strong positive relevance between construction land and farmland occupancy risk at all such three scales as grid, watershed, and town, which meant a low farmland occupancy risk region may not be suitable for human dwellings. Three basic farmland adjustment scenarios were put forward as the risk adaptation to reduce human construction induced ecological risk instead of changing the building site. It was found that the function adjustment scenario, which focuses on landscape connectivity, was acceptable; and the integrated adjustment scenario, which focuses on the total ecological risk and landscape connectivity, was the most advisable. The structure adjustment scenario, which only focuses on the ecological risk for construction, was less fitted. In this way, it is suggested that besides risk avoidance measures, a reasonable integration of risk adaptation approaches is required in landscape ecological risk assessment. Both concepts of risk avoidance and adaptation should be combined and emphasized in landscape planning and management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As global populations grow, cities are stretching their urban boundaries into rural areas and bringing the challenges of biodiversity conservation into the backyards of homeowners. Planning controls can attempt to regulate residents' behaviours to support conservation actions for threatened species but need to consider whether community attitudes align with conservation objectives. This study investigated community attitudes towards planned management interventions in a new conservation strategy designed to protect endangered Southern Brown Bandicoots in new residential estates around Cranbourne, Australia. A survey (n=318, response rate 15.2 per cent) investigated current resident attitudes towards bandicoot conservation, cat ownership and effectiveness of current planning controls. Results indicate community support for a range of bandicoot conservation actions including confinement of domestic cats and non-lethal cat controls and for new developments being cat-free with bandicoot habitat corridors. Awareness of bandicoots correlated with higher support for conservation actions while cat owners were less supportive overall, particularly to limitations on cat ownership. Potential barriers to management interventions include inadequate knowledge, perceived associated risks and housing turnover. This information is valuable for conservation planning for new developments and to improve implementation of planning controls in existing residential areas for delivery of long-term protection for threatened species like Southern Brown Bandicoots.

AB  - Many city logistic initiatives are large in scale and aim to improve the efficiency and overall state of goods movement within our urban areas. Unfortunately the implementation and day-to-day operations of urban goods movement is less than optimal. Commercial vehicles have many activities in their activity chains, from when they start at a terminal depot, until they return. Some vehicles have as many as hundreds of activities in a single chain. Unfortunately many consecutive activities in a vehicle's chain occur at the same facility, suggesting that vehicles have to maneuver and relocate a few times before their true, economically useful function is completed. In this study we consider such duplicate activities and perform temporal and spatial analyses to better understand the nature of these productivity sinks. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Aedes albopictus is a tropical invasive species which in the last decades spread worldwide, also colonizing temperate regions of Europe and US, where it has become a public health concern due to its ability to transmit exotic arboviruses, as well as severe nuisance problems due to its aggressive daytime outdoor biting behaviour. While several studies have been carried out in order to predict the potential limits of the species expansions based on eco-climatic parameters, few studies have so far focused on the specific effects of these variables in shaping its micro-geographic abundance and dynamics. The present study investigated eco-climatic factors affecting Ae. albopictus abundance and dynamics in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural sites in Rome (Italy), which was colonized in 1997 and is nowadays one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe. To this aim, longitudinal adult monitoring was carried out along a 70 km-transect across and beyond the most urbanized and densely populated metropolitan area. Two fine scale spatiotemporal datasets (one with reference to a 20m circular buffer around sticky traps used to collect mosquitoes and the second to a 300m circular buffer within each sampling site) were exploited to analyze the effect of climatic and socio-environmental variables on Ae. albopictus abundance and dynamics along the transect. Results showed an association between highly anthropized habitats and high adult abundance both in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas, with "small green islands" corresponding to hot spots of abundance in the metropolitan areas only, and a bimodal seasonal dynamics with a second peak of abundance in autumn, due to heavy rains occurring in the preceding weeks in association with permissive temperatures. The results provide useful indications to prioritize public mosquito control measures in temperate urban areas where nuisance, human-mosquito contact and risk of local arbovirus transmission are likely higher, and highlight potential public health risks also after the summer months typically associated with high mosquito densities.

AB  - The variations in species composition and assemblage of unmanaged simple-intensive green roofs in Hannover, Germany, were investigated over a thirty year period, in order to assess the persistence of the initial seed mixture and to evaluate floristic changes. The roofs were greened in 1985 with soil based turf rolls sown with a mixture of five grasses (Festuca rubra, Festuca ovina, Agrostis capillaris, Lolium perenne and Poa pratensis). Three sets of 120 phytosociological releves, sampled in 1987,1999 and 2014, have been compared to assess: (1) nestedness vs spatial turnover, (2) functional diversity and (3) the importance of vegetation dynamics on green roof performance and design. Results demonstrated that from 1987 to 1999 the species diversity increased and the species turnover prevailed over nestedness, due to the progressive niche occupation by new species. In contrast, from 1999 to 2014 species diversity remained steady, suggesting that nestedness prevailed over species turnover. The main driver of the observed functional changes was a shift towards relatively more thermoxeric conditions. In terms of plant life strategies, the competitive species sown on the roof gradually gave way to stress-tolerant and ruderal species, along with a progressive increase in species with shortdistance seed dispersal strategies. It is concluded that: (a) to create resilient green roofs, spontaneous colonisation should be accepted and considered as a design factor; and (b) regional plant communities could serve as a model for seed recruitment and installations.

AB  - Aside from the admixture between indigenous people and people from overseas, populations in Mexico changed drastically after the Spanish conquest of the sixteenth century, forming an intricate history that has been underutilized in understanding the genetic population structure of Mexicans. To infer historical processes of isolation, dispersal, and assimilation, we examined the phylogeography of mitochondrial (mt) DNA and Y-chromosome lineages in 3,026 individuals from 10 urban and nine indigenous populations by identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms. A geographic array with a predominance of Amerindian lineages was observed for mtDNA, with northern indigenous populations being divergent from the central and southern indigenous populations; urban populations showed low differentiation with isolation by distance. Y-chromosome variation distinguished urban and indigenous populations through the Amerindian haplogroup Q frequency. The MtDNA and the Y-chromosome together primarily distinguished urban and indigenous populations, with different geographic arrays for both. Gene flow across geographical distance and between the urban and indigenous realms appears to have altered the pre-Hispanic phylogeography in central and southern Mexico, mainly by displacement of women, while maintaining the indigenous isolation in the north, southeast, and Zapotec regions. Most Amerindian mtDNA diversity currently occurs in urban populations and appears to be reduced among indigenous people.

AB  - Chronic disturbances, such as selective logging, firewood extraction and extensive grazing, may lead to the taxonomic and phylogenetic impoverishment of remaining old-growth forest communities worldwide; however, the empirical evidence on this topic is limited. We tested this hypothesis in the Caatinga vegetation - a seasonally dry tropical forest restricted to northeast Brazil. We sampled 11,653 individuals (adults, saplings, and seedlings) from 51 species in 29 plots distributed along a gradient of chronic disturbance. The gradient was assessed using a chronic disturbance index (CDI) based on five recognized indicators of chronic disturbances: proximity to urban center, houses and roads and the density of both people and livestock. We used linear models to test if mean effective number of lineages, mean phylogenetic distance and phylogenetic dispersion decreased with CDI and if such relationships differed among ontogenetic stages. As expected, the mean effective number of lineages and the mean phylogenetic distance were negatively related to CDI, and such diversity losses occurred irrespective of ontogeny. Yet the increase in phylogenetic clustering in more disturbed plots was only evident in seedlings and saplings, mostly because clades with more descendent taxa than expected by chance (e.g., Euphorbiaceae) thrived in more disturbed plots. This novel study indicates that chronic human disturbances are promoting the phylogenetic impoverishment of the irreplaceable woody flora of the Brazilian Caatinga forest. The highest impoverishment was observed in seedlings and saplings, indicating that if current chronic disturbances remain, they will result in increasingly poorer phylogenetically forests. This loss of evolutionary history will -potentially limit the capacity of this ecosystem to respond to human disturbances (i.e., lower ecological resilience) and particularly their ability to adapt to rapid climatic changes in the region.

AB  - Latest theories and practices in Biophilic designs of the urban space regard the urban fabric as being composed of several interrelated layers of energetic structure influencing each other in a non-linear manner primarily. The interaction between two or more interfaces of the urban space layers evolves into new and non-predictable properties. Evolution and creation of new boundaries/interfaces follows laws related to fractal growth; most of the times this particular evolution is defined by laws of physics, such as Thermodynamics and Constructal Law. Designs that do not follow these laws may produce anti-natural and hostile environments, which do not fit into human beings' evolution, and thus, fail to enhance life by all means. The author of this paper should like to illustrate how new developments of urbanism worldwide currently work upon conceptual and town planning models based not only upon cutting-edge technology, but also upon natural laws and patterns of life and human behaviours strictly related to flaws and movement dictated by natural phenomena. When abrupt interruption of the urban structure has occurred, a consequent design solution does not even guarantee flowing and freedom to morph. It is impossible to create harmonic designs which naturally "unite the animate with the inanimate", as Adrian Bejan and Sylvie Lorente affirm, whenever urban sprawl fails to encompass Biophilic solutions related to tree-shaped architectures. The author argues that Constructal invasion into the urban space "as fundamental problems of access to flow: volume to point, area to point, line to point, and the respective reverse flow directions" can only guarantee high standard quality of life in either contemporary or future cities developments.

AB  - Nonhuman power is evident in urban ecologies, from droughts to tree diseases to everyday encounters with wildlife. Some urban environmental governance literature takes up questions of nonhuman agency, generally focusing on human-environment relations and their influence on decision-makers involved in planning, politics, and management. However, results from current research on a wetland restoration project suggest that there is more to nonhuman agency in environmental governance than its effects on human actors. This restoration project, located in a Washington D.C. Metro Area park, involved the installation of a berm and a water control system for the management of a hemi-marsh habitat. Resident beavers (Castor canadensis) emerged from the planning and proposal process as major players influencing the project design and implementation. The research traces the development of this urban wetland, drawing on assemblage theories of power to analyze how the elements of the managing apparatus (dispositif) including animal ethology, technological expertise, environmental ethics, and the concept of biodiversity-function to govern the space. Nonhuman agency in the network compelled park managers to incorporate beaver behavior and perception into the governing apparatus. Both humans and nonhumans emerge from this dispositif as coproducers of place and as political subjects playing a part in urban ecology governance decisions. The research shows that beavers not only exert their agency on the ecological network in the wetland, but also that their perceptual worlds (umwelt) form part of the logic of governance that guides management decisions. Ultimately, this research suggests that critical social theory frameworks coupled with nonhuman ontologies will help us to better understand the lively and productive human-environment relationships that are at the core of urban ecosystems.

AB  - Urbanization tends to remove or isolate green areas into fragments or restrict them to narrow corridors inserted in a matrix of buildings. Nevertheless, urban green areas may act as refuges for fauna and bats are among the animals able to use such habitats. Using bioacoustics we investigated the influence of green areas on the activity of insectivorous bats in the metropolitan area of Recife, a conurbation of 4 million people in the Atlantic forest of Northeastern Brazil. Bat activity was statistically higher in green areas, based on calls (t = 2.5298, p = 0.0165), but not on feeding buzzes (t = 1.8132, p = 0.0817) or social calls (t = -1.5551, p = 0.1329). Several species were able to persist in an urban matrix and calls were classified into 16 sonotypes, belonging to five families (Emballonuridae, Molossidae, Noctilionidae, Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae). However, activity was significantly more associated with areas with vegetation, indicating that green remnants are hotspots for bat activity. Our results indicate that most insectivorous bats have a biased use of the urban landscape and the maintenance of urban green areas is essential to preserve them and the environmental services they provide.

AB  - The boreal forest of Alberta, Canada, is under pressure from a rapid expansion of the wildland-human interface driven by natural resources exploitation. The specific impact of these changes on area burned remains poorly understood. We addressed this issue by modelling area burned for the 1980-2010 period using variables accounting for various anthropogenic effects. We hypothesise that an ecological frontier exists in the areas of intermediate to low human influence in northern Alberta, which implies a new influx of human-caused ignitions coinciding with continuous flammable vegetation, hence promoting area burned. Using a statistical control approach, we assessed the importance of each anthropogenic variable by adding them to a biophysical regression model. Our results show that there is a diversity of responses of area burned to the different anthropogenic factors considered. Distance to the transportation network, human footprint and density of the energy network significantly improved the model predictions. The area burned in the ecological frontier showed clusters of higher predictions by anthropogenic models, which supports our hypothesis of an ecological frontier and suggests that human and natural ignitions have an additive, albeit temporary, effect on landscape fire susceptibility.

AB  - Fluvial corridors such as streams and urban canals are critical components of the landscape and are key ecohydrological assets. They are essential to landscape function and are vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures. Energy and nutrient budgets in such corridors are dominated by processes associated with detrital organic matter and are mediated by microorganisms that mainly reside in biofilms. Here, we review the major hydrologic factors shaping biofilms in natural and urban water corridors, and propose the integration of single-cell visualization techniques with other broad-scale approaches (genomics) to better understand structure-function coupling in such complex microbial communities. We, further, provide evidence that it is possible to visualize specific bacterial clusters and autotrophic microorganisms within the matrix of natural biofilms from urban canals. This can then guide the development of ecohydrological approaches and management interventions to harness ecological services mediated by biofilms, with enormous implications also by a sanitary point of view.

AB  - Historical scholarship on the women's liberation movement (WLM) across the UK is as yet underdeveloped. This article argues against the commonly held assumption that London socialist-feminist accounts speak for England as a whole. This article examines the history of the WLM in England as refracted through a range of different English urban localities, specifically Bristol, Brighton, Norwich, Bolton and Leeds/Bradford. It attempts to show the importance of local studies to appreciate the diversity of the English women's liberation movement. The movement had very many unifying characteristics, but how they played out across the country differed according to local contexts.

AB  - We proposed an approach to calculate estuarine habitat suitability and habitat fragmentation by integrating various environmental factors. Based on fuzzy logic method, water depth, salinity, and fluctuation rate of salinity were integrated into a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) to map suitable habitat pattern of target species in estuaries. Then the HSI is used to calculate Habitat Aggregation Index (HAI) that represents the degree of habitat fragmentation. The proposed method was applied to the Yangtze River Estuary which has experienced long term land reclamation activities during the past two decades including the transformations of coastal wetlands to urban infrastructures and the deep-water channel construction. We selected Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) as a target species in this study, the results indicated that under the impact of land reclamation in the Yangtze River Estuary the isoclines of low salinity moved seaward and the optimum salinity range for Chinese mitten crab has been compressed. The suitable habitat for Chinese mitten crab decreased 325.4 km(2) and the HAI has also decreased 2% during the first stage of land reclamation (scenario 1-scenario 2) with a transformation of 237.2 km(2) coastal wetlands to concretes. During the second stage of land reclamation (scenario 2-scenario 3), the combined effects of coastal wetlands disappearance (282.7 km(2)) and deep-water channel construction (92.2 km) have led to a degeneration of suitable habitat for Chinese mitten crab about 427.4 km(2) and HAI decreased 6%. Land reclamations in the Yangtze River Estuary not only directly occupied suitable habitat for the Chinese mitten crab, but also altered the habitat patterns and destroyed habitat connectivity, which showed high potential to affect the migration of this species. This proposed approach is flexible for habitat evaluation in estuaries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human interventions that limit channel mobility such as bank stabilization are frequent in riparian zones in urban or agricultural environments. This is potentially problematic because channel mobility is an important geomorphological and ecological agent that structures natural instream and riparian ecosystems. This study aims to (1) quantify the relationship between mobility and three types of habitat-related features, namely bars, oxbow lakes and log jams, for a 54-km-long reach of the Yamaska Sud-Est River (Quebec, Canada), which runs from the forested Appalachian Mountains to the agricultural St-Lawrence lowlands, and (2) evaluate the impact of human interventions and geomorphological characteristics on these three features. Channel mobility was measured from historical aerial photos for the period 1950-2009. A combination of high-resolution aerial photos, LiDAR digital elevation model, and field observations was used to measure and map sediment bars, oxbow lakes and log jams, as well as several geomorphological characteristics (channel width, slope, sinuosity and floodplain width). A strong link between the mobility and the presence of habitat features is revealed, but local geomorphological contexts result in different mobility patterns responsible for specific habitats. Floodplain to channel width ratio appears as the best geomorphological factor predicting habitat diversity. Human intervention, mostly through bank stabilization, also appears to be a key factor limiting mobility and its related habitats. These results highlight the importance of defining a protected mobility corridor along rivers where geomorphic processes such as bank erosion can freely occur, as it is an essential process that should be integrated in land use planning and river management.

AB  - The article features a comprehensive review of recent research on the history of Constructivism in the Urals. Various experimental urban solutions in Ural cities and towns, innovative models of quarter planning, and the typological diversity of public, residential, and industrial buildings built in Constructivist style makes Ural region distinct from other parts of the country. The introduction of contemporary building materials and designs and novel research into the usage of space can be seen in diverse buildings in Perm, Chelyabinsk, Magnitogorsk, Kurgan, Nizhny Tagil, Sverdlovsk, Zlatoust, Nadezhdinsk, and others. The social and artistic direction of Constructivism as an ultra-modern creative movement greatly influenced the new architectural look of cities in the Urals. It also transformed the language of architecture and the visual imagery of buildings: it allowed for the creation of new, unprecedented architectural types and changed people's ideas about convenience, style, and quality of life. From the mid-1930s until the early 1990s, many towns in the Urals were closed off to foreign researchers: the publication of books and articles about Constructivism was also prohibited. This is why the first serious publications about the Constructivist heritage of the Urals appeared only at the beginning of the 21st century. Thus began a rise in scholarship on this subject.

AB  - Despite the growing development of tools that can integrate land use and transport, the desired integration is still illusive in daily practice. To address this gap, the current study uses spatial metrics, a set of methods traditionally used for studying changes in the spatial structure of landscapes, which are translated into the domain of transport planning. It examines how spatial metrics can be integrated into "Land Use Transport" strategy-making, and how useful they are according to the practitioners' perceptions. A Light Rail Transit corridor in Granada (Spain) provides the empirical focus of this research. Land use characteristics such as: land use mixing, land use diversity and green areas connectivity were successfully studied using spatial metrics, and they were used to map three "Land Use Transport" strategies: (i) proximity dynamics and non-motorised modes; (ii) modal shift from cars to Light Rail Transit system; (iii) shared spaces between motorised and non-motorised modes. Practitioners perceived that spatial metrics could improve the "Land Use Transport" strategy-making process in comparison with traditional methods used in practice. However, certain shortcomings related to the usability of spatial metrics are also highlighted and discussed. This study concludes with a reflection on research challenges for adapting spatial metrics to transport practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spatial synchronization refers to similarity in temporal variations between spatially separated populations. Three mechanisms have been associated with the spatial synchrony of populations: Moran effect, dispersal and trophic interactions. In this study, we explored the degree of spatial synchrony of three wader species populations (Pied Avocet, Black-winged Stilt and Kentish Plover) using monthly estimates of their abundance in inland lakes of the Iberian Peninsula. The effect of several types of wetland variables (structural, hydroperiod and landscape) on spatial synchronization was explored. Groups of lakes with significant synchronization were identified for all three species. The lakes with wastewater input presented longer hydroperiods than those that did not receive these effluents, and this factor was positively related to the spatial synchrony of the Pied Avocet and Kentish Plover populations. The distance between lakes (used as an indicator of the dispersal effect on synchronization) was significant only in Pied Avocet. No structural or landscape variables were related to spatial synchronization in any species. It was impossible to identify any variable related to the spatial synchronization of Black-winged Stilt abundance as a possible result of the high ecological plasticity of this species. Our data provides the first evidence for mechanisms that act on the spatial synchronizing of wader populations in temporary continental lakes in central Spain, and show that the hydroperiod of lakes acts as an important factor in the spatial synchronization of aquatic species and that its effect is mediated by the reception of urban wastewater.

AB  - This paper focuses on the way people define and challenge practices of distance during protest and the way protesters disrupt 'generally established and universally visible and valid distances' associated with the place. In illuminating these ideas, two case studies with seemingly similar socio-spatial characteristics are explored. The first case was initiated by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and aimed to call attention to the nation's neediest people by embarking on the 'Poor People's Campaign', which settled people on the National Mall in an encampment they called Resurrection City (RC). The second action, the Occupy Movement, was an international protest movement directed towards social and economic inequality. The Occupy Movement called upon protesters to 'flood into lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few months' to call attention to the inequalities of global capitalism. The paper interprets the strategies and tactics used by the Poor People's Campaign and the Occupy Movement to challenge distance, concluding with some reflections on the way contemporary forms of dissent are changing the way we perceive public space and its politics.

AB  - Higher rates of school switching by students contribute to achievement disparities and are typically theorized as driven by attributes of individual pupils or families. In contrast the neoclassical-economic account postulates that switching is necessary for competition among schools. We argue that both frames fail to capture social-referential and institutional comparisons that drive student mobility, hypothesizing that pupil mobility stems from the (a) student's time in school and grade; (b) student's race, class, and achievement relative to peers; (c) quality of schooling relative to nearby alternatives; and (4) proximity, abundance, and diversity of local school options. Propositions are tested with discrete-time hazard models using data from Los Angeles, including 6.5 million observations. We find the student's position relative to peers, relative school quality, and proximity to local alternatives contribute significantly to the likelihood of switching schools, beyond the effects of individual pupil or family attributes. Implications for understanding choice as a social-referential process within diverse organizational fields like urban education markets are discussed.

That massive takeover of public space lasted a few weeks but part of the movement (a bunch of assemblies, together with people involved in actions and iniciatives in the neighbourhoods and on the streets) continues today, five years later. The aim of this article is to explain (i) the genealogies of the feminist and queer assemblies which were organized within the 15M, (ii) the tensions and conflicts around these issues in the occupied squares and afterwards, and (iii) the labour of political pedagogy carried out by these assemblies towards both the movement itself and the city/society in general.

AB  - Hedgehogs (Erinaceous europaeus), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were 93.4% of 1390 mammal carcasses counted during 92 trips along a 63.2km route, 2009-2014, through peri-urban and farmland habitats. Pukeko (Porphyriomelanotus) and swamp harriers (Circus approximans) constituted 29% of the 466 bird road-kill. Comparisons indicate the recovery of hedgehog and rabbit populations from declines to 2005 and 2009, respectively, and the increased suppression of possum populations, consistent with disease and pest control trajectories. Road-kill density was spatially and temporally aggregated. Seasonal peaks reflected species-specific periodicity in breeding and dispersal. Carcass densities varied positively with traffic volume and did not asymptote with increasing traffic up to 25,000 vehicles per day. Kill rates per vehicle were maintained at the highest traffic volumes. Busier roads were not avoided by wildlife and could be substantial demographic sinks and barriers to their spread. We discuss the implications for wildlife management and conservation.

Based on a questionnaire conducted in stations on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and through an analysis of high-speed rail passenger travel behavior and family relocation, we explored the social effects of high-speed rail. The study found that high-speed rail passengers are mainly young, highly educated, and have a middle to high income. However, with the popularization of high-speed rail, such differences in the social stratum of high-speed rail passengers are expected to disappear. Through an analysis of passenger travel status, we found that the areas surrounding high-speed rail stations are very accessible to the main cities, and are well connected by other public transport. With the emergence of the "high mobility era" based on the high-speed rail network, the separation of workplace and residence and the number of "double city" households are increasing, primarily in the Beijing-Tianjin and Shanghai-Nanjing (especially in Suzhou-Kunshan-Shanghai) regions. In addition, high-speed rail introduces the possibility of household mobility, with 22.7% of the respondents in this study having relocated since the Beijing-Shanghai line opened. Household mobility is apparent primarily among big cities, with movement toward nearby cities. We also found that occupation, income, residence time, and schooling of children have a significant impact on households. With the improvement of high-speed rail networks, household mobility will become a common phenomenon and research on domestic mobility will continue to increase.

AB  - Anthropogenic heat (AH) emissions from human activities caused by urbanization can affect the city environment. Based on the energy consumption and the gridded demographic data, the spatial distribution of AH emission over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is estimated. Meanwhile, a new method for the AH parameterization is developed in the WRF/Chem model, which incorporates the gridded AH emission data with the seasonal and diurnal variations into the simulations. By running this upgraded WRF/Chem for 2 typical months in 2010, the impacts of AH on the meteorology and air quality over the YRD region are studied. The results show that the AH fluxes over the YRD have been growing in recent decades. In 2010, the annual-mean values of AH over Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang are 14.46, 2.61 and 1.63aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2), respectively, with the high value of 113.5aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2) occurring in the urban areas of Shanghai. These AH emissions can significantly change the urban heat island and urban-breeze circulations in the cities of the YRD region. In Shanghai, 2aEuro-m air temperature increases by 1.6aEuro-A degrees C in January and 1.4aEuro-A degrees C in July, the PBLH (planetary boundary layer height) rises up by 140aEuro-m in January and 160aEuro-m in July, and 10aEuro-m wind speed is enhanced by 0.7aEuro-maEuro-s(-1) in January and 0.5aEuro-maEuro-s(-1) in July, with a higher increment at night. The enhanced vertical movement can transport more moisture to higher levels, which causes the decrease in water vapor at ground level and the increase in the upper PBL (planetary boundary layer), and thereby induces the accumulative precipitation to increase by 15-30aEuro-% over the megacities in July. The adding of AH can impact the spatial and vertical distributions of the simulated pollutants as well. The concentrations of primary air pollutants decrease near the surface and increase at the upper levels, due mainly to the increases in PBLH, surface wind speed and upward air vertical movement. But surface O-3 concentrations increase in the urban areas, with maximum changes of 2.5aEuro-ppb in January and 4aEuro-ppb in July. Chemical direct (the rising up of air temperature directly accelerates surface O-3 formation) and indirect (the decrease in NOx at the ground results in the increase in surface O-3) effects can play a significant role in O-3 changes over this region. The meteorology and air pollution predictions in and around large urban areas are highly sensitive to the anthropogenic heat inputs, suggesting that AH should be considered in the climate and air quality assessments.

AB  - Like many developed coastal cities, San Diego, California has strong geographic and recreational ties to the adjacent ocean, but weak culinary ones. Less than 10% of the seafood consumed in the U.S., and San Diego in particular, is domestic. The popularity and abundance of farmers' markets and other local markets in San Diego indicates an interest among producers and the public alike in cultivating local, diverse food systems, but this trend has been slower to catch on for seafood. The goal of this project was, therefore, to define and begin to understand the influences on the patterns of locally sourced, domestic seafood availability in San Diego. This study focused on seafood availability in seafood markets including researching market websites and contacting seafood counter managers to determine the general frequency (consistent, occasional, none) at which the markets sold seafood produced by San Diego fishermen or aquafarmers. Seafood market locations were mapped, and demographic and spatial information was gathered for each market's zip code. The results of the study revealed that only 8% of San Diego's 86 seafood markets consistently carried San Diego-sourced seafood, and 14% of markets carried it on occasion. Increased density of these local seafood markets was correlated with proximity to the coast, with almost 80% of the markets located within 2 km of the coast. Neither per capita income nor racial diversity was correlated with local seafood market density, indicating that factors contributing to coastal isolation matter more than wealth or diversity in determining where local seafood is sold. The geographic disparity in local seafood availability may be due to a variety of factors, including a small fishing fleet, prevalence of imported seafood, limited waterfront and urban infrastructure needed to support a local seafood system, and a lack of public awareness about local fisheries. Information gleaned from this study can inform further investigation into the influences on local, equitable seafood systems, as well as help consumers, producers and marketers to make informed decisions about seafood purchases and marketing efforts.

AB  - Lack of diversity in the ranks as well as a failure to resonate with disadvantaged groups and other anti-oppression movements has been cited as one important barrier to the American Nonhuman Animal rights movement's success (Kymlicka and Donaldson in Animal rights, multiculturalism and the Left. The Mellon Sawyer Seminar at the Graduate Center, CUNY. City University of New York, New York, 2013). It is possible that social movements are actively inhibiting diversity in the ranks and audience by producing literature that reflects a narrow activist identity. This article creates a platform from which these larger issues can be explored by investigating the actual demographic representations present in a small sample of popular media sources produced by the movement for other animals. A content analysis of 131 magazine covers produced by two highly visible movement actors, PETA and VegNews, was conducted to demonstrate that activist representations in at least some dominant American Nonhuman Animal rights media are mostly white, female, and thin.

Mobility mode displays an animation of taxi movement in the city with pick-up drop-off locations, as well as statistical information about the number of total trips made, current and recent available/occupied number of taxis, and top performance taxis. Mobility mode also allows the user to select any particular taxi to be displayed individually through a drop-down menu and search bar. Flow mode gives an overview of taxi movement with an animation of origin-destination (pick-up/drop-off) hourly flows, along with statistical graph of hourly trips made. The user can choose to view any particular time duration to observe the flow. The developed tool can be useful for taxi service providers in scheduling and dispatching management, as well as urban planning and design.

AB  - Background
   There was a dengue epidemic in several regions of China in 2013. No study has explored the dynamics of dengue transmission between different geographical locations with dengue outbreaks in China. The purpose of the study is to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and to explore the dynamic transmission of dengue in China, 2013.
   Methodology and Principal Findings
   Records of dengue cases of 2013 were obtained from the China Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Full E-gene sequences of dengue virus detected from the outbreak regions of China were download from GenBank. Geographical Information System and heatmaps were used to describe the epidemiological characteristics. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylogeographic analyses were conducted to explore the dengue dynamic transmission. Yunnan Province and Guangdong Province had the highest imported cases in the 2013 epidemic. In the locations with local dengue transmission, most of imported cases occurred from June to November 2013 while local dengue cases developed from July to December, 2013. There were significant variations for the incidences of dengue, in terms of age distributions, among different geographic locations. However, gender differences were identified in Guangzhou, Foshan and Xishuangbanna. DENV 1-3 were detected in all locations with the disease outbreaks. Some genotypes were detected in more than one locations and more than one genotypes have been detected in several locations. The dengue viruses introduced to outbreak areas were predominantly from Southeast Asia. In Guangdong Province, the phylogeographical results indicated that dengue viruses of DENV 1 were transmitted to neighboring cities Foshan and Zhongshan from Guangzhou city, and then transmitted to Jiangmen city. The virus in DENV 3 was introduced to Guangzhou city, Guangdong Province from Xishuangbanna prefecture, Yunnan Province.
   Conclusions
   Repeated dengue virus introductions from Southeast Asia and subsequent domestic dengue transmission within different regions may have contributed to the dengue epidemics in China, 2013.

AB  - Green roofs can mitigate a number of urban environmental problems when green roof plant communities provide ecosystem services. However, this perspective may fail to address ecological aspects of the plant community. In particular, it does not account for the potential for green roofs to facilitate biological invasions. We consider current research in green roof ecology in light of the literature on biological invasions, focusing on plant invasion. We evaluate the role of species composition and novel communities, species interactions, succession, and dispersal on the trajectory of green roof plant communities. Green roofs have the potential to introduce invasive species through initial plantings, to become dominated by invasive species, and to spread invasive species, and we provide recommendations for plant selection and maintenance to reduce the risks of facilitating plant invasions to surrounding communities.

AB  - Mid-level disasters that frequently occur, such as typhoons and earthquakes, heavily affect human activities in urban areas by causing severe congestion and economic loss. Predicting the irregular movement of individuals following such disasters is crucial for managing urban systems. Past survey results show that mid-level disasters do not force many individuals to evacuate away from their homes, but do cause irregular movement by significantly delaying the movement timings, resulting in severe congestion in urban transportation. We propose a novel method that predicts such irregularity of individuals' movements in several mid-level disasters using various types of features including the victims' usual movement patterns, disaster information, and geospatial information of victims' locations. Using real GPS data of 1 million people in Tokyo, we show that our method can predict mobility delay with high accuracy,

AB  - Fewer than 250 Asian elephants remain in China, occupying fragmented habitats of Yunnan Province. One such fragmented population of 18-23 individuals occupies the Nangunhe Nature Reserve Area in Lincang City, Yunnan Province, China. The greatest threat to the survival of this population is the loss and fragmentation of habitat. In this study, we applied an ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) model to evaluate the habitat suitability of Lincang City for Asian elephants based on geographical factors, vegetation type, and human disturbance. Optimal, relatively suitable, and marginal habitat accounted for 0.16% (38.45 km(2)), 0.61% (150.00 km(2)), and 3.34% (817.26 km(2)) of the total study area, whereas non-suitable habitat accounted for 95.89% (23,463.29 km(2)) of this area. The marginality of Asian elephant habitat in Lincang was 1.954, indicating nonrandom selection of various eco-geographical variables in the environment. The primary factor affecting Asian elephant habitat quality was vegetation type, followed by geographical factors and human disturbance. A habitat quality map for the total distribution of Asian elephants remaining in China (i.e., Yunnan Province: Xishuangbanna, Lincang, and Pu'er) based on our current and previous study showed that just 1400.57 km(2) and 2689.62 km(2) relatively suitable and optimal habitat is available, owing to significant deforestation. In addition to reintroduction programs, conservation strategies should focus on improving the quality of marginal habitats for elephants, in parallel to placing ecological corridors through non-suitable habitat to connect all suitable habitats for this and other extremely small elephant populations in China to reduce genetic isolation and secure long-term survival for the species.

AB  - Salamanders are expected to differentiate genetically among local populations due to their low dispersal ability, and are potentially susceptible to loss of genetic diversity if the population is isolated by habitat fragmentation. The salamander Hynobius tokyoensis is a lowland lentic breeder and endemic to a narrow area of central Japan. In this urban area, H. tokyoensis habitats are extensively fragmented and several populations are threatened with extinction, but information on genetic divergence and loss of genetic diversity is scarce. We performed mitochondrial (cyt b) and microsatellite (five loci) DNA analyses of 815 individuals from 46 populations in 12 regions across their entire distribution range. As a result, populations were clearly separated into northern and southern groups, and genetic differentiation among the 12 regions was also evident. Regional differentiation appears to be affected by a complex geographical history, but the genetic diversity of each population may have also been affected by recent habitat fragmentation. There were positive correlations between the mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA diversities. Some populations have lost genetic diversity in both mitochondrial and microsatellite DNAs; all such populations were at the peripheral edges of the species distribution range. Thus, even in attempts to restore genetic diversity in a small population by the transfer of outside individuals, efforts must be made to avoid genetic pollution.

AB  - Mosquito midgut microbiota is a key component of vector competence, as gut bacteria can disturb pathogen development. In this study, we addressed the microbiota composition of Aedes aegypti during its lifespan, under field conditions. We also investigated the possible effects of environment, dietary regime and ageing on the gut community composition. We employed culture independent and dependent approaches to characterise vector microbiota. There was evidence of a lifelong stable core microbiota after mosquitoes were released into an urban settlement, where they presumably fed on a range of vertebrate hosts and carbohydrate sources. This core was formed mainly of bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas and Stenotrophomonas and to the families Oxalobacteraceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Comamonadaceae. We showed that both dietary regime and age were associated with the abundance of some bacterial groups in the Ae. aegypti microbiota. The majority of the bacterial groups we identified have been detected in the midgut of Ae. aegypti from laboratory and wild populations, indicating a possible core microbiota associated with this mosquito species. Our findings suggest that Ae. aegypti harbours a stable bacterial community during its adult life, similar to mosquito populations from distinct geographic areas, which may be further explored for arbovirus biocontrol strategies.

AB  - Predicting changes in species distributions under a changing climate is becoming widespread with the use of species distribution models (SDMs). The resulting predictions of future potential habitat can be cast in light of planned land use changes, such as urban expansion and energy development to identify areas with potential conflict. However, SDMs rarely incorporate an understanding of dispersal capacity, and therefore assume unlimited dispersal in potential range shifts under uncertain climate futures. We use SDMs to predict future distributions of the Mojave ground squirrel, Xerospermophilus mohavensis Merriam, and incorporate partial dispersal models informed by field data on juvenile dispersal to assess projected impact of climate change and energy development on future distributions of X. mohavensis. Our models predict loss of extant habitat, but also concurrent gains of new habitat under two scenarios of future climate change. Under the B1 emissions scenario-a storyline describing a convergent world with emphasis on curbing greenhouse gas emissions-our models predicted losses of up to 64% of extant habitat by 2080, while under the increased greenhouse gas emissions of the A2 scenario, we suggest losses of 56%. New potential habitat may become available to X. mohavensis, thereby offsetting as much as 6330 km(2) (50%) of the current habitat lost. Habitat lost due to planned energy development was marginal compared to habitat lost from changing climates, but disproportionately affected current habitat. Future areas of overlap in potential habitat between the two climate change scenarios are identified and discussed in context of proposed energy development. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - "Ecological Infrastructure (EI)" are defined as naturally functioning ecosystems that deliver valuable services to people, such as healthy mountain catchments, rivers, wetlands, coastal dunes, and nodes and corridors of natural habitat, which together form a network of interconnected structural elements in the landscape. On the other hand, natural disaster occur at the locations where habitat was reduced due to the changes of land use, in which the land was converted to the settlements and agricultural cropland. Hence, habitat loss and natural disaster are linked closely. Ecological infrastructure is the nature-based equivalent of built or hard infrastructure, and is as important for providing services and underpinning socio-economic development. Hence, ecological infrastructure is expected to contribute to functioning as ecological disaster reduction, which is termed Ecosystem-based Solutions for Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR). Although ecological infrastructure already exists in the landscape, it might be degraded, needs to be maintained and managed, and in some cases restored. Maintenance and restoration of ecological infrastructure is important for security of human lives. Therefore, analytical tool and effective visualization tool in spatially explicit way for the past natural disaster and future prediction of natural disaster in relation to ecological infrastructure is considered helpful. Hence, Web-GIS based Ecological Infrastructure Environmental Information System (EI-EIS) has been developed. This paper aims to describe the procedure of development and future application of EI-EIS. The purpose of the EI-EIS is to evaluate functions of Eco-DRR. In order to analyse disaster data, collection of past disaster information, and disaster-prone area is effective. First, a number of digital maps and analogue maps in Japan and Europe were collected. In total, 18,572 maps over 100 years were collected. The Japanese data includes Future-Pop Data Series (1,736 maps), JMC dataset 50m grid (elevation) (13,071 maps), Old Edition Maps: Topographic Map (325 maps), Digital Base Map at a scale of 2500 for reconstruction planning (808 maps), Detailed Digital Land Use Information for Metropolitan Area (10 m land use) (2,436 maps), and Digital Information by GSI (national large scale map) (71 maps). Old Edition Maps: Topographic Map were analogue maps, and were scanned and georeferenced. These geographical area covered 1) Tohoku area, 2) Five Lakes of Mikata area (Fukui), 3) Ooshima Island (Tokyo), 4) Hiroshima area (Hiroshima), 5) Okushiri Island (Hokkaido), and 6) Toyooka City area (Hyogo). The European data includes topographic map in Germany (8 maps), old topographic map in Germany (31 maps), ancient map in Germany (23 maps), topographic map in Austria (9 maps), old topographic map in Austria (17 maps), and ancient map in Austria (37 maps). Second, focusing on Five Lakes of Mikata area as an example, these maps were integrated into the ArcGIS Online (R) (ESRI). These data can be overlaid, and time-series data can be visualized by a time slider function of ArcGIS Online.

AB  - In Toulouse, in the 14th and 15th centuries, in a difficult and changing context, the urban elites, embodied by the well-known Capitoulat, actually make up a heterogeneous, mobile, and divided group. In spite of their social diversity and their differences, however, these men manage to establish a political identity shared by this group which includes high-ranking citizens and the ruling urban class. The purpose of this paper is to examine the to-and-fro movement between the Toulouse elites' otherness and identity, which thus invents urban identity, by studying discourses and representations, thanks to different sources (normative documents and documents de la pratique, such as notarial records), iconography, but also through the way of life and material culture)

AB  - Background: Numerous studies have suggested that friendly walking environments positively affect physical activity and health. Creating friendly walking environments in urban areas is a complex and wide-ranging topic, and no study has yet established a set of assessment indicators by drawing on the expertise of various disciplines. This study uses a multiple-criteria decision-making technique to elucidate the environmental factors that affect the friendliness of the walking environment.
   Methods: We conducted a two-phase expert questionnaire survey. Experts from the government sector, as well as the academic disciplines of urban planning, transportation, architecture, and landscape design, were recruited to establish a set of walking environment indicators; the degrees of importance assigned to these indicators by the experts were subsequently compared. In phase 1, the fuzzy Delphi method was used by 20 experts, whose responses were used to identify four dimensions and 22 indicators. In phase 2, an analytical network process approach was performed by 16 experts to determine the weights of the dimensions and indicators.
   Results: The results revealed that all of the experts ranked the four dimensions in the order of safety > facilities > aesthetics > land use mix. Of the 22 indicators, land use-diversity, land use-access, sidewalk width, sidewalk continuity, and cleanliness were considered the most important.
   Conclusions: The results provide a reference for the management of walking environments by promoting pedestrian- oriented environments and public health.

CP  - 13th IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)
AB  - Simulation is known to be an effective technique to understand and manage traffic in cities of developed countries. However, in developing countries, traffic management is lacking due to a wide diversity of vehicles on the road, their chaotic movement, little instrumentation to sense traffic state and limited funds to create IT and physical infrastructure to ameliorate the situation. Under these conditions, in this paper, we present our approach of using the Megaffic traffic simulator as a service to gain actionable insights for two use-cases and cities in India, a first. Our approach is general to be readily used in other use cases and cities; and our results give new insights: (a) using demographics data, traffic demand can be reduced if timings of government offices are altered in Delhi, (b) using a mobile company's Call Data Record (CDR) data to mine trajectories anonymously, one can take effective traffic actions while organizing events in Mumbai at local scale.

AB  - A rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in the 'West' has invoked wide debate on the impacts of Islamophobia on Australian Muslim citizens. Noble and Poynting ('White Lines: The Intercultural Politics of Everyday Movement in Social Spaces', Journal of Intercultural Studies 31 (2010): 489-505) speculated that racism impacts young Muslims' sense of belonging in and across public spheres. Despite Australian Muslim testimonials of racial experiences occurring in the public space, the impact of racism on how ethnic and/or religious minorities, such as Muslims, translate this sentiment into mental maps of exclusion has not hitherto been empirically examined. This paper reports on the findings of an online survey conducted in July 2014 with young Australian Muslims living in Sydney. Young Muslims suggest that there is a geographical distribution of Islamophobic spaces across Sydney, focused in the regions of Sutherland, Sydney's North Side/Eastern Suburbs, and the Upper North Shore. In comparing young Muslims' 'mental maps' of Islamophobia and existing evidence of Sydney's 'geographies of racial attitudes' illustrated by Forrest and Dunn in 2007 ('Constructing Racism in Sydney, Australia's Largest EthniCity', Urban Studies 44 (2007): 699-721), the need for culturally specific, empirical examinations of (in) tolerance across Australian cities is emphasised.

AB  - In landscapes dominated by fluvial erosion, the landscape morphology is closely related to the hydrographic network system. In this paper, we investigate the hydrographic network reorganization caused by a headward piracy mechanism between two drainage basins in France, the Meuse and the Moselle. Several piracies occurred in the Meuse basin during the past one million years, and the basin's current characteristics are favorable to new piracies by the Moselle river network. This study evaluates the consequences over the next several million years of a relative lowering of the Moselle River (and thus of its basin) with respect to the Meuse River. The problem is addressed with a numerical modeling approach (landscape evolution model, hereafter LEM) that requires empirical determinations of parameters and threshold values. Classically, fitting of the parameters is based on analysis of the relationship between the slope and the drainage area and is conducted under the hypothesis of equilibrium. Application of this conventional approach to the capture issue yields incomplete results that have been consolidated by a parametric sensitivity analysis. The LEM equations give a six-dimensional parameter space that was explored with over 15,000 simulations using the landscape evolution model GOLEM. The results demonstrate that stream piracies occur in only four locations in the studied reach near the city of Toul. The locations are mainly controlled by the local topography and are model-independent. Nevertheless, the chronology of the captures depends on two parameters: the river concavity (given by the fluvial advection equation) and the hillslope erosion factor. Thus, the simulations lead to three different scenarios that are explained by a phenomenon of exclusion or a string of events. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We analysed the development of benthic invertebrate assemblages in restored urban streams in Germany. Prior to restoration these streams were open sewers and not inhabited by benthic invertebrates except Oligochaeta. Therefore, almost all taxa recolonised the streams after restoration. Restoration included the improvement of the water quality and the hydro-morphology. Following stream restoration, benthic invertebrate assemblages are supposed to undergo a distinct succession, as new habitats have been generated. These processes are poorly understood in streams. Our study revealed succession patterns and processes of benthic invertebrate assemblages in restored streams formerly transporting sewage, with pioneer taxa being dominant in the first years and a gradual assemblage maturation. We sampled 13 sites in seven restored streams in the springs of 2012 and 2013. Seven of these sites are connected to near-natural sections, whereas six sites lack this connection. The 13 sites differ in time since restoration and were sampled between one and 20 years after restoration. Additionally, we sampled 21 near-natural sites within the catchment and 11 near-natural sites in neighbouring catchments as potential recolonisation sources. Within 1 year, the restored sites underwent succession, which led to a higher resemblance of their assemblages to those of source sites. Derived from change values and non-metric multidimensional scaling, assemblages of young restored sites changed more than assemblages of old ones. In the first years after restoration we found assemblages with high abundances of pioneer taxa, while 5 years after restoration assemblages were increasingly similar to those of the source sites and mature assemblages were observed a decade after restoration. The succession towards near-natural assemblages is influenced by the instream habitats, catchment conditions and the recolonisation sources in the surroundings. Our findings reveal that monitoring results obtained fewer than 10 years after restoration will still be influenced by ongoing succession.

AB  - Cities annex wilderness and alter the interactions between the plant and animal assemblages embedded in the remaining nature fragments. Here, we explore consequences of habitat fragmentation for dispersal of cactus by fruit-eating mammals in the Sonoran Desert landscape. We use the barrel cactus, Ferocactus wislizeni, as a model system to diagnose (1) how fruit utilization by a mammal assemblage changes with fragment area and isolation, (2) what characteristics make individual plants particularly susceptible to frugivore failure, and (3) how inter-fragment differences in plant-frugivore interactions influence the seedlings' susceptibility to other stressors (granivores and drought). We described the type and phenology of plant-animal interactions in 20 fragments along a 0.05-500 ha size continuum within a large city (Tucson, Arizona, USA), and combined allometric scaling models of mammalian home ranges and descriptions of plant size distributions to predict the fraction of the fruit crops accessible to resident mammalian frugivores in each fragment. Fruit removal rates generally increased along a continuum of fragment sizes, and older, taller plants were particularly susceptible to frugivore failure and more likely to have fruits attacked by granivorous rodents. As a result, thresholds where the nature and/or phenology of a plant's interactions with animals changes can be accurately predicted by integrating descriptions of fragment size, fragment isolation, and plant population structure. Last, we found support for the hypothesis that fragmentation-induced changes in the phenology of fruit removal compromise the seedlings' ability to exploit precipitation delivered in winter and spring. Specifically, as a result of slower fruit removal, the seed crops in small fragments forfeit access to an increasing proportion of the rains between October and March, which determine whether cactus seedlings can survive the following dry season (April, May, June). We expect these inter-site differences in the type and phenology of interactions to compromise the integrity of plant populations in smaller fragments, to become increasingly influential in ecological settings in the Sonoran Desert where access to precipitation is essential, and to become increasingly prevalent as the plants in newly fragmented plant populations age (grow) to sizes that are more susceptible to frugivore failure in the defaunated landscapes.

AB  - Stream daylighting is a radical form of restoration which aims to improve morphological, chemical and ecological condition through the re-creation of an open channel from a buried or piped channel. Whilst empirical assessments of its efficacy are lacking, it is hypothesised that the substantial changes in habitat, channel form and energy supply arising from daylighting would lead to a significant changes in stream invertebrate communities, particularly where source populations of macroinvertebrates exist upstream. In this first published study of the ecological outcomes arising from a daylighting project, changes in the invertebrate community were assessed in two reaches of an urban stream catchment in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, which were daylighted in early 2013. The two reaches allowed a paired assessment, where one of the reaches had a large area of intact native forest in its headwaters. Stream macroinvertebrates were sampled monthly pre- and post-daylighting to assess changes in stream macroinvertebrate communities.
   Community composition significantly changed pre- to post-daylighting (PERMANOVA Pseudo F = 2.0978, P=0.0018), where communities in different reaches changed by 58% and 71%, respectively. Taxonomic richness did not change with daylighting; however taxa replacements were apparent with 44 new taxa being collected in daylighted reaches and 11 taxa disappearing. Daylighting resulted in marked changes in energy resources and improved habitat in the short-term which altered invertebrate communities from biofilm feeding collector-browser communities to algal grazer communities. Although daylighting did not fully restore these streams from the effects of urbanisation, it is one practical option for the management of urban streams. Further, the presence of a local source population was an important determinant of stream community structure. Where source populations existed upstream community responses to daylighting were greater, including increased abundances of sensitive taxa. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Globalization, which brings the deformations such as the transformation of everything into imitation of each other, leads to uniformity between places by ignoring specific characteristics of a particular place in the design process. With the changes of urban or/and structural pattern occurring in this process, architecture turns into a commodity serving the consumer and fictionalizes the relationship between the place-culture and time in a different way. In this regenerated (un)relevance network, the features such as the memory of the place, urban context, socio-cultural structure and topography remain in the background, but serving to consumption becomes important in the design criteria. This architecture, named as "non-place" in literature, does not have the characteristics of a place; it does not reference to any context and creates no long-term experiences which make people feel the sense of belonging.
   The metamorphosis of the place to the non-place can be apparently observed in the framework of the transformation of historical districts where the individual, space and time intersect and where the concept of identity is formed through experiences. In these days it can be seen that with globalization's effect a differentiation of the user profile occurs with a functional change of historical buildings. In this case the architecture leads to an urban evaluation by affecting its near environment and the social structure as well. This article focusses on the regeneration of the place through globalization and consumption and aims to investigate the formation of the non-place. The consumption oriented changes in a historical district and its effects to the city are discussed in the case of Park-Hotel in Istanbul, Beyoglu. After summarizing the conceptual background on the subject, process of the metamorphosis of the hotel and its environment and the evolution of the building into a non-place are described by focusing on the impact of this transformation.

AB  - Perenniporia fraxinea is a fungal pathogen causing wood decay in roots and bole of a wide variety of broadleaf tree species. Despite its ecological importance, little is know about the infection biology of this fungus and in particular of its ability to infect trees through the mycelia growth through root contacts. To clarify its spreading mechanisms, a genetic analysis of 20 P. fraxinea isolates obtained from basidiomata collected from closely located Robinia pseudoacacia and Quercus robur trees in the Vernavola Urban Park (Pavia, Italy) and in surrounding areas was performed. Random Amplified Microsatellites (RAMs) fingerprinting was conducted allowing to distinguish 19 different haplotypes. High intrapopulation diversity was confirmed by somatic incompatibility tests (SITs), which were performed by dual-culturing isolates in vitro in all possible combinations, resulting in detection of 16 compatibility groups. These results, together with Non-metric MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis on genetic data, suggest that spread through root contacts is unlikely for P. fraxinea. In addition, a significant negative correlation between spatial distribution and kinship coefficients was observed in isolates from the Vernavola Urban Park, suggesting a limited dispersal potential of P. fraxinea basidiospores. This report provides a first glimpse of the primary mechanisms of spread of P. fraxinea.

AB  - We develop a cellular automaton (CA) model to produce spatiotemporal population maps that estimate population distributions in an urban area during a random working day. The resulting population maps are at 50m and 5 minutes spatiotemporal resolution, showing clearly how the distribution of population varies throughout a 24-hour period. The maps indicate that some areas of the city, which are sparsely populated during the night, can be densely populated during the day. The developed CA model assumes that the population transition trends follow dynamics and propagation patterns similar to a contagious disease. Thus, our model designed to change the states of each grid cell (stable or dynamic) in a way that is similar to changes in the condition of individuals who are exposed to an infectious disease (susceptible or infected). In addition, the modeling space is informed by several geographic features, such as the transport routes, land-use categories, and population attraction points. The model is geosimulated for the city of Trondheim in Norway, where the synthetic day population could be validated using an estimated daypopulation map based on the registered workplace addresses and employee statistics. The generated maps can be used to estimate a value for the population-at-risk in the wake of a major disaster that occurs in an urban area at any time of a day. In addition to assessing exposure to hazards, the resulting maps also reveal movement patterns, transition trends, peak hours, and activity levels. Possible applications range from public safety, disaster management, transport modeling, and urban growth studies to strategic energy distribution planning.

AB  - Critical race scholars have argued that curricular portrayals of the Civil Rights Movement are undermined by master narratives that legitimate the racial status quo. Although many scholars have critiqued Movement master narratives in social studies and society, few studies have examined Black students' interpretations of such representations and the effects of these representations on their sense of civic agency. In this article, I present ethnographic data that illustrate the function of a specific type of master narrative, messianic master narratives, in 9 Black urban youths' understandings of historical and contemporary civil rights leadership. Messianic master narratives position an individual as the messiah, savior, or deliverer of an oppressed group. Data provide evidence that messianic master narratives constrain Black youths' civic agency, specifically by associating civil rights leadership with immense risk, uncritically invoking Judeo-Christian values, and undermining participants' understandings of historical agency and historical collective action. I conclude by explicating curricular risks associated with messianic master narratives and offering recommendations toward disrupting these narratives in social studies classrooms.

AB  - Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is causing extensive mortality of ash (Fraxinus Linnaeus; Oleaceae) in North America. Once detected in an area, resource managers require methods to obtain estimates that could improve management decisions. We studied the within-crown and within-branch distribution and abundance of A. planipennis feeding galleries by sampling 3-m-long branches from asymptomatic urban ash trees and subdividing each branch into 12 sections of 25 cm each. We found galleries in all 12 sections of some, but not all, branches. Section was a significant source of variation in A. planipennis gallery density/m(2) of branch surface area. A comparison of predictive power and efficiency of estimates for samples of increasing length, and for samples of the same length but consisting of different combinations of sections, revealed that those based on the two basal 25-cm sections of a branch from the lower-crown or mid-crown of an asymptomatic tree were less accurate and precise than those based on more sections, but were the most cost effective. Whittling more sections per branch, irrespective of the combinations of branch sections per length, improved predictive power but reduced cost effectiveness. We also observed that crown level was not important, and aspect was only marginally so, when estimating gallery abundance per sampled branch.

AB  - The increasing health burdens pose great challenge for planners and policy makers to create a more livable city. Recent literature has linked land use to a wide range of illness and death causes in developed nations. It therefore requires evidence-driven and replicable frameworks to inform land use decisions that integrate with health promotion. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for the mechanistic links between neighborhood land use and public health; and then quantifies their associations at district level, using the case of Shenzhen in developing China. Data for 15 health indicators in 2010 are collected at district level; and a set of standardized land use variables (individual land use type, general land use mix, and physical street conditions) are proposed to comprehensively reflect the neighborhood land use characteristics. Spatial regression is employed to analyze the relationships between health outcomes and land use variables. Results show that the land use exploratory variables vary with health indicators, but several key land use determinants are identified: green land abundance, green land morphology, institutional land proximity, industrial land proximity, blue land abundance, street walkability and street connectivity. Structural equation modeling is further applied to examine the possible mediators and it demonstrates that the casual pathways between land use and public health are quite complex. The developed set of standardized land use variables can serve as practical tools to facilitate land use decisions with health considerations. In practice, several complexities at governance levels challenge the efforts to reconnect land use policies and public health promotion. We put forward three useful solutions to enhancing health connection with land use policy across different international settings.

AB  - In recent decades, greenways have been the focus of an international movement to improve urban environment quality. In metropolitan areas, more greenways are interconnected, forming a greenway network (GN). A GN is considered to encourage physical activities, but verifying this statement is difficult, as traditional social survey methods do not obtain fine-grain activity geographic data on a large scale. In view of this shortcoming, the volunteered geographic information and the geographic information system techniques were used to describe the distribution of physical activities in a GN, to explore the effects of greenway network features on supporting activities. The 1640-km-long Shenzhen GN was selected as a representative case, and walking, jogging and cycling were chosen as typical activities. The results showed that only a quarter of greenways were with activities. Greenways with dense residences, mixed land-use, advanced street network and large parks yielded positive effects on supporting physical activities, and advanced public transportation further improved activity diversity. Due to the spatial mismatch between the GN distribution and well-developed areas, the GN density showed negative effects on the presence of physical activities; within the greenways in use, the GN density, significantly improved activity diversity, indicating the positive effect of network feature on supporting activities. Compared with neighbourhood greenways, city and regional greenways supported more physical activities due to richer natural resources. The findings reveal that GN in green and welldeveloped areas supports physical activities better. Location, green quality and network form are necessary for greenways and should be integrated into GN planning. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Open Streets are community-based programs that promote the use of public space for physical activity (PA), recreation and socialization by closing streets temporarily to motorized vehicles, allowing access to pedestrians. The city of Atlanta hosted its first Open Streets event, Atlanta Streets Alive (ASA), in May 2010. An evaluation of the first 5 ASA events from May 2010 to May 2012 was conducted. The purpose was to learn about the characteristics of ASA participants, the influence of the event on their PA, and perceptions of safety and neighborhood social capital. Methods: ASA's evaluation had 2 components: participant counts and a participant survey. Characteristics of participation were compared among the 3 different events in which surveys were conducted using the Pearson chi(2) test and F test as appropriate. Results: The estimated participation at ASA increased from nearly 3,500 (ASA 1 to 4) to 12,520 (ASA 5). The number of events increased to 3 per year for a total of 10 events until 2014. Overall, 19.4% of participants met the weekly PA recommendation during 1 event. Conclusions: The expanding diversity of routes, participants, and sponsorships highlights the potential promise such programming offers in terms of establishing an urban culture of health.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation can change the community composition of species in remnant habitat patches. We studied the impacts of fragmentation by agriculture on the bird community in heavily fragmented areas of the sagebrush shrubsteppe in western North America. We examined whether bird communities in sagebrush habitat near orchards and vineyards were different from the community in interior sagebrush habitat, and evaluated whether observed differences could be explained by predator abundance, local vegetation, the presence of the habitat edge, or the proportion of land cover in the surrounding landscape. The bird community near agricultural edges differed from interior habitat: edge habitats had higher species diversity and were dominated by generalist bird species, while Vesper Sparrows, which are sagebrush-associated in this region, were strong indicators of interior habitat. The bird community also differed between orchard edge habitat and vineyard edge habitat, although the difference was small. Edge effects on species composition were associated with differences in the local vegetation, rather than the predator community or the proportion of urban, agricultural, and sagebrush cover on the surrounding landscape. We suggest that differences in the bird community within edge and interior habitat are the result of multiple mechanisms: avoidance of exotic grasses and attraction to high shrub cover in edge habitat, attraction to resources in adjacent habitats, and spill-over of generalist birds from the adjacent agriculture. The results of this study suggest that sagebrush bird conservation areas should be placed away from agricultural development. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   The presence of students culturally different in the classrooms from public the Primary Schools of the City of Mexico, it surprises training of educational and normalistas students, who remain perplex before the diversity of the present sociocultural contexts, for those who the curriculum, the Didactics and the theories of learning perhaps do not reach before the sociohistorico framework that today involves the processes of education and learning.
   The formativa experience that appears, is a Factory made during the scholastic cycle 2014-2015, whose intention was that students, in the last year of the Degree in Primary Education, of the Meritorious National School of Teachers, seat City of Mexico, wrote their academic trajectories of narrative form, from an autobiographical approach, with the purpose of entering itself in the world of the school through their experiences, that from the recognition of the yes same one, were sensitized with and for the others, in this case, their students.

AB  - This paper asks whether the notion of framing is sufficient to explain the ideational differences among different activist groups within a social movement. Using the example of two most prominent Arab-led pro-Palestine activist groups in New York City, Adalah-NY and Al-Awda, I argue that the notion of framing obscures much of the diversity within social movements, which has effects for how analysts can understand groups' actions and successes. Instead, I argue for attention to the discursive context in which groups situate themselves, particularly the way the identities of their members and networks allow them to make arguments that can be interpreted in a variety of discursive contexts.

AB  - In the province of Bari the hydrographic network consists of ephemeral streams called lame. In these watercourses the absence of runoff for long periods contributed to unfounded beliefs concerning the hydraulic safety of the landscape and therefore uncontrolled changes in stream beds and floodplains.
   In these streams high water discharges can occur during heavy rainfalls, as demonstrated by the floods that hit the city of Bari in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The flooding event of October 22-23, 2005 can be considered catastrophic as it resulted in six deaths, numerous injuries and substantial damage sustained by road and railway infrastructures at the intersection with the hydrographic network. This study aims to analyse the severity of the event in terms of the response of the landscape with reference to the case of the lama Scappagrano basin, where a Eurostar train derailed due to the collapse of the railway embankment. Coupled hydrological and two hydraulic modelling was performed to reconstruct the flood hydro graph and water depths on the upstream side of the embankment. The results were used to set the boundary conditions to analyse the internal stability of the embankment using a finite element method.

AB  - Bitlis, with its topographic position, of traditional dwellings of the urban image, with monumental buildings from different angles from each other, which provides a rich vista has a wealth of traditional architecture. XX. in the first quarter of the century, when it was a settlement where Armenians and Muslims live together, after the second half of the century because of internal and external migrations it is observed that the social structure of the residents of the city has changed. Migration for economic reasons began after 1960, after 1980, has continued because of terrorism occurring in the region. Bitlis traditional city texture, has had to live because of the migration of users change. The number of traditional houses in Bitlis is too much. maintaining the original city texture have survived the physical context. Experienced users change. It has not been a comprehensive study on traditional housing. these reasons, the traditional housing has led to the need to examine and evaluate the scientific sense of texture. In this study, the idea would be more successful social movement of a physical conservation, Bitlis is aimed to explain the traditional city texture. As a result of investigations in the area of traditional houses in the province of Bitlis prepared plans and facade typologies, social structure analysis was carried out at the survey. As a result, it was determined that what the impact on traditional house architecture of the changes in the social structure. Conservation of traditional city texture house were determined and made suggestions.

T2  - ARTHROPODA SELECTA
LA  - English
KW  - SEX
AB  - To obtain a relevant information on copepod biodiversity/distribution in continental Borneo water bodies in June 2011 about 30 different sites in Malaysian state Sabah were visited and more than 50 alcohol and formalin preserved samples in nine rivers, 10 ponds, and six near-road ditches and canals, rice fields and forest leaf litter environment were collected. In literature 16 copepod species were referred for Borneo and 10 other species for Kalimantan (Indonesean) states. After the Sabah sample analyses, the copepodspecies richnessin the Borneo island increased more than twice. The most abundant with species number genera were ranged as: Mesocyclops (13), Elaphoidella (6), Microcyclops (5), Eucyclops (4), Thermocyclops (4), Halicyclops (3) and Paracyclops (3). Species biodiversity in different sites plotted against type of water body and several environment parameters revealed significant positive correlations for number of species and both for depth and temperature in sampling site (Pearson non-parametric tests 0.6 and 0.5 respectively at p < 0.05). One way Kruscal-Walise dispersal analysis confirmed significant relationship between copepod biodiversity and water transparence/turbidity (p < 0.05). The highest copepod biodiversity values were found in ponds (23 species), near road ditches (15), rivers with transparent water (12), lowland or swamp areas related with rivers (9). The lowest number of species were found in rivers with turbid water colored in orange with soil-erosive matter where the average number of copepod species (0.2 +/- 0.08 species per site) was about 20 times less than in waters without silt particles (3.8 +/- 2.8 species per site). This indicates a strong negative effect of soil erosion resulting water land-used activities and deforestation in the watershed on the biodiversity of aquatic organisms in Borneo. In one sub-urban population of Mesocyclops cf. thermocyclopoides, a trans-sexual mutation of female-sized but constructed as male armed with geniculate antennule organisms was found that possibly reflect a negative result of wide artificial hormone-based pesticide usage in this area. Keys for Harpacticoida species for Borneo and for Eucyclops species known for SEAsia, Australia and India are provided. Within practically each copepod genus studied in Borneo there are forms with problems on species identification by existing faunistic keys. This possibly indicates a necessity of new species description from this area in the nearest future.

This occurred after a period of enrolment decline attributable to range of factors including loss of staff and major structural changes to University courses. The turnaround in numbers has affected two major qualifications at Burnley, The Associate Degree in Urban Horticulture and the Master of Urban Horticulture. We discuss how the increasing enrolments at Burnley can be attributed to developing a clear narrative around what constitutes urban horticulture. The renewal and revitalisation process that has occurred in enrolments continues and we emphasise that much work still needs to be done to keep programs alive. The paper explores the importance of a coherent narrative of "urban horticulture", which is enhanced and made authentic for students when teaching staff actively engage and network with industry to promote and develop new forms of urban horticulture. A case study is provided of how this high level of engagement in the developing area of urban agriculture has been used to generate further research and teaching opportunities. We argue that this networking helps create vocational opportunities for graduates and develops interest and motivation for future student enrolments. This is despite the fact that student expectations of urban agriculture before enrolment can differ from core elements of their training once study commences. Finally, we conclude that engagement and networking helps clarify the potential role of a professionally trained "urban horticulturist" to industry.

AB  - Population structure of pests is an important issue when designing management strategies to optimize control measures. In this study, we investigated a spatial pattern of genetic and phenotypic variation within seven urban and within six rural populations of Culex pipiens from Vojvodina Province (Serbia) incorporating landscape genetic methods (using allozyme data) and wing size and shape (using geometric morphometric approach). Comparing rural samples, no strong genetic groupings of individuals were detected. Nevertheless, traditional approaches where individuals are pre-assigned to populations, including F statistics and AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance), revealed low, but significant genetic differentiation among samples. Similarly, phenotypic data (wing size and shape) indicated some level of heterogeneity among rural samples. Contrary to genetic homogeneity found within rural biotype, the individual-based structuring characterized urban biotype. Geneland revealed the presence of two genetic clusters within urban group which is in concordance with FST and AMOVA results. These results showed that sample from Novi Sad (NS) is a distinct genetic unit, which has been likely resulted in intensive insecticide use over several decades. Furthermore, phenotypic differentiation supported the existence of spatial structuring. Therefore, complementary use of molecular markers and phenotypic traits may be a powerful tool for revealing hidden spatial diversity within Cx. pipiens.

AB  - The study of diet is pivotal in understanding a species, particularly for quantifying a predatory raptors' economic niche and potential for human-wildlife conflict. The crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus) is one of Africa's apex predators and a population is present within the urban greenspace mosaic of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. In close association with urban development, the local population of crowned eagles has the potential to be a concern to the safety of domestic stock and pets. Time-lapse cameras were positioned at urban nest sites (n = 11) to identify the prey composition during breeding, particularly in regards to taxa with human associations. The numerical proportion of avian prey, particularly hadeda ibis (Bostricia hagedash) pulli, was several times greater than any previous diet description. The methodology used and the abundance of hadeda ibis in these urban environments are potential contributing factors. Rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) was the primary prey and where hyrax were unavailable, the diet composition was broader and included more vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). It was found that domestic stock comprised 6 % of the identifiable prey. Contrary to popular belief, no dogs (Canis familiaris) and few cats (Felis domesticus) were delivered to the nest by breeding eagles in this study. The negative consequences of small proportions of pet losses should be considered against the majority of wildlife prey consumed, which also have various wildlife conflict interactions. Juvenile and sub-adult eagles are most frequently identified at in situ attacks of pets, particularly toy dog breeds. Further research on juvenile dispersal and winter diet will provide insights on the ecological impacts of eagle management strategies in the region.

AB  - Jerusalem is a city of extremes, where tourists and pilgrims come to see the sights and pray, but where violence is also a daily affair. In the square kilometer called the Old City, which is part of East Jerusalem and thus considered by the international community as occupied territory, the tensions accumulate as (Jewish) Israeli settlers move into houses in the middle of the Muslim and Christian quarters. In order to secure them, numerous cameras have been installed by the police that show all that happens in the narrow streets of the quarter and private security personnel are stationed on many roofs to watch the area. Furthermore, undercover police officers patrol the streets and at times check IDs of Palestinians. In this article, we focus on policing strategies that Israeli private and public security agents use to control this small and controversial urban space. We argue that the constant presence and movement of police, security personnel, and their surveillance technologies in and through the heart of the Muslim quarter should be analyzed within a colonial context and as a deliberate strategy to control and discipline the local population and to legitimize the larger settler project of the Israeli state. This strategy consists of different performances and thus relationships with policed audiences. First, their (undercover) presence is visible for Palestinians with the effect or intention of intimidating them directly. At the same time they also serve to reassure the Israeli settlers living in the Old City and when in uniform foreign tourists. Both Palestinians and settlers will recognize agents and other security arrangements through experience and internalization of the Israeli security mentality, while tourists see them only when in uniform. However, simultaneously, when undercover, their presence remains largely unseen for this third "audience"; the tourists who are not to be alarmed. By showing their presence to some while remaining invisible to others, security actors and technology "perform" for different audiences, manifesting their power within urban space and legitimizing the Israeli occupation.

AB  - The ecological dynamics of microplastic (<5 mm) are well documented in marine ecosystems, but the sources, abundance, and ecological role of microplastic in rivers are unknown and likely to be substantial. Microplastic fibers (e.g., synthetic fabrics) and pellets (e.g., abrasives in personal care products) are abundant in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and can serve as a point source of microplastic in rivers. The buoyancy, hydrophobic surface, and long transport distance of microplastic make it a novel substrate for the selection and dispersal of unique microbial assemblages. We measured microplastic concentration and bacterial assemblage composition on microplastic and natural surfaces upstream and downstream of WWTP effluent sites at nine rivers in Illinois, United States. Microplastic concentration was higher downstream of WWTP effluent outfall sites in all but two rivers. Pellets, fibers, and fragments were the dominant microplastic types, and polymers were identified as polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene. Mean microplastic flux was 1,338,757 pieces per day, although the flux was highly variable among nine sites (min = 15,520 per day, max = 4,721,709 per day). High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed bacterial assemblage composition was significantly different among microplastic, seston, and water column substrates. Microplastic bacterial assemblages had lower taxon richness, diversity, and evenness than those on other substrates, and microplastic selected for taxa that may degrade plastic polymers (e.g., Pseudomonas) and those representing common human intestinal pathogens (e.g., Arcobacter). Effluent from WWTPs in rivers is an important component of the global plastic "lifecycle," and microplastic serves as a novel substrate that selects and transports distinct bacterial assemblages in urban rivers. Rates of microplastic deposition, consumption by stream biota, and the metabolic capacity of microplastic biofilms in rivers are unknown and merit further research.

AB  - This article demonstrates how the concept of counter-conducts helps us understand Occupy by directing attention to the correlation between the way advanced liberalism works to control urban spaces and the way that control is countered through Occupy's tactics. The first section outlines the term counter-conducts by looking to Foucault's short and undeveloped theorisation. The second examines how advanced liberalism conducts conduct through the use of urban space, concentrating on London which comes to form a space of and for the mobility and circulation of goods, people and ideas. Occupy's tactics directly confront and counter such movement while engaging in its own forms of counter-circulation and (im)mobility. The third section examines how advanced liberal techniques have increasingly come to use a particular, heavily instrumentalised understanding of community in order to divide and control urban populations. Occupy's tactics embody versions of community which confront and oppose such instrumentalisation, ultimately both engaging with that control and partially reproducing it. Through these counter-conducts we can come to a view of Occupy as inevitably succeeding in its failure as a movement and failing in its success, while opening to an (im)possible futurity of occupying urban space differently.

AB  - The article analyses the phenomenon of "nano-demonstrations" occurring in the city of Barnaul, West Siberia. This city entered the repertoire of Russian protest movement in winter 2011-2012. These flash mobs involved toys, which gathered considerable media attention, are examined as manifestations of the mediatisation of civil protests. Which theories can be used to make sense of such mediatised, spectacular forms of protest? And what does each approach contribute to our understanding and explanation of these phenomena? The article shows how nano-demonstrations can be interpreted as a "media-event", a "cultural performance", and a "network", as well as examining the interplay between these approaches. In particular, "toy riots" are conceptualised as imitation media-events; social performances, repeatedly reproduced both in the real urban space and the virtual space of media communications. Nano-demonstrations were able to go viral thanks to global media-networks, especially the Russian online service VKontakte, which was used by "Barnaul civic movement" activists to announce and coordinate protest actions. The toy protest, as well as the movement "For fair elections" on the whole, was a networked event not only in this technological sense, but in terms of its lack of centralisation: protest networks are rhizomatic, just like the virtual space of the Internet. Besides, the toys, which symbolically represented the "dissenters", played the role of Latour's "actants", facilitating the opportunity to register protest and provoking a media response. Being "non-human", they became central to the performance named "nano-demonstration" and initiated actions among many other actants, including the global media. This article pays special attention to interdisciplinary theories that have developed at the intersection of media studies and social movement studies. These approaches analyse civic protests in terms of the communication repertoires employed by the protesters. Contemporary social movement activists have to be "advanced" users of media technology, since the success of their protest actions is connected to how visible they become, both for the authorities and other members of the society. In this case, media is not just a means to construct social issues and include them into the public agenda; it is also about the production of citizenship, communities and collective actions and broadening opportunities for participation in the political process for various social actors. This, the author concludes, is a manifestation of the fundamental process of society mediatisation.

AB  - Mountain Lake's unusual location, near the summit of Salt Pond Mountain, VA, in the non-glaciated portion of the Appalachian Mountains, has prompted geologists to study its origin for decades. The northeastern end of the lake abuts an area of heterogeneous colluvial deposits that contain large rectangular blocks of hard Tuscarora Sandstone. This area is known as "Rock City" because of the resemblance of the gaps between the rock blocks to streets and alleys in a city. The purpose of this study was to investigate the origin of Rock City and whether the colluvial deposits within its boundaries are part of a landslide that is possibly responsible for the formation of Mountain Lake. Mapping of Rock City included taking global positioning satellite readings at the corners of rock blocks and along the boundaries of other outcrops, then using ArcMap software to generate maps. Using stereonet analysis, the mode of rock-block displacement was investigated by comparing the measured orientations of principal discontinuity sets forming the rock-block boundaries with discontinuity orientations of undisturbed outcrops. Discontinuity data analysis indicates that Rock City is most likely a landslide that dammed the valley of Pond Drain, forming the lake. The primary mode of slope movement involves lateral spreading associated with extension occurring along discontinuities. The Tuscarora Sand-stone blocks comprising Rock City were detached from a scarp face along a northwest-southeast-trending joint set and were displaced laterally toward the west. A seis-mic event may have triggered slope movement; however, more extensive analysis must be done to rule out other interpretations.

AB  - Brown haze has been observed over a number of urban centres in different geographical locations around the world. It is a clear indication of degradation in air quality above a city; however, little is known about its underlying causes. This study examines the incidence of brown haze over the subtropical city of Auckland, New Zealand between 2001 and 2011. Using photographs to document the incidence and severity of the haze and a combination of near-surface meteorological observations, reanalysis data and three-dimensional modelling approaches, a detailed climatology of the incidence of haze is developed. The results show that haze is observed during weekday mornings in the cool months, most commonly associated with cold, calm conditions. These conditions are most commonly prevalent with the slow eastward movement of anticyclones (classified as Kidson weather types H and HSE). However, the conditional probability of haze events occurring within these classes is less than 25%, and there is little consistency in the thresholds of surface meteorological conditions between classes. Re-analysis of the mean sea-level pressure at regional to synoptic scales reveals that the strength and stability of the anticyclone is important in determining the occurrence and severity of brown haze events. Brown haze development is associated with a strong NE-SW temperature gradient immediately prior to the event, and anticyclonic development is enhanced by a well-developed wave train across the Southern Ocean. Back trajectory modelling shows these conditions are associated with slow moving air masses and suggest that the source of pollution is most likely to be local in origin. The results demonstrate the importance of a detailed understanding of synoptic and regional scale meteorology in predicting urban scale pollution events, even when the source of the pollution is local.

AB  - Recent work has attempted to deliver optimized distributed energy resource management, including the use of demand side management through smart homes. This aims to reduce power transmission losses, increase the generation share of renewable energy sources and create new markets through peak shaving and flexibility markets. Further, this leverages the development of product models at the device, building, and network level within the operational lifecycle stage, beyond the conventional role of BIM between design and construction stages. However, the management of heterogeneous software entities, incompatible data models and domain perspectives, across systems of systems of significant complexity, represent critical barriers to sustainable urban energy solutions and leads to a highly challenging problem space. The presented work describes a systemic approach based on the concept of holonic systems, which exemplify the role of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence across entities. This reduces the decision complexity of the problem and facilitates the implementation of optimized solutions in real power systems in a scalable and robust manner. Further, the concept of a flexibility market is introduced, whereby smart appliance owners are able to sell load curtailment and deferment to a local aggregator, which interfaces between a small number of homes and a distribution system operator. Artificial intelligence is present at each of the entities in order to express constraints, trade energy and flexibility, and optimize the network management decisions within that entity's scope. Specifically, this paper focuses on enabling interoperability between system entities such as smart homes, local load aggregators, and last mile network operators. This interoperability is achieved through ontological modelling of the domain, based on the existing standards of CIM, OpenADR, and energy@home. The produced ontology utilizes description logic to formalize the concepts, relationships and properties of the domain. A use case is presented of applying the ontology within a multi-agent system, which enables the optimization of day-ahead markets, load balancing, and stochastic renewable generation, and closely aligns with the holonic approach to deliver a holonic multi-agent system. The use case assumes a scenario in line with the emerging energy landscape of a district of domestic prosumers, with a high penetration of micro-generation, energy storage and electric vehicles. Initial results demonstrate interoperability between heterogeneous agents through ontological modelling based on an integration and extension of existing standards, which acts as a proof of concept for the approach.

AB  - Hong Kong has been represented as a politically indifferent, capitalist utopia. This representation was first deployed by British colonial elites and has since been embroidered by Hong Kong's new political masters in Beijing. Yet, on 15 October 2011, anti-capitalist activists identifying with the global Occupy movement assembled in Hong Kong Central and occupied a space under the HSBC bank. Occupy Hong Kong proved to be the longest occupation of all that was initiated by the global Occupy movement. Situated in a space notable for previously having been the haunt of Filipina domestic workers, the occupation conjured a community into the purified spaces of Hong Kong's financial district. I describe this in terms of an eruption of the sacred that placed conventional norms of Hong Kong city life under erasure, releasing powerful emotions into spaces once thought to be immune to the ritual effervescences of the transgressive.

AB  - This article aims to present the process of enforcement of accessibility towards vulnerable populations by deficiency: what policy and what reality in the public space? How communities at all levels can work and implement a territorial accessibility strategy in their areas of competence : what human means which organization which strategy ?
   To invest the subject and feed this proposed article, several scientists entries were favored. The social approach to accessibility by the report of the benefits of access to information, data and services for everyday life, accessibility as a vector of social cohesion and citizenship; and finally the structural accessibility, technical dimension that determines the built in its architectural design. Indeed, the mention of the concept of accessibility, in the sense of architectural and environmental quality condition the universal use of the living areas of society and composes of public space. Spatial form and social fact, public structure territories society space, specifically those of an urban society that continues to grow. Specifically the public space is a social environment is polymorphic identities; an area of mobility and movement for the meeting and the rally. Individuals must cope with complex social situations [Joseph, I., 1990]. Thus, public space can be glimpsed through a double dimension. On the one hand a social dimension into an integral component of social existence [Madanipour, A., 2003]. On the other hand, a material dimension, including streets, squares, parks, and the public places are the main constituents. These are the links that run through the territories of the city and the urban. Beyond this thematic diversity, public space must create the conditions for optimum accessibility for the public opening, the co-presence and therefore its universality. Public space and accessibility of complementarity play where everyone has an inherent right to the other role.
   However, investigation of these subject areas is particularly complex for territorial managers. The methods of design and management demonstrate a competence network, from national bodies [policy] and other more local [communities], which complicates the action by the policy and the environment for people who practice it. Therefore, our research focuses on a conceptual input, methodological and technical for better reading spaces and a decision support managers. Here we address the accessibility of original and innovative way, where public policy and governance are our core issues. So this article attempts to define our conceptual basis for analyzing the accessibility of public space. The methodology and the tools used are specified later. Finally, we illustrate our discussion with the presentation of expected a current research program in partnership with the General Council of Val de Marne [94] results.

AB  - Conflicts with dingoes and other wild dogs are becoming increasingly common in and around urban areas of Australia. A lack of basic information about wild dog movement ecology hampers efficient planning and allocation of resources to mitigate human-wild dog conflicts. We captured, collared and released 37 wild dogs in urban areas of north-eastern Australia to investigate their movement ecology. In general, wild dogs occupied small fragments of bushland within an urban matrix, were active at all times of the day, and lived within a few hundred meters of houses and humans at all times. We conclude that wild dog management strategies in urban areas should focus on the mitigation of impacts at the individual or group level, and not population-level reductions in numbers.
   Top-predators around the world are becoming increasingly intertwined with humans, sometimes causing conflict and increasing safety risks in urban areas. In Australia, dingoes and dingo x domestic dog hybrids are common in many urban areas, and pose a variety of human health and safety risks. However, data on urban dingo ecology is scant. We GPS-collared 37 dingoes in north-eastern Australia and continuously monitored them each 30 min for 11-394 days. Most dingoes were nocturnal, with an overall mean home range size of 17.47 km(2). Overall mean daily distance travelled was 6.86 km/day. At all times dingoes were within 1000 m of houses and buildings. Home ranges appeared to be constrained to patches of suitable vegetation fragments within and around human habitation. These data can be used to reallocate dingo management effort towards mitigating actual conflicts between humans and dingoes in urban areas.

AB  - The resurgence of vector-borne diseases is an increasing public health concern, and there is a need for a better understanding of their dynamics. For a number of diseases, e.g. dengue and chikungunya, this resurgence occurs mostly in urban environments, which are naturally very heterogeneous, particularly due to population circulation. In this scenario, there is an increasing interest in both multi patch and multi-group models for such diseases. In this work, we study the dynamics of a vector borne disease within a class of multi-group models that extends the classical Bailey-Dietz model. This class includes many of the proposed models in the literature, and it can accommodate various functional forms of the infection force. For such models, the vector-host/host-vector contact network topology gives rise to a bipartite graph which has different properties from the ones usually found in directly transmitted diseases. Under the assumption that the contact network is strongly connected, we can define the basic reproductive number R-0 and show that this system has only two equilibria: the so called disease free equilibrium (DFE); and a unique interior equilibrium usually termed the endemic equilibrium (EE)-that exists if, and only if, R-0 > 1. We also show that, if R-0 <= 1, then the DFE equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while when R-0 > 1, we have that the BE is globally asymptotically stable. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper offers one explanation for the institutional basis of food insecurity in Australia, and argues that while alternative food networks and the food sovereignty movement perform a valuable function in building forms of social solidarity between urban consumers and rural producers, they currently make only a minor contribution to Australia's food and nutrition security. The paper begins by identifying two key drivers of food security: household incomes (on the demand side) and nutrition-sensitive, 'fair food' agriculture (on the supply side). We focus on this second driver and argue that healthy populations require an agricultural sector that delivers dietary diversity via a fair and sustainable food system. In order to understand why nutrition-sensitive, fair food agriculture is not flourishing in Australia we introduce the development economics theory of urban bias. According to this theory, governments support capital intensive rather than labour intensive agriculture in order to deliver cheap food alongside the transfer of public revenues gained from rural agriculture to urban infrastructure, where the majority of the voting public resides. We chart the unfolding of the Urban Bias across the twentieth century and its consolidation through neo-liberal orthodoxy, and argue that agricultural policies do little to sustain, let alone revitalize, rural and regional Australia. We conclude that by observing food system dynamics through a re-spatialized lens, Urban Bias Theory is valuable in highlighting rural-urban socio-economic and political economy tensions, particularly regarding food system sustainability. It also sheds light on the cultural economy tensions for alternative food networks as they move beyond niche markets to simultaneously support urban food security and sustainable rural livelihoods.

AB  - Scholars have been taking the impact of weather on social movements for granted for some time, despite a lack of supporting empirical evidence. This paper takes the topic more seriously, analyzing more than 7000 social movement events and 36 years of weather records in Washington, D.C., and New York City (1960-95). Here, good weather is defined as midrange temperature and little to no precipitation. This paper uses negative binomial regression models to predict the number of social movements per day and finds social movements are more likely to happen on good days than bad, with seasonal patterns controlled for. Results from logistic regression models indicate violence occurs more frequently at social movement events when it is warmer. Most interestingly, the effect of weather is more salient when there are more political opportunities and resources available. This paper discusses the implications and suggests future research on weather and social movement studies.

AB  - Invasive species are capable of causing change in native plant communities, but invasion is often associated with other anthropogenic impacts on natural areas, such as habitat fragmentation and associated dispersal limitation for native species. Consequently, invasive species removal alone may not always be sufficient to meet restoration objectives. We tested if invasion and dispersal limitation interact to limit plant community restoration within a forest fragment invaded by Euonymus fortunei. Removal of Euonymus alone did not lead to the recolonization of native plant species. However, planting seedlings increased total native cover in invaded, Euonymus removal, and uninvaded control treatments. The consistent establishment of native plant seedlings across all treatments indicates that Euonymus invasion may have limited ability to displace established plants. In contrast, plant species that we added as seed were unable to establish in invaded plots, indicating that Euonymus invasion limits recruitment of native plant species from seed. Over the course of our experiment, a number of setbacks and surprises occurred, including high levels of herbivory, a windstorm, and extreme drought, all of which likely limited restoration success. Overall, our results indicate that Euonymus may contribute to native species declines, but other factors are important. Thus, invasive species removal alone may not be sufficient to reestablish a diverse native plant community. Instead, impacts on natural areas may need to be mitigated along with invasive species removal for restoration to be successful.

AB  - The Transition Movement is a translocal phenomenon circulated through transnational grassroots networks. This study explores the geographies of the Transition Movement with a theoretical framework that perceives it as both a social movement and a grassroots innovation. Participant-observation of Transition Salt Lake (TSL), located in the suburban metropolis of Salt Lake City, Utah, was conducted, as the United States remains a largely understudied country in regards to this particular movement. In this pursuit, we asked: (i) how and what this transition initiative draws from geographically extensive and intensive relations, (ii) how it combines place-specific elements and generalized models (embeddedness), and (iii) how this impacts the success of the transition initiative and how these impacts (positive or negative) are generated. Place, space, and scale played a large role in defining the nature, dynamics, possibilities, and constraints of this transition initiative. Specifically, geographically intensive and extensive relations were critical for the mobilization of complementary resources. The Transition model was found to be flexible, allowing for the initiative to adopt those elements that worked in place and to focus on locally relevant topics. TSL faced many challenges identified by previous researchers regarding finances, participation, diversity, and intragroup competition. While networking with other similar groups, TSL demonstrated that fertile environments of activism are incubatory pools for grassroots innovations and social movements, and a trade-off was found with competition for resources between local groups.

Scholarship on refugee and immigrant protests has focused on demonstrations and every day acts of resistance in refugee camps or accommodation. However, there has been less focus on the ways in which refugees engage in spatial politics. This article focuses on urban resistance in Berlin where refugee activists in alliance with supporters occupied several spaces and transformed them to political sites.

AB  - In this study, 269 Beijing born respondents were interviewed and asked questions about their language attitude and language behavior. Research categories, apart from 'attitude', were 'accent maintenance', 'accent selection', and 'code-switching', whereas the variables employed were 'gender', 'age group', 'origin' of parents, 'district' grown-up, 'spouse' background, 'education' level, 'job profile', and 'network density'. We found that Beijing dialect in Beijing's central city districts, coexists with the national language Putonghua, or, Standard Chinese, has high language status among native young people in Beijing and a wide range of uses. The main factors which effect respondents' language behavior are 'network density', 'place-of-origin', and 'occupation'. We also determined a high level of confusion between Beijing dialect accent and Putonghua accent, which we related to the mode of Putonghua teaching and Putonghua promotion. We conclude that Beijing dialect and Putonghua will form two functional varieties, playing different roles in different language environments.

AB  - It has been over 20 years since Judith Innes proclaimed communicative action to be the "emerging paradigm" for planning theory, a theoretical perspective which has been developed into what is known as collaborative planning theory (CPT). With planning theory shifting to a new generation of scholars, this commentary considers the fate of this intellectual movement within planning. CPT never achieved the paradigmatic status its advocates desired because of its internal diversity and limited scope. However, its useful combination of analytical and normative insights is attracting the interest of a new generation of researchers, who are subjecting it to rigorous empirical testing and addressing longstanding theoretical weaknesses. Like Jane Jacob's classic book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, CPT has made an enduring impact on planning theory, even as it has failed to achieve a total revolution in thinking.

AB  - This article presents the findings of a multidisciplinary study regarding socio-spatial changes in the Porto Alegre Metropolitan Area (PAMA) that is part of the project entitled The Metropolis Observatory: territory, social cohesion and democratic governance, developed by a network of researchers in Brazil's main metropolises. The article provides a brief overview of the metropolization process in Brazil as a contemporary urban phenomenon and then goes on to briefly outline the history of the formation of the PAMA and its place in the urbanization and metropolization process in Brazil over the last three decades, highlighting the effects of the different economic models adopted by the country's government during the period, and market globalization and liberalization. Finally, it discusses socioeconomic and socio-spatial changes over the last three decades, using a specific methodology to construct a socio-spatial typology that reflects the role played by socio-occupational categories in the metropolitan and intrametropolitan landscape.

AB  - Eugenia dysenterica DC. (Myrtaceae) is a perennial tree producing edible fruits and ornamental flowers of potential value widely distributed in Brazilian "Cerrados" (savannas), but available genetic resources and potential for future breeding programs must be evaluated. Here we evaluated the reproductive system and pollen-mediated gene flow in one generation of Eugenia dysenterica germplasm collection of Agronomy School, Federal University of Goias (in GoiA cent nia city, Central Brazil). We collected leaves from all adults from the germplasm collection (682 plants) and seeds (542) from 23 mother-trees. Genotypes were obtained for seven microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was high and did not significantly differ between adults (H (e) = 0.777) and progeny arrays (H (e) = 0.617). Our results showed that E. dysenterica has an allogamous mating system in the germplasm collection (t (m) = 0.957), but with high and significant biparental inbreeding (t (m) - t (s) = 0.109). Because sibs are very close to each other, mating between closely related individuals is likely. Paternity correlation was also relatively high, indicating a 11.9 % probability that a randomly chosen pair of outcrossed progeny from the same array are full sibs. The maximum pollen dispersal distance (224 m), estimated using assignment test, corresponded to the boundaries of the orchard. We were able to assign the paternity to only 64 % of the 349 seeds analyzed, indicating potential pollen immigration to the germplasm collection. The variance effective population size estimated for one maternal family in the germplasm collection (N (ev) = 3.42) is very close to the theoretical maximum value for half-sibs (Nev = 4.0). Because E. dysenterica has a long life cycle and generation time, the maintenance of an effective population size of at least 100 in the germplasm collection is suggested, which can be achieved by maintaining a seed-trees number around 30 individuals.

AB  - The paper describes a simple, abstract model to simulate gentrification from both supply and demand side perspectives. Three theories rent gap theory, filtering theory and household life cycle theory are employed to construct a combined cellular automaton and agent-based model. This abstract model has good potential for simulating urban development. It exhibits a distinctive relationship between the spatial dynamics of gentrification patterns and different rent gap thresholds and rent gap impacts: at low rent gap thresholds and limited rent gap impact, renovation events occur at all locations leading to a mixed rent map distribution. As the rent gap threshold and rent gap impact increase, gentrification becomes more spatially concentrated, leading to spatially segregated rent patterns. Also, gentrification starts in run-down areas neighboring wealthier regions in agreement with empirically observed gentrification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article revolves around the role of the urban poor or the "informal proletariat" in popular political protests in West Africa. It critically surveys instructive accounts of their participation in the 1990s movement for democracy in Lagos, youth politics in Dakar, and a recent insightful analysis of popular uprisings in various parts of the continent in the 2000s. Various aspirations for change anchor these accounts. Against this backdrop, I turn to everyday life and politics in zones of urban informality and juxtapose it to a discussion of the acclaimed Nigerian artist Jelili Atiku's street performance towards the end of the Occupy Nigeria movement as a generative figure of protest. The scripts in which we read dispositions of the informal proletariat, their protest actions, relationship to state and power, and hopes for the coming community are central here. At stake I believe is our own ability to grasp agentive democratic possibilities for the future, which the protests and Atiku's performance illuminate.

AB  - The complex structure of the urban traffic link tunnel (UTLT) exacerbates fire accident risk and increases the difficulty of smoke control, especially for a UTLT with looped tunnel systems. The applicability of the traditional tunnel smoke control methods, e.g., transverse ventilation and longitudinal ventilation, needs further investigation for UTLTs. Experiments were conducted in a small-scale model to investigate the effectiveness of both two ventilation modes for a looped UTLT. In a longitudinally ventilated UTLT, the critical velocities, as the minimal air velocities for preventing smoke infiltrating into the regions upstream of the fire and entering the downstream tunnel branches that are adjacent to the smoke discharge route, should be guaranteed. Multiple operational modes of longitudinal ventilation could be feasible for achieving the desired performance of smoke control. For transverse ventilation, both the effects of the exhaust flow rate and the air supply rate are investigated. To confine the smoke in the tunnel branch where fire occurs, an effective exhaust flow rate could be twice the smoke production rate. Forced air supply could be unnecessary for a UTLT due to the abundance of natural air supply routes. Longitudinal ventilation leads to lower smoke flow temperatures than transverse ventilation does in UTLTs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of developing spatial analysis of user movement pattern analysis and socialization is to ensure socializing comfort at the user environment. User Movement patterns and socialization need to be estimated in order to avoid any disturbance in obtaining user comfort during in its environment. Research on this spatial analysis was held on public facilities in Surabaya and Malang City. In the analysis on various public facilities was concluded that comfort sense was influenced by facilities and infrastructure, spacious place to socialize, view and direction in order to control the circulation flow and the ability to accept a variety of activities that are likely arise. Results of this research showed that the type of movement and socialization can be known through the Environment Socialization Values Analysis (ESVA). The value results of the ESVA are determined from the average number of socialization types that occurs and the average of user member number. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using longitudinal data on the universe of workers in Denmark during the period 1991-2008, we track the labor market outcomes of low-skilled natives in response to an exogenous inflow of low-skilled immigrants. We innovate on previous identification strategies by considering immigrants distributed across municipalities by a refugee dispersal policy in place between 1986 and 1998. We find that an increase in the supply of refugee-country immigrants pushed less educated native workers (especially the young and low-tenured ones) to pursue less manual-intensive occupations. As a result immigration had positive effects on native unskilled wages, employment, and occupational mobility.

AB  - As voluntary affirmative action in the United States has been transformed into diversity management, the original intended beneficiaries of affirmative action - racial/ethnic minority group members and women, and particularly black Americans - have been left behind.
   Despite controversy over the use of racial quotas in the United States, demands for voluntary affirmative action by private employers grew into a nationwide movement in the 1960s under the leadership of Rev. Dr Martin Luther King, Jr and Rev Jesse Jackson. In cities across the United States with large black populations, they demanded the use of proportional hiring so that companies selling their products to black consumers would hire black employees in proportion to the local black population or their black clientele. In the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the US Congress considered the affirmative action/proportional representation/quota issue and reached a compromise; employers would not be required to give preferences to black applicants, but neither would they be prohibited from voluntarily doing so. In the 1970s and 1980s the US Supreme Court upheld the compromise, holding that private employers could give hiring and promotion preferences to underrepresented ethnic/racial minority workers (and women) to correct ` imbalances' in the workplace, subject to certain limitations. Yet beginning with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, and accelerating into the 21st century, US employers have abandoned affirmative action policies in favour of ` diversity management' policies. While these policies initially focused on the hiring and promotion of women and racial/ethnic minorities, as diversity policies have grown and developed, they have abandoned their focus on aiding underrepresented workers. As a result, black Americans are being left behind, even as the policies adopted through their advocacy have become widely accepted.

Daylight varies widely due to the movement of sun, changing seasons and diverse weather conditions. Custom static daylight assessments, simulations represent only one time of the year or one time of the day, are inadequate to evaluate the dynamics of daylight variability. Using the intuitive graphic tool Temporal Map to display the annual daylight data, this study compared different passive architectural design strategies under the climate conditions of five representative Chinese cities and selected the most suitable design scheme for each city. In this study, the dynamic yearly-graphic tool was utilized for architectural design in China, and we integrated the optimal design with the Chinese academic calendar to achieve improvements within the occupancy time. This modified map connects design work with human activity that makes daylight evaluation more accurate and efficient. The results of this study will provide preliminary recommendations for energy-saving design in China, and reference to other similar studies.

AB  - While personality-dependent dispersal is well studied, local space use has received surprisingly little attention in this context, despite the multiple consequences on survival and fitness. Regarding the coping style of individuals, recent studies on personality-dependent space use within a habitat indicate that 'proactive' individuals are wider ranging than 'reactive' ones. However, such studies are still scarce and cover limited taxonomic diversity, and thus, more research is needed to explore whether this pattern generalises across species. We examined the link between coping style and space use in a population of crows (Corvus corone) freely inhabiting the urban zoo of Vienna, Austria. We used a binary docility rating (struggle during handling vs. no struggle) and a tonic immobility test to quantify individual coping style. Individual space use was quantified as the number of different sites at which each crow was observed, and we controlled for different number of sightings per individual by creating a space use index. Only the binary docility rating showed repeatability over time, and significantly predicted space use. In contrast to previous studies, we found that reactive crows (no struggle during handling) showed wider ranging space use within the study site than proactive individuals (who struggled during handling). The discrepancy from previous results suggests that the relationship between behavioural type and space use may vary between species, potentially reflecting differences in socioecology.

AB  - To date, less care has been taken to quantitatively visualize the intellectual evolution of transport geography research than to qualitatively review this field. Based on big-data literature from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science as well as scientometric mapping analysis, this important research topic is analyzed by techniques from informetric domains to detect its developmental landscape. After data reduction and clean-up, 4840 articles published from 1982 to 2014 are identified on which two network analyses are conducted: a bibliometric approach (i.e. co-occurrence and co-citation network) and a complex network approach utilizing C. Chen's CiteSpaceII, O. Persson's BibExcel and ESRI's ArcGIS. Results illustrate the following: (1) periods including the rise (1960-1970s), to a stagnation period (1980-1990s), to a boom (since 1990); (2) that the change of research frontiers and hot issues is either social oriented or topic oriented; (3) that its development owes a good deal to cooperative subnetworks (schools) of six academic communities-Urban Planning, Marxist Geography, Mobility Turn, New Economic Geography, Port Geography, and Time Geography; and (4) that its research methods tend to be diversified and integrated, while its research perspective is inclined to be microcosmic and oriented to social hot issues. Finally, 23 documents are identified as playing the pivotal role in its knowledge evolution as an intellectual base.

AB  - Objective: This report examines mental health recovery in a population neglected in the literature -formerly homeless adults with serious mental illness and co-occurring substance abuse. The term 'complex recovery' is used to examine the onset and impact of various types of adversity over the life course.
   Method: Burawoy's extended case method was conducted on in-depth interviews with 74 formerly homeless adults living in housing programs in New York City. Data included verbatim transcripts, interviewer feedback forms, and case summaries.
   Results: Seven themes emerged: the longstanding influence of poverty, childhood hardship, social support and network depletion, substance abuse and recovery, unequal impact of gender differences, experiences of incarceration and fragmented service system. Structural as well as individual factors were found to comprise complex recovery.
   Conclusions: Complex recovery, which situates mental health recovery amidst homelessness and other forms of adversity, has implications for policies and practices designed to assist this vulnerable population.

AB  - We advance social movement and diffusion theories by exploring the role of online activities in the spread of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The results from event history analyses suggest that, after controlling for community characteristics, online activities on Facebook and Twitter are associated with the spread of protests. The association is stronger for Facebook than other Internet-enabled technologies. The importance of Facebook activities increases over time, but the importance of community characteristics such as population size decreases over time. While intermunicipal contagion does not affect the diffusion process directly, it affects the diffusion in combination with online activities: the effect of spatial proximity to prior sites of contention increases in cities where Facebook activities preexist. The results provide a better understanding of how the Internet and social media activity create new communication channels among potential sites of contention and facilitate the rapid diffusion of contentious collective actions across wide areas.

AB  - The Taihape landslide is a large, deep-seated, translational rockslide in central North Island of New Zealand, one of over 7000 large landslides mapped in the late Neogene deposits of this area. This study examined its patterns of movement using high temporal resolution, high-precision monitoring and explored the relationships between the movement and triggering mechanisms. During the 30-year monitoring period, movement was always extremely slow, but included periods of faster and slower motion due to a combination of simultaneous basal sliding, internal plastic deformation and seasonal soil shrinkage and swelling. The data suggested that movement rate was not controlled by pore-water pressure or any other monitored parameter. Intervals of more rapid movement appear to follow toe erosion that debuttress the landslide mass, an example of which occurred following a flood in February 2004 that had a return period of about 100 years.
   The high-temporal and spatial frequency of the monitoring and the measurement precision of the instruments have allowed new insights into the complex movement patterns of deep-seated, slow moving rockslides. The patterns of movement observed here, and the techniques described to collect and analyse the data, are applicable to many slowly moving landslides in New Zealand, and to those occurring in similar environments worldwide.

AB  - Plant invasions substantially impact the ecosystem services provided by forests in urbanizing regions. Knowing where invasion risk is greatest helps target early detection and eradication efforts, but developing an accurate predictive model of invasive species presence and spread on the basis of habitat suitability remains a challenge due to spatial variation in propagule pressure (the number of individuals released) which is likely conflated with suitability. In addition to neighborhood propagule pressure that originates with propagules dispersing from naturalized populations within invaded habitats, we expect residential propagule pressure arising from the widespread use of exotic plants in the yards of single-family residences to be an important driver of invasions, and to notably improve the predictive accuracy of species distribution models (SDMs). To this end, we collected presence/absence data for a widespread forest invader, Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet), from 400 stratified random plots located along an urban gradient across the Charlotte, North Carolina metropolitan area. We assessed the relative contribution of residential propagule pressure and neighborhood propagule pressure to improving the predictive performance of a probit SDM for Chinese privet that only contains environmental predictors. Our results indicate that, although the environment-only model predicted the highest geographic area to be at risk of invasion by privet, it also had the highest rate of failure to accurately predict observed privet occurrences as indicated by the omission (incorrectly predicted absence) and commission (incorrectly predicted presence) error rates. Accounting for residential propagule pressure substantially improved model performance by reducing the omission error by nearly 50%, thereby improving upon the ability of the model to predict privet invasion in suboptimal habitat. Given that this increase in detection was accompanied by a decrease in the geographic area predicted at risk, we conclude that SDMs for invasive exotic shrubs and potentially for other synanthropic generalist plants may be highly inefficient when residential propagule pressure is not accounted for. Accounting for residential propagule pressure in models of invasive plants results in a more focused and accurate prediction of the area at risk, thus enabling decision makers to feasibly prioritize regional scale monitoring and control efforts.

AB  - Introduction
   Since the late 1990s and particularly at the start of the 21st century, considerable research has highlighted the consequences of multiple urban developments in different areas following patterns of low residential density in Europe. A report drafted by the European Environment Agency in 2009 forecast that between 1995 and 2025 the urbanised land area would increase from 55% to 73% of total land area in Europe. This urban-residential expansion has often been located along coastal areas, for example in Ireland, Portugal and above all in the Spanish Mediterranean. In the Spanish Mediterranean alone, in the period 1992-2000, over one million two hundred thousand new dwellings were built, increasing by close to five million more between 2001 and 2011, representing an increase of 25% in housing numbers. In the case of the province of Alicante (Spain), this territory between 1997 and 2008, ranked third in Spain in housing units built (345,410), after Madrid and Barcelona and ahead of provinces with larger populations such as Valencia or Malaga.
   This residential expansion has been accompanied by a change in the urban model. From a concentrated, it has moved towards low-density models (detached houses with a swimming pool and garden) and medium-density models (semi-detached houses) and, to a much lesser degree, to high-rise buildings (blocks of apartments). These later two types of urbanization are integrated into private developments with gardens and swimming pools. The diverse evolution of the urban-residential land area between different regions will have repercussions on various aspects of the territory, such as consumption and demand for water because greater or lesser demand will be generated depending on the urbanization model.
   Methodology and Objectives
   The demand for water in urban spaces depends on a combination of different factors and components: population served (permanent and seasonal); city model (disperse or concentrated); number and types of households served (in blocks, detached, etc.); number of industries and activities developed; number of commercial premises; municipal consumption (gardens, street cleaning, schools and other public buildings, etc.). Besides, other decisive factors are the dynamism of the economy, pricing policies and, above all, the measures for managing and saving water in consumption habits. The aim of this paper is know which causes had been influenced this decrease. This decline is generalized in the rest of Spain and other development countries. We have conducted several interviews with the directors and technicians of the supply water companies. In this sense, it has been revealed that there are several causes that have affected a continuous decrease of water consumption. Four interviews were conducted at the headquarters of the company Hidraqua, Integrated Management of Aguas de Levante SA (Former Aquagest Levante), as this is the company that has facilities and transparency in providing concrete data and interviews. It should also be noted that this company is one of the most implementation is in the localities of the study area. This has yielded the expected results on the objectives and initial hypothesis and to know what the possible causes are and how they have affected the aggregate of falling consumption or urban and tourist water.
   Results
   According to the last dates in the inquest about suply and sanitation water in Spain, the average consumption in the Spanish dwellings in 2011 was 142 litres/inhabitant/day, 1.4% less than 2010. In the Valencian Community, where is localized the province of Alicante, in 2011 water consumption was 155 litres/inhabitant/day, the 3.2% less than the year before. In compare with other Spanish cities, for example, in the same year, water consumption was 133 litres/inhabitant/day in Madrid, 119 in Valencia or 116 in Barcelona. In the case of Alicante, water consumtpion per inhabitant and day is 119 litres in 2013. Noteworthy that there has been a decline of 22% since 2000. In this year water consumption per inhabitant and day was 150 litres. This reduction is similar in others cities in the Spanish Mediterranen. In this sense, in the towns on the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, there has been a decrease of 25% in fifteen years. If we compare others cities around the world, we can see that this consumption is higher than the Spanish towns. For example, in Jerusalem the average water consumption per inhabitant and day is 650 litres, in Sidney 206 litres, in Oslo 197 litres or London 154 litres. It is important to highlight the domestic water consumption decrease in other parts of the world. In California (USA) in 2014 water suppliers reported that consumption fell 11.5 percent in August compared with the year before. That was the first full month of mandatory restrictions and fines for water-wasters imposed by the State Water Resources Control Board in July. In this sense, Santa Cruz residents conserved far more than the state average as Santa Cruzans cut water use by 28 percent. Besides, the Governor of the State called on Californians to reduce water use by 20 percent when he declared a drought emergency in January. Californians could face further restrictions if the drought worsens and the coming winter fails to produce adequate snow and rainfall.
   The general dynamic of domestic water consumption decrease since the end of the nineties could be related to structural and conjunctural factors. This is due to a combination of interrelated causes, the following stand out as being the most significant determinants. One of these causes is the installation and generalization of water saving devices. For example, in plumbing systems and electrical appliances, great improvements in water consumption have been achieved. Savings of 40-60% compared with conventional models have been made. Aerators and diffusers to reduce water consumption by 40% and the installation of WC cisterns with dual flush systems also constitute a saving of up to 50%. On top of this we can also add the gradual and permanent development of consumption habits aimed at saving water that have been growing in popularity since the middle of the last decade, and which have intensified even more as a result of the economic crisis from 2007 onwards.
   Conclusions
   A good understanding of factors that influence domestic water consumption is essential for developing and implementing appropriate policies with regard to this resource. Among these factors, prices and taxes have received considerable attention in the past, whereas demographic and cultural variables remain less explored. Economics has traditionally dominated the scientific literature on domestic water consumption. From the economic perspective, water is generally considered to be an inelastic good since it can hardly be substituted, and users do not tend to perceive this resource as being too costly. Another factor is the improvement of the water supply network and the installation of saving devices. Others factors are the environmental awareness campaigns, use of the reused water for watering gardens and finally, the effect of the economic crisis and climatic conditions. In this sense, a currently example occurred in California where their inhabitants will have to reduce by 25% the consumption of water, under threat of heavy fines, to an extent unprecedented emergency with the drought in that state for four years.
   Perhaps the most important lesson to be learnt from the case of the Alicante coastline is the impact of the different urban residential typologies on water consumption generated by outdoor residential uses. The expansion of the residential and tourist population, incentivized for decades by different administrations, has brought about strong competition with other economic (agriculture) and environmental (wetland) functions for the use of land and water. In low-density developments, i.e., single homes with a single-family garden and swimming pool, the water consumption associated with outdoor areas is quite high, mainly due to the exclusive nature of their use by their owners. Urban typology consisting of condominiums and apartment blocks would therefore make for a more responsible and sustainable use of water resources associated with leisure. This is one finding that should be taken into account in the future planning of residential areas. In this sense, it is important to study and analyse the increase of urban sprawl on the coast of Alicante due to its impacts on water consumption. For this reason, in this dry region, urban typologies are a main element to account for when planning water resources in future scenarios.

TI  - Blurring Public and Private: The Pragmatic Desegregation Politics of an Elite Private School in Atlanta
T2  - HISTORY OF EDUCATION QUARTERLY
LA  - English
KW  - BROWN
KW  - TEACHERS
AB  - The school desegregation narrative often references historically white public schools as sites of massive resistance and historically white private schools as segregationist academies. Yet some historically white elite private schools or independent schools, such as The Westminster Schools (plural in name only), established in 1951 in Atlanta, Georgia, chose to desegregate. Such elite institutions, which have served as one catalyst for the creation and maintenance of social and cultural capital, became more accessible after Brown v. Board of Education through a combination of private and public decisions galvanized by larger social, political, and federal forces. Westminster's 1965 decision to consider all applicants regardless of race was emblematic of the pragmatic desegregation politics of Atlanta's city leaders during the civil rights movement and a national independent school agenda focused on recruiting black students. Drawing on institutional, local, regional, and national archival records and publications, this article examines the import of schools like Westminster to civic and business leaders, to the politics of race and desegregation occurring in large cities, and to the range of educational opportunities available in metropolitan areas. This examination yields an analysis of the leadership and politics of a southern historically white elite private school that black students desegregated in 1967.

AB  - Since its discovery in 2008, the pestiferous Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), has become widely established in residential citrus trees throughout southern California. In 2011, Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a host-specific parasitoid of D. citri, sourced from Punjab Pakistan, was introduced into California as part of a classical biological program aimed at suppressing D. citri populations in urban areas. Despite these release efforts, little is known about the population dynamics of D. citri in urban citrus or the efficacy of T. radiata in controlling psyllid populations in urban-grown citrus. To address this shortcoming, the population phenology of D. citri was monitored biweekly for 2-3 yr on five different host plants (Rutaceae) at 11 residential sites across Riverside and Los Angeles Counties in southern California. Citrus flush growth patterns and parasitoid activity levels were also assessed. Urban D. citri populations were present year round at each site, with highest densities occurring over July through November. Temperature was an important indicator of overall D. citri densities with positive correlations across all life stages. Regularly flushing lime trees consistently supported the highest densities of psyllid eggs and nymphs, while equally vigorous flushing curry leaf plants supported the highest adult densities. While T. radiata activity was detected at all sites, average year-round percent parasitism was low throughout the study, averaging < 5% in 2012, 2013, and 2014.

AB  - The article contains the results of observations on the formation, existence and the dissociation of the collective winter roost of corvids (crow species) in 2014-2015 in Melitopol (Zaporozhye region). A detailed study of the concentration and the dynamics of its functioning during the winter period was carried out. By the method of absolute counting of birds, the estimation of the gathering process on the roost in the night and dispersal from roost in the morning was carried out twice a week (a total of 47 days of observation in the morning and evening). We selected the following essential parameters: time of the beginning and ending of the process of dispersal from the roost in the morning and gathering at the roost in the evening; time - study of birds' flight activity in these intervals; the number and species composition of birds; directions of flights with their mapping; weather conditions. Within the city of Melitopol during the winter period of 2014-2015, corvids (Rook, Western Jackdaw, Eurasian Magpie and Common Raven) form one central roost. The total number of birds at the roost was typically 18 thousand individuals. The collective roost exists from the beginning of October till the end of March. The analysis of dynamics of the birds' number during the existence of the collective showed a wide amplitude of fluctuation in the range of 1,000-5,000 individuals during autumn (10 times) and spring (5 times) migration. By the end of November migration ends, the number of birds has stabilized, and the location of the night roost becomes permanent. In winter the gathering is more stable and fluctuations in number lie within the limits of 500 individuals (8 times). The number of birds that roost collectively decreased from mid - March. In this article considerable attention is paid to processes of the birds' dispersal from the roost site and gathering at the roost at night. The observations showed a high degree of dependence on day length and different intensity of these types of daily activity. During the analysis of the process of morning dispersal of birds from the collective roost, seasonal differences in the time of dispersal were found. In the winter months this period was significantly shorter than in the autumn and spring. The duration of dispersal of birds from the roost (28.4 +/- 9 min; lim - 15-45 min) was reliably less than that of gathering at the roost (87.9 +/- 14.8 min; lim - 30-115 min); the difference of averages is significant for the highest probability threshold of p >= 0.001 for the entire observation period. As a result of research on dispersal and gathering of birds at the roost site, the basic strategies of the birds' behaviour were revealled. For morning dispersal of birds from the territory of the roost the strategy of "gathering with a pause" (16 registrations; 35.6%) is dominant. The strategy of "the damped wave" is sub dominant (14; 31.1%). The lowest percentage was taken up by the strategy of "three peaks" (1; 2.2%). For the evening gathering of birds at the roost, the strategy of "two peaks" is dominant. The lowest percentage was taken up by the strategy of "gathering with a pause" (2; 4.5%). The overall species diversity within a gathering and on the routes of birds' flights reached 24 species. The undisputed dominant in numbers was the Rook, and the subdominan was the Jackdaw. Thus, corvids form the basis of the ornithological complex of the forest - park zone of Melitopol in the autumn and spring period.

AB  - Two Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (silver carp) were collected in the Pearl River on 6 September 2012 during a natural fish kill in the decommissioned lock chamber of Lock-and-Dam No. 1 located at river kilometer (RKM) 47.5 in St. Tammany Parish, 9.4 km NW of the city of Pearl River, LA. Fish were a male 987 mm TL, 10.9 kg, and a female 1042 mm TL, 12.2 kg. Both fish were age 5. Eight additional silver carp (930-1054 mm TL, 9.1-14.1 kg) and one bighead carp (H. nobilis) (1065 mm TL, 15.9 kg) were collected in the West Middle Pearl River 29 September - 1 October 2015 (RKM 18.9-20.8), 10.5 km E of Slidell, LA (St. Tammany Parish). All specimens were male and ranged 6-9 years in age. A silver carp (age = 7) was collected by a recreational fisher 19 November 2015 in the Pearl River below the Ross Barnett Reservoir (RKM 480) near Jackson, MS. These three collections are believed to represent nonindigenous silver and bighead carp dispersal from the Mississippi River Basin during floods.

AB  - Relationships between anthropogenic sources of Cl- and wetland surface water Cl- concentrations have received little attention. Spatial and temporal patterns of Cl- concentration were investigated in 11 wetlands in the mid to late 1990s and in 2012-2013 along a rural to urban gradient. Chloride concentrations in wetlands located in forest watersheds were <3 mg/L. Small spring-fed swamps in relatively undeveloped rural areas had elevated Cl- concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 mg/L which originated from nearby house septic systems and salt application on secondary roads. Potassium fertilizer application on areas of intensive crop production was a major source of Cl- in riparian wetlands where surface water Cl- concentrations were 50-65 mg/L. The application of deicing salts caused the highest Cl- concentrations (100-730 mg/L) which were observed in depressional wetlands in a rapidly urbanizing landscape with a denser road network. Chloride contamination in the study wetlands occurred throughout the year and diffuse surface flow paths produced a widespread pattern of elevated surface water Cl concentrations which have increased considerably in the past 10-15 years in some of the wetlands. Wetland Cl- levels in the most developed landscapes reached or exceeded chronic water quality thresholds established in the USA and Canada for negative effects on aquatic biota.

AB  - Background
   Ranong Province in southern Thailand is one of the primary entry points for migrants entering Thailand from Myanmar, and borders Kawthaung Township in Myanmar where artemisinin resistance in malaria parasites has been detected. Areas of high population movement could increase the risk of spread of artemisinin resistance in this region and beyond.
   Methods
   A respondent-driven sampling (RDS) methodology was used to compare migrant populations coming from Myanmar in urban (Site 1) vs. rural (Site 2) settings in Ranong, Thailand. The RDS methodology collected information on knowledge, attitudes, and practices for malaria, travel and occupational histories, as well as social network size and structure. Individuals enrolled were screened for malaria by microscopy, Real Time-PCR, and serology.
   Results
   A total of 619 participants were recruited in Ranong City and 623 participants in Kraburi, a rural sub-district. By PCR, a total of 14 (1.1%) samples were positive (2 P. falciparum in Site 1; 10 P. vivax, 1 Pf, and 1 P. malariae in Site 2). PCR analysis demonstrated an overall weighted prevalence of 0.5% (95% CI, 0-1.3%) in the urban site and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.5-1.7%) in the rural site for all parasite species. PCR positivity did not correlate with serological positivity; however, as expected there was a strong association between antibody prevalence and both age and exposure. Access to long-lasting insecticidal treated nets remains low despite relatively high reported traditional net use among these populations.
   Conclusions
   The low malaria prevalence, relatively smaller networks among migrants in rural settings, and limited frequency of travel to and from other areas of malaria transmission in Myanmar, suggest that the risk for the spread of artemisinin resistance from this area may be limited in these networks currently but may have implications for regional malaria elimination efforts.

AB  - The study examined the significance of five sets of variables classified under personal characteristics, adaptive actions, climatic factors, building spatial characteristics, and neighborhood location characteristics in the determination of indoor thermal comfort and the impact of spatial comfort on residents' preferences in space use. A thermal comfort survey was conducted among residents of 528 buildings in 12 selected residential neighborhoods of Ibadan metropolis in Nigeria. The impact of the urban microclimate on the building spaces was found significant. Indoor comfort assessment varied according to the different building design typology. The location and building characteristics were found to influence the indoor comfort of respondents. It was found that there were differences in air temperature measured within the spaces in the buildings. The thermal assessment of respondents for different spaces in their respective buildings also varied. There was very strong correlation between the most comfortable spaces, the most used spaces, and the first choice spaces voted by respondents at different periods of the day. Residents utilized adaptive actions and exhibited thermal consideration in the use of spaces. Adaptive movement from space to space due to variation in spatial comfort was confirmed in the study.

AB  - Free-roaming feral cats are common in areas of concentrated human habitation, and can pose considerable threats of nuisance and damage to native ecosystems. Trap-neuter-return (TNR) and trap vasectomy-hysterectomy-return (TVHR) are two humane methods for the reproductive control of feral cat populations. Both TNR and TVHR render a cat infertile, but cats that have undergone TVHR continue to produce hormones that drive mating behaviors. We built a stochastic agent-based computational model for simulating the survival, reproduction, and movement of individual feral cats and the use of TNR and TVHR to modify cats' reproductive abilities and behaviors. Daily movement of cats between colonies is implemented based on the distance between colonies and landscape properties (e.g. rural, urban). Spatially targeted TNR and TVHR policies are evaluated using two management goals: (1) reduce total population size and (2) reduce nuisance attributed to feral cats. Nuisance includes spraying and noise, both of which are associated with un-neutered males, as well as population abundance. Results indicate that both TNR and TVHR have the potential to greatly reduce population size. Effectiveness of each control depends on the capture rate, number of colonies targeted, size of each colony, and movement of individual cats between colonies. Results show that on average TVHR performs moderately better than TNR at reducing population size, but TNR substantially outperforms TVHR in reducing multiple nuisance measures.

AB  - Information on the pattern and rate of spread for invasive wood- and phloem-feeding insects, including the emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), is relatively limited, largely because of the difficulty of detecting subcortical insects at low densities. From 2008 to 2011, grids of girdled and subsequently debarked ash (Fraxinus spp.) detection trees were established across a >390 km(2) area encompassing two recently established EAB infestations in Michigan as part of the SLow Ash Mortality (SLAM) Pilot Project. Ash distribution and abundance were inventoried across the project area which included public and private forestland, a state park, and street trees in a small municipality. Spread rates of EAB from 2008 to 2011, based on larval presence in girdled detection trees, were estimated to be 1.2-1.7 km yr(-1) in the larger, presumably older, infestation and 0.4-0.7 km yr(-1) in the smaller infestation; suggesting a slower spread rate during the initial stages of population establishment. From 2009 to 2011, a total of 587 ash trees in the project area were trunk-injected with a highly effective, systemic emamectin benzoate insecticide. Potential effects of girdled ash trees and the systemic insecticide treatment on EAB spread were evaluated using a simulation model and a simple descriptive model of observed spread. Not surprisingly, density of trees treated with the insecticide was too low to exert a detectable effect on EAB spread. However, while the density of girdled trees was also relatively low, model results indicated a reduced spread of EAB out of areas containing girdled trees. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The phenomenon of "diving plumes" frequently occurs in some particular hydrogeological settings where the groundwater recharge flows into the top of a shallow water table aquifer and, once inside the aquifer, this water begins to move downwards. Due to the preferred horizontal flow path, it can push contaminant plumes downwards up to the deepest aquifers. Therefore, especially in urban areas, where the water table depression is more pronounced, the pollutants are conveyed to the most important groundwater resources for human consumption, often causing a severe decay of the drinking water. This paper thus deals with the most reliable criteria to delimit the areas in which the hydrogeological settings expose the aquifers to the deepening of the contaminants.
   To this end, this paper considers several contaminations of alluvial deposits in the Functional Urban Area of Milan. It analyses the hydrogeological setting and uses a mathematical model to highlight the deformations of the flow net produced by each of them. In this way, it was possible to identify the structures that facilitate the deepening of pollution and to set up an appropriate monitoring network that highlights the location of the plumes and allows their attenuation.

AB  - Nuclear or radiological terrorism in the form of uncontrolled radioactive contamination presents a unique challenge in the field of nuclear decontamination. Potential targets require an immediate decontamination response, or mitigation plan to limit the social and economic impact. To date, experience with urban decontamination of building materials - specifically hard, porous, external surfaces - is limited to nuclear weapon fallout and nuclear reactor accidents. Methods are lacking for performing wide-area decontamination in an urban environment so that in all release scenarios the area may be re -occupied without evaluation and/or restriction. Also lacking is experience in developing mitigation strategies, that is, methods of mitigating contamination and its resultant radiation dose in key areas during the immediate aftermath of an event and after lifesaving operations. To date, the tremendous strategy development effort primarily by the European community has focused on the recovery phase, which extends years beyond the release event. In this review, we summarize the methods and data collected over the past 70 years in the field of hard, external surface decontamination of radionuclide contaminations, with emphasis on methods suitable for response to radiological dispersal devices and their potentially unique physico-chemical characteristics. This review concludes that although a tremendous amount of work has been completed primarily by the European Community (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), the few studies existing on each technique permit only very preliminary estimates of decontamination factors for various building materials and methods and extrapolation of those values for use in environments outside the EU and UK. This data shortage prevents us from developing an effective and detailed mitigation response plan and remediation effort. Perhaps most importantly, while the data available does include valuable information on the practical aspects of performing the various remediation methods including costs, coverage rates, manpower, pitfalls, etc., it lacks the details on lessons learned, best practices, and standard procedures, for instance, that would be required to develop a mitigation strategy. While the urban decontamination problem is difficult and there is much more research to do, the existing literature provides a framework for a response plan. Using this framework, in conjunction with computer modeling and relevant data collection, can lead to development of appropriate plans and exercises that would permit development of a mitigation and remediation response.

AB  - The present paper employs advanced statistical modeling in order to assess the spatial factors that may influence the maneuverability of Powered Two-Wheelers (PTW) in urban corridors during overtaking. Using trajectory data from video recordings, two types of maneuvers are examined: those that occur with a lane change and those conducted without speed change and/or lane change (on the fly). The modeling approach has two parts: First, the probability to conduct an overtake is statistically modeled. Second, a Multiple Indicators-Multiple Causes (MIMIC) latent variable model is developed to assess the microscopic traffic characteristics and other critical factors that may affect the maneuverability of PTW. Results show that during overtaking, speed difference from the preceding vehicle is the most significant factor. Further results from the MIMIC model indicate that the PTW maneuverability is related to the type of overtake, the distance between the PTW and the vehicle being overtaken, as well as speeds.

AB  - This study investigated the variables that shaped people's willingness to engage in collective action in the context of the Occupy Movement. Data were collected in 2011 from nonprotesting supporters at the New York City Occupy encampment and active occupiers at the New York and Atlanta encampments. Participants distinguished between different kinds of collective action based on cost. Furthermore, different predictors motivated distinct kinds of collective action. Identity and anger predicted low-cost collective action. Efficacy predicted relatively costly collective action and mediated the link between identity and costly collective action. This study provides evidence that people draw distinctions between different actions based on cost and that, when it comes to predicting collective action, these distinctions matter.

AB  - Decreases in the water retention function of various artificial disturbed landform units (DLUs) caused by urbanization activities, compared to original landform units (OLUs), are the main factor that causes urban water and soil loss and the aggravation of urban floods under certain rainfall conditions and specially designed drainage network capabilities. Field investigations, laboratorial analyses of soil physical properties and analytic hierarchy process (AI-IP) composite methods were performed to comprehensively analyse the effects of various DLUs on the water retention function of OLUs. The results indicated as the following: (i) The >5 mm particle content (>54%) for various DLUs was higher than that for OLUs (lower than 3%); the natural repose angles of soil -rock mixtures (32-37 degrees) and soil bulk denSity (1.41-1.74 g/cm(3)) in the DLUs were all higher than those in the OLUs (30-31 degrees,1.18-1.14 g/cm(3)); and the uniformity coefficients and curvature coefficients were 10.00-80.00 and 3.24-5.70 in the DLUs and 6.00-75.00 and 0.17-2.50 in the OLUs, respectively. (ii) The soil steady state infiltration rate in the DLUs decreased from disturbed soil accumulation with 2 months (DSA(2m), 15.00 mm/min) to disturbed soil accumulation with 2 years (DSA(2a), 5.63 mm/min), disturbed soil accumulation with 4 years (DSA(4a), 3.82 mm/min), the slope greening belt (SGB, 124 mm/min), and construction roads (CR, 0.51 mm/min). The conversion from forests to DSA(2m) had the greatestimpact on the soil infiltration capacity and soil storage capacity, while the conversion to CR had the lowest impact. (iii) The total reservoir storage in the DLUs' soil was ordered as follows: DSA(4a) > SGB > DSA(2a) > DSA(2m)> CR. The conversion process from grass to CR exerted the greatest impact on storing water and regulating the overland flow. (iv) The water retention functions in the DLUs were all weaker than those in the OLUs: DSA(2m) was the weakest (0287), while paddy fields were the strongest (0.668). Thus, the occupied areas of urban water surfaces (e.g., lakes, rivers and ponds), forests and grassland and their spatial distribution during urbanization must be carefully considered. These results could help to understand the ecological service functions of urban soil and water conservation, provide relevant knowledge to landscape rehabilitation, alleviate urban floods during urban development and recover the functions of soil and water conservation ecological services in project areas during the urbanization construction process.

AB  - The main objectives of this paper are, designing and balancing of Water Distribution Network (WDN) based on loops hydraulically balanced method as well as using Geographical Information System (GIS) methodology with the contribution of EPANET. GIS methodology is used to ensure WDN's integrity and skeletonized a proper and functional WDN by using Network Analyst utilizing the geometric network and topology network by hierarchical geo-databases. The problem is to make WDN hydraulically balanced by applying WDN balancing method. For that reason, we have analyzed water flows in each pipe and performed the iterations process on loops, in order to make the algebraic summation of head loss "h(f)" around any closed loop zero, in case, the summation of pipe flows must be equal to the flow amount entering or leaving the system through each node. At each iteration, reasonable changes occurred at pipes flow until the head loss has become very small or fixed zero as (optimizes correction) by using excel sheet solver. Since this method is confirmed to be effective, simulations were done by using GIS and EPANET water distribution platform. As a result, we accomplished hydraulically balanced WDN. Finally, we have analyzed and simulated hydraulics parameters for the targeted area in Kabul city. Thus, we successfully determined the hydraulics state of parameters around the network as a positive result. It is worth mentioning that, Hardy-cross method is being used for approaching more precise optimized correction and consequences concerning hydraulically-balanced and optimal WDN. This method can be done for complex loops WDN as well; the advantage of the method is simple math and self-correction. Managers and engineers who work in the field of water supply this methodology has been recommended as the more advantageous workflow in planning water distribution pattern.

AB  - Increasingly, archaeological research in Amazonia is revealing complex precolonial occupation in areas around riverine confluences. In 2014, the first site-based archaeological investigations were undertaken in Gurupa, Para, Brazil, a municipality that spans the region of the Xingu-Amazon confluence. The Portuguese controlled access to Amazonia from 1623 onward through a network of settlements organized around Gurupci. Results from extensive excavations of terra preta sites, landscape archaeology, and analysis of ceramic evidence suggest that this was also a precolonial crossroads. Carrazedo, once a booming historical town (Arapijo), sits atop a significantly larger terra preta site. Excavations in historical and precolonial sectors of Carrazedo found well-preserved remains, including a precolonial house terrace complex. The extent of terra preta and earthworks at Carrazedo indicate that the precolonial occupation was more intensive than the colonial-historical period occupation. Regional survey revealed colonial-historical period sites consistently overlying expansive precolonial sites, the density and extent of which suggest a major precolonial center at the Xingu-Amazon confluence. Overall, ecological and landscape modifications appear to have been more intense in the precolonial past than during later periods. Short- and long-distance settlement networks also differed during the two periods. This as-of-yet understudied region promises to shed new light on deep-time human-environment interactions and spatial organization in the humid tropics of Amazonia.

AB  - Geomorphological studies indicate that the current Iranian Central Desert has previously consisted of several large lakes, the remains of which are still visible in the form of numerous playas across the desert. The Northern edge of the Iranian Central Desert has been subject to several seasons of systematic Paleolithic surveys from 2009. As a result of these surveys, several Paleolithic settlements have been recorded, the most significant of which include the Middle Paleolithic sites of Mirak, Soofi-Abad and Chah-e Jam. In order to test whether any Middle Paleolithic sites existed around the boundary of such playas, one of them (Chah-e Jam Desert), which is located at the southern outskirts of the modern city of Damghan (300 km east of Tehran), was selected for intensive walking survey in July-August 2014. During the course of the survey, a large exposure of lithic artefacts, 8.5 km in length, was discovered. Techno-typological analysis of the lithic assemblages indicates an abundance of Levallois technology and numerous retouched tool types (e.g., Levallois points, and all types of convergent scrapers), leading the site to be attributed to the Middle Paleolithic. The presence of some typological elements of later periods indicates the site has been inhabited during Upper/Epipaleolithic periods as well. This site, along with other Middle Paleolithic settlements in this landscape, indicate that climatic conditions during the Late Pleistocene were significantly different to present, and the presence of numerous lakes and associated vegetation permitted hominin populations to occupy currently arid areas.

AB  - We argue that existing studies underestimate the degree to which racial change leads to residential segregation in post-Civil Rights American neighborhoods. This is because previous studies only measure the presence of racial groups in neighborhoods, not the degree of integration among those groups. As a result, those studies do not detect gradual racial succession that ends in racially segregated neighborhoods. We demonstrate how a new approach based on growth mixture models can be used to identify patterns of racial change that distinguish between durable integration and gradual racial succession. We use this approach to identify common trajectories of neighborhood racial change among blacks, whites, Latinos, and Asians from 1970 to 2010 in the New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston metropolitan areas. We show that many nominally integrated neighborhoods have experienced gradual succession. For blacks, this succession has caused the gradual concentric diffusion of the ghetto; in contrast, Latino and Asian growth has dispersed throughout both cities and suburbs in the metropolitan areas. Durable integration has come about largely in the suburbs.

AB  - Drainage history is a well-demonstrated factor that influences the population structure of freshwater inhabitants over a broad geographic scale. However, there has been little research undertaken on such a relationship with freshwater fish on a small geographical scale, especially in Asia. In this study, we investigated the role of local, small drainage systems in affecting the population genetic structure of a freshwater goby, Rhinogobius duospilus, in Hong Kong streams using a multilocus approach. Analyses on nine genetic markers (2 mitochondrial and 7 nuclear markers, including 5 microsatellite markers) reveal prominent and intensive genetic structuring (2.1-5.4% mtDNA sequence divergence) in R. duospilus in Hong Kong. The lineages and clusters recovered from mtDNA data and assignment analysis of nuclear markers coincide with the paleodrainage networks. Furthermore, marked population subdivision between streams located on different side branches (<20 km apart) within the same paleodrainage area is observed and gene flow occurs only between closely situated streams that share common paleodrainage confluences. In an extreme case, gene flow is limited between streams that are less than 5 km apart. Apparently, such an intensive population structure is attributed to the regional paleodrainage pattern, together with the highly sedentary life style of R. duospilus, which reduces contemporary gene flow and dispersal between populations in neighbouring streams.

AB  - Agricultural changes are complex and managing an appropriate type of crop change to satisfy stakeholders with various interests is challenging. Decisions regarding a crop change need to be debated among multiple stakeholders with various conflicting viewpoints. Two kinds of conflicts might occur as a result of crop change in an agricultural landscape: (1) conflicts among multiple ecosystem services i.e., internal conflicts and (2) conflicts among multiple stakeholders i.e., external conflicts. While a spatial decision support system (SDSS) can provide answers concerning multifaceted problems, there are currently a few SDSSs that indicate the trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services as a result of crop change and also enable stakeholders with diverse preferences to arrive at group-based decisions. In this study, we held a series of meetings with stakeholders, who were experts in economics, energy, soil erosion, greenhouse gas emission, surface water, and biodiversity, to develop two crop change scenarios by replacing perennial energy crops with annual energy crops and vice versa. We then used an online SDSS, SmartScape (TM), and applied it to Dane county, Wisconsin, U.S. to (1) run the two aforementioned crop change scenarios separately in order to assess how effectively SmartScape (TM) enables decision makers to resolve internal conflicts while considering the relative values of multiple ecosystem services, and (2) run the two crop change scenarios jointly to show how well SmartScape (TM) enables decision makers to resolve external conflicts in a group while taking into account the diverse goals of stakeholders. The outcomes of this study can inform policy-makers about both internal conflicts within a crop change scenario and external conflicts among stakeholders and provide a unique framework to resolve both types of conflict in an effective way. Obtaining acceptable crop change solutions among stakeholders with conflicting interests can lead us in moving from individual decision-making to group-based decision-making so that we can enhance sustainability in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Variation in rates of sanitary hygiene products, toilet tissue and faeces occurring in sewers are presented for dry and wet weather from three steep upstream urban catchments with different economic, age and ethnic profiles. Results show, for example, that total daily solids per capita from the low income and ageing populations are almost twice that from high income or ethnic populations. Relative differences are verified through independent questionnaires. The relationship between solids stored in sewers prior to storms, antecedent dry weather period and the proportion of roof to total catchment area is quantified. A full solids' flush occurs when storm flows exceed three times the peak dry weather flow. The data presented will assist urban drainage designers in managing pollution caused by the discharge of sewage solids.

AB  - In Southampton Water, UK, the recent (c. 150 years ago) interspecific hybridisation between Spartina alterniflora (2n = 6x = 62; A-genome) and S. maritima (2n = 6x = 60; M-genome) gave rise to the homoploid hybrid (S. x townsendii, 2n = 6x = 62), and subsequently to the invasive allododecaploid species S. anglica (2n = 12x = 120-124) that has since spread worldwide. To address the question of dynamics of mixed ploidy populations involving these plants, we analysed several Spartina populations (fifty one individuals) in Southern England, UK, one of which was the presumed place of origin of the homoploid hybrid (Hythe). Using a combination of flow cytometry and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genotyping we were able to identify the genomic composition and ploidy level of each individual analysed. The data show that the homoploid hybrid still dominates the population at Hythe (82 % of individuals collected in that locality) since its origin in the nineteenth century. We also identified S. x townsendii for the first time on Hayling Island (66 % individuals), indicating dispersal beyond its likely origin. The fertile allododecaploid S. anglica was mainly found in populations outside the initial hybridisation site, on Hayling Island and at Eling Marchwood. Quantification of the rDNA contributions from each parental genome showed that the ratios were mostly balanced in S. x townsendii. However, two (3 %) S. anglica individuals analysed have lost nearly all M-genome homeologs, indicating extensive repeat loss. Such variation indicates that despite the presumed single allopolyploid origin of S. anglica and genetic uniformity at other loci, it has undergone substantial changes at the rDNA loci following genome duplication.

AB  - In the stretch of the River Segura between the Contraparada Dam and the city of Murcia there is an area where fluvial dynamic created pronounced meanders and fertile river groves that have made the land suitable for irrigated agriculture. However, channeling works promoted by the Flood Control Plan in the Segura Basin (1987) generated more than four kilometres of removed meanders and increased lack of connection between groves and stream. This article aims to identify opportunities in this place that could be part of an effective strategy against the consequences of Climate Change in the Region of Murcia. Regarding methodology, basically it was done through literature review about fluvial history of the area, properties of traditional Mediterranean irrigation systems and the effects of climate change in the Region of Murcia. Likewise, a cartographic study covering the period 18092013 was made in order to understand the meandering river movement and the disturbances generated by human activity. Results show that the study area where traditional orchards, river and irrigation system are combined presents many opportunities like the opening of the former meanders to the current river to embrace possible floods or the potential ability to generate biodiversity. Results encourage to consider these combined landscapes as strategic locations to contribute to restoration projects and to mitigation and adaptation to Climate Change.

AB  - Over the past 30 years, the collectivist-democratic form of organization has presented a growing alternative to the bureaucratic form, and it has proliferated, here and around the world. This form is manifest, for example, within micro-credit groups, workers' co-operatives, nongovernmental organizations, advocacy groups, self-help groups, community and municipal initiatives, social movement organizations, and in many nonprofit groups in general. It is most visible in the civil society sector, but demands for deeper participation are also evident in communities and cities, and the search for more involving and less bureaucratic structures has spread into many for-profit firms as well. Building on research on this form of organization, this article develops a model of the decisional processes utilized in such organizations and contrasts these "Democracy 2.0" standards for decision making from the Democracy 1.0 (representative and formal) standards that previously prevailed. Drawing on a new generation of research on these sorts of organizations, this article and this special section discuss: (a) how consensus decisional processes are being made more efficient; (b) how such organizations are now able to scale to fairly large size while still retaining their local and participatory basis; (c) how such organizations are cultivating a more diverse membership and using such diversity to build more democratic forms of governance; (d) how such organizations are combatting ethnoracial and gender inequalities that prevail in the surrounding society; and (e) how emotions are getting infused into the public conversations within these organizations and communities.

TI  - The British Isles and Beyond: The Performance of Instrumental Music by William Sterndale Bennett during the Long Nineteenth Century
T2  - NINETEENTH-CENTURY MUSIC REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Bennett wrote in a variety of instrumental and vocal genres. Some of his most popular pieces during his lifetime comprise anthems, oratorios and cantatas. But his enduring legacy resides with his instrumental output, in particular works that include a pianist. This article begins with an examination of performances that occurred in Britain and in Germany, where Bennett's close associations with the Mendelssohn circle provided him with substantial encouragement during his formative years. Advances in transportation and increasing globalization led touring artists to travel farther to cities worldwide, bringing with them Bennett repertoire to foreign shores. George Loder, for example, conducted the US premiere of The Wood Nymphs overture at the New York Philharmonic in 1848. Arabella Goddard gave an early American performance of the Piano Sonata Op. 46 (Die Jungfrau von Orleans) in 1875, just two years after its premiere in London. In addition, migrs from Britain and Germany, especially to Australia, New Zealand and America, contributed to the movement of British music across the globe. In both small towns and large cities, from Melbourne to Auckland, San Francisco to Boston, audiences heard Bennett compositions. In tracing performances of Bennett's instrumental music before the First World War in both his own country and selected areas outside the British Isles, this research contributes to our understanding of developments in modern concert life as well as the transmission of British music within the Empire and beyond.

AB  - Due to high blockage loss of millimeter wave (mm-wave) channel, researchers proposed to use multipath components (MPCs) as alternative communication links when line of sight (LOS) signal gets blocked. However, when both link ends are moving such as in Device-to-Device (D2D) scenario, MPC parameters show variation in their characteristics. In such scenarios, MPCs need to be persistent with transmitter/receiver's movement in order to be used as a communication link. The main goal of this paper is to the characterize persistent MPCs for the mm-wave propagation channel at 30 GHz frequency in an urban environment. To this end, we develop a set of algorithms to resolve these MPCs. We investigate how persistent MPCs evolve and change their characteristics in both temporal and angular domain with receiver's movement. We also analyze the probability of occurrence of persistent paths of different lengths and differential change of their azimuth angle of arrivals (azimuth-AOAs) throughout the movement. These information of persistent paths will help the system developer to design blockage effect immune communication links for D2D user.

AB  - This article analyses the role played by Spanish immigrants in the diffusion of the indignados movement in Occupy Wall Street (OWS). I argue that Spanish residents in New York City acted as brokers between the two movements, and that their behaviour had a significant impact on OWS's understanding of itself as an expansive, inclusive and empathic phenomenon. Building on recent theoretical developments, which stress the importance of dialogue and collective learning in the transnational diffusion of historical social movements, this research produces results at different levels. At the empirical level, the problems faced by the immigrants reveal the cultural complexity of transnational diffusion within the recent wave of contention. At the analytical level, the personal contact and intergroup dialogue established between immigrants and local activists challenge accounts stressing the role of social media and the internet within the transnational diffusion of this protest. At the theoretical level, the article develops a process-oriented perspective on brokerage, improving our understanding of its implications concerning diffusion. I argue that a longitudinal analysis of brokerage shows how interaction can modify role identity and movement diffusion: diffusion develops where brokers maintain a coordinating role in the movement, and ceases to do so where brokers are displaced from this central position.

AB  - Riparian areas are key ecosystems for conservation and protection because of the multiple and essential ecosystem services they provide despite occupying only a small percentage of the watershed. The greater soil water availability in the riparian areas compared to the adjacent terrestrial ecosystems leads to more productive, different and diverse terrestrial vegetation assemblages compared to the adjacent upland terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, riparian areas have many services that range from reducing nonpoint sources pollutants, overland flows and floods, to wildlife and fish essential habitats, to recreational opportunities for humans. Humans have recognized these ecosystem services and have utilized them with various activities for thousands of years. This has led to the severe degradation of riparian areas that are considered as some of the most threatened ecosystems. In the European Union the importance of conserving and protecting riparian areas is recognized by the many riparian areas that have been designated as Natura 2000 sites. Additionally, the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) has recognized their importance as essential features in the hydromorphological assessment of freshwater bodies. Riparian corridors are highly valuable and diverse habitats in Euro-Mediterranean-type environments, especially within agricultural dominant landscapes. In the Mediterranean region, large tracts of natural habitat have been replaced by agriculture and urban areas that has simplified their diversity and their ecosystem services. The objective of this study was to use an ocular protocol to estimate the condition of characteristic Mediterranean riparian habitats in agricultural dominated landscapes in Northern Greece. The characteristic riparian habitats surveyed were: a) natural woody vegetation along a stream with perennial flow adjacent to agricultural fields (Ste-Ag), b) natural woody vegetation along a torrent with intermittent flow adjacent to agricultural fields (Tor-Ag), and c) natural woody vegetation along a stream with perennial flow adjacent to forested areas (Ste-For). The Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP) was implemented in 20 survey plots in each studied riparian habitat. The protocol was developed in the United States and is widely used as an easy technique to evaluate riparian habitats adjacent to farmlands. For this study it was modified for the Euro-Mediterranean environments. Based on the average SVAP values of the 20 survey points the Ste-Ag and Ste-For were not statistically different. In contract, the Tor-Ag had significantly lower values that the other two habitats. Overall, this modified SVAP could be used with to meet the requirements to assess riparian Mediterranean ecosystems. This could be a valuable and easy to use tool that will help manage riparian areas more effectively in Greece.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases caused by endemic pathogens such as Ross River, Barmah Forest and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses are an annual concern in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. More than a dozen mosquito species have been implicated in the transmission of these pathogens, with each mosquito occupying a specialised ecological niche that influences their habitat associations, host feeding preferences and the environmental drivers of their abundance.
   The NSW Arbovirus Surveillance and Mosquito Monitoring Program provides an early warning system for potential outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease by tracking annual activity of these mosquitoes and their associated pathogens. Although the program will effectively track changes in local mosquito populations that may increase with a changing climate, urbanisation and wetland rehabilitation, it will be less effective with current surveillance methodologies at detecting or monitoring changes in exotic mosquito threats, where different surveillance strategies need to be used.
   Exotic container-inhabiting mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus pose a threat to NSW because they are nuisance-biting pests and vectors of pathogens such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. International movement of humans and their belongings have spread these mosquitoes to many regions of the world. In recent years, these two mosquitoes have been detected by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources at local airports and seaports. To target the detection of these exotic mosquitoes, new trapping technologies and networks of surveillance locations are required. Additionally, incursions of these mosquitoes into urban areas of the state will require strategic responses to minimise substantial public health and economic burdens to local communities.

AB  - In the late nineteenth century to the twentieth, at Rio de Janeiro, the experience of working with the press occurs in the movement of expansion of literacy in the media circuit, with obvious tensions that have marked this process. This article covers the spatial distribution of those newspapers and its newsrooms and thus analyzes the performance thereof as an organization of spaces and public affirmation of the presence of workers in the city. This work also highlights the initiatives for the production and collection of historical evidence within this press, trying to understand it as affirmation strategies of workers' identities and legitimizing their memories and stories.

Plan named as coup attempt but would go beyond invasion of countrey has been driven back with Turkish people's rapid, dense and determined reaction. We should get the message of this time course through studies run under religion-politics, military forces-state, NGOs-societystate relations, religious education, political culture, social theory and values headlines.
   Gulen movement has a history of 50 years and has spread among religionist people due to religious purposes apparently. Thrgogh its plicies the movement reached a winder impact different areas and it has became a global actor. They have worked with AK Party governments in harmony and gained significant acquisitions. Conflicts in assignments to critical positions, state management and intitutionalization have turned into frustration in a short time.
   In this article the process of conversion of community to a terrorist organisation and religious-theological concepts and arguments used in this period will be examined, and some suggestions will be presented on religious education, religion-politics relations, religious organisations and their activities for building a healty and sustainable social order.

AB  - There is a growing need for high resolution spatio-temporal population estimates which allow accurate assessment of population exposure to natural hazards. Current approaches to population estimation are usually limited either by the use of arbitrary administrative boundaries or insufficient resolution in the temporal dimension. The innovative approach proposed here combines the use of a spatio-temporal gridded population model with flood inundation data to estimate time-specific variations in population exposed to natural hazards. The approach is exemplified through an application centred on Southampton (UK) using Environment Agency flood map inundation data. Results demonstrate that large fluctuations occur over time in the population distribution within flood risk zones. Variations in the spatio-temporal distribution of population subgroups are explored. Analysis using GIS indicates a diurnal shift in exposure between fluvial and tidal flooding, particularly attributable to the movement of the working age population. This illustrates the improvements achievable to flood risk management as well as potential application to other natural hazard scenarios both within the UK and globally.

AB  - ObjectivesStatistical tools are effectively used to determine the distribution of mosquitoes and to make ecological inferences about the vector-borne disease dynamics. In this study, we utilised species distribution models to understand spatial patterns of Aedes aegypti in two dengue-prevalent regions of Pakistan, Lahore and Swat. Species distribution models can potentially indicate the probability of suitability of Ae. aegypti once introduced to new regions like Swat, where invasion of this species is a recent phenomenon.
   MethodsThe distribution of Ae. aegypti was determined by applying the MaxEnt algorithm on a set of potential environmental factors and species sample records. The ecological dependency of species on each environmental variable was analysed using response curves. We quantified the statistical performance of the models based on accuracy assessment and spatial predictions.
   ResultsOur results suggest that Ae. aegypti is widely distributed in Lahore. Human population density and urban infrastructure are primarily responsible for greater probability of mosquito occurrence in this region. In Swat, Ae. aegypti has clumped distribution, where urban patches provide refuge to the species in an otherwise hostile heterogeneous environment and road networks are assumed to have facilitated in passive-mediated dispersal of species.
   ConclusionsIn Pakistan, Ae. aegypti is expanding its range northwards; this could be associated with rapid urbanisation, trade and travel. The main implication of this expansion is that more people are at risk of dengue fever in the northern highlands of Pakistan.

AB  - Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), the most tempting features are usability, availability and service integrity required by the users especially in case of the video streaming. Thus, the concept of quality of experience (QoE) occurred with non-technical aspects which directly influence user's perception. This paper provides a complete performance evaluation of seven ad-hoc routing protocols, for the application of video streaming, considering different number of connections in an urban scenario. Afterwards, since position-based protocols present a major issue of networking for VANETs, we focused our comparative study on the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) protocol. The tool-set for this evaluation integrates Evalvid, NS-2 and VanetMobiSim. Besides considering Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Throughput and Delay as QoS metrics, we evaluate Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Video Quality Metric (VQM) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) as QoE measures. The simulation shows that GPSR offers acceptable results for all metrics except delay, it enables a good improvement of the later though. Therefore, it still needs enhancement for its metrics performances.

AB  - This article departs from accounts that either deify Indignant Squares as a model for 21st century political praxis or demonize them as apolitical/post-political crowd gatherings. By performing a closer ethnographic reading of the Indignants' protests at Athens' Syntagma Square, we depict the Indignant Squares as a consensual and deeply spatialized staging of dissent, which nevertheless harbours in its underbelly internally conflicting and often radically opposing political imaginaries. A closer reading of the organization, practice and discourses that evolved at Syntagma Square unearths the existence of not one, but two distinct Indignant Squares, both at Syntagma, each with its own topography (upper and lower square), and its own discursive and material practices. Although both squares staged dissent, they nevertheless generated different (opposing, even) political imaginaries. The upper square' often divulged nationalistic or xenophobic discourses; the lower square' centred around more organized efforts to stage inclusive politics of solidarity. The paper suggests that, rather than focusing on the homogenizing terms Indignants' movement/Indignant Squares we should instead be trying to develop a more nuanced theoretical understanding and a more finely grained empirical analysis of the discursive and spatial choreographies of these events. This, we argue, would allow us to go beyond either celebrating them as new political imaginaries, or condemning them as expressions of a post-political era. Talking of Indignant Squares' in the plural helps one explore in more grounded ways both the limitations and the possibilities that these events offer for opening up (or closing down) democratic politics.

AB  - This paper examines the dynamic interplay between language policy and local stakeholders in the process of dialect planning in the city of Shanghai, in the context of social tensions surrounding the decline of Shanghai dialect in mainland China. A process-oriented Language Management Theory (LMT) model is adopted as the analytical framework to reveal the interactive facet of micro language planning. Drawing on in-depth interviews and document analysis, the paper analyzes and interprets ten key players' perceptions and experiences in relation to the 'saving Shanghai dialect' movement. Qualitative data analysis demonstrates five stages in the dialect planning process and reveals how individuals' agency, when struggling and striving for local language rights, exert bottom-up influence upon language policy-making. The findings also unravel the social political duality between macro structure and individual agency. The paper ends with a discussion on the need to negotiate the individual agency in a more interactive and democratic dialog with predefined policy constraints. This study may have implications for multilingual/multidialectal contexts in other geographical locations where linguistic diversity in the local contexts is encountering shifts in language use and language changes. Besides, this study may also enrich applicability of the LMT framework which reveals the interactive and dynamic process by unbundling individual responses and influences on language planning.

AB  - Energy crisis is one of the biggest problems in developing countries. There is a big gap between generation and demand of Electric energy. Since the deposits of Non-renewable energy are limited, the only solution is to use Renewable energy. Solar energy which is present in abundance can play a vital role to overcome the energy deficiency. The potential of solar voltaic energy can also be exploited for averting environmental pollution and managing atmospheric emission. This research paper provides a proposal for design of an inverter using dual axis solar tracker installed on rooftop. The paper focuses on presenting the structure and application of a microcontroller based dual axis solar tracker which tracks the direction of the solar radiation thereby adjusting the movement of solar panel accordingly. This facilitates the sun to remain perpendicular to the PV panel throughout the day which makes the total energy received to be increased by 50-60%. The energy hence received gets stored in a chargeable battery. This battery has an inverter attached to it so that whenever there is a power-cut, the stored energy may be used to light up the appliances. The stated research aims at minimizing the dependence on power from national grid station to meet the daily energy requirements in both urban and rural areas of the country.

AB  - Land use development is following the needs of the community in a city. The development of land use and those usages could be difference from the Master Plan of the city. This may occur subject to the new policy or some new idea to adopt any general tendency of global change. The changing of land usage drives unmanageable traffic movement due to changing traffic generation or attraction of the new land use. This situation will increase travel time of the road network. The impact of increasing travel time is more affected to air travelers; increasing travel time in the access road to the airport may cause the lost of their flight. This research attempts to determine how much difference of travel time of road access to the airport from time to time that is caused by changing of land use. The result shows that the number of alternative routes to the airport is increased from six to eleven in year 2009 and 2014 respectively. However, the increasing number of access route is not followed by the reducing of travel time. Only two routes out of 11 that have less travel time from 2009. (C) (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Statistical tourism data are critical to supporting tourism policy decisions. Such data are normally compiled via questionnaires or interviews, which requires both time and money, thus making such data unusable for policy decision-making to occur in real-time. To support real-time policy decision-making, we focused on person trip data for promoting tourism. The city government can reflect such data on tourism events and guidebooks if it has a grasp of tourist person trip patterns. In this paper, we focused on using the log data of Wi-Fi access points available at each tourist spot. Wi-Fi access points have log data that keep track of the timestamps of users connecting and disconnecting from the Wi-Fi. We can visualize the movements of tourists using these data; however, there is bias among Wi-Fi users. Therefore, we must evaluate the Wi-Fi log data to verify they are representative of almost all tourists. More specifically, we evaluated log data for Goto City to determine whether the government's data were equivalent to the log data. We also showed the possibility of visualizing tourist movement history based on our log data.

AB  - In order to explore the nanoparticles' movement and distribution pattern of a car emission, a 3-D CFD simulation code, based on Eulerian multiphase model, was developed and tested, the exhaust gas from the car is modeled as a mixture of air and seven kinds of particles: 10 nm, 70 nm, 100 nm, 300 nm, 500 nm, 1.0 mu m and 2.5 mu m. The model is validated before the typical city street simulation through a field experiment, and the simulation prediction is lower 4.1%, 5.1% and 8.2% than that the field test results for 300 nm, 500 nm and 1.0 mu m particles. In city street case, when the car moving with a typical 50 km/h speed, the airflow at the bottom of the vehicle would lift the exhausting gas of the car and pressed down by the airflow from the top of vehicle thereafter. The particles are scattered behind the vehicle immediately, to occupy a larger space than the vehicle in width and height in a distance of a vehicle's length behind, and concentrate behind the vehicle in a space no higher than the height of the vehicle. The distribution pattern of particles is symmetric with the axial of exhaust pipe in the horizontal plane and the higher the height, the smaller the distribution area, the diffusion range of the small particles is larger than the larger ones. The results of this paper could provide some ideas for the control of automobile exhausting gas pollution.

AB  - There has been a resurgence of interest in time geography studies due to emerging spatiotemporal big data in urban environments. However, the rapid increase in the volume, diversity, and intensity of spatiotemporal data poses a significant challenge with respect to the representation and computation of time geographic entities and relations in road networks. To address this challenge, a spatiotemporal data model is proposed in this article. The proposed spatiotemporal data model is based on a compressed linear reference (CLR) technique to transform network time geographic entities in three-dimensional (3D) (x, y, t) space to two-dimensional (2D) CLR space. Using the proposed spatiotemporal data model, network time geographic entities can be stored and managed in classical spatial databases. Efficient spatial operations and index structures can be directly utilized to implement spatiotemporal operations and queries for network time geographic entities in CLR space. To validate the proposed spatiotemporal data model, a prototype system is developed using existing 2D GIS techniques. A case study is performed using large-scale datasets of space-time paths and prisms. The case study indicates that the proposed spatiotemporal data model is effective and efficient for storing, managing, and querying large-scale datasets of network time geographic entities.

AB  - Background: Among the chronic rheumatic diseases, hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent and is a leading cause of pain and disability in most countries worldwide. Its prevalence increases with age and generally affects women more frequently than men. OA is strongly associated with aging and heavy physical occupational activity, a required livelihood for many people living in rural communities in developing countries. Determining region-specific OA prevalence and risk factor profiles will provide important information for planning future cost effective preventive strategies and health care services.
   Materials and Methods: The study was a community based cross sectional study to find out the prevalence of primary knee OA in India which has a population of 1.252 billion. The study was done across five sites in India. Each site was further divided into big city, small city, town, and village. The total sample size was 5000 subjects. Tools consisted of a structured questionnaire and plain skiagrams for confirmation of OA. Diagnosis was done using Kellgren and Lawrence scale for osteoarthritis.
   Results: Overall prevalence of knee OA was found to be 28.7%. The associated factors were found to be female gender (prevalence of 31.6%) (P = 0.007), obesity (P = 0.04), age (P = 0.001) and sedentary work (P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: There is scarcity of studies done in India which has varied socio geographical background and communities. We conducted this study for analyzing the current prevalence of OA in different locations. This study has evidenced a large percentage of population as borderline OA; therefore, it depends mainly on the prevention of modifiable risk factors to preserve at ease movement in elderly population through awareness programs.

AB  - In June 2013, protesters took to the streets of hundreds of Brazilian cities. The mobilizing factor was the rising fares of public transportation, which precipitated a wave of discontentment characterized by a mix of demands for better public services and changes in the discredited democratic institutions. This article discusses the role of social media in the protests and how such use configures a paradigmatic example of how communication occurs in network societies. To frame the discussion, we examine social media appropriation for the purposes of political participation through a survey applied online in 17 countries and an in-depth analysis of protests in Brazil. Looking at the Brazilian protests, the ways in which the appropriation of social media occurred and institutional responses to demonstrations developed, we argue that in the network society, the people, and no longer the media, are the message.

AB  - We integrated correlative (species distribution) and process-based (agent-based) modeling approaches-to predict future range expansion of an invasive plant (Leucaena leucocephala) in the lowland rainforest and tropical coastal forest ecosystems of the Hengchun peninsula, Taiwan. We simulated range expansion to the year 2027 using a spatially-explicit, agent-based model representing invasion rate as a function of habitat quality and propagule pressure. We developed an index of habitat quality by relating 1988 plant distribution data to geo-referenced data on climatic conditions, landscape features, and anthropogenic factors via logistic regression. We represented propagule pressure using a lognormal dispersal kernel. We evaluated model performance by simulating range expansion from 1988 to 2007 and comparing simulated distribution patterns to those observed in 2007. Results of logistic regression indicated that L. leucocephala is more likely to occur in warm, dry areas containing a higher percentage of natural landscape (forest or grassland), areas adjacent to the forest edge, and areas disturbed by human activities such as a main road or an abandoned sisal plantation. Model evaluation showed that the prediction performance is excellent with AUC > 0.9 and Mantel's r = 0.77. Our results indicated that L. leucocephala will continue from the western portion toward the southern and central portions of Checheng township, and throughout the southern portion of Hengchun and Manjhou townships, with about 2500 ha of new area invaded within the next 20 years. Our predictions should allow managers to develop proactive management plans for the areas most likely to be invaded.

AB  - Pathogen contamination from leaky sanitary sewers poses a threat to groundwater quality in urban areas, yet the spatial and temporal dimensions of this contamination are not well understood. In this study, 16 monitoring wells and six municipal wells were repeatedly sampled for human enteric viruses. Viruses were detected infrequently, in 17 of 455 samples, compared to previous sampling at these wells. Thirteen of the 22 wells sampled were virus-positive at least once. While the highest virus concentrations occurred in shallower wells, shallow and deep wells, were virus-positive at similar rates. Virus presence in groundwater was temporally coincident, with 16 of 17 virus-positive samples collected in a six-month period. Detections were associated with precipitation and occurred infrequently during a prolonged drought. The study purposely included sites with sewers of differing age and material. The rates of virus detections in groundwater were similar at all study sites during this study. However, a relationship between sewer age and virus detections emerged when compared to data from an earlier study, conducted during high precipitation conditions. Taken together, these data indicate that sewer condition and climate affect urban groundwater contamination by human enteric viruses.

AB  - An integrated ecological assessment and restoration plan has been developed for Koumoundourou Lake, a heavily modified peri-urban lagoon near Athens, Greece. After the construction of an artificial weir on the coastal lagoon's canal outlet with Elefsina Bay, the water quality has improved and a short-term decrease in heavy metal concentrations in sediments is noted, which indicates a slow amelioration during the last decade. Nevertheless, the weir construction since the mid-1990s has changed the hydrological conditions of the wetland; it inevitably blocked marine fish movement and extirpated several fish species, while the area occupied by submerged aquatic vegetation has expanded due to the reduction in the lagoon water's salinity. In order to maintain the improved water quality and ecological potential of Koumoundourou Lake, the construction of a fish pass within the sluice is recommended that would allow the free passage of fishes (particularly gray mullet mugilidae). Although this is expected to affect the current hydraulic conditions of the lagoon and may increase the salinity and slightly decrease the time renewal of the water, the lagoon's ecological potential is expected to improve as the food web will be enriched.

AB  - Focusing primarily on CEDAW (The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women), this article examines the role that international human rights law plays in the advancement of the protection of human rights of women. My general conclusion will be that international human rights law is one small, but not utterly insignificant, aspect of the success of the women's movement, important more for its role in enabling the movement to grow and prosper than for what it does in and of itself. Indeed, I claim, human rights law lags well behind the women's movement in some crucial ways. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile that documents like CEDAW exist, and not merely for their direct legal value (which can be questioned). Documents help people to network across national boundaries and to develop a sense of common purpose, a common language, a common set of demands, and a sense that progress is being made; all of which are incredibly important for a movement, especially an international one, and especially for members who feel isolated or relatively powerless. In a few cases, moreover, CEDAW has had a real, if limited, legal significance, when implemented by friendly jurists. I suggest that the influence of international human rights law ought to be assessed, often at least, in this broader way, looking at the role of documents in political and social movements.
   Now let's be clear, this problem is bigger than football. There has been, appropriately so, intense and widespread outrage following the release of the video showing what happened inside the elevator at the casino. But wouldn't it be productive if this collective outrage, as my colleagues have said, could be channeled to truly hear and address the long-suffering cries for help by so many women? And as they said, do something about it? Like an on-going education of men about what healthy, respectful manhood is all about.
   Consider this: According to domestic violence experts, more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners. That means that since the night of February 15th in Atlantic City [when the elevator incident occurred] more than 600 women have died.

AB  - Stable O and H isotopes and radioisotopes show that Rio Bravo water recharged prior to the construction of Elephant Butte Dam is the principal source of groundwater in the Hueco Bolson aquifer beneath Ciudad Juarez. Mixing between pre-dam and post-dam river water occurs in samples from the aquifer beneath the Rio Bravo floodplain, where finite tritium is also present. Along the flanks of the Sierra de Juarez, mixing occurs between pre-dam river water and water derived from the Sierra de Juarez. Carbon-14 content of groundwater generally decreases from northwest to southeast beneath the city; corrected residence times in city supply wells range from post-bomb to 3600 years. Sulfur isotopes in groundwater of pre-dam river water origin and anion ratios (Cl/Br and Cl/SO4) are consistent with mixing of solutes from native Hueco Bolson groundwater with river water. Stable isotopes serve to identify mixing of 9 percent or more of local water into pre-dam river-derived water. Mixing of smaller amounts of saline Hueco Bolson groundwater into river-derived groundwater can best be identified using anion ratios. The improved understanding of groundwater origins, flow paths, and quality arising from this study is crucial information for future water-supply engineering in Ciudad Juarez and for elucidating preferred pathways for contaminant movement in groundwater.

KW  - WOOD ADDITION
AB  - Engineered Log Jams (ELJs) reflect the structure and function of naturally occurring large wood jams, providing multifunctional benefits to degraded stream corridors by protecting infrastructure, enhancing habitat, and improving aesthetic qualities. A two-part experimental campaign was conducted using Froude-scale river models to evaluate in-stream hydraulic and morphodynamic effects for two ELJ types (ELJ-1 and ELJ-2) deployed in single- and multi-structure configurations. Morphodynamic responses of a movable-bed experimental channel is reported here, with channel response varying with ELJ type and spacing interval between paired ELJs. The extent of channel impacted by the introduction of ELJs is similar in most cases, while the length of opposite bank eroded ELJs is consistently greater for ELJ-1 vs. ELJ-2. An intensity score aggregating ELJ effects is also used to facilitate a comparison of ELJ effects between design-types and across the experimental configurations examined. Overall channel-bed response was amplified when ELJs were deployed at shorter spacing intervals, with adverse opposite-bank impacts increasing through the greatest interval between ELJs evaluated. Outcomes of this investigation are intended to guide the design and deployment of ELJs in rivers, including highly-constrained urban restoration scenarios requiring careful consideration of the extent, intensity, and pattern of ELJ effects before deployment.

AB  - Background
   Dengue is a re-emerging infectious disease of humans, rapidly growing from endemic areas to dengue-free regions due to favorable conditions. In recent decades, Guangzhou has again suffered from several big outbreaks of dengue; as have its neighboring cities. This study aims to examine the impact of dengue epidemics in Guangzhou, China, and to develop a predictive model for Zhongshan based on local weather conditions and Guangzhou dengue surveillance information.
   Methods
   We obtained weekly dengue case data from 1st January, 2005 to 31st December, 2014 for Guangzhou and Zhongshan city from the Chinese National Disease Surveillance Reporting System. Meteorological data was collected from the Zhongshan Weather Bureau and demographic data was collected from the Zhongshan Statistical Bureau. A negative binomial regression model with a log link function was used to analyze the relationship between weekly dengue cases in Guangzhou and Zhongshan, controlling for meteorological factors. Cross-correlation functions were applied to identify the time lags of the effect of each out-of-weather factor on weekly dengue cases. Models were validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and k-fold cross-validation.
   Results
   Our results showed that weekly dengue cases in Zhongshan were significantly associated with dengue cases in Guangzhou after the treatment of a 5 weeks prior moving average (Relative Risk (RR) = 2.016, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.845-2.203), controlling for weather factors including minimum temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall. ROC curve analysis indicated our forecasting model performed well at different prediction thresholds, with 0.969 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for a threshold of 3 cases per week, 0.957 AUC for a threshold of 2 cases per week, and 0.938 AUC for a threshold of 1 case per week. Models established during k-fold cross-validation also had considerable AUC (average 0.938-0.967). The sensitivity and specificity obtained from k-fold cross-validation was 78.83% and 92.48% respectively, with a forecasting threshold of 3 cases per week; 91.17% and 91.39%, with a threshold of 2 cases; and 85.16% and 87.25% with a threshold of 1 case. The out-of-sample prediction for the epidemics in 2014 also showed satisfactory performance.
   Conclusion
   Our study findings suggest that the occurrence of dengue outbreaks in Guangzhou could impact dengue outbreaks in Zhongshan under suitable weather conditions. Future studies should focus on developing integrated early warning systems for dengue transmission including local weather and human movement.

AB  - Objective: to analyze the discourses about the care provided by nurses operating in Specialized HIV/Aids Outpatient Services in four public institutions of the city of Fortaleza, Cear, Brazil. Method: descriptive and exploratory study with a qualitative approach, which used as a method the discourse analysis. Results: when titling the "care as negative", such title came from the analogy proposed by Freud (1912) with the photographic negative, represented by what that care can configure from the unconscious movement, since nurses did not perceive themselves in the care actions developed by supporting the work of other occupational categories, contributing to maintain the ideology of biomedicine. Conclusion: it is necessary to justify and theorize a nursing clinical practice from epistemological issues of the profession, in such a way that nurses can understand their relevance within the care provided.

AB  - This study looks at children's music making in a public setting designed for society writ large. Although known to most children in the city, the subway presents a unique environment, both structurally predictable yet sonically dynamic; it is in continuous transition. Adopting Winnicott's psychoanalytical perspective, we make a case for viewing children's spontaneous music making as a tool for comfort and engagement, specifically through the use of musical material as transitional objects and musical behaviors as transitional practices. Data were collected over three weekends on two subway lines in New York City. Seven to 10 field observers traveled in groups of two or three; each filled out a protocol form for every episode of children's music making observed, indicating musical qualities, sources, and contexts. These categorical descriptors and accompanying field notes were later used to construct more detailed qualitative narratives. With a total of 69 episodes, the authors found that music making was present in children from infancy to middle childhood (approximately age 10). Findings showed musical behaviors were influenced by adult interaction, and generated by resources in the environment. Over 81% of observed episodes contained vocal behaviors; movement occurred in almost half (48%). Musical materials were mostly invented. The most frequent function was "to comfort and entertain self," comprising over 50% of those observed, and was linked to solitary interaction. Communicating with others accounted for another third of the reports.

AB  - The Three Pagoda Fault Zone (TPFZ) is believed to have developed as a consequence of the Indian-Eurasian Collision, and is considered to originally have been a major left lateral shear zone activated during the Eocene-Oligocene. The fault zone probably reversed its movement to right lateral motion in Early Miocene, marking the opening of the Gulf of Thailand and the Central Plain. The fault zone may have had little or no slip in post mid-Miocene time before reactivation with right-lateral transpression in Pliocene to Holocene. A number of studies have suggested that only the most northwestern part of the TPFZ in Thailand is currently active. The interpretation of aeromagnetic data covering the area over Kanchanaburi and vicinity reveals distinct sets of lineaments believed to be associated with basement structure. Aeromagnetic anomalies have led us to suggest that the dextral-strike-slip movement of TPFZ may be associated with igneous intrusion occurred at the depths of approximately 1000 - 1500 m from the surface. The anomalies strongly reveal the SE-extension of the buried TPFZ path running through downtown Kanchanaburi (Tha Muang and Tha Maka Districts), parts of Ratchaburi and Nakhon Pathom Provinces, and through the southern part of the Bangkok Metropolitan region. Field studies have been carried out to preliminarily evaluate the existence of the major fault. This buried fault may become the location of future seismic activity located at or near to city centers along its path.

AB  - There is an emerging abundance of freely available high resolution (one meter or less) LIDAR data due to the advent of remote sensing, which enables wider applications of detailed flood risk modelling and analysis. Digital terrain surface data often comes in raster form, i.e., a square regular grid, and often requires conversion into a specific computational mesh for two-dimensional (2D) flood modelling that adopts triangular irregular meshes. 2D modelling of flood water movement through urban areas requires resolution of complex flow paths around buildings, which requires both high accuracy and computational efficiency. Water distribution and wastewater systems in the UK contain over 700,000 km of water distribution and sewer pipes, which represents a large risk exposure from flooding caused by sewer surcharging or distribution pipe breaks. This makes it important for utilities to understand and predict where clean or dirty water flows will be directed when they leave the system. In order to establish risk assessment many thousands of simulations may be required, calling for the most computational efficient models possible.
   Cellular Automata (CA) represents a method of running simulations based on a regular square grid, thus saving set-up time of configuring the terrain data into an irregular triangular mesh. It also offers a more uniform memory pattern for very fast modern, highly parallel hardware, such as general purpose graphical processing units (GPGPU). In this paper the performance of the CADDIES [1], a CA platform and associate flood modelling software caFloodPro, using a square regular grid and Von Neumann neighbourhood, is compared to industry standard software using triangular irregular meshes for similar resolutions. A minimum time step is used to control the computational complexity of the algorithm, which then creates a trade-off between the processing speeds of simulations and the accuracy resulting from the limitations used within the local rule to cope with relatively large time steps. This study shows that using CA based methods on regular square grids offers process speed increases in terms of 5-20 times over that of the industry standard software using irregular triangular meshes, while maintaining 98-99% flooding extent accuracy.

AB  - At the turn of the twenty-first century, a new generation of Moroccan fashion designers has started to emerge that can be distinguished from their predecessors by a radical style break. These designers no longer adhere to the idea that Moroccan fashion should be limited to a characteristic set of garments and/or decorations representing Arab-Muslim identity, but aspire an artistic freedom to conceptualise and define Moroccan fashion in an innovative, distinct and critical way. They are turning to Morocco's cultural diversity for inspiration, represented in popular culture, street styles, rural cultural heritage as well as the country's heterogeneous cultural past, including its African origins. This new generation, however, finds itself widely accused of 'not being Moroccan' by Moroccan consumers. I argue that this is due to the hegemonic construction of Moroccan national identity based on Arab-Muslim cultural heritage, dating back to the nationalist movement during the French Protectorate. What qualifies as Moroccan fashion - and especially as opposed to European fashion - in contemporary Moroccan urban society is complex and represents political, cultural and social power struggles. This style change initiated by contemporary designers not only reflects a general desire for more individual rights in relation to religious and cultural identity, but also a direct critique of the sociocultural domination of the elite. This article aims to analyse the aesthetics and politics of contemporary Moroccan fashion design and its artistic ambitions, as a way to challenge prevailing ideas of Moroccanness imposed by the ruling elite.

AB  - Norway rats are an abundant synanthropic species in urban settings and serve as reservoirs for many pathogens. Attempts to control their populations have met with little success. Recent genetic studies suggest that local populations are structured and few individuals move significant distances, but there is substantial gene flow. To understand these observations and their implications on control strategies, we genotyped 722 rats from 20 alleys in Baltimore to establish paternity for 180 embryos. Up to 88 males may have contributed to the litters. All litters were sired by 2 males, with an average of 4.9 (range 2-7) males. For dams and sires with known locations, most matings (71.7%; n=46) occurred among animals from different alleys. The average distance between sires and dams was 114 meters (range 8-352 meters). In 10/17 (58.8%) litters, the majority of the identified sires were captured in different alleys than the females. Sires were significantly less related to females than were the males captured in the females' alleys. Although rats may generally restrict their movements, either receptive females and/or breeding males engage in mate-seeking behaviors that extend beyond movement patterns at other times. This geographically extends the sizes of local populations and buffers them from the impacts of control strategies that focus on local infestations.

AB  - Weather monitoring systems, such as Doppler radars, collect a high volume of measurements with fine spatial and temporal resolutions that provide opportunities to study many convective weather events. This study examines the spatial and temporal characteristics of severe thunderstorm life cycles in central United States mainly covering Kansas, Oklahoma, and northern Texas during the warm seasons from 2010 to 2014. Thunderstorms are identified using radar reflectivity and cloud-to-ground lightning data and are tracked using a directed graph model that can represent the whole life cycle of a thunderstorm. Thunderstorms were stored in a GIS database with a number of additional thunderstorm attributes. Spatial and temporal characteristics of the thunderstorms were analyzed, including the yearly total number of thunderstorms, their monthly distribution, durations, initiation time, termination time, movement speed and direction, and the spatial distributions of thunderstorm tracks, initiations, and terminations. Results revealed that thunderstorms were most frequent across the eastern part of the study area, especially at the borders between Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Finally, thunderstorm occurrence is linked to land cover, including a comparison of thunderstorms between urban and surrounding rural areas. Results demonstrated that thunderstorms would favor forests and urban areas. This study demonstrates that advanced GIS representations and analyses for spatiotemporal events provide effective research tools to meteorological studies.

AB  - The Chinese water deer was once widely spread in Liaodong Peninsula, North China Plain and both banks of the Yangtze River and the Korean peninsula. Due to long-term environmental changes and influence of human development, its wild population in China has rapidly declined, both in abundance and distribution. As one of the native species in the history of Shanghai, Chinese water deer was introduced to Shanghai for captive breeding in 2006 and were released into the wild in 2010. The present study was conducted in Nanhui East Shoal Wildlife Sanctuary. The reintroduction of Chinese water deer was carried out separately in June and October 2010. So as to study the movement of the deer after release, 12 Chinese water deer (sex ratio 1:1) were tagged with radio-collars. We successfully used radio-telemetry to track 10 deer, and used the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and fixed kernel estimation (FKE) methods to calculate their home range. The results showed that using the MCP method, the mean home-range size of Chinese water deer was estimated to be 671 ha (range 245-1559 ha), while using the 95% FKE method, the mean was estimated to be 262 ha (range 43-435 ha). The mean home-range size of a buck was smaller than that of a doe by both MCP and FKE. The mean home-range size of an adult female was smaller than that of a subadult female. The largest seasonal home-range size (MCP, 275 ha) occurred during the winter of the first year, which then kept on shrinking in spring and summer. Home-range overlap was found among the home range of each individual. The mean overlap size was 303 ha. The mean overlap size was 135 ha in bucks, 422 ha in does and 270 ha between the buck and the doe. The study reflects that the seasonal food change is probably the main factor for the change of home-range size. Oestrus may also result in the enlargement of home range in winter. As an attempt to reintroduce large mammals to cities, we hope to provide useful experience for future wildlife management and conservation.

AB  - Avalanche is a mass movement of soil or rock down a slope under the influence of gravity (Zhou et al. 2015). The topography of Batu City has a character that can trigger landslides. Landslide disaster that occurred in the region always cause material losses and casualties. This research aims to create a map of potential hazard landslide area, identifying types of landslide, making landslide susceptibility map. Mapping of landslide hazard areas is the first step in disaster risk reduction and it is essential to do. The products of this research are landslide research report incorporating maps and a journal article. The selected research methods, that are interpretation of Landsat 7 satellite imagery of 432 band primary data causes landslides, and analyzing the soil data, interpreting of maps, and scoring variables of landslides. The ArcView 3.2 software is used in the analysis of the map. The landslide variables evaluated are: 1) soil texture, 2) soil permeability and plasticity index, 3) bedding rock slope, 4) the degree of weathering, 5) muscular density and depth of weathering, 6) existence of spring/seepage, 7) slope, and 8) presence or absence of cutting slopes. The results showed Landsat 7 imagery of bands 432 scale 1: 11.000 - 1: 15.000 objects can be interpreted such as: 1) residential, open land, 2) irrigated rice, 3) lowland, 4) upland, 4) orchard, 5) landslide slope, 6) mixed forest, 7) pine forest and 8) agroforestry forest (Stumpf, Malet, and Delacourt 2017).

AB  - For a century Missouri was a bellwether state in presidential elections, always picking the winner. Since 2008 it has been experiencing a partisan divide along urban/rural lines with President Obama losing the state twice. The battle over Medicaid expansion found a Democratic governor unable to convince a Republican legislative majority to support ACA-based expansion. The more highly partisan legislative environment has rendered traditional bargaining and negotiations impossible on the controversial question of Medicaid expansion.
   Despite supportive advocacy by hospitals and the business community, the Republican legislative leaders have opposed any movement on Medicaid expansion over the past four years. There will be a new occupant in the governor's mansion in 2017, which may create a fork in the road. Democrats are unlikely to regain a legislative majority, and one path is continued Republican refusal to consider expansion. The other path features the new governor responding to the national 2016 election outcome, and creating the prospects for a deal, perhaps around a waiver plan.

AB  - Big Data has begun to create significant impacts in urban and transport planning. This paper covers the explosion in data-driven research on cycling, most of which has occurred in the last ten years. We review the techniques, objectives and findings of a growing number of studies we have classified into three groups according to the nature of the data they are based on: GPS data (spatio-temporal data collected using the global positioning system (GPS)), live point data and journey data. We discuss the movement from small-scale GPS studies to the Big GPS' data sets held by fitness and leisure apps or specific cycling initiatives, the impact of Bike Share Programmes (BSP) on the availability of timely point data and the potential of historical journey data for trend analysis and pattern recognition. We conclude by pointing towards the possible new insights through combining these data sets with each other - and with more conventional health, socio-demographic or transport data.

AB  - Native to China and Mongolia, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) nowenjoys a worldwide distribution. While black rats and the house mouse tracked the regional development of human agricultural settlements, brown rats did not appear in Europe until the 1500s, suggesting their range expansion was a response to relatively recent increases in global trade. We inferred the global phylogeography of brown rats using 32 k SNPs, and detected 13 evolutionary clusters within five expansion routes. One cluster arose following a southward expansion into Southeast Asia. Three additional clusters arose from two independent eastward expansions: one expansion from Russia to the Aleutian Archipelago, and a second to western North America. Westward expansion resulted in the colonization of Europe from which subsequent rapid colonization of Africa, the Americas and Australasia occurred, and multiple evolutionary clusters were detected. An astonishing degree of fine-grained clustering between and within sampling sites underscored the extent to which urban heterogeneity shaped genetic structure of commensal rodents. Surprisingly, few individuals were recent migrants, suggesting that recruitment into established populations is limited. Understanding the global population structure of R. norvegicus offers novel perspectives on the forces driving the spread of zoonotic disease, and aids in development of rat eradication programmes.

AB  - Domestic cats (Felis catus) in Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island/Rakiura, were tracked to assess the potential for incursions into native forest around the township, and into Rakiura National Park c. 5 km away. During February and April 2005, 15 and 4 radio-collared cats were tracked, respectively. During a six-month period, cat-owners logged prey brought home by 11 cats. Cats were at home >90% of the time. Of the six cats that left home, movements were small: home range was between 0.05 and 16.6 ha (100% minimum convex polygon). Four cats brought prey home, comprising rats (Rattus spp.; 67% of prey items), and birds (four species, one native; 33%). Cats sampled at Halfmoon Bay were unlikely to enter the national park; however, many locations were within native forest patches, indicating that native birds within Halfmoon Bay were vulnerable to predation. The high proportion of rats caught could have benefits for native species.

In order to contribute to the next generation, offspring must survive to sexual maturity, secure a territory and find a mate.
   In this study, we explore factors influencing both offspring survival and their subsequent recruitment into the local breeding population in a long-lived urban raptor, the black sparrowhawk (Accipiter melanoleucus). Adult black sparrowhawks show discrete colour polymorphism (dark and light morphs), and in South Africa, morphs are distributed clinally with the highest proportion of dark morphs (c.75%) present in our study population on the Cape Peninsula.
   Parental morph was associated with both survival and recruitment. For survival, parental morph combination was important - with young produced by pairs of contrasting morphs having higher survival rates than young fledged from like-pairs. The association between recruitment and morph was more complex; with an interaction between male morph and breeding time, whereby recruitment of offspring from dark morph fathers was more likely when fledging earlier in the season. The opposite relationship was found for light morph fathers, with their offspring more likely to be recruited if fledged later in the season.
   This interaction may be due to differential morph-specific hunting success of fathers (males contribute most food provisioning), linked to background matching and crypsis in different weather conditions. Dark morph males may hunt more successfully in rainier and cloudier conditions, which occur more frequently earlier in the breeding season, and light morph males may be more successful later on, when weather conditions become increasingly brighter and drier. Our results reveal a complex situation whereby the family morph combination influences survival, and the father morphs specifically recruitment, revealing morph-specific benefits dependent on the timing of breeding. These empirical data are among the first to support the idea that differential fitness consequence of morph combination may explain balanced polymorphism in a vertebrate population.

AB  - Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann), an invasive termite species in Taiwan, has been a major structural pest in southwestern Taiwan. C. gestroi was recently reported to have infested living trees in a Taiwanese forest, showing its potential of becoming an invasive forest pest in Taiwan. To determine whether C. gestroi have naturalized in the forests, we monitored their dispersal flights and estimated their colony development status on the basis of their worker and soldier morphology. The results showed that mature C. gestroi colonies occurred in forest, indicating that C. gestroi has naturalized. The colony sizes of C. gestroi were estimated using a triple mark-release-recapture method. The three studied colonies contained 0.12-0.20 million individuals, which was smaller than that reported in previous studies conducted in urban environments. We speculate that C. gestroi population is suppressed by ants and another dominant termite species, Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki). Colony elimination was achieved four months after employing termite baits for controlling the three colonies of C. gestroi in forest. In summary, although C. gestroi have naturalized in Taiwan, their further expansion in the forest has likely been restricted by ants and other termite species. Termite baits can be a practical option for controlling C. gestroi in the forests.

AB  - Jogging is a relatively under-researched mobile practice with much existing literature focusing on serious' and competitive running. In this paper, we provide an account of some of the movements, meanings and experiences that together help produce the practice of jogging in the south-western English city of Plymouth. Drawing upon participant diaries and interviews, we uncover rich detail about how joggers ascribe not one but a number of meanings to their practice. Some of these are positive, some are negative; some complement each other and some compete with each other. We also consider how the experiences of joggers can be shaped by their ongoing need to develop tactics capable of enabling them to negotiate space with non-joggers. This is in some contrast to more competitive running that occurs in the separated space of an athletics track. Our sense is that better awareness of the meanings and experiences of jogging will be of value if the advertised health and sustainability benefits of the practice are to be more effectively encouraged and promoted.

AB  - Organization theorists have predominantly studied identity and organizing within the managed work organization. This frames organization as a structure within which identity work occurs, often as a means of managerial control. In our paper our contribution is to develop the concept of individuation pursued through prefigurative practices within alternative organizing to reframe this relation. We combine recent scholarship on alternative organizations and new social movements to provide a theoretical grounding for an ethnographic study of the prefigurative organizing practices and related identity work of an alternative group in a UK city. We argue that in such groups, identity, organizing and politics become a purposeful set of integrated processes aimed at the creation of new forms of life in the here and now, thus organizing is politics is identity. Our study presents a number of challenges and possibilities to scholars of organization, enabling them to extend their understanding of organization and identity in the contemporary world.

AB  - Purpose The paper studies the progressive occupancy of parking capacity along the street by candidate users, under the user equilibrium paradigm. The situation depicted typically applies to a parking peak period.
   Methods In our model, the parking supply is made up of capacitated lots situated along a spatial axis, while the demand is disaggregated continuously in both destination place and preferred time of arrival. Each user selects a parking lot and time from among options on the basis of their trade-offs between walking, driving, parking price and schedule delay. Efficient algorithms are developed and an application instance is dealt with in detail.
   Results The dynamical equilibrium pattern exhibits parking lots "efficiency regions" in the plane of destination places and preferred arrival times. These efficiency regions are dynamic market areas with strong yet simple structural characteristics, making it easy to assign each parking user to his preferred option and to derive the lot saturation times. The latter are identified as the key state variables for the parking system, since they induce the lot efficiency regions. The equilibrium state is characterized as the solution to a fixed-point problem with respect to the saturation times.
   Conclusion Our model improves upon previous parking models in economic theory, by adopting a higher resolution in space and time on both supply and demand side. The higher resolution is enabled by focusing on the street level, thus restricting the outreach of the model. Further research may be directed to extend the model to a network of streets, on the side of traffic assignment, and to study parking management policies, on the side of parking economics.

AB  - Colombia is a country located in a geographical area with great geological diversity, where every day the effects of climate change increases the probability of the failure of buried pipelines due to the movement of land or the instability associated with them. That is why the use of geometric In Line Inspection (ILI) intelligent tools with the inertial module is important for the diagnosis of structural integrity of pipelines and is associated with an integrity management program due to the geotechnical threats present throughout its path. It decreases maintenance costs due to pump stoppage for unscheduled repairs, anticipating the solution, and mitigating and controlling deformations in the pipeline caused by geotechnical ground displacements.
   OCENSA-Pipeline Central SA (Colombia) has developed, through its experience, a program to manage integrity by determining the structural expense in specific sections due to displacement of the pipeline caused by ground movement through the use of the Geometric ILI tools and MFL inertial module. This paper specifically presents the use of the tool in decision-making based on OCENSA's preset study limits for deformations in the elastic range and plastic building material of the pipeline.
   In 1997 OCENSA was among the first companies in Latin America to use Inertial Geo-positioning technology; today there are sectors which have been inspected with this technology as many as five times, in which pipe displacement of up to 5 meters has been found.
   The case study presented refers to a geographical point on the route of the pipeline located in the Andes, at the site of the movement known as the "La negra" ravine, near the town of Puente Nacional, where movements of the pipeline associated with geotechnically unstable slope conditions were detected by In line inspection (ILI) Geometric and inertial modules, beginning in 2004. Since that time, integrity management was conducted in order to reduce the chances pipeline failure will materialize in this area of geotechnical instability.

AB  - On-going excavations at the Early Bronze Age III settlement of Tell es-Safi/Gath, Israel have recovered a small assemblage of basalt ground stone objects in a residential neighbourhood. As high quality basalt is not found within the Shephelah (the Judean foothills), the occurrence of basalt artefacts at settlements in this region has frequently been cited as evidence of movement of raw material or the exchange of commodities within the southern Levant. However, only a limited number of studies have connected basalt artefacts with sources through geochemical provenance from this area of Israel. Using the geochemical fingerprints from previous studies and an XRF analysis, we attempt to identify the source of origin of nineteen basalt grinding stones using a meta-analysis of previously identified geological sources in the region and surrounding areas. The results demonstrate that the basalt artefacts originated from a wide variety of sources, including the eastern Dead Sea, Jezreel Valley, and Galilee-Golan regions, thereby supporting previously held hypotheses about the movement of basalt commodities from sources within the immediate region. No artefacts were linked to more distant sources (e.g. Egypt, Sinai). These data provide evidence that EB urban centres, such as Tell es-Safi/Gath, were socio-economically connected even for quotidian commodities to other regions of the southern Levant through some kind of system for the non-local exchange of traditionally domestic commodities.

AB  - The steep declines over the last quarter century of wild pollinators in the Southwest among native bees, monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.), hummingbirds, and nectar-feeding bats have come during a time of accelerated climate change, and are likely due to a variety of stresses interacting with climatic shifts. Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that declining availability and altered timing of floral resources along "nectar corridors" accessible to pollinators involves climatic shifts as a serious stressor that had been previously underestimated. Longitudinal studies from both urban heat islands and rural habitats in Southwestern North America suggest peak flowering of many wildflowers serving as floral resources for pollinators is occurring three to five weeks earlier in spring than a century ago, leaving "phenological gaps" in nectar resource availability for certain pollinators. To avoid the threat of what A. Dobson (Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University) and others have termed "food web collapse," a range of groups have initiated ecological restoration efforts in semi-arid zones that attempt to (a) assemble more resilient plant-pollinator food chains, and (b) hydrologically restore watercourses to ensure water scarcity will be less likely to disrupt re-assembled food chains in the face of droughts, catastrophic floods, and other correlates of global climate change. We recommend "bottom-up food chain restoration" strategies for restoring nectar corridors in protected areas on or near geopolitical and land management boundaries in all regions, but particularly in the Southwest or US-Mexico desert border states. We highlight binational and multicultural workshops facilitated to communicate about, and initiate restoration of, mutualistic relationships among plants, pollinators, and people to protected area managers on both sides of the border.

AB  - Pelabuhan Ratu area is located on the south coast of West Java. Pelabuhan Ratu area's rapid development and population growth were partly stimulated by the Indonesian Government Regulation No. 66 the year 1998 that made Pelabuhan Ratu the capital city of the district of Sukabumi. Because of this fact, it is very important to create a geological hazard mitigation plan for the area. Pelabuhan Ratu were passed by two major faults: Cimandiri fault in the western and Citarik fault in the eastern. Cimandiri fault starts from the upstream of Cimandiri River to the southern of Sukabumi and Cianjur city. While Citarik fault starts from the Citarik River until the Salak Mountain. These two faults needs to be observed closely as they are prone to cause earthquake in the area. To mitigate earthquake that is estimated will occur at Cimandiri fault or the Citarik fault, the Research Center for Geotechnology LIPI conducted research using Magnetotelluric (MT) method with artificial Phoenix MT tool to determine the cross-section resistivity of the Pelabuhan Ratu and the surrounding area. Measurements were taken at 40 points along the highway towards Jampang to Pelabuhan Ratu, and to Bandung towards Cibadak with a distance of less than 500 meters between the measuring points. Measurement results using this tool will generate AMT cross-section resistivity to a depth of 1500 meters below the surface. Cross-section resistivity measurement results showed that there was a layer of rock with about 10 Ohm-m to 1000 Ohm-m resistivity. Rocks with resistivity of 10 Ohm-m was interpreted as conductive rocks that were loose or sandstone containing water. If an earthquake to occur in this area, it will lead to a strong movement and liquefaction that will destroy buildings and potentially cause casualties in this area.

AB  - A small tetrapod footprint assemblage from the Anning Formation (Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous) at Konglongshan Town, Yunnan Province, China, contains possible swim traces attributable to theropod dinosaurs based on their tridactyl and mesaxonic pes morphology. Morphotypes are tentatively assigned to the ichnogenera Characichnos and Wintonopus, a third one is similar to Hatcherichnus. Due to the inherent variability observed in tetrapod swim tracks, the names are used here informally describing footprints that reflect a distinct trackmaker behavior rather than anatomically accurate images of the pes anatomy. Variation of the imprint shape is obviously due to extramorphological effects and does not indicate taxonomic diversity of trackmakers. Elongate, slender impressions associated with these tracks are discussed here as possible tail traces. Trackmakers were possibly buoyant and active swimming individuals touching and scratching the bottom of deeper waterbodies with the distal ends of their digits. The orientation of the traces perpendicular to preserved ripples suggest cross-current movement and activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS.

AB  - The vector species Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) was recorded in Turkey for the first time, near the Greek border, in 2011 and a high risk of expansion towards Aegean and Mediterranean coasts of Turkey was estimated. A preliminary study was planned to evaluate the possibility of creating a satellite mass rearing facility for this species and manage a larval rearing procedure by using the new mass-rearing technology proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). For this purpose, the effects of different larval densities (1, 2, 3 and 4 larvae per ml) on the preimaginal development were evaluated by observing pupal, adult and male productivity using life cycle trials. Geometric morphometric analyses were also performed to define all phenotypic differences that occurred on the wing size and shape morphology of adult stage at the four different rearing conditions tested. A high pupation productivity was obtained with a larval density of 2 larvae/ml while adult emergence ratio was not affected by the densities tested. No significant difference was observed in shape of the wings among different densities in males and females. Nevertheless, a significant difference in female's centroid sizes was observed between the treatment groups 1-2 and 3-4 larvae/ml and in males centroid size reared at 1 larvae/ml versus the other densities.

AB  - Improving bicycle safety is considered as a growing concern for two reasons. First, in the United States in recent years, about 700 cyclists were killed and about 48,000 were injured in bicycle motor vehicle crashes each year. Regarding crash location, from 2008 to 2012 in the United States, more than 30% of cyclist fatalities occurred at intersections. Furthermore, up to 16% of bicycle-related crashes were due to cyclist violations at intersections. Second, from 2000 to 2011, bicycle commuting rates in the United States has increased: by 80% in large Bicycle Friendly Cities (BFCs), by 32% in non-BFCs, and overall by 47%. Also, cycling as one of the sustainable and eco-friendly modes of transport is receiving more attention than before.
   In this paper, to investigate factors affecting cyclist behavior at signalized intersections, a naturalistic cycling experiment was designed and conducted. Applying mixed effects generalized regression analysis, movement and presence of other users were found as significant factors that influence the probability of red light violations by cyclists. Moreover, several machine learning algorithms were adopted to develop cyclist violation prediction models at signalized intersections. The violation prediction models were developed based on kinetic information of cyclists approaching the intersection. The results showed a promising performance of the prediction models in terms of high true positive rates and low false positive rates.

AB  - Frequent occurrence of religious events generates highest event based pedestrian trips in CBD area, which has been accumulated by the sidewalk, provided at both side of carriageway. However, due to uncontrolled vehicular growth, planners force to expand the main carriageway compromising width of sidewalk that affect on overall efficiency of pedestrian facility and degrade walking ability. Moreover, due to encroachment by hawkers and shopkeepers on sidewalk offer less space than that required. Hence, pedestrian share the main carriageway and it is widespread scenario in India, which cause friction to moving vehicles and endanger their safety. To understand, how pedestrian deals with offer pedestrian facility on different event days and the results compared with normal walking behavior in normal working day, the study stretch selected in CBD area of Vadodara city. The religious event of Durgashtami and Dushera of Navratri festival and one normal working day were selected for the study. The pedestrian flow data were collected through video recording technique. Further, relationship between pedestrian flow, walking speed, density, and space were developed by data extracted from video on one-minute basis. The study observed bidirectional pedestrian flow and 20% reduction in walking speed on event days than the normal working day and it should be transformed in to congestion and uncomfortable movement; results in pedestrian overrun on main carriageway up to 40% on event day and 20% on normal day. The empirical relationship between all the parameters has been developed. Based on results, the present study concludes that Level of service is higher on normal working day than event day. To improve comfort, safe movement and to prevent sharing of main carriageway, an event based TSM action in the form of prohibition of on street parking may prove effective.

AB  - Climate change is impacting water users in many sectors: water supply, farming, industry, hydropower, fishing, housing, navigation and health. Existing situations, like population growth, movement of populations from rural to urban areas, poverty and pollution can aggravate the impacts of climate change. hydropower The aim of the study is to evaluate the vulnerability of different water user groups to climate change and define communities' adaptation strategies in the Comoe River Basin. Information was collected on communities' concerns and perception on changes in climate and potential adaptation measures and strategies. Results show that 95 % of the sample in the study communities had heard of it and are aware that climate change is occurring. They have been experiencing changes in economic activity and cropping pattern, reduced water level in rivers, crop failure, delay in cropping season, new pests and diseases, food insecurity, drop in income and decline in crop yield. Results also show that communities employ various adaptation strategies including crops diversification, substitution and calendar redefinition, agroforestry, borrowing from friends and money lenders and increasing fertilizer application.

AB  - In the future urban traffic system, there will be great demands for technologies that ensure safety on the road, specifically those that monitor illegal activities, detect risks associated with the movement of vehicles, and prevent collisions. As technologies of sensor networks and the loT (Internet of Things) made strides, systems that monitor traffic violations have become automated, which led to increase in the amounts of data generated, and as such overheads may occur. Also, given encryption is used to prevent leakage of information on vehicles, in order to track a specific vehicle, data on the vehicle must be provided to the secondary user. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a model based on Attribute-Based Proxy Re-Encryption (ABPRE). The proposed system collects data from a place (edge) close to the sensor (device), and performs pre-processing or real-time processing on the data, or processes the data using a smart gateway that processes only sensor data. Such processing is done by the proxy of ABPRE, and the system is designed so that among the secondary users, only those with the specific privileges can decrypt the ciphertext.

AB  - The Kucukcekmece vertebrate locality yielded a well-preserved and diverse fauna that was the first Turkish fossil assemblage to be adequately studied by its discoverers, Ahmet Malik and Hamit Nafiz (1933) at that time geology professors at Istanbul University. Indeed, the Marmara Region, where the city of Istanbul and Kucukcekmece are located, is mostly covered of Cainozoic deposits. A review of vertebrate fossil investigations in this region reveals that since the mid-1800s several scholars discovered vertebrate fossils when they explored the region during their "voyage d'etude" in search of evidence concerning the poorly known archaeological, natural and social treasures. Many well-known explorers such as Ami Boue, Auguste Viquesnel, Petr Alexandrovich Tchihatcheff, Franz Toula and later on Nicolae Arabu and Ernest Chaput undertook these "voyages d'etudes" and they were the first to mention the sporadic occurrence of vertebrate fossils along their itineraries. Since the study of the Kucukcekmece vertebrate fauna by Malik & Nafiz (1933a, b), many other localities have been found, but only a few of them have been the subject of detailed studies. The great extent of Cainozoic deposits in this region indicates great potential for yielding rich vertebrate faunas. In addition, this region is in the transition zone between the Mediterranean and Paratethyan marine realms, on the one hand, and is at the crossroads between the major landmasses of the Old World, on the other. This particular situation is of great interest for palaeobiogeographical research as well as for the dispersal history of many ancient organisms. However, it is also the most populated part of Turkey, and consequently natural outcrops and quarries progressively disappear, being covered by factories and settlements. It is high time that palaeontological research in this region received a new impetus.

AB  - In this study, the 11 August 2012 M (w) 6.4 Ahar earthquake is investigated using the ground motion simulation based on the stochastic finite-fault model. The earthquake occurred in northwestern Iran and causing extensive damage in the city of Ahar and surrounding areas. A network consisting of 58 acceleration stations recorded the earthquake within 8-217 km of the epicenter. Strong ground motion records from six significant well-recorded stations close to the epicenter have been simulated. These stations are installed in areas which experienced significant structural damage and humanity loss during the earthquake. The simulation is carried out using the dynamic corner frequency model of rupture propagation by extended fault simulation program (EXSIM). For this purpose, the propagation features of shear-wave including value, kappa value , and soil amplification coefficients at each site are required. The kappa values are obtained from the slope of smoothed amplitude of Fourier spectra of acceleration at higher frequencies. The determined kappa values for vertical and horizontal components are 0.02 and 0.05 s, respectively. Furthermore, an anelastic attenuation parameter is derived from energy decay of a seismic wave by using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for each station. The average frequency-dependent relation estimated for the region is Moreover, the horizontal to vertical spectral ratio is applied to estimate the site effects at stations. Spectral analysis of the data indicates that the best match between the observed and simulated spectra occurs for an average stress drop of 70 bars. Finally, the simulated and observed results are compared with pseudo acceleration spectra and peak ground motions. The comparison of time series spectra shows good agreement between the observed and the simulated waveforms at frequencies of engineering interest.

AB  - This study aims at accurately presenting the structure that directed the repression of the manifestations for democracy in December 1989, while detailing the actions that took place at that time. The repressive actions occurred under the coordination of a team. They were conducted directly from Bucharest, first through the agency of party and local administration institutions, alongside units from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and of the Ministry of National Defense. Later, officials in control of the Communist Party, the Army, the Militia (as the police was called during the communist regime), the Prosecutor's Office, and the Securitate (the secret or intelligence service within the communist system) were also sent to Timisoara. On 17 December, around 4.30 pm, there was a shootout, and many people were killed and others were wounded. The repression forces occupied the city and made sure that the traces of the revolt were erased. The medical evidence was largely destroyed. Likewise, the authorities refused to engage in dialogue with the revolutionaries, as their only attempt in that respect occurred on 20 December 1989. Under such circumstances, the communist regime in Romania continued the repression until 22 December, at 12 am, when demonstrators toppled Nicolae Ceausescu from his position of power.

Therefore, we worked with some fragments of life stories of three young people engaged in cultural collective distinctive - marginal literature soiree, hip hop movement and audiovisual production - in the districts of Brasilandia and Vila Nova Cachoeirinha in the north of the city of Sao Paulo, whose we could follow through ethnographic incursions in protagonized cultural activities or in which they participate and oral history interviews. The youth subjectivities productions has been configured as a live territory marked not only by poverty and violence experiences, but, also by collective and creative productions, a brand new life style through aesthetic inventions in the periphery where the stigma of being young, negro and poor gives place to an emblem: the pride of being from the periphery. This emblematic territory is highlighted in cultural collective, particularly in Sarau Poetry Brasa and Cinescadao, two strategies of art and culture that invoke an experience resistance, transforming the experiences of violence and vulnerability that are experienced on the outskirts, in ethical, aesthetic and policies practices.

AB  - Since the first major and most recent Brazilian geological disasters triggered in 2011 in the state of Rio de Janeiro, the Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM) has started a geological and geotechnical mapping of High and Very High risk areas in targeted municipalities, on an emergency basis, by demand of the Federal Government. These areas were not only chosen by their susceptibility to geological processes, such as landslides, or by their susceptibility to hydro-meteorological phenomena, such as inundations and floods, but especially due to their historical record of different types of damage and losses, including life losses. This national mapping was due in 2015, ending a 5-year cycle of continuous effort to help mitigate and reduce risks. During the process, the most populous area of the country, the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP), was intensely studied by the CPRM and by several other research institutes in matters of geological risk. This region has an area of about 7,946.96 sq. km, comprising 39 densely urbanized municipalities, with a population of more than 20 million people living mostly on rough terrain, on geological units highly susceptible to mass movement. The fragile human occupation, living in precarious and substandard housing complexes, is also mostly located in steep terrains, putting its most vulnerable population at high risk, especially when the slopes suffer modifications without proper engineering measures, urban planning or removal of high risk buildings. 27 municipalities have been subject to these studies, which were conducted not only by the CPRM, but also by other state research institutes throughout the years. There is also the case of the city of Sao Paulo itself, which recently have been the target of a large scale geological risk mapping. In examining and assessing the available technical studies so far, it is easy to see that risk areas and sectors highlighted in different sources, using similar methodologies, have certain aspects in common, alongside physical conditions and predisposing factors that form, in fact, constraints to human use and occupation. The identifiable pattern is the typical human-made scenario of precarious settlements on susceptible geological formations, ordinarily triggering landslides mainly in cut and fill slopes. Even where the terrain susceptibility is not high, the main risks in the MASP are being triggered by human activity on precarious settlements. Apart from the current work, there is also information from local civil defence and protection units on landslide occurrences, plus field surveys by researchers' teams pointing towards this pattern of human-induced geological risk.

AB  - Pollution in estuaries is an issue of high concern for scientists, local stakeholders and authorities. Sediments have been frequently used as sentinels of chemical pollution, including metals and metalloids. The estuary of the Nerbioi-lbaizabal River was subjected to an important input of metals since the late XIXth century until about 1975. Afterwards, a significant decrease in chemical pollution has occurred due to a progressive closure of the most polluting activities and the pre-treatment of waste waters. However, a large scale civil engineering work, including a large movement of highly polluted sediments, has recently started in order to reduce the effects of floods and improve the urban image of the city. A precise description of the magnitude and geographical distribution of chemical pollution in the estuary nowadays would make feasible a future quantification of the effects derived from the above-mentioned work. With this aim, we collected sediments at about 50 sites in the inter-tidal part of the estuary in January 2009, 2010,2011 and 2014, and the concentration of fourteen elements (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, V and Zn) in the acidic extract of the samples was simultaneously measured by ICP/MS. Afterwards, geoaccumulation indexes were calculated in order to estimate the metal fraction of anthropogenic origin. The Normalized and Weighed Average Concentrations (NWAC's) were also calculated to identify areas of higher concern. Finally, the mean Effect-Range-Median quotients (mERMq's) allowed us to estimate the toxicity associated to the sediments. The results show that: i) the geographical distribution of metals is rather heterogeneous within the estuary and changes from sampling campaign to sampling campaign, ii) hotspots of metal pollution are concentrated in a few points (the surroundings of the Gobela and Galindo tributary rivers and the closed dock of Deusto in 2009,2010 and 2011, and the Abra Bay, the dock of Portu and the point where the effluent of the biggest waste water treatment plant of the area is released into the river in 2014), and most of the sediments collected in those hotspots of pollution are highly toxic, mainly due to the presence of Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu and As of anthropogenic origin.

AB  - This work explores the characteristics and the seismogenic potential of crustal faults on the overriding plate in an area of high seismic hazard associated with the occurrence of subduction earthquakes and shallow earthquakes of the overriding plate. We present the results of geomorphic, structural, and fault kinematic analyses conducted on the convergent margin between the Cocos plate and the forearc region of the overriding North American plate, within the Guerrero sector of the Mexican subduction zone. We aim to determine the active tectonic processes in the forearc region of the subduction zone, using the river network pattern, topography, and structural data. We suggest that in the studied forearc region, both strike-slip and normal crustal faults sub-parallel to the subduction zone show evidence of activity. The left-lateral offsets of the main stream courses of the largest river basins, GPS measurements, and obliquity of plate convergence along the Cocos subduction zone in the Guerrero sector suggest the activity of sub-latitudinal left-lateral strike-slip faults. Notably, the regional left-lateral strike-slip fault that offsets the Papagayo River near the town of La Venta named "La Venta Fault" shows evidence of recent activity, corroborated also by GPS measurements (4-5 mm/year of sinistral motion). Assuming that during a probable earthquake the whole mapped length of this fault would rupture, it would produce an event of maximum moment magnitude Mw = 7.7. Even though only a few focal mechanism solutions indicate a stress regime relevant for reactivation of these strike-slip structures, we hypothesize that these faults are active and suggest two probable explanations: (1) these faults are characterized by long recurrence period, i.e., beyond the instrumental record, or (2) they experience slow slip events and/or associated fault creep. The analysis of focal mechanism solutions of small magnitude earthquakes in the upper plate, for the period between 1995 and 2008, revealed that frequent normal faults, sub-parallel to the trench, could be reactivated in the current stress field related to the Cocos subduction. Moreover, these features could also be reactivated by subduction megathrust earthquakes.

TI  - Misuse of Speed-Bumps on Two-Lane Main Rural Roads. A Generalized Practice in Venezuela
T2  - XII CONGRESO DE INGENIERIA DEL TRANSPORTE

CP  - 12th Conference on Transport Engineering (CIT)
AB  - Settlements of uncontrolled population on side of road in Venezuela originate excessive use of speed-bumps to mitigate accidents. Misuse of these speed control devices generate functionality problem in the two-lane main rural roads which requires study to show its effect on level of service (LOS). Although other factors may occur (i.e., environmental problems and health), disproportionate use of speed-bumps worsens circulation quality by increase of travel-time as most sensitive parameter. This effect is difficult reverted in some places, for this reason, it should be made efforts to mitigate impact using another measure. Sub-stretches were selected according to presence of urban settlement with one or more speed-bumps and without speed-bumps, which guarantees contrast. Video cameras to detect travel-time were used in each road section and allowed measure other parameters. The travel-time distribution with or without speed-bumps and probability distribution that characterizes vehicle movement in each sub-stretch allows the simulation and modeling with ARENA software. Speed and percent time-spent following determines level of service according to Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). An analysis of cost was evaluated and may be useful in decision-making by Venezuelan Transport Institutions.

AB  - The promotion of physical activity (PA) in children and their parents requires effective planning and sometimes even interventions. This study shows the effect of PA during a 15-week intervention program "Junior for Seniors" by applying a socioecological model to the interpretation of the data. This comprehensive approach emphasizes the fact that health promotion should focus not only on intrapersonal factors but also on the multilevel factors that might be determinants and modulators of increased PA. In 2015, 24 children ("juniors," 14 girls and 10 boys, aged M = 7.96 +/- 0.69) and 22 parents (" seniors," 14 mothers aged M = 38.86 +/- 2.96 and 8 fathers aged M = 37.38 +/- 2.97) were voluntarily enrolled in a study spread across three primary schools in the city of Poznan, Poland. The effectiveness of the intervention was determined according to postintervention behavioural changes in PA in comparison to preintervention levels, as reported by the parents and children. Overall, the study found increases in PA levels and reductions in sedentary time. Although the changes are modest, there are some unrecognized benefits of the intervention which may have occurred, such as improved sport and motor skills, more frequent family social behaviours (walks, meals, and visiting relatives), or simply improved quality of "do-together" leisure time PA.

AB  - A strong East Asian cold surge (SEACS) is one of the most distinct extreme weather events that can promote an improvement in local air quality. Combining East Asian atmospheric circulation with the air pollution index (API) datasets of 47 major cities throughout mainland China in 11 winter half-years (November-March) during 2001/2002-2011/2012, we investigated the influence of 39 SEACSs in conjunction with air pollution episodes on air quality over mainland China. The results showed that SEACS can cause considerable improvement in air quality and a remarkable decrease in the API over mainland China in up to 4 days after the SEACS outbreak day. The removal efficiency of air pollutants by SEACSs was greater than 30% in north central China, eastern southwest China, and southeast China. The occurrence date of the lowest value of the local API (indicating the best local air quality) can be observed as late day by day from northwest to southeast over mainland China after the SEACS outbreak, indicating a process of gradual improvement in Chinese air quality after the SEACS outbreak. When clean cold air originating from Siberia moves southward into coastal areas of southeastern China, the increase in sea level pressure, the drop in temperature and the enhancement in the northerly wind also tend to progress gradually from north to south over SEACS-affected East Asia. Thus, the "early in the north and late in the south" feature of air quality improvement by SEACSs over mainland China results from the southward movement of cold air masses from high to low latitudes after cold surge outbreaks.

AB  - for the northern part, and 25-32 km for the central part which is coincident with the epicenter of the 1668 Tancheng earthquake. The southern part, however, is only locked from 5 km to 25 km depth. Similar to spatial distribution of the fault coupling, the slip rate deficit changes from a lower value in the northern part to a higher level in the southern part, ranging from 0. 9 mm . a(-1) to 1. 2 mm . a(-1) along the middle and southern segments of the Tanlu fault. And it gradually decreases to 0 mm . a(-1) along the dip. The seismic moment accumulation rate per unit length of the fault is high on the fault plane beneath Tancheng city; however, it is negatively correlated with the strain rate on the surface. Our results also show that tectonic deformation occurring in East China is dominated by block rotation. While most sites in East China are affected by elastic strain within blocks to some degree. However, only sites in a narrow strip (less than 50 km with velocities less than 1 mm . a(-1)) along the middle and southern segments of the Tanlu fault are affected by elastic strain loading due to fault coupling. Compared with sites on the footwall, sites on the hanging wall are affected more by strain loading due to fault coupling.

AB  - Artificial sensory disturbances (sound and light) can extend far beyond the physical footprint of human development. Nocturnal predators such as owls may be influenced by artificial sound and light, as they depend on aural and visual cues when hunting. Owl nocturnal movements may also be altered by physical changes to the landscape, as these can affect prey availability. The burrowing owl population in Canada has declined by 90% and was classified as endangered in 1995. We tracked adult male burrowing owls Athene cunicularia with GPS dataloggers, and used resource selection models to examine their night-time movement patterns in relation to human infrastructure and associated artificial light and sound. The amount of sound and light from compressor stations, oil wells, traffic, towns and buildings was calculated for each owl and random location. We found that owl night-time space use was better predicted by distance to infrastructure on the landscape than by intensity of sensory disturbance. Burrowing owls did not show a pronounced avoidance of artificial sound. Infrastructure best predicts owl space use, perhaps because associated changes to vegetation alter prey abundance and availability. While human infrastructure most influenced owl nocturnal space use, the extent to which ecosystems are impacted by artificial sound and light is becoming clearer and needs to be considered when assessing the total effect of human development on species.

AB  - This article addresses the impact of turbo-roundabouts located in urban areas on pollutant emissions using field measurements of vehicle activity data and road congestion levels. The research also compares the emissions of vehicles moving along a turbo-roundabout and a conventional multilane roundabout. Based on field measurements taken at turbo-roundabouts without curb dividers located in Grado, Spain, and multilane roundabouts in Aveiro, Portugal, three representative speed profiles for each speed trajectory were identified: no stop (I), stop once (II), and multiple stops (III). This study also develops discrete models for turbo-roundabouts and multilane roundabouts in which the relative occurrence of those speed profiles is expressed as a function of the entry and conflicting traffic flows. The vehicle specific power (VSP) methodology is then employed to estimate second-by-second pollutant emissions. This study tests the hypotheses that emissions are impacted by the differences in (1) the characteristics of speed profiles in each movement, (2) the volumes of entry and conflicting flows, (3) the overall saturation level, and (4) the transportation facility considered (turbo-roundabout / multilane roundabout). Considering the selected case studies and traffic demands, vehicles at turbo-roundabouts generated more emissions (15-22%, depending on the pollutant) than multilane conventional roundabouts, especially under medium and high congestion levels. These findings suggest that there are no advantages in implementing turboroundabouts from an environmental point of view, regardless of the traffic congestion levels.

AB  - Objective:
   Hospital readmissions impose considerable physical and psychological hardships on patients and represent a high, but possibly preventable, cost for insurers and hospitals alike. The objective of this study was to identify patient characteristics associated with 30-day readmission among persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) using a statewide administrative database and to characterize the movement of patients between facilities.
   Design:
   Retrospective cohort analysis of HIV-infected individuals in New York State using a comprehensive, all-payer database.
   Setting:
   All hospitals in New York State.
   Participants:
   HIV-infected adults admitted to a medical service in 2012. PLWH identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 diagnosis codes 042 and V08.
   Results:
   Of 23,544 index hospitalizations, 21.8% (5121) resulted in readmission. Multivariable predictors of readmission included insurance status, housing instability, psychoses, multiple comorbid chronic conditions, substance use, and past inpatient and emergency department visits. Over 30% of readmissions occurred at a different facility than that of the initial hospitalization.
   Conclusion:
   A number of patient characteristics were independently associated with hospital readmission within 30 days. Behavioral health disorders and comorbid conditions may be the strongest predictors of readmission in PLWH. Readmissions, especially those in urban areas, often result in fragmented care which may compromise the quality of care and result in harmful discontinuity of medical treatment.

CP  - 12th International Symposium on Landslides
AB  - On December 2013, the town of Montescaglioso (Basilicata, Southern Italy), located at the top of a prominent hill within a highly landslide-prone setting, was affected by reactivation of a large earth-slide along the south-western slope. The slope is formed of stiff clays, belonging to the Argille Sub-appennine formation, covered by sands and conglomerates, with these latter being chaotically dislocated into arenaceous blocks resulting from ancient gravitational processes. The sliding movement started rapidly, accordingly to eyewitness accounts, and in a time span lower than 1 hour destroyed more than 500 m of the main road connecting the town of Montescaglioso to the Province Road SP175, and involved a few warehouses, a supermarket, and private homes. Surface displacement analysis jointly with detailed field surveys, and with visual analysis of post-event terrestrial and helicopter-based photographs, carried out soon afterward the landslide activation, allowed to identify the main effects produced by the slope movement, and to compile a map of the landslide surface deformations, aimed at identifying the landslide zones characterized by different kinematical features. Both geomorphological evidences and post-event inclinometric measurements have indicated that the failure surface has presumably developed at high depths and specifically in the clay substratum. Laboratory tests have been carried out for the characterization of the mechanical behavior of the clays involved in the sliding process. Both a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional finite element analysis were carried out in order to investigate the overall failure mechanism, the factors that could have controlled the landslide triggering and the spatial directivity of the landslide movement. The modeling results are in very good agreement with the observed landslide process as regards the conditions leading to the slope reactivation and the displacement field occurred in situ and highlight the role of the slope saturation as the main triggering factor of the landslide process.

AB  - Mitrovica, northern Kosovo, is the site of some of the highest Pb concentrations reported in human populations; exemplified by Pb concentrations in scalp hair of up to 130 mu g g(-1) and widely-publicized of Pb-related ill-health and mortality amongst internally displaced populations. High human Pb burdens are accompanied by elevated concentrations of potentially harmful elements (PHEs) in soils and house dust within the city, which has a long history of mining and metallurgy. In this study enrichment-levels for PHEs in soils are quantified and compared to environmental quality guidelines and a statistically-derived estimation of background concentration. In addition, Pb isotopes (Pb-207/Pb-206, Pb-208/Pb-206) are used to characterise the isotopic signatures of potential point sources of Pb and a mixing model employed to quantify the contribution of sources to Pb present in soils, house dust, and the scalp hair of children and young people. Pb isotopic evidence suggests that Pb in surface soils and house-dust is predominantly sourced from historical deposition of Pb-containing aerosols from metal smelting, with lower contributions from wind-blown dispersal of metalliferous waste. Pb present in scalp hair is interpreted as the result of non-occupational exposure and the ingestion and/or inhalation of Pb-enriched surface soil and house dust. This study represents one of the very few instances where this type of geochemical tracing technique has been successfully applied to definitively identify the source of Pb present within biological samples. The results of this study are of particular relevance to environmental management and highlight the human health risk posed by the legacy of now inactive mining and metallurgy in addition to the challenge posed in mitigating the risk posed by diffuse soil pollution.

AB  - Environmental quality to be the basis of all activities, including tourism, makes inseparable from the phenomenon of tourism. The variety of natural environmental quality and its aesthetic appearance, constitute basic resources for tourism today, and increasingly homogenized by the process of economic globalization. Between the environment and various forms of tourism there are complex reciprocal relations, interdependence, which are often described as a "symbiosis". The purpose of this paper is to present and characterize economic activity and tourism in the area Razim-Sinoe Lagoon Complex. Will present data on population, agriculture, industry, tourism, transport and do some actual proposals on tourism potential. For these aspects we used data from the National Institute of Statistics, Department of Statistics Tulcea Strategic Plan for Sustainable Tourism Development in the Danube Delta, developed under the auspices of Tulcea County Council; Master Plan, Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, Danube Delta developed by National Institute for Research and Development. Data collected were placed in tables and processed to yield graphics that then we have interpreted and analyzed. Thus, after processing the data provided by the authorities, we conclude that: (i) The area study presents the following administrative-territorial structure: one city, Babadag, 10 communes with a total of 32 villages in the composition (including the common city of residence).(ii) The most important activity in terms of number of active local businesses is trade, with 50.83% of the total active units; (iii) Manufacturing attract the largest number of employees, 44.98%, is from this point of view, the most important activity. Manufacturing is followed in this trade indicator 19.37% and 10.38% of construction;(iv) The most representative activity is the fishing area is favorable for the development of such an activity, often combined with agrotourism.(v) The main categories of land use are the agricultural land (arable, pasture and hayfields, orchards and vineyards), forest vegetation surfaces, surfaces occupied by water, roads and railways construction;(vi) Sulfur forms prevalent in the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve phytocoenosis, covering approximately 160.000 hectares, of which 100,000 ha is monodominanta reed community.(vii) In Romania especially in geographical areas close to water highlights specific types of tourism, which is distinguished from other forms of tourism in areas with higher altitudes. In the Razim-Sinoe meet as a form of tourism: tourism heliotherapy, sports tourism, rural tourism, eco-tourism, scientific tourism, health tourism, tourism movement.

AB  - The traffic scenario in developing economies is fundamentally different from that of the developed economies. The latter is predominantly composed of passenger cars and can be aptly termed as "homogeneous'' traffic, whereas the former is composed of vehicle types with a wide variety of static and dynamic characteristics, which occupy the same right of way, resulting in an unsynchronized movement of the vehicles. Another distinguishing characteristic of this traffic is the absence of lane-discipline, resulting from the wide variation in sizes and maneuvering abilities of the vehicles. These distinctions result in some phenomena like vehicle creeping, which are absent in the homogeneous traffic. Hence, this type of traffic can be referred to as "heterogeneous disordered'' or "mixed'' traffic. A review of the literature has shown that most of the studies in such traffic make use of the methods and concepts developed for homogeneous traffic. Very few studies have attempted to capture and understand the distinctive characteristics of the mixed traffic. The primary objective of this paper is to provide a review of the studies on various mixed traffic characteristics in developing economies, identify their limitations and provide guidelines for the future research. Also, a detailed methodology of the simulation process for the mixed traffic is given, reflecting the "gap-filling'' rather than the conventional "car-following'' behavior. A comparison of the past modeling approaches is also presented and the accuracy of their implementation is discussed.

AB  - Various road surface deformations generally occur on urban and rural roads due to infrastructure, superstructure deficiencies and excessive heavy vehicle loads. In addition to driver-based errors, many accidents happen due to these mentioned surface deformations. This study aims to present lateral lane utilization and longitudinal driving behaviours on a two-lane deformed road. The effect of deformation on the tendency of drivers' lane selection, lane utilization, and the movement in traffic flow will also be determined. For this purpose, parameters such as lateral position, speed, acceleration/deceleration and location data of vehicles travelling through four different deformation zones on a two-lane road in Izmir (Turkey), were collected. Based on the fact that in ideal conditions, distribution of lateral positions of vehicles in a lane is similar to normal distribution. The collected data was evaluated with chi-square (chi(2)) goodness of fit test to see if they are fit to normal distribution or not. This study concluded that if a deformation zone has wider area and less depth, it will be less effective on lateral lane utilization of vehicles. It was also obtained from the results that variation in other parameters such as deformation type, depth and height are associated with the lateral lane utilization of drivers. Additionally, the drivers' characteristics such as perception and aggressiveness are seen as the most important factors influencing the longitudinal vehicle behaviours while passing through the deformation zones.

AB  - We model the dynamics of a variation of the Schelling model for agents described simply by a continuously distributed variable-wealth. Agent movement is not dictated by agent choice as in the classic Schelling model, but by their wealth status. Agents move to neighborhoods where their wealth is not lesser than that of some proportion of their neighbors, the threshold level. As in the case of the classic Schelling model, we find here that wealth-based segregation occurs and persists. However, introducing uncertainty into the decision to move-that is, with some probability, if agents are allowed to move even though the threshold condition is contravened-we find that even for small proportions of such disallowed moves, the dynamics no longer yield segregation but instead sharply transition into a persistent mixed wealth distribution, consistent with empirical findings of Benenson, Hatna, and Or. We investigate the nature of this sharp transformation, and find that it is because of a non-linear relationship between allowed moves (moves where threshold condition is satisfied) and disallowed moves (moves where it is not). For small increases in disallowed moves, there is a rapid corresponding increase in allowed moves (before the rate of increase tapers off and tends to zero), and it is the effect of this non-linearity on the dynamics of the system that causes the rapid transition from a segregated to a mixed wealth state. The contravention of the tolerance condition, sanctioning disallowed moves, could be interpreted as public policy interventions to drive de-segregation. Our finding therefore suggests that it might require limited, but continually implemented, public intervention-just sufficient to enable a small, persistently sustained fraction of disallowed moves so as to trigger the dynamics that drive the transformation from a segregated to mixed equilibrium.

AB  - The Middle Cambrian Zhangxia Formation, 65 km southwest of Beijing City, was deposited in an epeiric sea that extended over almost the entire North China palaeo-plate (including Korea). The depositional conditions under which the limestones were deposited are commonly considered to have been quiet, although oolites indicating current and wave activity occur fairly frequently. The presence of a large (6 m) lens of breccia, embedded in oolite, raises the question, however, how quiet the depositional conditions actually were. The lens is composed of a limestone breccia which occurs only rarely in the Zhangxia Formation, but that is common in the Late Cambrian Chaomidian Formation.
   It appears that the large lens was deposited as an entity. This does not fit the commonly presumed quiet depositional conditions of its host rock. Therefore it may be concluded that the lens was put in place by a special event. This event is interpreted to have been a form of mass movement, more particularly sliding of a consolidated but not yet completely lithified breccia mass.
   Only once such a feature has been described before from an epeiric sea, remarkably enough from the Chaomidian Formation, at a distance of several hundreds of kilometres from the present study site. Although this feature thus seems to be extremely rare, it is important as it indicates instable conditions. Such instable conditions in epeiric seas have not commonly been recognized thus far, which implies that our idea of the conditions in this environment need to be re-considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed to assess cognitive function and associated factors among school age children in Goba Town, South-Eastern Ethiopia. School based cross-sectional study was employed on 131 school children age 8-11 years. Cognitive function was assessed by Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-II) and Ravens colored progressive matrices (Raven's CPM) test. Descriptive statistics, independent t test, one way ANOVA and logistic regression were used in statistical analysis. The mean (+/- SD) score of Raven's CPM test and triangles test Was 22.02(+/- 4.79) and 15.17 (+/- 3.24) respectively. The mean (+/- SD) for short term memory measures such as word order, hand movement number recall was 15.66 (+/- 3.03), 9.09 (+/- 2.88) and 8.91 (+/- 2.19) respectively. The mean score (+/- SD) of pattern score was 9.63 (+/- 4.43). There was a statistically significant mean difference in hand movements and pattern score between those children who currently used iodized salt and non iodized salt(p< 0.05). Wealth index was associated with rovers score (P = 0.044). Breakfast consumption was statistically associated with triangles (P<0.001). Those children who had eaten breakfast less than seven days in last week had above 3 times higher odd to score RPM below average(AOR=3.05; 95% CI: 1.07-8.68). This might implicates that promotion of iodized salt intake, improving dietary diversity, improving breakfast eating habit, and improving wealth index are important modifiable factors of cognitive function.

AB  - Translocation of 'nuisance' snakes is frequently employed on a large scale in densely populated areas in order to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. However, the methods used are often applied haphazardly and are rarely evaluated, especially in tropical Asia. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of long-distance translocation on the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) in South China, where they are routinely removed from urban areas or homes and translocated into national parks. Using radio telemetry, we compared the ecology and biology of 'resident' and 'translocated' snakes to determine if long-distance translocation (>3 km) is a viable conservation option. Translocation extended the period over which predation occurred and significantly decreased survival. Translocated snakes made unidirectional movements away from points of release, yet these movements were not oriented towards points of origin and there was no evidence for homing behavior. Trans location significantly increased frequency of movements and distances-moved by female snakes, but no such differences were observed for male snakes. In contrast with resident snakes, translocated snakes did not show synchrony in the onset of brumation, and translocation appeared to negatively affect reproduction in both males and females. Our results suggest that long-distance translocation is not the best management approach to handle nuisance individuals of this species. Findings of this study can be used to prescribe improvements for current strategies to deal with nuisance snakes in Hong Kong and in the region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Invasive alien species represent a growing threat for natural systems, economy and human health. Active surveillance and responses that readily suppress newly established colonies are effective actions to mitigate the noxious consequences of biological invasions. However, when an exotic species establishes a viable population in a new area, predicting its potential spread is the most effective way to implement adequate control actions. Emerging invasive species, despite monitoring efforts, are poorly known in terms of behaviour and capacity to adapt to the new invaded range. Therefore, tools that provide information on their spread by maximising the available data, are critical.
   Methods: We apply three different approaches to model the potential distribution of an emerging invasive mosquito, Aedes koreicus, in Northeast Italy: 1) an automatic statistical approach based on information theory, 2) a statistical approach integrated with prior knowledge, and 3) a GIS physiology-based approach. Each approach possessed benefits and limitations, and the required ecological information increases on a scale from 1 to 3. We validated the model outputs using the only other known invaded area in Europe. Finally, we applied a road network analysis to the suitability surface with the highest prediction power to highlight those areas with the highest likelihood of invasion.
   Results: The GIS physiological-based model had the highest prediction power. It showed that localities currently occupied by Aedes koreicus represent only a small fraction of the potentially suitable area. Furthermore, the modelled niche included areas as high as 1500 m a.s.l., only partially overlapping with Aedes albopictus distribution.
   Conclusions: The simulated spread indicated that all of the suitable portion of the study area is at risk of invasion in a relatively short period of time if no control policies are implemented. Stochastic events may further boost the invasion process, whereas competition with Aedes albopictus may limit it. According to our analysis, some of the major cities in the study area may have already been invaded. Further monitoring is needed to confirm this finding. The developed models and maps represent valuable tools to inform policies aimed at eradicating or mitigating Aedes koreicus invasion in Northeast Italy and Central Europe.

AB  - Anthrax is a zoonotic disease that occurs naturally in wild and domestic animals but has been used by both state-sponsored programs and terrorists as a biological weapon. A Soviet industrial production facility in Sverdlovsk, USSR, proved deficient in 1979 when a plume of spores was accidentally released and resulted in one of the largest known human anthrax outbreaks. In order to understand this outbreak and others, we generated a Bacillus anthracis population genetic database based upon whole-genome analysis to identify all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a reference genome. Phylogenetic analysis has defined three major clades (A, B, and C), B and C being relatively rare compared to A. The A clade has numerous subclades, including a major polytomy named the trans-Eurasian (TEA) group. The TEA radiation is a dominant evolutionary feature of B. anthracis, with many contemporary populations having resulted from a large spatial dispersal of spores from a single source. Two autopsy specimens from the Sverdlovsk outbreak were deep sequenced to produce draft B. anthracis genomes. This allowed the phylogenetic placement of the Sverdlovsk strain into a clade with two Asian live vaccine strains, including the Russian Tsiankovskii strain. The genome was examined for evidence of drug resistance manipulation or other genetic engineering, but none was found. The Soviet Sverdlovsk strain genome is consistent with a wild-type strain from Russia that had no evidence of genetic manipulation during its industrial production. This work provides insights into the world's largest biological weapons program and provides an extensive B. anthracis phylogenetic reference.
   IMPORTANCE The 1979 Russian anthrax outbreak resulted from an industrial accident at the Soviet anthrax spore production facility in the city of Sverdlovsk. Deep genomic sequencing of two autopsy specimens generated a draft genome and phylogenetic placement of the Soviet Sverdlovsk anthrax strain. While it is known that Soviet scientists had genetically manipulated Bacillus anthracis with the potential to evade vaccine prophylaxis and antibiotic therapeutics, there was no genomic evidence of this from the Sverdlovsk production strain genome. The whole-genome SNP genotype of the Sverdlovsk strain was used to precisely identify it and its close relatives in the context of an extensive global B. anthracis strain collection. This genomic identity can now be used for forensic tracking of this weapons material on a global scale and for future anthrax investigations.

AB  - Smoke from wildfires poses a significant threat to affected communities. Prescribed burning is conducted to reduce the extent and potential damage of wildfires, but produces its own smoke threat. Planners of prescribed fires model the likely dispersion of smoke to help manage the impacts on local communities. Significant uncertainty remains about the actual smoke impact from prescribed fires, especially near the fire, and the accuracy of smoke dispersal models.
   To address this uncertainty, a detailed study of smoke dispersal was conducted for one small (52 ha) and one large (700 ha) prescribed fire near Appin in New South Wales, Australia, through the use of stationary and handheld pollution monitors, visual observations and rain radar data, and by comparing observations to predictions from an atmospheric dispersion model. The 52 ha fire produced a smoke plume about 800 m high and 9 km long. Particle concentrations (PM2.5) reached very high peak values (> 400 mu g m(-3)) and high 24 h average values (> 100 mu g m-3) at several locations next to or within similar to 500 m downwind from the fire, but low levels elsewhere. The 700 ha fire produced a much larger plume, peaking at similar to 2000 m altitude and affecting downwind areas up to 14 km away. Both peak and 24 h average PM2.5 values near the fire were lower than for the 52 ha fire, but this may be because the monitoring locations were further away from the fire. Some lofted smoke spread north against the ground-level wind direction. Smoke from this fire collapsed to the ground during the night at different times in different locations. Although it is hard to attribute particle concentrations definitively to smoke, it seems that the collapsed plume affected a huge area including the towns of Wollongong, Bargo, Oakdale, Camden and Campbelltown (similar to 1200 km(2)). PM2.5 concentrations up to 169 mu g m(-3) were recorded on the morning following the fire. The atmospheric dispersion model accurately predicted the general behaviour of both plumes in the early phases of the fires, but was poor at predicting fine-scale variation in particulate concentrations (e.g. places 500 m from the fire). The correlation between predicted and observed varied between 0 and 0.87 depending on location. The model also completely failed to predict the night-time collapse of the plume from the 700 ha fire.
   This study provides a preliminary insight into the potential for large impacts from prescribed fire smoke to NSW communities and the need for increased accuracy in smoke dispersion modelling. More research is needed to better understand when and why such impacts might occur and provide better predictions of pollution risk.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) has been reported in South Africa since the early 20th century. The disease has been controlled and confined to northern South Africa over the past 80 years by means of a well-defined boundary line, with strict control measures and movement restrictions north of this line. In 2012, the first outbreak of ASF outside the ASF control zone since 1996 occurred. The objective of this study was to evaluate the current relevance of the ASF control line as a demarcation line between endemic ASF (north) areas and ASF-free (south) area and to determine whether there was a need to realign its trajectory, given the recent outbreaks of ASF, global climate changes and urban development since the line's inception. A study of ASF determinants was conducted in an area 20 km north and 20 km south of the ASF control line, in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West and Gauteng provinces between May 2008 and September 2012. The study confirmed that warthogs, warthog burrows and the soft tick reservoir, Ornithodoros moubata, are present south of the ASF control line, but no virus or viral DNA was detected in these ticks. There appears to be an increasing trend in the diurnal maximum temperature and a decrease in humidity along the line, but the impact of these changes is uncertain. No discernible changes in minimum temperatures and average rainfall along the disease control line were observed between 1992 and 2014. Even though the reservoirs were found south of the ASF boundary line, the study concluded that there was no need to realign the trajectory of the ASF disease control line, with the exception of Limpopo Province. However, the provincial surveillance programmes for the reservoir, vector and ASF virus south of this line needs to be maintained and intensified as changing farming practices may favour the spread of ASF virus beyond the control line.

AB  - Collaborative online research offers opportunities and constraints for geographers. This article critically appraises a collaborative research process that we used to illuminate spatial and political dynamics of feminism contained within the online group 'Destroy the Joint' (DTJ). A mostly Australian initiative of over 74000 Facebook members, DTJ aims to end sexism and misogyny in multiple ways. It operates as a meeting place, discussion forum, and umbrella organisation for numerous micro-campaigns that change in response to broader social, cultural and political contexts, and occur in online and offline spaces. We formed a collaborative research agreement with the moderators of DTJ to reflect on its work, asking participants to put themselves on a map and complete a survey. Participatory GIS and survey-based research operated in the real and the more-than-real spaces that contain paradoxical possibilities. We use the term more-than-real to highlight the excesses of digital spaces: the affect that social media generates, and is generated by, characterises the more-than-real, where extremes in productive and corrosive relations can permeate. Survey results showed diverse appreciations of DTJ's multiple activist tactics (across seemingly 'superficial' and 'meaningful' interventions), and creative ideas for future campaigns. Mapping revealed both dispersed networks and urban activist concentrations. Nevertheless, after an initial peak of interest and enthusiasm for reflecting on DTJ, the reporting back of research findings to DTJ followers did not garner significant interest. This article tracks that collaborative research trajectory. Intentions to build a hybrid research collective were not realised because of how the more-than-real affords possibilities and limitations. The politics of 'giving-back' within the more-than-real are critically engaged with in this appraisal of an experimental online collaboration.

AB  - Urbanization and rapid growth in construction have led to the problems of global warming and urban heat island throughout the world. In order to reduce these problems particularly in hot and humid climatic region, a research on current level of outdoor thermal comfort and wind characteristics based on the local weather conditions around Malaysia should be conducted. This paper reports on the analysis of outdoor thermal comfort level at hottest temperatures and wind characteristics at three locations in Peninsular Malaysia by using hourly climatic data recorded by Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia). The level of outdoor thermal comfort was assessed based on the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). The results showed extreme heat stress conditions have occurred at Alor Setar, Kuantan, and Subang with UTCI values of 51.2 degrees C, 49.7 degrees C, and 49.0 degrees C respectively taking into account only temperature data from the year 2012 to 2014. However, for 20 years data from 1994 to 2014, the calculated UTCI also showed extreme heat stress conditions with their respective values of 49.6 degrees C, 43.8 degrees C, and 49.7 degrees C for Alor Setar, Kuantan, and Subang respectively. Meanwhile, the hourly mean wind speed for three years data at Alor Setar, Kuantan, and Subang, were 1.70m/s, 1.69m/s, and 1.63m/s respectively. The highest mean wind speed of 11.6m/s was observed at Subang, while no wind movement (i.e. 0m/s) was considered to be the lowest hourly wind speed for all three locations. The observed prevailing wind direction for all the three locations was from the north (0 degrees). It can be concluded that Peninsular Malaysia is generally facing extreme heat stress problem due to unfavourable climatic conditions.

AB  - During the ongoing project "Spaceborne Multiple Aperture Interferometry and Sequential Patterns Extraction Techniques for Accurate Directional Ground and Infrastructure Stability Measurements" (DGI-SAR), between : "National Institute of RD for Earth Physics" (NIRDEP) and "Terrasigna Ltd" we learned that we can deliver to local authorities, in our case the Municipality of Bucharest and Nuclear Electric Plant at Cernavoda, Romania, important information about the safety of existing buildings through satellite monitoring. These data will be delivered through the service named: "Critical Infrastructure and Seismic Movement Monitoring Service", whose organization will be presented in the paper.
   Also we shall present other aspects concerning the safety of buildings during their lifetime. On a map of Bucharest, advanced InSAR interferometric techniques help locate certain regional or local anomalies exemplified by ground uplifting or subsidence. On such a map we overlap seismic intensities, periods of oscillation of Bucharest zones during a strong earthquake which could affect the behavior of constructions of the studied zone/region. This showed us possible endangered areas during an earthquake.
   Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique gave us the possibility to find out about settelemnts of some buildings and sites. This is an important factor for integrity of buildings during their lifetime and especially when they are in seismic regions, because settlement could occur because of soft soil or other reasons in the lifetime of a construction.
   Moreover, for the first time in the SAR industry, with the launch of the Sentinel 1 Constellation in 2014 continuous spatial and temporal (every 12 days) coverage of the whole Earth is provided and the data is available directly and free of charge. This is a great opportunity to define a robust service based on this mission. First Sentinel-1 InSAR results for Bucharest City will be presented in this paper.
   The satellite monitoring of areas of interest, metropolitan and industrial, gave us data, which processed, lead to mitigation of seismic risk and discover soil movements, like settlements, during the lifetime of a construction which could endanger its safety.

AB  - Background: High-performance sport has been described as a formative environment through which athletes learn sporting skills but also develop athletic selves. Within this process, career movements related to selection for and de-selection from representative teams constitute critical moments. Further, retirement from sport can be problematic as the athletic self becomes obsolete'. This dilemma is acute in sports that demand an early entry, extreme time investments and a high risk of retirement before adulthood. Women's artistic gymnastics (WAG) is such a sport.Purpose and scope: This article considers an artistic gymnast's (Marie) experiences of movement into and out of this sport. Marie's construction and reconstruction of her athletic self when she entered gymnastics at the age of six, relocated to a different city in order to train with the national team at the age of 15, and retired from the sport one year later receives particular attention.Method and theoretical perspective: An in-depth biographical interview was conducted with Marie. Further, the first author's personal knowledge of this gymnast's career experiences was used for contextualisation. The analysis of data involved the identification of learning outcomes during her time in high-performance WAG and post-retirement. Storied accounts surrounding the key learning experiences were compiled. In order to understand Marie's learning, cultural perspective of learning developed by education scholars and the respective metaphors of learning as becoming' and horizons for action' and horizons of learning' are employed.Findings: Marie's choice of relocating to train with the national team involved her assuming a temporary orientation towards the requirements of the high-performance WAG context she entered. To achieve this, Marie suppressed the dispositions she had brought to this setting and adjusted her training philosophy, relationship with her coach, diet and socialising. Further, despite Marie intending to only momentarily adjust to the practices of the high-performance context, her learning was deep. Upon retiring from gymnastics, she could not leave the high-performance gymnastics self behind. The subsequent process to adjust to life without gymnastics was difficult and testing, and could only be realised with professional treatment.Conclusion: Learning in sport is not limited to athletic skills. Athletes' selves are formed in interaction with sporting contexts and actors. This embodiment can become durable and cause significant conflict when moving out of sport. To handle life without sport, adjustment may be challenging and lengthy.Recommendations: Sporting cultures should allow for more interactive learning and athlete diversity. Coaching practices that allow athletes to voice difficulties should be provided. Athletes should be encouraged to reflect upon their sporting experiences and upon leaving high-performance sport, should be (professionally) supported.

AB  - Toxic metal pollution of agricultural soils caused by mining activities is a serious environmental problem in many parts of the world. To establish an appropriate remediation strategy to improve soil quality, it is essential to first monitor the metals in the soil to understand their distribution and behavioral characteristics. In this study, the concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in agricultural soil near abandoned gold mine sites in a region of South Korea (Chungyang county) were analyzed. A total of seven abandoned gold mines are located in this area. In November 2014, surface soil samples were collected from 200 locations across agricultural fields in the study site. Pollution sources were investigated using various statistical techniques, including multivariate statistical analysis and Geographic Information System (GIS), and the spatial distribution of metals and metalloids was determined. The results of cluster-, principal component-, and correlation analyses, as well as descriptive statistics, indicates that the metals can be divided into two groups. Cu, Ni, and Zn are derived from natural sources related to the parent materials in which the soil developed, whereas As, Cd, and Pb are shown to originate from abandoned gold mines. The results of this study clearly show that the movement and behavior of As, Cd, and Pb are governed mostly by the specific environment of the paddy field soil. Our results also show that these elements can be transported to the agricultural fields to up to 4 km or farther away from their source mines, and affect the surrounding environment. Accordingly, the most appropriate remediation strategy for paddy field soils that are polluted by toxic metals (and arsenic) due to mining activities would be one that takes into account their characteristics, in particular the fact that both oxidizing and reducing environments occur.

AB  - Oropouche virus (OROV) is a midge-borne human pathogen with a geographic distribution in South America. OROV was first isolated in 1955, and since then, it has been known to cause recurring outbreaks of a dengue-like illness in the Amazonian regions of Brazil. OROV, however, remains one of the most poorly understood emerging viral zoonoses. Here we describe the successful recovery of infectious OROV entirely from cDNA copies of its genome and generation of OROV mutant viruses lacking either the NSm or the NSs coding region. Characterization of the recombinant viruses carried out in vitro demonstrated that the NSs protein of OROV is an interferon (IFN) antagonist as in other NSs-encoding bunyaviruses. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of the nine C-terminal amino acids of OROV NSs in IFN antagonistic activity. OROV was also found to be sensitive to IFN-gamma when cells were pretreated; however, the virus was still capable of replicating at doses as high as 10,000 U/ml of IFN-gamma, in contrast to the family prototype BUNV. We found that OROV lacking the NSm protein displayed characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus, suggesting that the NSm protein is dispensable for virus replication in the mammalian and mosquito cell lines that were tested.
   IMPORTANCE
   Oropouche virus (OROV) is a public health threat in Central and South America, where it causes periodic outbreaks of dengue-like illness. In Brazil, OROV is the second most frequent cause of arboviral febrile illness after dengue virus, and with the current rates of urban expansion, more cases of this emerging viral zoonosis could occur. To better understand the molecular biology of OROV, we have successfully rescued the virus along with mutants. We have established that the C terminus of the NSs protein is important in interferon antagonism and that the NSm protein is dispensable for virus replication in cell culture. The tools described in this paper are important in terms of understanding this important yet neglected human pathogen.

AB  - Objective: Information on the rates and predictors of polypharmacy of central nervous system medication in older people with intellectual disability is limited, despite the increased life expectancy of this group. This study examined central nervous system medication use in an older sample of people with intellectual disability.
   Methods: Data regarding demographics, psychiatric diagnoses and current medications were collected as part of a larger survey completed by carers of people with intellectual disability over the age of 40 years. Recruitment occurred predominantly via disability services across different urban and rural locations in New South Wales and Victoria. Medications were coded according to the Monthly Index of Medical Specialties central nervous system medication categories, including sedatives/hypnotics, anti-anxiety agents, antipsychotics, antidepressants, central nervous system stimulants, movement disorder medications and anticonvulsants. The Developmental Behaviour Checklist for Adults was used to assess behaviour.
   Results: Data were available for 114 people with intellectual disability. In all, 62.3% of the sample was prescribed a central nervous system medication, with 47.4% taking more than one. Of those who were medicated, 46.5% had a neurological diagnosis (a seizure disorder or Parkinson's disease) and 45.1% had a psychiatric diagnosis (an affective or psychotic disorder). Linear regression revealed that polypharmacy was predicted by the presence of neurological and psychiatric diagnosis, higher Developmental Behaviour Checklist for Adults scores and male gender.
   Conclusion: This study is the first to focus on central nervous system medication in an older sample with intellectual disability. The findings are in line with the wider literature in younger people, showing a high degree of prescription and polypharmacy. Within the sample, there seems to be adequate rationale for central nervous system medication prescription. Although these data do not indicate non-adherence to guidelines for prescribing in intellectual disability, the high rate of polypharmacy and its relationship to Developmental Behaviour Checklist for Adults scores reiterate the importance of continued medication review in older people with intellectual disability.

AB  - The main hypothesis of the paper is that cyclists tend to blame primarily car drivers, for the conflict events they have experienced with cars, but they do not have the same intention for the conflict events with pedestrians. For this purpose, 306 cyclists were interviewed through a revealed questionnaire survey and 64% revealed that they had experienced a conflict with a pedestrian whereas 55% revealed that they had experienced a conflict with a car. From the responses, two linear regression models were developed, with the perceived responsibility considered as the dependent variable.
   The cycling-pedestrian model indicated that cyclists who also have car accessibility, tend to blame primarily the pedestrians for the incidents, compared to cyclists who do not possess a car. Further, cyclists tend to give less responsibility to pedestrians for incidents occurred at sidewalks, crosswalks, etc. compare to incidents occurred at shared use paths. In addition, cyclists do not blame pedestrians for conflicts occurred primarily at sidewalks and crosswalks; places were pedestrians are considered to have the priority. Finally, cyclists aged between 55 and 64 years old, are giving.less responsibility to pedestrians for the incident, compare to cyclists aged between 25 and 39 years old.
   On the other hand, the cycling-car model showed that an illegal cyclist's movement at a road segment can reduce by half the responsibility the cyclists give to the car drivers, compare to the responsibility they give when the latter have an aggressive driving behavior. It was also found that cyclists, who tend to cycle less than 1 h, do not blame so much the car drivers for the incident, compared to cyclists that cycle for longer. Finally, cyclists who prefer the bicycle lane to be located along the road instead at the sidewalk, tend to accuse less the drivers for the incident. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article argues that a counter-conducts approach, drawing on the work of Michel Foucault, can be used to disaggregate the concept of resistance and highlight how some resistant practices work to subvert dominant ways of being. One of the features of a counter-conducts approach is an attention to the interpenetration of forms of power and resistance, governmentality and alternative modes of subjectification. Such an approach can be used to interpret forms of social protest in new ways, particularly in terms of the ways in which they facilitate or hinder ethical self-reflection and militant lives. Examples are provided from contemporary South Africa, specifically the Occupy Umlazi protest and a township youth movement known as izikhothane or pexing. In very different ways these protests are public assertions that we are not like that. As such they each challenge mainstream social values, yet they also have quite problematic implications for progressive politics and radical theorists.

AB  - Landslides are one of the most severe geological hazards, which threaten and influence the socioeconomic conditions of many countries across the globe. Many towns, road networks are at risk by these landslides and fatalities of human lives and infrastructure are very common.
   Landslides are very common in the Indian Himalayas which is geo-dynamically very active. Presence of large number of faults and lineaments make the region geologically very fragile and susceptible to landslides at any scale. Small progressive slips are often likely to occur prior to a sporadic slip. Therefore, progressive slips are investigated in order to enhance disaster prevention capabilities. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of satellite based advanced InSAR techniques, such as Small Baseline Subset and Persistent Scatterers InSAR, in order to estimate the mass movement of landslide susceptible Haridwar region.

AB  - Context The presence of large mammals on roads poses a serious risk to both the animals and motorists if collisions with vehicles occur. Fencing roads can reduce this risk, and it also limits the landscape-scale movements of animals. By also constructing fauna underpasses it may be possible to avoid collisions with vehicles, while, at the same time, allowing the natural movement of animals across the landscape.
   Aims We aimed to determine whether western grey kangaroos (Macropus fulignosus) would use fauna underpasses and to determine how this may affect their home range.
   Methods We used motion-activated infrared cameras to monitor the use of one large 8x3m arched underpass and two 0.9-m-diameter fauna underpasses over 342 days between March 2011 and March 2012. The underpasses were situated between reserves separated by a four-lane fenced highway, with one reserve surrounded by residential properties. At the same time, 20 kangaroos (10 males and 10 females) were radio-tracked to determine the size of their home range and to test whether the animals incorporated the fauna underpasses into their daily movements.
   Key results The large fauna underpass was used 3116 times by individual kangaroos in groups of up to 21 animals, whereas the two smaller underpasses were used only twice. In total, 14 of the 20 radio-collared kangaroos used the large underpass over the course of the study, but underpass use did not affect home-range size. Kangaroos that did not use the underpass had a significantly higher proportion of their home range on residential properties surrounding one of the reserves than did those kangaroos that used the underpass.
   Conclusions The use of the underpass did not affect the size of the home range of the kangaroos, but it allowed the kangaroos to access grazing areas that would have been otherwise inaccessible. Fauna underpasses allow the safe passage of kangaroos between isolated remnant vegetation patches and may reduce significantly the risks posed to motorists and kangaroos from collisions.
   Implications Fencing roads and constructing fauna underpasses is a viable solution to reducing some of the problems of managing large kangaroos in peri-urban areas.

TI  - Diet and seasonal dispersal of extralimital giraffe at Sanbona Wildlife Reserve, Little Karoo, South Africa

KW  - BEHAVIOR
AB  - South African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) have been introduced as an extralimital species to private farms in the Little Karoo on the basis of economic sustainability, and the need to create a competitive tourism product. However, little is known about the medium-to long-term impacts and ecological sustainability of such introductions. The diet of a population of giraffe on Sanbona Wildlife Reserve, near the town of Ladismith, was assessed via direct observations between January and October 2014, in order to determine their potential impact on the world's most species-rich semi-desert, the Succulent Karoo. Unlike giraffe in their native range, the Sanbona population showed seasonal preference for browse species. Acacia karroo (sweet thorn) appears to be the preferred browse species during autumn and spring, with Schotia afra being the preferred species in winter, and no significant preference being shown in summer. Giraffe also appeared to seasonally move between catchments where tree species other than A. karroo occurs, especially during winter and spring when the tributaries of the Brak River, containing mixed Acacia with S. afra (karoo boer-bean) and Euclea undulata (small-leaved guarri), were visited with increasing frequency. These results largely confirm the importance of A. karroo as the main browse species in this environment but also suggest that other species may be important components of the diet of extralimital giraffe in the Little Karoo. On farms where A. karroo is dominant, supplementary feed may be needed when A. karroo browse is unavailable due to leaf drop.
   Conservation implications: Acacia karroo was the main browse species of extralimital G. c. giraffa at Sanbona Wildlife Reserve, but it switched to S. afra during winter. This suggests that an assessment of alternative food species forms part of suitability assessments for the introduction of extralimital G. c. giraffa for areas similar to Sanbona.

AB  - Pottery is a mainstay of archaeological analysis worldwide. Often, high proportions of the pottery recovered from a given site are decorated in some manner. In northern Iroquoia, late pre-contact pottery and early contact decoration commonly occur on collars-thick bands of clay that encircle a pot and extend several centimeters down from the lip. These decorations constitute signals that conveyed information about a pot's user(s). In southern Ontario the period A. D. 1350 to 1650 witnessed substantial changes in socio-political and settlement systems that included population movement, coalescence of formerly separate communities into large villages and towns, waxing and waning of regional strife, the formation of nations, and finally the development of three confederacies that each occupied distinct, constricted areas. Social network analysis demonstrates that signaling practices changed to reflect these regional patterns. Networks become more consolidated through time ultimately resulting in a "small world" network with small degrees of separation between sites reflecting the integration of communities within and between the three confederacies.

CP  - 12th International Symposium on Landslides
AB  - In recent years Brazil has been undergoing changes in consciousness and management of natural disasters, considering the major events in 2008 and 2011. The magnitude of such events motivated the creation of Federal Law no. 12.608, which sets guidelines aimed at risk management and reduction of natural disasters in the country, with emphasis on preventive actions, such as the mapping of risk areas and geotechnical mapping. This work is part of an agreement between the Ministry of National Integration/National Secretariat of Civil Defense (MI/SEDEC) with the Federal University of Pernambuco/Group of Geotechnical Engineering regarding slopes, plains and disasters (UFPE / GEGEP). The municipality of Ipojuca in Pernambuco State (PE) was chosen as the pilot area. This municipality in recent years became one of the protagonists of the state economic scene, responsible for the second largest revenue in Pernambuco State. Alongside this growth, the town suffers from constant landslides on the occupied slopes, due to a physical and environmental setting prone to risk, and disorderly occupations. The Ruropolis community is the main representative of such a configuration. The purpose of this study is to chart the mass movement risks for a pilot area-the community Ruropolis in the municipality of Ipojuca, considering the factors associated with susceptibility and vulnerability. A methodology with reference to past experiences of susceptibility mappings by GEGEP/UFPE was developed. The vulnerability analysis was done considering two-dimensional indices: environmental and socioeconomic-cultural-physical. Environmental physical factors were obtained by observing all risk elements, such as building standards, hillside, and environmental degradation. The socioeconomic and cultural factors were obtained by interviewing residents in the study area, in order to learn the number of residents, the media used by the family, the presence of the elderly, children and disabled, social problems in the community, and other situations. Susceptibility was analyzed using indicators developed by evaluating the geological and geotechnical characteristics, geomorphology, soil science, land use and occupation. The risk was obtained by using a matrix that correlates the final degree of susceptibility and vulnerability. The risk level classification (low risk, medium risk, high risk and very high risk) was adopted. The study area is located south of the Ipojuca town center, the land area is 0.20 square kilometers, and at an average distance of 1.5 kilometers from the municipal buildings. According to IBGE (2014) the residential population in this area is approximately 7330. The study area was divided into 18 homogeneous sectors and the degree of risk was defined in these units. Sixteen sectors were defined as high risk (88% of the entire area of the sectors of the study area) and two sectors as low risk (12% of the total area of the study area sectors). Finally, it was evidenced that the form of disorderly occupation of the slopes is primarily responsible for causing landslides, the major type of movement found in the area.

AB  - El Mdaouar subcircular structure is located in the eastern Saharan Atlas ( Algeria) at 35 degrees 05' N and 4 degrees 19' 30 '' E, about 20 km southwest of the town of Bou Saada. Its diameter is about 3.2 km and shows a raised rim that stands high above the surrounding terrain. We have carried out a combining remote sensing ( Landsat 8 OLI image and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ( SRTM) data) and geological field investigation of the El Mdaouar subcircular structure in order to study its morphology and to determine its origin. In the absence of evidence of magmatism, diapirism, and impact on this structure, a tectonic deformation is the most likely in the origin of this subcircular feature. The counterclockwise rotational motion of the layers explains the morphology of the structure. This rotational motion is probably the result of a combination of the movement of the faults which pass through the structure, in particular two NE-SW strike-slip faults and a NW-SE fault, which marks the eastern limit of the El Mdaouar structure. The NE-SW trending of the structure indicates a NW-SE compressional event, which corresponds to that of the Atlasic phase. This event occurred in the Late Eocene ( 35 Ma), which is the best estimation of the age of the El Mdaouar structure.

AB  - Heavy rainfall is a severe weather occurring frequently in summer across China. It can not only bring urban waterlogging, landslides, but also cause huge losses of life and property. While it is difficult to forecast depending on the single physical parameters or only based on routine numerical weather prediction. At present the 6-hour-interval TS score of heavy rainfall is just 2. 6% in China, much lower than the scores of the wind and temperature fields, so the forecast accuracy of strong precipitation still needs to be improved. From previous research, the occurrence of heavy rainfall has a very close relationship with convective parameters. Therefore it is of particular importance to find an integrated and convenient parameter to characterize the formation mechanism of heavy rainfall.
   As the atmosphere is an organic combination of dynamic and thermal fluids, and precipitation is the result of many factors in the atmosphere, so the key of precipitation forecasting is data processing and mining strong signals from various early physical quantities. Base on the Ingredients-Based Methodology (IM), this paper introduces a new physical parameter THP (Temperature, Helicity and Precipitable water), which contains atmospheric thermodynamics, dynamics and moisture factors. Using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data (time resolution every 6 h, spatial resolution 1 degrees X1 degrees) and ground observational data in China, the THP index was diagnosed and analyzed in two heavy precipitation processes in detail. And then, the universality of THP was tested according to precipitation observational data from July 1 to August 15, 2012.
   The analysis and comparison show that the THP index can provide good direction to the distribution and the movement of summer heavy precipitation, and heavy rainfall is located in the high value area of THP. The variation of THP is ahead of changes in observational precipitation, so THP index can also give a good reference to the beginning and ending time of heavy rain. The THP value is of certain indicating significance to predication of rainfall intensity. Moreover, judging from the inspection effect, the THP index has a good applicability during summer in China mainland. Because the major affecting factors of rainstorms are considered in THP index, the stability of THP is superior to the method of using single physical parameters in forecasting analysis. And compared with some conventional physical parameters, the THP value shows a better correspondence to the precipitation rainfall area in the following 6 hours.
   The THP index can reflect the characteristic and mechanism of heavy rainfall, and the bigger of the THP value, the bigger probability of rainstorms. Therefore, as a forecaster parameter, the THP index plays a positive role in forecasting heavy rainfall. Besides, the IM method has a clearly physical meaning, and can be used more widely to forecast the locations of other disasters, such as thunderstorms, wind gusts and hail, so as to improve the forecasting level of severe convective storms.

AB  - The article continues the series of publications built on the memories of participants of the Russian Civil War (1917-1920), which complemented by synchronous documents of Soviet institutions and units of the Red Army. Psycholinguistic analysis of women's memoirs from the collections of "party archives", was conducted and it showed that for the majority of the authors was characterized by the traditional model of behavior, which, paradoxically, facilitated their involvement in political events. The women came to the Red Army, if there was already the male part of the family, in order not to fall into the hands of enemies and do not become a victim of their revenge. Among these women were few ideological; mainly "ideological" were those who participated in the revolutionary movement before 1917. Women rarely occupied combatant positions in the Red Army. They were commonly used in the services providing the front and rear (typists and other lower positions in the headquarters, cultural workers, medical personnel). The authors analyzed on the basis of archival documents underpinnings common myths about women's participation in the making and the enforcement of sentences. The authors analyzed on the basis of archival documents underlying reason widespread myths about women's participation in the making and the enforcement of sentences. On the other hand, marked, that women from the lower strata of the towns and villages were often the instigators, provokers. This behavior is explained by the fact that in the legal representation of the lower strata of society the women do not be fully responsible for their actions.

AB  - ObjectiveIt is unclear how best to go about improving child feeding practices. We studied the effect of a novel behaviour change intervention, Gerakan Rumpi Sehat (the Healthy Gossip Movement), on infant and young child feeding practices in peri-urban Indonesia.
   MethodsThe pilot intervention was designed based on the principles of a new behaviour change theory, Behaviour Centred Design (BCD). It avoided educational messaging in favour of employing emotional drivers of behaviour change, such as affiliation, nurture and disgust and used television commercials, community activations and house-to-house visits as delivery channels. The evaluation took the form of a 2-arm cluster randomised trial with a non-randomised control arm. One intervention arm received TV only, while the other received TV plus community activations. The intervention components were delivered over a 3-month period in 12 villages in each arm, each containing an average of 1300 households. There were two primary outcomes: dietary diversity of complementary food and the provision of unhealthy snacks to children aged 6-24 months.
   ResultsDietary diversity scores increased by 0.8 points in the arm exposed to TV adverts only (95% CI: 0.4-1.2) and a further 0.2 points in the arm that received both intervention components (95% CI: 0.6-1.4). In both intervention arms, there were increases in the frequency of vegetable and fruit intake. We found inconsistent evidence of an effect on unhealthy snacking.
   ConclusionThe study suggests that novel theory-driven approaches which employ emotional motivators are capable of having an effect on improving dietary diversity and the regularity of vegetable and fruit intake among children aged 6-24 months. Mass media can have a measurable effect on nutrition-related behaviour, but these effects are likely to be enhanced through complementary community activations. Changing several behaviours at once remains a challenge.
   ObjectifIl est difficile de savoir comment mieux s'y prendre pour ameliorer les pratiques d'alimentation des enfants. Nous avons etudie l'effet d'une nouvelle intervention pour le changement de comportement, Gerakan Rumpi Sehat (le Mouvement de Commerage Sain), sur les pratiques d'alimentation des nourrissons et des jeunes enfants en zone periurbaine en Indonesie.
   MethodesL'intervention pilote a ete concue sur la base des principes d'une nouvelle theorie de changement de comportement, le concept centre sur le comportement. Il evite les messages educatifs en faveur de l'emploi de guidages emotionnels pour le changement de comportement, tels que l'affiliation, encourager et degouter et l'utilisation des publicites televisees, des activations de la communaute, des visites de porte-a-porte comme canaux de livraison. L'evaluation a pris la forme d'un essai randomise par grappes a deux bras, avec un bras controle non randomise. Un bras d'intervention a recu la TV seule, tandis que l'autre a recu la TV plus des activations communautaires. Les composantes de l'intervention ont ete delivrees sur une periode de trois mois dans 12 villages dans chaque bras, contenant chacun une moyenne de 1300 menages. Il y avait deux resultats principaux: la diversite alimentaire des aliments complementaires et la fourniture de casse-croute malsain aux enfants de 6 a 24 mois.
   ResultatsLes scores de diversite alimentaire ont augmente de 0,8 points dans le bras expose aux spots TV seuls (IC95%: 0,4-1,2) et de 0,2 points supplementaire pour le groupe qui a recu les deux volets d'intervention (IC95% 0,6-1,4). Dans les deux bras d'intervention, il y avait une augmentation dans la frequence de consommation de fruits et legumes. Nous avons trouve des resultats inconsistants d'un effet sur le grignotage malsain.
   ConclusionL'etude suggere que de nouvelles approches basees sur la theorie qui emploient des motivations emotionnelles sont capables d'avoir un effet sur l'amelioration de la diversite alimentaire et la regularite de l'apport en fruits et legumes chez les enfants de 6 a 24 mois. Les medias de masse peuvent avoir un effet mesurable sur le comportement en matiere de nutrition, mais ces effets sont susceptibles d'etre renforces par des activations communautaires complementaires. La modification de plusieurs comportements a la fois reste un defi.
   ObjetivoNo esta clara cual es la mejor forma de mejorar las practicas de alimentacion infantil. Hemos estudiado el efecto de una nueva intervencion de cambio de comportamiento, Gerakan Rumpi Sehat (Movimiento de Chismorreo Saludable), sobre las practicas de alimentacion del lactante y ninos pequenos en zonas periurbanas de Indonesia.
   MetodosSe diseno una intervencion piloto basada en los principios de una nueva teoria de cambio de comportamiento, el Diseno Centrado en el Comportamiento. Evitaba el mensaje educativo en favor de utilizar factores emocionales promotores del cambio de comportamiento, tales como la afiliacion, el nutrir y el asco y usar comerciales de television, activaciones comunitarias y visitas a los hogares como canales de distribucion. La evaluacion se realizo como un ensayo aleatorizado de 2 brazos, con un brazo no aleatorizado como control. Un brazo de intervencion recibio solo la TV, mientras que el otro recibio TV mas activaciones comunitarias. Los componentes de la intervencion se entregaron a lo largo de un periodo de tres meses, en 12 poblados en cada brazo, cada uno de los cuales contenia un promedio de 1300 hogares. Habia dos resultados principales: diversidad en la dieta de alimentos complementarios y el suministro de meriendas poco saludables a los ninos con edades entre 6-24 meses.
   ResultadosLos resultados de diversidad de la dieta aumentaron en 0.8 puntos en el brazo expuesto a anuncios de TV solamente (IC 95%: 0.4-1.2) y otros 0.2 puntos en el brazo que recibio ambos componentes de la intervencion (IC 95% 0.6-1.4). En ambos brazos de intervencion hubo aumentos en la frecuencia de ingesta de vegetales y fruta. Hemos encontrado inconsistencias en la evidencia sobre un efecto en las meriendas poco saludables.
   ConclusionEl estudio sugiere que enfoques novedosos basados en la teoria que utilizan factores emocionales como promotores pueden tener un efecto en la mejora de la diversidad de la dieta y la regularidad de la ingesta de vegetales y frutas de ninos con edades entre los 6-24 meses. Los medios de comunicacion masiva pueden tener un efecto medible sobre comportamientos relacionados con la nutricion, pero estos efectos probablemente mejorarian con activaciones comunitarias complementarias. Conseguir cambiar varios comportamientos al mismo tiempo continua siendo un reto.

AB  - Over the last twenty years Mount Etna has produced more than one hundred explosive events ranging from light ash emissions to violent sub-plinian eruptions. Significant hazards arise from tephra plumes which directly threaten air traffic, and generate fallout affecting surrounding towns and infrastructures. We describe the first radar system, named VOLDORAD 2B, fully integrated into a volcano instrumental network dedicated to the continuous near-source monitoring of tephra emissions from Etna's summit craters. This 23.5 cm wavelength pulsed Doppler radar is operated in collaboration between the Observatoire de Physique du Globe de Clermont-Ferrand (OPGC) and the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Osservatorio Etneo (INGV-OE) since 2009. Probed volumes inside the fixed, northward-pointing conical beam total about 1.5 km in length, covering the summit craters which produced all recent tephra plumes. The backscattered power, related to the amount of particles crossing the beam, and particle along-beam velocities are recorded every 0.23 s, providing a proxy for the tephra mass eruption rate. Radar raw data are transmitted in real-time to the volcano monitoring center of INGV-OE in Catania and are used to automatically release alerts at onset and end of eruptive events. Processed radar parameters are also made available from the VOLDORAD database online (http://voldorad.opgc.fr/). In addition to eruptive crater discrimination by range gating, relative variations of eruption intensity can be tracked, including through overcast weather when other optical or infrared methods may fail to provide information. Short-lived dense ash emissions can be detected as illustrated for weak ash plumes from the Bocca Nuova and New South East craters in 2010. The comparison with thermal images suggests that the front mushroom of individual ash plumes holds the largest particles (coarse ash and small lapilli) and concentrations at least within the first hundred meters. For these short-lived ash plumes, the highest particle mass flux seems to occur typically within the first 10 s. We also analyze data from the first lava fountain generating an ash and lapilli plume on 12 January 2011 that initiated a series of 25 paroxysmal episodes of the New South East Crater until April 2012. We illustrate the pulsating behavior of the lava fountain and show that vertical velocities reached 250 m s(-1) (with brief peaks exceeding 300 m s(-1)), leading to mean and maximum tephra fluxes (DRE) of 185 and 318 m(3) s(-1) (with peaks exceeding 380 m(3) s(-1)) respectively, and a total volume of pyroclasts emitted during the lava fountain phase of 1.3 x 10(6) m(3). Finally, we discuss capacities and limits of the instrument, along with future work aimed at providing source term inputs to tephra dispersal models in order to improve hazard assessment and risk mitigation at Etna.

AB  - Interest on academic research about sports management has increased as well as the articles in this regard. In relation with the studies on municipal sports services, it has been observed the existence of investigations which extract results of their main structural characteristics.
   Given the progress experimented by the Andalusian community on sport matter, a study for the improvement of sports municipal services' knowledge has been carried out, trying to describe their characteristics, to examine the differences on the municipalities analysed and to provide some elements which help to interpret the obtained results.
   For this purpose, a quantitative and descriptive-transverse methodology about the main features of this municipal sport services in this region has been used. The study object are the municipal sports services of over 30,001 inhabitants of the provinces of Jaen, Cordoba, Sevilla, Granada y Almeria. Sampling is carried out with case total collection. By this way, 17 municipal sports services have been analysed through a standardized face-to-face interview, where the interviewer asks the questions according to the proposed order, showing in some cases the answers or their fields, and annotating the responses given by the surveyed. Those interviewed occupy the head of services, address and / or management or failing, the sports services coordinators.
   The tool used to collect the information was the previously validated questionnaire for Barcelona's (2011) and Girona's (2011) Deputation researches. For their application in Andalusia, we made the translation from Catalan to Castilian as well as the adaptation to the social reality of Andalusia. The following results have been analysed with the SPSS STATISTICS v. 17 for Windows software. The most relevant common features in the whole of analysed services are those referred to the way of disseminating information where many of them use the same mediums, as well as those related aspects with opinions and problems which affect to the municipal sports services. Other common aspect is the consideration of a high dependency of public funds, not reaching the desired self-financing ratio.
   However, the greatest interest lies on the differences about municipal population size. For example, towns of over 100,001 inhabitants are configured under a patronage or municipal sports institute, prevailing the indirect management in some sports facilities On the contrary, the municipal sports services on towns of less population tend to set under a Council dependent formula, establishing a smaller network of collaborations with associative and commercial fabric. Regarding the management of sports facilities, the direct management thereof is rooted.
   The previous differences on the structures have their reflection on the expressed opinions about culture and services and problems which affect them. A greater adaptation capacity to the marked demands are observed in the municipalities of higher population. These accuse in higher degree the produced consequences by the temporality of the political office. Nevertheless, a larger number of less population towns conceive the lack of staff as a service management problem.
   As means of conclusion, it is noted that the municipalities of higher size, unlike the towns of lesser population, have adopted further forms of indirect management, and they also count with other sports system agents to develop their programs. The interpretation made about it is that they have more developed sports systems. Likewise, the hegemonic social image of the state (in our case of municipalities) has been changing to a less central and more cooperative or subsidiary role. Thus they resemble to companies that have a more consolidated third sector, as the countries of central and northern Europe.

AB  - The Yushu M(s)7. 1 earthquake occurred on April 14th, 2010 in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, China. The seismic event ruptured the Yushu segment of the pre-existing Garze-Yushu fault. We established 15 GPS stations over 7-10 days following the earthquake, which constituted a 360 km long transection across the rupture trace, encompassing 1 continuously operating, 3 semi-continuous and 11 survey-mode sites. Most of the sites were observed for more than 240 days to capture the spatiotemporal changes of postseismic deformation. The secular deformation of the 15 sites was corrected using Euler vectors and a dislocation model. A layered visco-elastic dislocation model was employed to calculate aftershock induced deformation, showing that aftershocks contributed considerably to the deformation of near-field sites. A logarithmic function was used to fit the post-seismic displacements, yielding a characteristic decay parameter of 6. 7 +/- 1. 2 days. The Steepest Decrease Method of optimization was employed to invert for spatiotemporal changes of afterslip. Afterslip was found mostly at the northwestern and southeastern flanks of coseismic slip. The afterslip patch at the northwestern flank almost reaches the surface, and the other one being directly beneath the major cosesimic slip patch. Maximum afterslip is located at 10 similar to 20 km depth range southeast of Gyegu town. With the time lapse after the mainshock, the 2 domains of major afterslip were stationary in space, but their area was significantly increased. The moment released by the afterslip is (1. 5 similar to 5. 1) X 10(18) Nm, equivalent to an earthquake of M(w)6. 1 similar to 6. 4. Deformation due to poroelastic rebound cannot explain the observed surface deformation. The contribution to observed postseismic deformation from relaxation of lower crust and upper mantle is not significant, calculated using a Maxwell visco-elastic model. The rapid decay of postseismic deformation and the good fit of the after slip model suggest that the dominant source in the early stage of postseismic process is most likely ascribed to afterslip.

AB  - The greatest earthquake in the modern history of Japan and probably the fourth greatest in the last 100 years in the world occurred on March 11, 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku. Large tsunami and ground motions caused severe damage in wide areas, particularly many towns along the Pacific coast. So far, gravity change caused by such a great earthquake has been reported for the 1964 Alaska and the 2010 Maule events. However, the spatial-temporal resolution of the gravity data for these cases is insufficient to depict a co-seismic gravity field variation in a spatial scale of a plate subduction zone. Here, we report an unequivocal co-seismic gravity change over the Japanese Island, obtained from a hybrid gravity observation (combined absolute and relative gravity measurements). The time interval of the observation before and after the earthquake is within 1 year at almost all the observed sites, including 13 absolute and 16 relative measurement sites, which deduced tectonic and environmental contributions to the gravity change. The observed gravity agrees well with the result calculated by a dislocation theory based on a self-gravitating and layered spherical earth model. In this computation, a co-seismic slip distribution is determined by an inversion of Global Positioning System (GPS) data. Of particular interest is that the observed gravity change in some area is negative where a remarkable subsidence is observed by GPS, which can not be explained by simple vertical movement of the crust. This indicated that the mass redistribution in the underground affects the gravity change. This result supports the result that Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites detected a crustal dilatation due to the 2004 Sumatra earthquake by the terrestrial observation with a higher spatial and temporal resolution.

TI  - NEWS FROM SPAIN AS SEEN FROM ITALY
T2  - RA-REVISTA DE ARQUITECTURA
LA  - Spanish
AB  - The debt that the Spanish architecture owes to the Italian one has often been a subject of discussion. From the fifties to the eighties, generations of Spanish architects trained themselves by examining the projects of architects such as Luigi Moretti, Ignazio Gardella, Franco Albini and Aldo Rossi and by reading Zevi and Tafuri, as well as magazines such as Casabella, Domus and Lotus. This fact has been reasserted repeatedly by Oriol Bohigas and especially by Rafael Moneo who wrote, "I remember that the Italian books were our gateway to modern architecture. The texts by Bruno Zevi and Giulio Carlo Argan, which we read thanks to some Argentinian translations, have to be mentioned, given the influence they had on us. Zevi made us dream of an architecture that reached the fullness of the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, whereas Argan made us dream of the promised paradise of the avant- gardes. The panorama described by the Italian critics brought us into a world that was over our boundaries, and gave us an outlook on architecture considerably different from the one we had in our country which, given the situation, might have been considered as insular". These observations by Moneo should give us pause. After the Second World War, the Italian architecture, almost as in an attempt to distance itself from the fascist regime, entered an eclectic season, in which the language of the Modern Movement was manipulated, occasionally with some audacity. These manipulations produced some syncretic works, elitist and popular, simultaneously rigorous and eccentric, that consciously or unconsciously attempted to make peace with history, an attempt that characterized the postmodern season. An eclecticism and syncretism typical of a latecomer country, one that entered modernity late and that, because of it, organized its own resources in a heterodox manner by experimenting with new modes of expression, which resulted in considerable breaks from the canons of advanced modernity. Indeed, it is exactly this syncretic eclecticism, contradictory yet thriving, that attracted the Spanish architects of the generation of Moneo and of the previous one, as they perceived it as an alternative to the modernist orthodoxy that, until a short time before with GATEPAC and JosepLluis Sert, characterized the Spanish architecture. Hence, the renewed relation with history shown by the Italians attracted the Spanish during these years. With regard to that, Moneo noted that " The ambition to use history as the foundation for architectural knowledge was a revelation for me. It was an interesting time for studies on the history of architecture. an architecture that was aware of how its own evolution occurred and that, consequently, was respectful of the past, thus becoming a methodological alternative to the purist rigorism of the Modern Movement". So, history as a method, as an antidote to superficial professionalism and as an instrument to keep urban planning and architecture together, a message that came from Italy in different ways and with different implications: on the one hand the history of Bruno Zevi, practical, adaptable to the contemporary time and not self- congratulatory, on the other hand the history of Manfredo Tafuri, philological and focused on reconstructing the conditions in which a work was conceived and realized.
   What might be defined as the separation from Italy, or at least as a reduction of the Spanish dependence on Italy, began during the first years of the seventies. Starting from 1969, the political and social situation in Italy got progressively worse: the radicalism that, at the end of the sixties, was the expression of a desire to voice the needs of a profoundly changed society began transforming into political disputes, aimed at overthrowing the post- war political balances. Consequently, the image of Italy as perceived from Spain changed completely. Indeed, Moneo wrote " Italy stopped being the paradise that fascinated us and become a true ideological battleground". Pier Vittorio Aureli, reminiscing of these years, noted that two most successful expressions of the Italian architecture of that age, the radical Supertudio and Archizoom and Giorgio Grassi's and Aldo Rossi's Tendenza, were two alternatives of the diaspora of the Italian Left of these years which, after having conquered the hegemony on national culture, split between, on the one hand, laborusim and unionism and the orthodoxy still connected to the Communist Party on the other. The shared belief that architecture was to testify the commitment to overthrowing the system and to be a message against the bourgeois individualism was the glue that kept everything together. The case of Manfredo Tafuri, the most authoritative critic of that period, is paradigmatic. While Zevi had always operated in a reformist context, Tafuri, initially following Lukacs and then Barthes, radicalized his thought. The result is what will be called a critique of ideology, that is, an action that was to go beyond language to gather the political and social elements that, according to the Marxist Tafuri, stir society and above all class struggle from below. Ignasi de Sola-morales, one of the most attentive and acute commentators of Tafuri, understood the contribution of Tafuri's critique to opening new horizons in the evaluation of an architectural work, but he also understood - as Zevi before him-that through Tafuri, an exasperated critical deconstruction turned into an increasingly sterile aggressive nihilism. Indeed, Morales wrote that "with Tafuri, the separation between the practice of architecture and the practice of critique becomes an axiom: morality was to be guaranteed by independence from practice (...) but the disappearance of militant critique, replaced by radical critique and the specialization of branches such as history of architecture eventually led this culture to detach from the actual transformation phenomena". Although Moreno admired Tafuri, he spent some even harsher words as he wrote " therefore, the scornful judgments Tafuri reserved to the attempts of those architects who were fighting to achieve personal forms of expression are hardly surprising: they always fell for the traps laid for them by the power-that-be and consequently talking about architecture almost did not make any sense. The role of the critic was therefore that of unveiling that predicament, rather than singing the praises of the architects at the service of power. Architecture, as understood by the previous critics, was no longer of interest. That was tantamount to announcing its imminent disappearance".
   In less than ten years, the ideological conflict became so exacerbated a desire to find a diversion started spreading in the Italian society, a desire to exorcize the ideology of conflict and to replace it with an opposite one, that of losir, of the flaunted entertainment. Paolo Portoghesi, who cleverly understood the depth of the ongoing change, consecrated postmodern hedonism by curating a show aptly named " The presence of the past" in 1980. From that moment onward a generation of architects, that until recently had been busy implementing some more or less radical political intentions, began designing by increasingly exasperating an historicist formalism that finds its privileged place of expression in the practice of drawing, almost forgetting the practice of building, perceived the latter as inferior to the artistic one. " With the Tide Ebbing of its Success" is the title of an article wrote at the end of the eighties by Franco Purini, in which he briefly summarized the postmodern era, whose ebbing left national architecture exhausted, stunned by the fast metamorphosis of radical commitment into an equally radical hedonism. The prevailing feeling in Italy during these years -and not only with regard to matters related to architecture-was that of having gone too far, in an area in which ideological prejudices first and then narcissism undermined once and for all the blooming eclecticism, one that thrived on complexity and contradictions, which characterized the Italian architecture and that fascinated Bohigas and Moneo. The price paid for what, on reflection, appears to be a real case of cupio dissolvi, was twofold: on the one hand, the disappearance of that technical wisdom, that mastery that characterized the works of Gardella, Moretti, Albini, Valle and, on the other hand, the problems encountered in capitalizing the subsequent theoretical effort.
   At the turn of the eighties, some of the works made by Spanish architects started being published in Italy. The prologue can be found in the Biennale curated by Portoghesi, as among the many works that exalted the presence of the past in a somehow superficial manner, Tusquets's and Clotet's villa in Pantelleria (1975) -an isle in the extreme south of Italy-stood out. The villa is one of the most fascinating projects seen at a successful Biennale, which had very few valid projects, though. Tusquets and Clotet certainly evoke history with their naked columns towering toward the sky and actually, they even tell us how to look at it -with the eyes of romantic artists enamoured of ruins-, yet their villa is characterized by some soundness, some attention to tectonics that was far from the scenographic exhalations supported by Portoghesi. This tectonic soundness, which is proof of a desire to resist reducing architecture to an image is the element that, at the turn of eighties, characterized the works of Cruz, Viaplana and Pion, Lapea and Torres and Moneo: these are some moderately postmodern works, sober and linear, more attentive to finding their own place in their context than to exalting their own appearance. Works that, generally speaking, are characterized by a practical reasonableness that is able to intervene where the Italians seemed to have failed, namely in urban planning. The new Barcelona that was getting ready to host the 1992 Olympics was perceived by the Italian architects as a model to imitate. Bohigas and a large number of architects who followed him abandoned any radicalism and started working on a series of attentive minor interventions: their attention is often focused on external public spaces, the ones that were forgotten by the city architecture supported by the Italian architects. Not only did the results start to be appreciated, they were also envied as they showed a realism that was more frequently invoked than pursued by the Italian architects, and they were also proof of the capacity of modern language to communicate better that postmodern historicism. The fact that the Italian architects, from the beginning of the nineties, turned their back to iconic postmodernism, is also due to the lesson that comes from Spain and it is no accident that the competition for the new Palazzo del Cinema of Venice in 1991 was won by Rafael Moneo, who prevailed over Carlo Aymonino, Aldo Rossi and Mario Botta, who suddenly appeared to have grown old, thus becoming memories of a waning era.
   Two Spanish works of the second half of the eighties and an architect of the following decade struck the imagination of an otherwise stalling Italian architecture. The first one is Rafael Moneo's Merida Museum, in which the principle of repeating large Roman masonry infrastructures is adopted with a certain veracity, without any scenographic pretense. The lateral fronts, together with a sequence of masonry bastions, configure an almost anonymous faoade, devoid of any scenographic pretense and the internal fair-face concrete floors made sure this work would not slip into historicist redundancy, by proposing a wise mediation between ancient and modern construction. The second one is Juan Navarro Baldeweg's Palace of Congresses and Exhibitions of Castilla y Leon in Salamanca (1985-1992), a work that, at first sight, might be considered entirely " Italian". Indeed, in Salamanca we find again the attention to the pre-existing environmental elements theorized by Ernesto Nathan Rogers, as well as the notion of establishing a dialogue with the historical context through the sober minimalism of Giorgio Grassi; by examining both the arrangement of the two volumes and the manner in which they define the calibrated internal square contained between them, we can find evidence of that attention in the manner in which these buildings blend their presence with the orography and the open spaces, theorized by Vittorio Gregotti with a precision that is inversely proportional to the capacity of achieving it. These two works by Moneo and Baldeweg are indebted to the Italian architecture, but they might also be understood as subtle critique to it, with regard to two key matters. The first one is inherent in the character of Italians, namely their tendency to spectacularize everything, to elevate theatre as the ideal set for their actions. During the fifties, with the irreverent causticity the distinguished him, Leo Longanesi stated that " our stations are only useful to those who are not departing and to those who wish to see them in a postcard: [those stations] are great sceneries, great civic trophies for our State. Our post offices, our government buildings, our banks, our hotels are merely theatrical scenes. Styles are fading away: baroque in concrete, then floral, then rational: embellishments are changing, columns and capitals are disappearing, the windows are first contracting then expanding; concrete and glass are appearing, ornate is disappearing and the polished marble of rational logic is shining, but the reign of theatrical scenes nonetheless survives". Let us consider, for instance, two works such as Aldo Rossi's Il Palazzo in Fukoka and Giorgio Grassi's Theatre of Sagunto: these two works perfectly exemplify the aforementioned statement by Longanesi, according to which everything is sacrificed in order to configure some theatrical scenes that, by the way, are very fascinating. A sacrifice that reaches a paradoxical peak in Rossi's building, whose main faoade is devoid of any opening, in order to make it as monumental as possible. The second characteristic of the Italian architecture -especially the one of the seventies-that the Spanish architects studiously avoided importing is its didactic -if not didascalic-character, almost an ideology according to which any work has to be a paradigmatic, materialized expression of its underlying theoretical concepts.
   Let us consider, for instance, Vittorio Gregotti, one of the most paradigmatic and pedagogic Italian architects, and let us compare one of his works, such as the Bicocca in Milan, with a Spanish building that was built just a few years later and that owes a lot to his urban theories, namely Rafael Moneo's and Manuel de Sola-Morales's building in the Avenida Diagonal. While Gregotti's work is more similar to a model of architecture than to a true architecture -a choice that necessarily makes it look schematic-Moneo and Sola-Morales did not wish their work in the Diagonal to become a paradigmatic building, but if anything, an emblematic one. Although its urban impact is not lesser than the one of the Bicocca, the block in the Diagonal is definitely not a diagram transposed into a building: indeed, the rear side of that block seems to articulate its presence by toning down the iconic impact of its main front through an organicism that seems inspired by Alvar Aalto, an architect that -as it is well knownconsiderably influenced the Spanish architecture. The quality of construction is also evidently different in these two buildings, a difference that deeply embarrassed the Italian architects of the nineties, so much so that the generations that came after the nineties attempted to remediate that embarrassment by focusing on construction and, in an attempt to do that, they took inspiration from the works of some Spanish architects such as Abalos and Herreros, Carlos Ferrater, Vopzquez Consuegra, Francisco Mangado, Mansilla and Tupn.

AB  - The world's greatest deposit of gold is hosted by the Archaean Witwatersrand sedimentary basin, situated in the central portion of the Kaapvaal Craton of South Africa. The geological setting of this remarkable clastic sedimentary deposit, which has yielded more than one third of all the gold ever produced on the planet, is discussed. The stratigraphy and structure of the Witwatersrand Supergroup is reviewed together with the sedimentology, mineralogy and geochronology of the more important auriferous conglomerate (reef) horizons. Geophysical methods of exploration are discussed briefly.
   The Witwatersrand Basin was formed in response to a series of crustal plate movements from the north and west in a foreland basin setting. Deposition commenced in a shallow marine environment with quartzite and shale, including prominent iron rich shale horizons forming the West Rand Group (WRG). The overlying dominantly arenaceous Central Rand Group (CRG) was deposited in a basin which regressed as it filled. Important gold deposits formed on braided fluvial plains which sometimes terminated in a shoreline. Gold reefs at the base of the CRG show evidence of later marine reworking. Higher in the sequence, fluvial deposits become dominant. The focus of this paper is the Central Rand Group where most of the gold mineralisation occurs. Detrital gold (largely within sulphides) and uranium (as uraninite) were originally concentrated along with placer minerals such as chromite and zircon, at the base of fluvial cycles. In addition to the placer mineralisation, prokaryotic bacteria flourished and provided carbon-rich material that was highly effective in the concentration of non-detrital gold. Although most of the lithologies, including reef horizons, have great continuity and can be correlated across much of the Witwatersrand Basin, discrete entry points of reef material, with distributary channels and associated ore shoots, can generally be clearly defined.
   Three major events reshaped and metamorphosed the Witwatersrand. Lateral crustal plate movements caused severe faulting and folding, especially along the western and northern sides of the Basin. The second event was the catastrophic Vredefort meteorite impact which struck the centre of the basin. The resulting fluid movement which pervaded the Witwatersrand strata caused widespread metasomatic alteration. Localised alteration and remobilisation of the gold mineralisation is thought to have been in partial response to this event. The third major event was the emplacement of the Bushveld Complex, which is the largest layered igneous intrusion of its kind on Earth. The heat generated by this intrusion certainly exceeded that of the Vredefort event, also making it an important agent of mineral alteration and remobilisation, especially along the northern flank.
   The "Great Debate" on the origin of the gold has been the subject of heated discussions for decades. The three main points of view are a placer source, a hydrothermal source and a combination of the two called the modified placer theory. Recognition of the problem was realised soon after the discovery of the gold and continues to this day. Evidence has been presented in favour of all arguments, lending more credence for the modified placer process. Although the Witwatersrand is a mature goldfield with declining production, it is estimated that it still contains six times more gold than the world's second largest goldfield. Much of the remaining resource occurs at considerable depths; however, there are still opportunities for extracting some of this resource, as well as generally somewhat lower grade mineralisation, at moderate to shallow depth. The Basin thus remains a major exploration target.
   Gold mining in the Witwatersrand Basin has been responsible for the creation of the metropolis of Johannesburg and many thriving mining towns and has had a major influence in the shaping of South Africa. It still plays an important role in the country's economy.
