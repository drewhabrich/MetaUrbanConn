AB  - Green roofs and walls have recently emerged as conservation tools, and they offer promising additional opportunities to enhance biodiversity in cities. However, their ecological conditions remain poorly considered when planning wildlife corridors. To discuss the role of vegetated buildings in landscape connectivity, we reviewed the ecological and technical specificities of green walls and green roofs in light of the key factors concerning urban wildlife (patch size, quality, abundance, and isolation). Green roofs and walls show limited patch sizes, distinct habitat quality at the building scale, and limited redundancy of patch quality within the landscape. We also highlight that the abundance of roof and wall patches is often low. Future research is needed to establish if walls can be vertical corridors for wildlife, thereby reducing the isolation of green roofs. We argue that creating 3D ecological connectivity within the city requires substantial modifications of the design and maintenance of existing green building systems. We suggest that research is needed to integrate the biotic and abiotic characteristics of green buildings to make them more closely resemble those of open green spaces.

AB  - Urban riparian corridors have the capacity to maintain high levels of bird abundance and biodiversity. How riparian corridors in cities are used by waterbirds has received relatively little focus in urban bird studies. The principal objective of our study was to determine how habitat and landscape elements affect waterbird biodiversity in an arid city. We surveyed 36 transects stratified across a gradient of urbanization and water availability along the Salt River, a riparian corridor that is monitored as part of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research study system located in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Habitat and landscape variables were reduced via Principal Component Analysis to be used in a constrained ordination that identified waterbird community composition patterns, and then used to model the responses of guild abundance and diversity. Habitat and landscape components from the constrained ordination explained 39% of the variation in the waterbird community. Land use components were related to the suite of species at each site, but had a weaker relationship to guild abundance or diversity. Habitat-level components (water physiognomy, shoreline composition, and terrestrial vegetation cover) were more important in predicting both guild abundance and diversity. We found that water physiognomy was the strongest driver shaping waterbird community parameters. The implications of our study are relevant to urban planning in arid cities, offering the opportunity to design and improve wildlife habitat while providing other important public amenities.

AB  - Maintaining biodiversity in urban landscapes requires a well-functioning green infrastructure for the landscape to remain ecologically functional. However, city planners often lack knowledge to identify how well different parts of the green infrastructure are connected, and tools to estimate the accessibility to important habitats for different species in urban areas are strongly needed. We compared the ability of three measures of available food resources, with increasing complexity, for explaining species richness and abundance of bees and wasps at 23 locations in an urban landscape in Sweden. Specifically, we tested (1) the summed amount of food habitat within a buffer circle, (2) the amount of food habitat weighted by distance, and (3) the summed amount of food habitat within an area created by cost-weighted distance based on the surrounding landscape friction. We tested two spatial scales (200 and 400 m). The results show that both the summed (1) and the weighted measures (2) were very poor in explaining species richness and abundance regardless of spatial scale, while we found significant relationships for both species richness and abundance with the friction-based measure (3) at both scales. For the friction-based measure, the relationships with both response variables were strongest at the smallest spatial scale (200 m). We conclude that bees and wasps are sensitive to barriers such as large roads and built-up areas when foraging in urban environments. This is important to consider when assessing the functionality of urban green infrastructure in order to not overestimate the available amount of habitat and how well different parts of the landscape are connected for these important pollinators.

AB  - The scarcity of green areas in urban landscapes hinders connectivity among sites reducing the flux of organisms and seed dispersal. Ramphastos toco is an effective plant disperser in tropical landscapes, playing an important role in conserving plant connectivity. In this study we combined two methods of landscape connectivity analysis, in a way not yet explored, to assess the potential contribution of Ramphastos toco to enhancing connectivity among urban vegetation patches. We used spatial modeling techniques to evaluate least cost routes, or those that facilitate bird movement through green urban areas, in Belo Horizonte, a city in Southeast Brazil. We also assessed the relative importance of forest patches for conserving both bird and seed dispersal fluxes using the integral index of connectivity. The resulting least cost route of greater accessibility for the species included in its course an important forest patch under environmental licensing for the construction of a residential condominium. The number of green urban areas covered by forest, of highest habitat quality for the species, summed to 155 patches. Of this total only 5.2% were relevant for regional connectivity, while the four most important patches are targeted by the city's expansion plans. Ramphastos toco is an effective connector for tropical green urban areas given its adaptability, wide range of movement and seed dispersal effectiveness. We emphasize the need for incorporating ecological knowledge and the prioritization of green areas into city planning, since current expansion projects jeopardize forest patches that are crucial to the functional connectivity of the urban landscape.

AB  - University campuses often contain contiguous areas of urban green space (UGS) which are otherwise scarce in large cities and, thus, may provide critical habitat for numerous species. In this study, we evaluate butterfly and plant diversity at Chiba University in Japan from five UGS types, including intensive green roofs, meadows, roadsides, open spaces. and community gardens. Surveying non-destructively every two weeks from June to November 2010, we identified 707 individual butterflies to 25 species from five families, including red-listed species (e.g. Parantica sita Kollar, 1844). However, one species, Pseudozizeeria maha Kollar, 1848, represented over 50% of all individuals surveyed. Butterflies in the family Papilionidae showed strong preference for roadside habitat, indicating the importance of 'butterfly flyways' and contiguous habitat corridors on University campuses. Butterfly richness and abundance was significantly different between UGS types and highest in the community garden and roadsides. We recorded 70 garden plant species and 117 spontaneous plant species (which grew opportunistically, without design input), of which 58% were native. Total plant richness was positively correlated with butterfly species richness, and non-native spontaneous plant species richness was positively correlated with butterfly richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness. Additionally, 76% of the spontaneous species identified were determined to be used by butterflies as larval hosts or for adult feeding. Identification of spontaneous plant species and use of selective weeding should be included in landscape management planning on campuses to promote butterflies, which can act as ambassadors for biodiversity conservation and help connect people to nature.

AB  - Urbanisation is a growing global phenomenon having multiple ecological consequences. However, the effects of urbanisation on biodiversity remain ambiguous, and some evidence exists that cities provide valuable secondary habitats for many species, possibly mitigating regional biodiversity loss. Therefore, the value of urban sites for biodiversity depends on local habitat conditions and the configuration of the surrounding landscape. We aimed to disentangle the effects of local habitatparameters (management, plant diversity) and urban matrix variables (urbanisation, isolation) on carabid beetle and spider diversity and traits in informal urban green spaces in Berlin, Germany. Habitat management and isolation were the most important influences on carabid beetle and spider species and trait compositions. Spider communities of irregular managed sites contained 2.5 times more species of conservation concern than extensive (regular) managed sites. Moreover, irregular managed sites contained larger species (both for carabid beetles and spiders) and affected the hunting mode of spiders. Isolated sites tended to have lower spider species richness and number of spider species of conservation concern. Moreover, isolated sites were characterised by small, mobile and herbivorous carabid beetles. In contrast, urbanisation and local plant diversity had no effect on carabid beetles and spiders. We conclude that urban grasslands within residential areas - even if not targeted for conservation plans - can provide important habitats for conserving biodiversity, including species of conservation concern. Reducing the intensity of habitat management and increasing the connectivity of urban grassland sites can promote diverse arthropod communities and should therefore be considered in urban planning.

AB  - The City Biodiversity Index (CBI), or Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity, serves as a tool to monitor biodiversity in cities and was endorsed by the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2009. Indicator 2 of the CBI measures the connectivity of natural areas in cities. We propose an improved and straightforward method for measuring connectivity based on the effective mesh size metric to replace the previous method used in the CBI. The previous version did not account for intra-patch (within-patch) connectivity nor for major barriers. Our evaluation of the new version of Indicator 2 through its application to Montreal and Lisbon confirmed its reliability. In Montreal, natural areas have a total connectivity value of 581.7 ha, the majority of which exists between, rather than within, patches of natural area. Smaller patches (<15 ha) contribute significantly to overall connectivity, which may have implications for future conservation efforts. In Lisbon, connectivity (342 ha) is concentrated within patches. We also applied the improved Indicator 2 to a case study in southwestern Montreal, where a greenway network ("green infrastructure") has been proposed by a local community organization. We assessed the contribution of Meadowbrook Golf Course to connectivity in scenarios of the proposed greenway network and the effect that residential development would have. Not only would this development eliminate the golf course's current contribution to connectivity, but also its much greater potential contribution to connectivity in future scenarios. Restoring and establishing additional natural areas would significantly increase connectivity in the network. Our results demonstrate that the improved version of Indicator 2 is a suitable method in the CBI. It is equally useful for identifying options to increase the connectivity of natural areas within cities in the future and for determining the impacts of urban development on connectivity. More advanced methods for quantifying connectivity exist and may also be included in Part I of the CBI. However, they are often challenging to use and this frequently discourages city planners from including any indicator of connectivity in their biodiversity monitoring. The connectivity metric presented here overcomes this problem through its practicality in a wide range of planning structures while still generating meaningful results which may then inspire city planners to move towards using more advanced methods of measuring connectivity. We dedicate this paper to the memory of Bernice Goldsmith (1934-2014). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Birds are considered a good model for indicators of biodiversity response to habitat variations, as they are very sensitive to environmental change. However, continuous observations of habitat alterations from undisturbed landscapes to human-dominated ones, as well as the associated effects on bird biodiversity, are lacking. In this study, New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai, China was selected to illustrate the response of bird species, and thus biodiversity, to habitat loss and fragmentation. land use/land cover (LULC) data and bird records from 2002 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. The results suggested that, due to urban sprawl, the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by 82.4% and 87.3% by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the landscape. To measure bird biodiversity, species richness and relative abundance were calculated, and they could account for the overall trend in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an indicator of biodiversity accounting, the mean species abundance (MSA) of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in its calculation, and its value decreased from 100% to 76.8% to 52.2% to 24.5% in the four corresponding stages. Finally, suggested by redundant analysis, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird biodiversity differed in various bird communities, and the area and connectivity of wetlands were the most significant variables. Our findings could provide important information to inform bird biodiversity protection and habitat restoration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - For better or worse, in those parts of the world with a widespread farming, livestock rising, and urban expansion, the maintenance of species richness and ecosystem services cannot depend only upon protected natural sites. Can they rely on a network of cultural landscapes endowed with their own associated biodiversity? We analyze the effects of land-cover change on landscape ecological patterns and processes that sustain bird species richness associated to cropland-grassland landscapes in the Great Plains-Denver metropolitan edge. Our purpose is to assess the potential contribution to bird biodiversity maintenance of Great Plain's cropland-grassland mosaics kept as farmland green belts in the edge of metropolitan areas. We present a quantitative landscape ecology assessment of land-cover changes (1930-2010) experienced in five Great Plains counties in Colorado. Several landscape metrics assess the diversity of land-cover patterns and their impact on ecological connectivity indices. These metrics are applied to historical land-cover maps and datasets drawn from aerial photos and satellite imagery. The results show that the cropland-grassland mosaics that link the metropolitan edge with the surrounding habitats sheltered in less human-disturbed areas provide a heterogeneous land matrix were a high bird species richness exists. They also suggest that keeping multifunctional farmland-grassland green belts near the edge of metropolitan areas may provide important ecosystem services, supplementing traditional conservation policies. Our maps and indicators can be used for selecting certain types of landscape patterns and priority areas on which biodiversity conservation efforts and land-use planning can concentrate.

AB  - 1. Despite high levels of disturbance and habitat modification, urban ecosystems still host substantial levels of biodiversity. The processes that maintain existing levels of diversity, however, remain understudied. Identifying the links between urban ecological processes and patterns has, therefore, become a fundamental research goal to support urban biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
   2. We conducted a study to determine how the diversity and composition of urban plant communities is affected by spatially and temporally variable land use legacies. We constructed a chronosequence of vacant lot properties covering a range of 3-22 years since demolition, in an urban neighbourhood in Baltimore, Maryland (USA). Surveys of herbaceous plant species abundance were conducted during the summers of 2012 and 2013 in sections of each vacant lot where the building previously stood (the "building footprint") and sections of the lot that was previously a backyard or garden (the "remnant garden").
   3. We found divergent patterns in plant community composition between areas of vacant lots with varying land use histories. This includes significant shifts in the functional composition of biotically vectored seed dispersal strategies, as well as an increase in seed mass and terminal velocity trait values of plant communities in building footprints over time. In addition, we found that plant communities in different sections of the same vacant lot tended to become more functionally dissimilar in seed dispersal strategies over time. In contrast, we found no significant changes in taxonomic diversity over time for any of our measures.
   4. Policy implications. Our study suggests that regional-scale patterns of seed dispersal interact with diverse land use legacies to structure the plant communities of urban vacant lots. Although it has been suggested that highly altered local environmental conditions and competition from introduced species limit native plant diversity in urban environments, we find seed dispersal to be a more significant driver of urban plant community assembly patterns. Implementing management strategies that focus on habitat connectivity and enhancing species pools via seeding may present an effective strategy for promoting more successful establishment of diverse plant communities in urban environments.

AB  - Urban forests can provide the necessary ecosystem services for their residents and play an important part in improving the urban environment. Forest landscape connectivity is a vital indicator reflecting the quality of the ecological environment and ecological functions. Detecting changes in landscape connectivity is, therefore, an important step for providing sound scientific evidence for the better urban planning. Using remote sensing images of a study area in Zhuhai City in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013, the dynamic forest landscape connectivity of Zhuhai city can be evaluated based on a graph-theoretic approach. The aims of our study were to discover and interpret the effect of rapid urbanization on forest landscape connectivity. The construction of ecological corridors helps us specifically compare the landscape connectivity of three parts of urban forests. On the basis of functional landscape metrics, the correlation of these metrics and patch area was discussed in order to comprehensively identify the key patches. The analysis showed that the total areas of forestlands reduced from 1999 to 2009 and then increased from 2009 to 2013, and the same trend was found in overall forest landscape connectivity. To improve the overall landscape connectivity, construct urban ecological network and appropriately protect biodiversity in the future, the existing important patches with large areas or key positions should be well protected. This study revealed that urbanization reduced the area of key patches and consequently reduced the forest landscape connectivity, which increased while the patch areas increased due to the environmental protection policy. Functional connectivity indicators could provide more comprehensive information in the development of environmental protection strategies.

AB  - Green roofs are a promising tool to return nature to cities and mitigate biodiversity loss brought about by urbanization. Yet, we lack basic information on how green roofs contribute to biodiversity and how their placement in the urban landscape affects different taxa and community composition. We studied the effects of local and landscape variables on beetle communities on green roofs. We expected that both local roof characteristics and urban landscape composition shape communities, but that their relative importance depends on species characteristics. Using pitfall traps, we collected beetles during two consecutive years from 17 green roofs in Basel, Switzerland. We evaluated the contribution of six local and six landscape variables to beetle community structure and to the responses of individual species. Communities on the roofs consisted of mobile and open dry-habitat species, with both local and landscape variables playing a role in structuring these communities. At the individual species level, local roof variables were more important than characteristics of the surrounding urban landscape. The most influential factors affecting the abundances of beetle species were vegetation, described as forb and grass cover (mainly positive), and roof age (mainly negative). Therefore, we suggest that the careful planning of green roofs with diverse vegetation is essential to increase their value as habitat for beetles. In addition, while beetle communities on green roofs can be diverse regardless of their placement in the urban landscape, the lack of wingless species indicates the need to increase the connectivity of green roofs to ground level habitats.

AB  - The loss of global biodiversity is one of the major challenges of our time and urbanisation is seen as a main cause of this. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for Odonata in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on dragonfly species richness and density of 35 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 35 control ponds (CONTROL).
   Our study revealed significant differences in environmental conditions between STOPON and CONTROL. At the habitat level, STOPON were larger, had a warmer microclimate, and lower concentrations of phosphate. STOPON were predominantly situated in suburbs, while CONTROL occurred mostly in rural areas. Accordingly, at the landscape level, STOPON had greater cover of built-up area as well as a lower cover of arable land and woodland. In line with this, the dragonfly assemblages at STOPON and CONTROL differed. Overall species richness was greater at STOPON than at CONTROL, and indicator species were only identified for STOPON. Especially threatened species benefited from STOPON, having higher species richness as well as higher adult and exuviae densities than CONTROL.
   In conclusion, our study shows that stormwater ponds in urban areas play an important role in the conservation of dragonflies in general and threatened species in particular. At STOPON, as a result of regular management, the habitat quality was high and compensated for the low landscape quality stemming from significant urbanisation effects.

AB  - By increasing landscape patchiness and habitat loss, urbanization threatens biodiversity. Its adverse effects may be mitigated by urban parks, in which conditions that promote structural and functional biodiversity contribute to preserve ecosystem processes. Therefore, deep knowledge of urban park biodiversity and of patterns driving species assemblages is required, especially for soil communities which are understudied. This study, conducted in public parks in Montpellier (Southern France), is the first one examining the impact of landscape patterns on Collembola communities. Moreover, soil abiotic properties were analyzed to examine how local factors drive species assemblages in different landscape types. The results of the study highlighted that Collembola community structure is affected by landscape patterns. Specifically, Collembola communities with species-abundance structures typical of late successional stages were found within woody landscapes, whereas those with early successional stage structures were observed in wide turf patches surrounded by other vegetation covers. When turf patches become small and isolated, homogenization was observed in Collembola community composition. From the perspective of urban park planning, managers should consider limiting landscape fragmentation (i.e. interspersion and configuration of impervious surfaces) and preserving landscape diversity (especially through woody vegetation patches). These may promote the development of diverse and structured Collembola communities, indicators of the overall soil quality.

AB  - Recent concern over increasing loss of biodiversity has prompted considerable interest in the role of urban green spaces as reservoirs of local biodiversity. This study assessed the diversity of three indicator taxa - plants, ants and birds - on golf courses spanning a wide range of environmental variation in terms of climate, elevation, course age, size and connectivity to native woodland. Species richness and community composition was further compared between contrasting on-course habitat types that reflect different management intensities. We identified a set of taxon-specific environmental correlates indicating an intricate interplay of landscape- and local-scale variables that affect local species diversity. Our results show that floristic diversity is positively associated with the amount of rainfall, whereas ant and bird diversity are related to local-scale factors, particularly the number of trees and the size of water features on a site. The amount of on-course native habitat was a strong predictor of plant and ant diversity and was also associated with the number of unique species at the site level; this reinforces the value of remnant habitat patches as local biodiversity reservoirs that represent mini hot-spots in an otherwise species-poor urban landscape. Community composition for all three taxa differed markedly between non-playing and playing areas, with boundary and remnant habitats generally having more diverse, species-rich communities. Our results suggest that local floral and faunal biodiversity on urban golf courses can be enhanced by creating woody non-playing areas and, especially, by preserving, restoring or expanding remnant habitats.

AB  - In recent years, Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has gained broad political support and has evolved to become a new research topic in the area of sustainable urban development. The focus has been largely on green urban structures, such as parks and urban forest. The role and contribution of farmland has often been neglected. This work wants to scrutinise the potential of farmland's contribution to the basic conception of UGI, in particular, with regard to connectivity. It reports on three case studies from Southern Germany, in the peri-urban regions of the three largest and expanding cities of Bavaria: Munich, Nuremberg and Augsburg. The spatial analysis we used is transparent, simple and repeatable. It is transferable to any European urban area. We use habitat suitability modelling to map the potential spatial distribution of low-intensity farmland, with emphasis on grassland systems. Based on these potential distributions, landscape indicators are used to analyse structural connectivity. Structural connectivity is used as a surrogate for functional connectivity, which supports ecological and abiotic processes and functions, but on the other hand characterises functional social connectivity, with respect to the accessibility of recreation. The results of this study suggest that farmland bears a great potential to contribute to UGI. The immediate surroundings of the cities do not just offer spatial potential but can enhance connectivity significantly. Based on these results some recommendations have been formulated to enable a better appreciation of farmland and farmers as partners for effectively developing strategies for UGI planning and sustainable urban development.

AB  - Understanding the impact of urban expansion on functional connectivity is significant to biodiversity conservation. Particularly, in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA, Southwest China), the urban land has rapidly expanded to provide settlements for an enormous population of TGRA migrants. However, the consequence of future land-use changes to the functional connectivity of the local habitat network has rarely been studied. To extend this knowledge, this paper proposes a framework that integrates a novel cellular automata (CA) simulation model and ecological network analysis, taking the TGRA as the study area, to predict how different urban expansion scenarios might affect functional connectivity for a nationally protected species, the leopard. The least-cost path modeling is used, and a set of connectivity indicators are adopted to evaluate functional connectivity. The results show that, the population-growth-based urban expansion maintains a higher connectivity than the business-as-usual and fast-urban-growth scenarios. In addition, the connectivity loss due to urban expansion can be offset by the reforestation efforts of the Green-for-Grain Project. Finally, we identify habitat patches that act as key connectivity providers, and suggest that those patches be prioritized for protection to avoid significant connectivity loss.

AB  - The biodiversity of urban and post-industrial ecosystems is a highly relevant and growing new frontier in ecological research. Even so, the functionality of these ecosystems may not always be successfully predicted based on prior biodiversity and ecosystem functioning theory. Indeed, evidence suggests that the general biological impoverishment within the urban context envisioned thirty years ago was overstated. Many of the world's urban centers support some degree of biodiversity that is indigenous, as well as a complex array of non-native species, resulting in highly functional, and often, novel communities. For over two decades, a multi-disciplinary team has examined the sub-lethal impact of soil metal contamination on the multi-trophic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of a post-industrial brownfield in the New York City metropolitan area. We do this through examinations of photosynthesis, carbon allocation, and soil enzyme activity as well as multi-trophic metal translocation via the plant and rhizosphere. In this paper, we synthesize the findings of our research network and apply the results to a framework of functional diversity. Due to the unique constraints many post-industrial lands impose on communities, functional diversity may be more meaningful to ecosystem health than species richness.

AB  - Pond networks support high levels of biodiversity when compared to other freshwater ecosystems such as rivers, lakes and streams. The persistence of species in these small, sometimes ephemeral, aquatic habitats depends on the dispersal of individuals among ponds in the landscape. However, the number of ponds across the landscape is at a historical low as urbanisation and intensified agricultural practices have led to a substantial loss of ponds (nodes in the pond network) over more than a century. Here, we examine the extent and drivers of pond loss in a heavily urbanised landscape (Birmingham, UK) over 105 years and determine how pond loss influences key structural properties of the pond network using graph theoretic approaches. Specifically, we calculated minimum spanning trees (MST) and performed percolation analyses to determine changes in both the spatial configuration and resilience of the pond network through time. Pond numbers declined by 82% between ca1904 and 2009, such that pond density decreased from 7.1 km(-2) to 1.3 km(-2). The MST analyses revealed increased distance between ponds in the network (i.e. edge length increased) by up to 49% over the 105-year period, indicating that ponds in the modern landscape (2009) were considerably more isolated, with fewer neighbours. This study demonstrates that graph theory has an excellent potential to inform the management of pond networks in order to support ecological communities that are less vulnerable to environmental change.

AB  - Urban fragmentation can reduce gene flow that isolates populations, reduces genetic diversity and increases population differentiation, all of which have negative conservation implications. Alternatively, gene flow may actually be increased among urban areas consistent with an urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter pests are able to thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing human-mediated transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population genetic approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic connectivity in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model of human health concern. We collected genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism variation from mitochondrial and nuclear double-digest RAD (ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals sampled from 11 urban and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western United States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic, and network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population genetic diversity, lower between-population genetic differentiation and higher estimates of genetic connectivity. Social network analyses show that urban locales not only have more connections, but can act as hubs that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, which show signatures of historical isolation. These results are consistent with an urban facilitation model of gene flow and demonstrate the importance of sampling multiple cities and markers to identify the role that urbanization has had on larger spatial scales. As the urban landscape continues to grow, this approach will help determine what factors influence the spread and adaptation of pests, like the venomous black widow spider, in building policies for human and biodiversity health.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation results in landscape configuration, which affects the species that inhabit it. As a consequence, natural habitat is replaced by different anthropogenic plantation types (e.g. pasture, agriculture, forestry plantations and urban areas). Anthropogenic plantations are important for biodiversity maintenance because some species or functional groups can use it as a complementary habitat. However, depending on plantation permeability, it can act as a barrier to the movement of organisms between habitat patches, such as forest fragments, reducing functional connectivity for many species. Anthropogenic plantations are becoming the most common land use and cover type in the Anthropocene and biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes requires information on how different plantation types affect the capacity of the species to move through the landscape. In this study, we evaluated the influence of the type and structure of plantations on the movement of two forest-dependent understory bird species - plain antvireo (Dysithamnus mentalis) and flavescent warbler (Myiothlyps flaveola) - within a highly fragmented landscape of Atlantic Forest hotspot. Knowing that forestry plantation is assumed to be more permeable to dependent forest bird species than open ones, we selected six study areas containing a forest fragment and surrounding plantation: three with sugarcane plantation and three with Eucalyptus sp. plantation. We used playback calls to stimulate the birds to leave forest fragments and traverse the plantations. Control trials were also carried out inside the forest fragments to compare the distances crossed. We observed that individuals moved longer distances inside forest than between plantation types, which demonstrate that plantations do constrict the movements of both species. The two plantation types equally impeded the movements of the species, suggesting the opposite of the general assumption that forestry plantations are more permeable. Our results indicate that, for generalist species, plantation type does not matter, but its presence negatively impacts movement of these bird species. We highlight that plantations have negative influences on the movements of common bird species, and discuss why this is important when setting conservation priorities.

AB  - Protected areas in the cities play an important role for nature conservation and sustainable urban planning. In many occasions however development activities and urban planning ignore this ecological aspect. For sustainable urban planning, understanding the landscape pattern and connectivity importance of urban protected areas and its surroundings are important. Therefore, this study examined: i) landscape pattern changes of three protected areas-Bukit Sungai Puteh, Bukit Nenas and KL Golf Course and ii) their connectivity importance for biodiversity conservation of Kuala Lumpur conurbation. In this study three satellite images (Landsat TM 30 m resolution) of the study areas in 1988, 1996 and 2005 were processed and analyzed using ERDAS Imagine 9.2 and ArcGIS 9.3 to develop land use/ land cover maps of the study areas in the three years. Landscape pattern of the maps was analyzed using landscape metrics calculated by Vector Based Landscape Analysis Tools Extension (vLATE) software. Conefor Sensinode 2.2 (CS22) software was used to measure landscape connectivity. Results revealed that over the decades the protected areas experienced highly pressure from anthropogenic activities. Generally, their size is very small and the natural areas within their boundary gradually reduced and fragmented. Analysis also revealed the transformation of natural landscape to the anthropogenic settlements inside all of the three protected areas. This suggests that these protected areas may have lost their capability to support valuable biodiversity if the situation persisted. However, the connectivity analysis showed that some of the large patches of forest outside the protected areas have connectivity importance. Therefore, there is a need for more protected areas in the Kuala Lumpur conurbation to protect valuable biodiversity and also the natural landscapes for sustainable planning of the city.

AB  - Background: Eurasian Sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) increasingly represent successful city-dwellers. Thereby, a rich food supply indicated by high numbers of small birds is believed to be the key driver for this bird-eating rap- tor species to settle in urban environments. However, as small passerine birds show particularly strong antipredator responses, sparrowhawks may not simply focus on patches of highest prey densities, but rather respond strategically to prey behavior, raising the importance of other parameters in determining the occurrence within urban landscapes.
   Methods: To deepen our knowledge on habitat requirements of urban sparrowhawks, bird surveys were carried out during winter between December 2005 and January 2017 in 36 city parks in Vienna, Austria. Besides food supply also park size, canopy heterogeneity and the connectivity with other green spaces were considered.
   Results: Occurrence of sparrowhawks was positively affected by increasing park size, prey density and the interaction between both. Bird feeder density and park connectivity with other green spaces were of minor importance in explaining the presence of this species. Canopy heterogeneity didn't affect city park occupancy by Eurasian Sparrowhawks.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that large city parks, particularly when characterized by high prey densities, substantially contribute to protect and preserve ecologically important bird species such as raptors within the urban environment-a landscape already struggling with biodiversity losses and functional homogenization.

AB  - Urban expansion has caused major deforestation and forest fragmentation in the tropics. The impacts of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity are understudied in urban forest patches, especially in the tropics and little is known on the conservation value of the patches for maintaining mammalian biodiversity. In this study, camera trapping was used to determine the species composition and species richness of medium- and large-sized mammals in three urban forest patches and a contiguous forest in Peninsular Malaysia. We identified the key vegetation attributes that predicted mammal species richness and occurrence of herbivores and omnivores in urban forest patches. A total number of 19 mammal species from 120 sampling points were recorded. Contiguous forest had the highest number of species compared to the urban forest patches. Sunda Pangolin and Asian Tapir were the only conservation priority species recorded in the urban forest patches and contiguous forest, respectively. Top predators such as Malayan Tiger and Melanistic Leopard were completely absent from the forest patches as well as the contiguous forest. This was reflected by the abundance of wild boars. We found that mammal species richness increased with the number of trees with DBH less than 5 cm, trees with DBH more than 50 cm, and dead standing trees. In the future, the remaining mammal species in the urban forest patches are expected to be locally extinct as connecting the urban forest patches may be infeasible due to land scarcity. Hence, to maintain the ecological integrity of urban forest patches, we recommend that stakeholders take intervention measures such as reintroduction of selected species and restocking of wild populations in the urban forest patches to regenerate the forest ecosystems.

AB  - The world is rapidly urbanizing, and many previously biodiverse areas are now mostly composed of impervious surface. This loss of natural habitat causes local bird communities to become dominated by urban dweller and urban utilizer species and reduces the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds. Green roofs can increase green space in urban landscapes, potentially providing new habitat for wildlife. We surveyed birds and arthropods, an important food source for birds, on green roofs and nearby comparable conventional (non-green) roofs in New York City during spring migration and summer breeding seasons. We predicted that green roofs would have a greater abundance and richness of both birds and arthropods than conventional roofs during both migration and the breeding season for birds. Furthermore, we predicted we would find more urban avoider and urban utilizer bird species on green roofs than conventional roofs. We found that both birds and arthropods were more abundant and rich on green roofs than conventional roofs. In addition, green roofs hosted more urban avoider and utilizer bird species than conventional roofs. Our study shows that birds use green roofs as stopover habitat during migration and as foraging habitat during the breeding season. Establishing green roofs in urban landscapes increases the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds and can partially mitigate the loss of habitat due to increasing urbanization.

AB  - It is of great significance to explore landscape pattern changes around urban areas to maintain regional ecological security and encourage sustainable development. Few studies have focused on the small cities located in the mountain regions. In this study, we established an 'urban-rural' gradient, and combined with landscape metrics to analyze the spatial-temporal changes of the landscape pattern around cities located in the Hengduan Mountain region in China. We also explored the impacts of topography on urban sprawl using the 'relief degree of land surface' index. Our results showed that: (1) There was an inverse relationship between the urban sprawl and restricted topography; (2) From the city center to rural areas, the landscape dominance degree and connectivity decreased initially and then increased, while the diversity presented an opposite trend and the shape complexity increased first and then fluctuated; (3) For temporal changes, in the internal buffers, the landscape dominance degree and connectivity increased, and the shape complexity and diversity decreased. However, in the outer buffers, the landscape showed opposite trends. It is advisable to use gradient and landscape metrics to explore landscape pattern changes. Similar to cities on plains, the landscape around mountain cities exhibits a circular structure, however, it also possesses unique characteristics when facing topographic restrictions.

AB  - Worldwide, the expansion of settlement and transport infrastructure is one of the most important proximate as well as ultimate causes of biodiversity loss. As much as every modern human society depends on a network of settlements that is well-connected by transport infrastructure (i.e., settlement network), animal and plant species depend on networks of habitats between which they can move (i.e., habitat networks). However, changes to a settlement network in a region often threaten the integrity of the region's habitat networks. Determining plans and policy to prevent these threats is made difficult by the numerous interactions and feedbacks that exist between and within the settlement and habitat networks. Mathematical models of coupled settlement and habitat networks can help us understand the dynamics of this social-ecological system. Yet, few attempts have been made to develop such mathematical models. In this paper, we promote the development of models of coupled settlement and habitat networks for biodiversity conservation. First, we present a conceptual framework of key variables that are ideally considered when operationalizing the coupling of settlement and habitat networks. In this framework, we first describe important network-internal interactions by differentiating between the structural (i.e., relating to purely physical conditions determining the suitability of a location for living or movement) and functional (i.e., relating to the actual presence, abundance or movement of people or other organisms) properties of either network. We then describe the main one-way influences that a settlement network can exert on the habitat networks and vice versa. Second, we give several recommendations for the mathematical modeling of coupled settlement and habitat networks and present several existing modeling approaches (e.g., habitat network models and land-use transport interaction models) that could be used for this purpose. Lastly, we elaborate on potential applications of models of coupled settlement and habitat networks in the development of complex network theory, in the assessment of system resilience and in conservation, transport and urban planning. The development of coupled settlement and habitat network models is important to gain a better system-level understanding of biodiversity conservation under a rapidly urbanizing and growing human population.

AB  - Environmental policies have highlighted the importance of preserving ecological networks to limit the fragmentation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss. A crucial issue for landscape managers is how to reconcile conservation measures that benefit all species and the maintenance of human activities. This study aimed to promote landscape multifunctionality, i.e., improving connectivity for several species without significantly modifying human activities. The objectives were to identify the most strategic natural landscape types to prioritize for preservation and to propose landscape management actions in highly anthropized areas that would benefit a majority of species. The analysis combined landscape types and bird species observation data to model landscape suitability for six species profiles defined by their affinity for wetlands, agricultural areas, urban areas and three types of forested landscapes. By graph modelling, we analysed the functional connectivity of the ecological networks of these species profiles. The results revealed that only ten landscape types out of 72 were core habitats for three species profiles simultaneously. These were primarily forested landscape types - either strict or associated with open areas (wasteland, forest clearing). Conversely, some anthropogenic landscapes dominated by built areas and sometimes shared with agriculture were completely unfavourable for all species profiles. The graph modelling analysis showed that the transformation of some landscape types could potentially improve connectivity for four species profiles presenting different ecological requirements. This coupling approach thus provided guidance to propose some landscape management actions that benefit the majority of species while preserving land uses.

AB  - Urbanization generates shifts in wildlife communities, with some species increasing their distribution and abundance, while others decline. We used a dataset spanning 15years to assess trends in distribution and habitat dynamics of the black-tailed prairie dog, a highly interactive species, in urban habitat remnants in Denver, CO, USA. Both available habitat and number of prairie dog colonies declined steeply over the course of the study. However, we did observe new colonization events that correlated with habitat connectivity. Destruction of habitat may be slowing, but the rate of decline of prairie dogs apparently remained unaffected. By using our estimated rates of loss of colonies throughout the study, we projected a 40% probability that prairie dogs will be extirpated from this area by 2067, though that probability could range as high as 50% or as low as 20% depending on the rate of urban development (i.e. habitat loss). Prairie dogs may fulfill important ecological roles in urban landscapes, and could persist in the Denver area with appropriate management and habitat protections.

AB  - This article is the first-ever analysis of cities in relation to maritime transport flows from a relational, or network, perspective. Based on untapped vessel movement data covering the last 120 years, this articles sheds new light about the interdependencies at stake between urban hierarchies and port hierarchies overtime. Main results point to the fading correlation between traffic volume, port centrality, and city size, while the largest cities have maintained their prominence in the global maritime network despite contemporary spatial and functional changes affecting the distribution of transport systems and commodity chains. Such findings help better understanding not only the spatial and functional evolution of port-city relationships and maritime transport; they also confirm the importance of taking into account the long-term dynamics and socio-economic embedding of spatial networks in geography and other disciplines.

AB  - Introductions of non-native lineages increase opportunities for hybridization. Non-native lineages of the common wall lizard, Podarcis rnuralis, are frequently introduced in cities where they hybridize with native populations. We aimed at unravelling the invasion history and admixture of native and non-native wall lizards in four German cities using citywide, comprehensive sampling. We barcoded and genotyped 826 lizards and tested if gene flow in populations composed of admixed native and introduced lineages is facilitated by similar environmental factors to those in native populations by comparing fine-scale landscape genetic patterns. In cities with non-native lineages, lizards commonly occurred in numerous clusters of hybrid swarms, which showed variable lineage composition, consisting of up to four distinct evolutionary lineages. Hybrid swarms held vast genetic diversity and showed recent admixture with other hybrid swarms. Landscape genetic analyses showed differential effects of cityscape structures across cities, but identified water bodies as strong barriers to gene flow in both native and admixed populations. By contrast, railway tracks facilitated gene flow of admixed populations only. Our study shows that cities represent unique settings for hybridization, caused by multiple introductions of non-native taxa. Cityscape structure and invasion histories of cities will determine future evolutionary pathways at these novel hybrid zones.

AB  - The beginning of the 21st century has witnessed a growth in our understanding of the importance of planning urban landscapes in the context of urban population growth and unpredictable climatic conditions. In the search for responses to the challenges set by the development of contemporary urban landscapes, researchers have offered solutions based on the concept of sustainable and resilient cities, whose spatial development would be based on an interdisciplinary approach to strategy development: biodiversity, urban ecological networks and connectivity, multifunctionality and modularity. Although the concepts of a green infrastructure, in their spatial and functional dimensions, allow the application of such strategies, there are still problems when it comes to implementation and measuring the results achieved. At the same time, there is a growing discussion of the important role played by urban forestry in the context of the collaborative planning of urban landscapes and the application of the ideas of a green infrastructure. The key question is: what are the modalities of application of the concept of green infrastructure in the process of planning the development of the modem city and how can the resulting benefits be evaluated? With the modalities of application of the concept of green infrastructure in mind, we discuss its multi-scale and multifunctional dimensions as applied in the case of Serbia. The realisation of the green infrastructure concept is presented through the example of the Urban Forest Management Plan for the City of Belgrade - Mladenovac Municipality. The results of using the spatial-ecological approach in creating the plan and establishing connectivity as a new aim in forest management planning show that the implementation of the green infrastructure concept, and the achieved multifunctional ecosystem values, can be presented on the basis of the parameters of landscape metrics. In light of the new urban world, future research should focus on the application of the landscape ecological approach of the green infrastructure concept in collaborative planning at the urban landscape scale, which allows the creation of ecosystem services and benefits to human well-being.

AB  - A study on urban plant diversity of Catania city (Sicily, Italy) was carried out through the analysis of urban green space network and natural habitats. The study area is extended to 939 km(2) and includes 15 km of coastal habitat. Floristic data were used to analyze environmental changes. The vascular plant flora was investigated through a literature list for periods from 1889 to 1909 and from 1970 to 1990 and through an extensive survey campaign from 2010 to 2017. A total list of 927 species was acquired. Each species was associated with its own ecological and chorological information. Ellenberg's values were used as environmental indicators to assess the relationship between plant species and environmental factors.

AB  - Ecological security patterns (ESPs) aim to provide an effective spatial approach for maintaining urban ecological security based on the relationship between landscape patterns and ecological processes. However, the methods of selecting ecological security sources and evaluating resistance surfaces for ESPs construction are not well developed and lack consideration of land degradation and spatial heterogeneity. Using Shenzhen City, a fast-growing city in a rapidly urbanizing region, as a case study area, this study evaluated two types of land degradation risk for ecological land: type transformation risk and functional damage risk. Both two kinds of risk were combined with ecological functional importance, which was composed of habitat quality and landscape connectivity, so as to quantify the comprehensive reserve value of ecological land to identify the ecological security sources. Ecological corridors were established with the application of remotely-sensed impervious surface area in the ecological resistance surface evaluation. In all, 477.43 km(2) ecological land were identified as ecological security sources, with 278.1 km and 197.5 km for the length of group corridors and landscape corridors respectively. The ecological corridors spatially presented a radiation pattern of one axis and three strips. The majority of both ecological security sources and corridors was located within the existing ecological protection boundary, confirming its ecological significance. This study provided an effective quantification framework to identify urban ESPs, and ESPs mapping could make a fundamental support to urban planning.

AB  - Diversity is one of the defining characteristics of complex adaptive systems - systems made up of heterogeneous agents whose interactions form a dynamic network resulting in emergent behaviour. Recent research shows that various types of diversity increase with the scale of the system. This paper uses ideas and methods from community ecology to define business types as functional traits and to calculate functional diversity as a measure of the economic diversification in an urban system. It asks how functional diversity changes with the size of the city within an urban region. Using Keihanshin Metropolitan Area in Japan as an example, the paper concludes that while functional diversity scales with city size, it reaches saturation due to the limitations of the business types classification systems. It argues that regardless of the observed saturation, the method can reveal the structural complexity of the city, showing what types of industries form its economy. It also discovers functions common to all cities in the region, and calls for further development of the method by introducing the multidimensional analysis and additional measures of diversity.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has caused drastic declines in the area and species richness of semi-natural grasslands across Europe. Novel habitats, such as power line clearings, provide alternative habitats and niches for grassland species, and might therefore mitigate these declines. However, it is not fully understood which environmental factors determine the occurrence of grassland species in the clearings. Identifying the most important drivers for grassland species occurrence would help understand the value of the clearings for grassland conservation and target enhanced management into clearings with most potential as grassland habitat. We studied the effects of local environmental conditions, and past and present connectivity to semi-natural grasslands, on the species richness of grassland plants and butterflies in 43 power line clearings in Finland. The results of generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning showed that increasing time since clear-cut and amount of clearing residue decreased the species richness of both species groups, while the cover of mesic habitats increased it. However, the two species groups showed also divergent responses. Present-day local environmental conditions appeared to be the sole driver of grassland butterfly species richness, whereas the richness of grassland plants was related both to current conditions and historical connectivity to grasslands in 1870-1880s. This suggests the presence of an extinction debt in the studied grassland plant communities, emphasizing the need for enhanced management to increase suitable grassland habitat in the clearings. This would diminish the potential future losses of grassland plant species in the clearings and create valuable habitat for grassland butterflies as well.

AB  - Accelerating pressures to accommodate rapidly increasing human populations in Australia pose major problems for insect conservation in urban and periurban regions from loss of natural habitats, alien species impacts and a variety of other causes. Several urban insects have become notable flagships for promoting wider conservation interests, leading to wider appreciation of environmental benefits of 'open spaces', urban forests, connectivity, 'green architecture' and other landscape features as relevant planning considerations in urban development. Their conservation, under a range of ecological contexts and threats, occurs in conjunction with energetic advocacy and educational programs that can emphasise the roles and diversity of Australia's unique insect fauna. Approaches to conserving native insects amidst urban intensification are discussed from selected case studies and citizen science projects that illustrate principles and complexities of single-species conservation, the values of indicator and diversity surrogate taxa and the implications of alien species on native insect diversity and its losses in urban environments. Important lessons and implications include the following: (1) recognition that taxonomic and ecological diversity of insects can be high in urban areas; (2) acknowledgment that insect diversity in urban environments is vulnerable to changes and a variety of threatening processes; (3) mitigation responses that involve reducing threats, preserving open spaces with natural vegetation, creating new open areas and promoting connectivity; (4) establishment of partnerships that enhance conservation values and prospects through individual people, local authorities and government agencies; and (5) increasing awareness of insects as integral components of ecological sustainability contributing to the wider values of urban environments.

AB  - Research on restoration of degraded areas is a popular topic in landscape ecology and restoration ecology. Finding proper methods to determine the restoration priorities for coal mining subsidence areas has great significance in improving urban ecosystem services and human well-beings in coal resources cities. Based on analysis of the existing research of ecological restoration priorities and green infrastructure (GI as short) theory, this paper proposes an integrated approach that combines habitat quality evaluation module in InVEST model (an integrated ecosystem services assessment tool based on ArcGIS), biodiversity service equivalent and land-scape connectivity index to determine the restoration priorities. Using the Chinese coal resource city of Xuzhou as an example, the results of the integrated approach indicated that restoration priority values of coal mining subsidence areas in Xuzhou could be categorized into 5 grades, with high restoration priorities (Priority Class 5 and Class 4) generally located in the Jiawang district, the western Pangzhuang east district, the eastern and southern parts of the Dongzhuang west district and the northern Dahuangshan district. These regions are strongly recommended for integration into urban green infrastructure and for preferential restoration.

AB  - Urbanization often substantially influences animal movement and gene flow. However, few studies to date have examined gene flow of the same species across multiple cities. In this study, we examine brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) to test hypotheses about the repeatability of neutral evolution across four cities: Salvador, Brazil; New Orleans, USA; Vancouver, Canada; and New York City, USA. At least 150 rats were sampled from each city and genotyped for a minimum of 15 000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms. Levels of genome-wide diversity were similar across cities, but varied across neighbourhoods within cities. All four populations exhibited high spatial autocorrelation at the shortest distance classes (less than 500 m) owing to limited dispersal. Coancestry and evolutionary clustering analyses identified genetic discontinuities within each city that coincided with a resource desert in New York City, major waterways in New Orleans, and roads in Salvador and Vancouver. Such replicated studies are crucial to assessing the generality of predictions from urban evolution, and have practical applications for pest management and public health. Future studies should include a range of global cities in different biomes, incorporate multiple species, and examine the impact of specific characteristics of the built environment and human socioeconomics on gene flow.

AB  - Landscape metrics represent powerful tools for quantifying landscape structure, but uncertainties persist around their interpretation. Urban settings add unique considerations, containing habitat structures driven by the surrounding built-up environment. Understanding urban ecosystems, however, should focus on the habitats rather than the matrix.
   We coupled a multivariate approach with landscape metric analysis to overcome existing shortcomings in interpretation. We then explored relationships between landscape characteristics and modelled ecosystem service provision.
   We used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to isolate the most effective measures of landscape variability and then grouped habitat patches according to their attributes, independent of the surrounding urban form. We compared results to the modelled provision of three ecosystem services. Seven classes resulting from cluster analysis were separated primarily on patch area, and secondarily by measures of shape complexity and inter-patch distance.
   When compared to modelled ecosystem services, larger patches up to 10 ha in size consistently stored more carbon per area and supported more pollinators, while exhibiting a greater risk of soil erosion. Smaller, isolated patches showed the opposite, and patches larger than 10 ha exhibited no additional areal benefit.
   Multivariate landscape metric analysis offers greater confidence and consistency than analysing landscape metrics individually. Independent classification avoids the influence of the urban matrix surrounding habitats of interest, and allows patches to be grouped according to their own attributes. Such a grouping is useful as it may correlate more strongly with the characteristics of landscape structure that directly affect ecosystem function.

AB  - Small forest patches embedded in agricultural (and peri-urban) landscapes in Western Europe play a key role for biodiversity conservation with a recognized capacity of delivering a wide suite of ecosystem services. Measures aimed to preserve these patches should be both socially desirable and ecologically effective. This study presents a joint ecologic and economic assessment conducted on small forest patches in Flanders (Belgium) and Picardie (N France). In each study region, two contrasted types of agricultural landscapes were selected. Open field (OF) and Bocage (B) landscapes are distinguished by the intensity of their usage and higher connectivity in the B landscapes. The social demand for enhancing biodiversity and forest structure diversity as well as for increasing the forest area at the expenses of agricultural land is estimated through an economic valuation survey. These results are compared with the outcomes of an ecological survey where the influence of structural features of the forest patches on the associated herbaceous diversity is assessed. The ecological and economic surveys show contrasting results; increasing tree species richness is ecologically more important for herbaceous diversity in the patch, but both tree species richness and herbaceous diversity obtain insignificant willingness to pay estimates. Furthermore, although respondents prefer the proposed changes to take place in the region where they live, we find out that social preferences and ecological effectiveness do differ between landscapes that represent different intensities of land use. Dwellers where the landscape is perceived as more "degraded" attach more value to diversity enhancement, suggesting a prioritization of initiatives in these area. In contrast, the ecological analyses show that prioritizing the protection and enhancement of the relatively better-off areas is more ecologically effective.

AB  - Humans have urbanised and fragmented landscapes across the globe, with detrimental impacts to biodiversity, habitats and food webs in most biomes. Urbanisation might also modify the provision of ecological functions, but these putative effects of landscape transformation are rarely measured. Coastal cities are typically located near estuaries, and we tested for potential impacts of these on ecological functions. Our study used 22 estuaries in eastern Australia as model systems to examine how urbanisation shapes the consumption of carrion by fish, a pivotal ecological function in estuaries. Fish assemblages varied among estuaries according to the extent of shoreline hardening, and this was correlated with changes in the rate of carrion consumption. In estuaries with low levels of shoreline hardening and abundant remnant mangroves, most carrion was consumed by toadfishes (Tetraodontidae). By contrast, in moderately urban estuaries (i.e. where 20-60% of shorelines had been hardened with artificial structures) yellowfin bream (Sparidae) replaced toadfish and performed the bulk of the scavenging function. Bream are particularly effective scavengers that utilize artificial structures as habitat for both foraging and sheltering. We show that by augmenting habitat for an important species of scavenger, the moderate addition of urban structures to estuarine shorelines also helped to supplement a key ecological function in estuaries. Urbanisation impacts diversity in all ecosystems, but many opportunistic species flourish in urban habitats. Identifying and conserving taxa that perform important roles in urban environments is now a critical conservation challenge for maintaining ecological functions across disturbed landscapes.

AB  - As an important factor of scenic quality and biodiversity along a greenway, landscape diversity has yet to receive as much attention as it deserves. In the practice of greenway alignment planning, it usually gives way to the primary consideration of land suitability. In this article, we aim to make up this missing link. Upon the new concepts and measurement of linear landscape diversity and cellular landscape diversity, we proposed greenway potential index incorporating land suitability and landscape diversity. The greenway potential index was combined with connectivity analysis to connect path between a future greenway's origin and destination that meets both land suitability and landscape diversity requirements. Specially, with Wuchang (Wuhan City, China) as a case study area, we proposed three greenway alignment planning scenarios respectively according to the criteria of suitability, diversity and the synthesis of them. Markedly differences were revealed between the results of suitability greenways and diversity greenways. The results indicate that the tripartite model we proposed is capable of planning a connecting path between a future greenway's origin and destination that not only meets land suitability requirements for greenway construction, but also incorporates as many landscape types of significant difference as possible.

AB  - The demand for urban construction has placed growing pressure on biodiversity conservation. In China, landscape fragmentation caused by rapid urbanization has resulted in an immense amount of damage to the ecological system. Taking the Haidian District of Beijing as the study area, this study distinguishes the vital patches and corridors for landscape connectivity maintenance through morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), the probability of connectivity (PC), and the least-cost path analysis. Although we adopted and combined these methods from the existing research about landscape modeling, we went deeper into two parameters: the resistance value and the distance threshold. In order to get a species-specific result, we selected two focal species: the ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchius) and the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), whose biological characteristics and habitat types are assumed to represent most of the habitats in Beijing. The result shows the different habitats and corridors for two species. Then, the results of two simulated scenarios are overlaid to obtain the final landscape pattern. Based on this case study, we propose a paradigm of ecological network identification of multiple species, which may contribute to landscape modeling and green space planning.

AB  - Whether or not individuals in cities and adjacent rural areas form separate populations depends on the origin of urbanized individuals. The rural individuals may have simply gradually invaded the city. Alternatively, the urbanization depended on arrival of individuals with specific adaptations for city life. A population within the city could also remain separated from adjacent rural populations if there are physical or behavioural dispersal barriers lowering the possibility of genetic exchange between individuals. All this is linked to dispersal behaviour of the species as gene flow is determined by distances moved during dispersal. In this study, we used microsatellite markers to evaluate whether or not Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) individuals in an urban environment are genetically separated from their sub-urban/rural counterparts. Using radio-telemetry, we also studied natal dispersal distances of urban red squirrels to evaluate the potential for gene flow within the city. We observed no indication that urban squirrels had been genetically isolated from rural squirrels. In addition, increased amount of built area did not explain differentiation between urban individuals, further indicating that there were no barriers restricting movement. Still, the genetic differentiation within the city was increased and natal dispersal distances relatively short, perhaps indicating lack of need to move long distances in the urban environment. We conclude that urban and adjacent rural squirrels were part of the same larger population with gene flow in and out from the city. Yet, urbanization was related to increased genetic differentiation, indicating different spatial genetic structure in urban and rural populations.

AB  - Close-to-nature urban forests and remnants of natural vegetation represent an important opportunity for urban residents to experience daily perception of and access to the natural environment. Despite there being a high percentage of forest cover (59%) and a favorable structure of the prevailing forested landscapes in Slovenia, urban expansion and infrastructure-driven development has severely weakened the connectivity and conservation of urban and suburban forests. The majority of urban settlements lie within walking distance of the surrounding forests (<1 km). However, only close-to-nature forests with relatively low silvicultural inputs offer ecosystem services sufficient to fulfil the supply and demand of the expanding urban population. In order to estimate the conservation of forests in the open space of Slovenian settlements, we used a spatial model of landscape structure and forest connectivity. The model can be enhanced with patterns of corridors and stepping stones of natural vegetation in the landscape matrix to provide support in the decision-making process of landscape planning and the conservation of urban and suburban forests.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the key landscape structures of migratory bird habitats that affect abundance of migratory birds to promote resilient coastal green infrastructure planning on the Yellow Sea coast. We classified coastal areas into four watersheds of South Korea and conducted multivariate regression analysis between migratory bird populations and landscape structures including total class area (CA), patch area distribution (MN), patch density (PD), and edge density (ED). At the national level, sandbank MN, sandbank CA, water ED, and grasslands were derived as key landscape structures affecting the abundance of migratory birds. At the watershed level, key landscape structures were determined as follows: Urban area_MN for the Han River watershed, rice paddy MN for the Asan watershed, rice paddy CA for Saemangeum, and grassland MN for the Youngsan River watershed. Considering the multifunctionality, redundancy, and connectivity of the resilience strategy, we provide specific coastal infrastructure planning recommendations at the national and watershed scales.

AB  - Green roofs have recently gained recognition for their potential contribution to urban ecosystems by providing, among other services, habitat for plants and animals, and stepping stones for mobile organisms, thereby enhancing permeability among habitat patches across densely built cities. In Switzerland, investigations over the past 20 years on more than one hundred distinct green roofs across six cities have provided an unprecedented dataset on ground beetles, albeit with information that is scattered across unpublished reports and local databases. We present here for the first time a synthesis of the state of knowledge of ground beetle communities from green roofs in Switzerland. We describe 91 ground beetles species (19,428 individuals) and highlight patterns of species occurrence and composition across green roofs and cities. Most of the roofs host ground beetle communities dominated by five common mobile species with quite diversified ecological requirements. In addition, we observed nine species (10% of all species collected) that are conservation concerns in Switzerland and Central Europe as well as numerous stenotopic species (from grasslands and pioneer vegetation). This indicates that, besides sustaining local populations of common species, green roofs can also offer suitable ecological conditions of high conservation interest. We suggest both improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation, as well as soil depth and substrate composition) to increase their ecological value for species with the most different ecological needs, and to integrate green roofs into urban planning to make them more efficient as biodiversity supports.

AB  - Urbanization involves a cocktail of human-induced rapid environmental changes and is forecasted to gain further importance. Urban-heat-island effects result in increased metabolic costs expected to drive shifts towards smaller body sizes. However, urban environments are also characterized by strong habitat fragmentation, often selecting for dispersal phenotypes. Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-mothsan insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal linksat both the community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean body size because of stronger filtering against small species along urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local and landscape scales (50-3,200m radius), depending on the species. Hence, measuressuch as creating and improving urban green infrastructureto mitigate the effects of urbanization on body size will have to be implemented at multiple spatial scales in order to be most effective.

AB  - Selecting urban ecological patches is of great significance for constructing urban green infrastructure network, protecting urban biodiversity and ecological environment. With the support of GIS technology, a criterion for selecting sources of patches was developed according to existing planning Then ecological source patches of terrestrial organism, aquatic and amphibious organism were selected in Wuhan city. To increase the connectivity of the ecological patches and achieve greater ecological protection benefits, the green infrastructure networks in Wuhan city were constructed with the minimum path analysis method. Finally, the characteristics of ecological source patches were analyzed with landscape metrics, and ecological protection importance degree of ecological source patches were evaluated comprehensively. The results showed that there were 23 important ecological source patches in Wuhan city, among which Sushan Temple Forest Patch, Lu Lake and Shangshe Lake Wetland Patch were the most important in all kinds of patches for ecological protection. This study can provide a scientific basis for the preservation of urban ecological space, the delineation of natural conservation areas and the protection of biological diversity.

AB  - Wetlands often form an important component in the urban matrix, where they are largely disseminated. Despite the abundance of these urban waterbodies, little is known about the spread of alien aquatic plant species in cities. Ponds are frequent in urban parks and domestic gardens where terrestrial alien plant species are common. Therefore, urban ponds are likely to support many aquatic alien species which might disperse to the natural environment. To investigate this potential, we collected data from 178 ponds in a large European city (Geneva, Switzerland), across an urbanization gradient. 17% (23 taxa) of the aquatic flora appears to be non-native, including five species at high risk of invasion. A large proportion of the waterbodies (43%) supported at least one alien taxa. Through the development of a risk assessment tool, the "Geneva-Aquatic Weed Risk Assessment system", a risk map was created which revealed several alien species hotspots situated in the urban environment, but also in rural areas, including in protected wetlands. This risk mapping included the dispersal potential distance of species around these risk hotspots, and showed that most areas of dispersal seem to be relatively small. Ponds are target sites for deliberate introduction but they tend to be hydrologically isolated in the urban matrix, and these 'islands' therefore present a relative low risk of a wider dissemination of alien species. This risk is nevertheless expected to sharply increase in future. Introduction by humans is likely to be the main source of new alien aquatic plants, and so management should primarily aim to prevent the introduction of these species. Sites supporting alien species should also be monitored and, if possible, the species presenting a risk should be eradicated. Sites supporting alien species should also be monitored and, if possible, the species presenting a risk eradicated.

AB  - Peri-urban farmland provides a diversity of ecological services. However, it is experiencing increasing pressures from urban sprawl. While the effects of land use associated with farming on arthropod assemblages has received increasing attention, most of this research has been conducted by comparing conventional and organic cropping systems. The present study identifies the effects of urban sprawl and the role of non-cropped habitat in defining arthropod diversity in peri-urban farmed landscapes. Multi-scale arthropod data from 30 sampling plots were used with linear-mixed models to elucidate the effects of distance from urban areas (0-13 km; 13-25 km and >25 km, zones I, II, and III, respectively) on arthropods. Results showed that urban sprawl, disturbed farm landscapes, and disturbance in non-cropped habitats had negative effects on arthropods, the latter requiring arthropods to re-establish annually from surrounding landscapes via dispersal. While arthropod species richness showed no obvious changes, arthropod abundance was lowest in zone II. Generally, patch density (PD), Shannon diversity index (SHDI), and aggregate index (AI) of non-cropped habitat were major drivers of changes in arthropod populations. This study contributes to identifying the effects of urban sprawl on arthropod diversity and documenting the multiple functions of farm landscapes in peri-urban regions.

AB  - Questions: How do plant functional trait abundance and diversity in urban remnants of a rapidly urbanizing city change with fragmentation? Is there a delayed functional response to fragmentation?
   Location: Thirty remnant Banksia woodlands, Perth, Australia.
   Methods: We used GLMM to examine the effects of remnant age and area, and their interaction, on the relative abundance and functional diversity (FD) of five plant functional traits: growth form, pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient acquisition and regeneration strategies. We then used fourth-corner analysis to examine the influence of a wider set of fragmentation-related factors on trait abundances.
   Results: The functional composition and diversity of Banksia woodlands changed with remnant age, particularly in the smaller remnants. Plants more prone to decline with remnant age were the growth form shrubs, root-clustered trees, herbaceous obligate seeders and understorey species that are insect-pollinated, have seeds dispersal internally by animals and have arbuscular or ericoid mycorrhizas. In contrast, plants more prone to persist were growth forms trees, sedges and rushes, ectomycorrhizal trees, herbaceous resprouters, wind-pollinated and root-clustered understorey species. FD increased with remnant age in the growth forms and overstorey, but declined among the herbaceous and shrub pollination and nutrient acquisition traits.
   Conclusions: Functional traits that consistently signalled the plant community response to fragmentation were growth form, pollination and dispersal. This functional response was largely delayed, suggesting a functional extinction debt, which will lead to a further decline of plants with vulnerable trait states in the future, especially in the small- and medium-sized remnants. Our study illustrates the vulnerability of small remnants to changes in community assembly and ecosystem function due to fragmentation. Furthermore, it exemplifies how a functional trait approach is valuable to understand the impacts of urbanization on remnant plant communities, before local extinctions may occur. Finally, the study shows how cities' fragmentation history and biogeographic settings provide an important context influencing plant functional responses to urbanization-related processes.

AB  - Orchid bees are important pollinators in tropical forests. Although studies have already detected effects of habitat loss and forest fragmentation on bee assemblages, little is known about orchid bees in urban forest fragments. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of forest fragments (size and edge index) and landscape features (forest cover area and built-up area around the forest fragments, connectivity and spatial distance from the urban center) on the abundance, richness and composition of orchid bees. Male bees were attracted by odoriferous baits and collected in ten forest fragments of different sizes. In total, we collected 3166 male bees belonging to 4 genera and 38 species. The increase of the built-up area and the reduction of the forest cover area around the forest fragments decreased the abundance and richness of bees. We recorded a smaller number of bees in areas closer to the urban center. We failed to find a significant relationship between abundance/richness of bees and forest fragment area, edge index, and connectivity. We observed that the faunistic dissimilarity was positively correlated with the geographic distance between forest fragments. The forest fragments that presented greater landscape dissimilarity also presented greater faunistic dissimilarity. Our results suggest that the matrix structure around the forest fragments is an important factor that influences the Euglossini bee assemblages inside these forest fragments. Based on our results, we believed that the conservation of fragments with a larger forest cover area and smaller built-up areas around them contribute to the maintenance of the diversity of orchid bees and their pollination services.

AB  - Conservation planning for biodiversity within anthropogenic landscapes is crucial given the rate of habitat conversion and human population growth. Investigating anthropogenic impacts on the persistence of biodiversity is key to management decision-making.
   We investigated the influence of protected areas (PAs), agriculture and urbanisation on the occupancy of mammal communities in an anthropogenic matrix containing indigenous forest fragments of the Coastal Belt of southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
   We integrated camera-trap mammal data, land-use and human population density within occupancy models, and compared occupancy of individual species across the land-use mosaic.
   We modelled occupancy of seven mammal species with sufficient na < ve occupancy (> 0.20, range 0.25-0.87). The occupancy of Philantomba monticola was positively influenced by human population size and was higher within urban areas compared with PAs. Although human population size positively affected Hystrix africaeaustralis occupancy, it along with Atilax paludinosus had a lower occupancy within urban areas. Tragelaphus scriptus and Potamochoerus larvatus overall had higher and Sylvicapra grimmia had lower occupancies within PAs.
   Species were variable in their response to the anthropogenic changes in the landscape. For example, occupancy of P. monticola was low within PAs but high in areas where change in land ownership and loss of habitat are threats. For other species, it appeared that the density of infrastructure of the urban landscape, rather than human population density, affected them negatively. However, seasonal differences within different management regimes also provided context-specific influences on occupancy and detectability. We emphasize the importance of natural vegetation patches within anthropogenic landscapes for maintaining native fauna, whilst stressing the value of temporally replicated, multi-species, regional-scale studies when making conservation decisions.

AB  - The present study debates on the issue of urban regeneration in contemporary cities, adopting a strategic vision which includes the use of vegetation and green infrastructure to create a network of public spaces. Especially, urban periphery lacks of public spaces, meaning a public use of urban space for outdoor activities and social networks.
   The extraordinary program for the Italian peripheries, addressed to all the metropolitan cities and provincial capitals in 2016, inspired to Renzo Piano idea of "resewing" urban fabrics, has been a good opportunity for testing new approaches to urban regeneration. The case study investigated in this study is the financed project for the city of Perugia, which provides different interventions aimed at improving (and developing new) public spaces through vegetation enhancement and a large area destined to vegetable social gardens as a strategy for urban infill. By recovering public spaces with social purpose and providing a comprehensive strategy for aesthetic improvement of the city, the case study provides a representative example, how greening the city may promote together biodiversity conservation and urban regeneration.

AB  - Habitat alteration via urbanization has very different effects on even closely related taxa. Most research investigating the ecological effects of urbanization has focused on birds or mammals, resulting in a relatively poor understanding of how the species richness and community composition of invertebrates may change. We quantified differences in species richness of adult odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) at lentic and lotic sites in urban and rural landscapes, and we examined environmental factors that might drive the differences in community composition that we observed. For lotic sites, species richness did not differ between urban versus rural sites for either dragonflies or damselflies. For lentic sites, urban and rural sites contained similar dragonfly species richness, but damselfly species richness was significantly lower at urban sites than at rural sites. Differences in lentic odonate community composition were associated with the amount of urban development within 150 m of each site, mean algal coverage, and distance to the urban center. At lotic sites, water temperature and distance to the urban center were correlated with differences in odonate community composition. The differing responses to urbanization observed in this study were probably a consequence of differences between lentic versus lotic ecosystems and between dragonflies versus damselflies in dispersal capability and habitat specificity. Given that different environmental factors affected these taxa differently in lentic and lotic sites, maintaining the highest level of odonate diversity possible across a landscape will require the use of different management practices for each ecosystem type.

AB  - Contemporary processes of urbanization have outpaced the traditional notion of city. Connectivity has become a distinctive characteristic of urban spaces, so that networked cities don't rely anymore on continuous urbanized areas, but on connections that rarely leave a direct spatial footprint. The new spatial structure of urban areas include greater inter-penetration of built-up and open spaces, and the emergence of urban enclaves, which can be spatially isolated despite being functionally connected to a city. In order to study these enclaves and their impact on urban form, a sample of 47 Spanish functional urban areas was examined, ranging from 36,000 to 6.0 million inhabitants. Land use polygons provided by SIOSE were grouped into three main categories (residential, non-residential and urban infrastructure) and cross-matched with functional urban areas defined by AUDES (an iterative method than combines morphological and functional criteria) in order to calculate compactness proximity index, gross and net density. Factors that influence urban compactness were identified: most northern and some coastal urban areas display a low compactness which can be attributed to orographic conditions; bigger cities tend to display high compactness, but smaller ones display a great diversity of values, from the highest to the lowest. A further analysis of small and intermediate cities helped to identify two complementary mechanisms of urban growth, spatial expansion of core areas and functional integration of peripheral nuclei, whose ocurrence in different proportions can explain the variation of compactness in the studied sample.

AB  - Land-use changes often facilitate alien species invasion, impacting on biodiversity and ecosystem processes at the regional scale. Transport infrastructure is a potential corridor for biological invasion, but processes underlying invasion of alien species from human settlements along transport networks are uncertain. We surveyed alien and native plant species and their functional traits in roadside vegetation in Shiretoko National Park, Japan. The site is unique because there is a single invasion source (i.e., town). Vegetation, environmental and spatial factors were measured in 362 quadrats on two transects established along roads. Mean species richness within each quadrat (taxonomic alpha-diversity) was higher for alien assemblages, whereas mean functional richness (functional alpha-diversity) was higher for native assemblages. Alien species shared similar traits as generalists, which show lower functional diversity than specialists. Functional alpha-diversity of alien assemblages decreased with increasing distance from the source town, and the nestedness-resultant component of functional beta-diversity of alien assemblages accounted for a relatively high proportion of their total functional beta-diversity. Alien species with high dispersal ability were widely distributed, whereas other alien species were still limited to areas adjacent to the human settlement. Alien species showed a greater probability of having seed floss, lower percentage of perennial species, and lower seed dry mass than native species. Thus, alien species showed superior dispersal and competitive abilities compared with native species, and exclusion of all alien species is likely impractical. Consideration of functional traits may aid selection of alien species of particular concern for implementation of control and extermination measures.

AB  - Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii) have been extending their breeding range into urban areas, prompting questions about the relative importance of cities to the demography and conservation of these raptors. A key unanswered question is how urban subpopulations interact with their precedent exurban subpopulations. Two general models have been proposed to describe relationships among subpopulations in a metapopulation: (1) source-sink, where immigrants from sources sustain sinks; and (2) balanced dispersal, where dispersal is proportionally equal among subpopulations. I evaluated whether either of these models predict metapopulation dynamics of urban and exurban Cooper's Hawks in central New Mexico using demographic data in a Bayesian integrated population model. All urban female Cooper's Hawks began breeding in their first year; 69% settled at nests in the urban subpopulation and 31% emigrated and settled in an exurban subpopulation. The high rate of female emigration was likely because of a shortage of breeding urban males, caused by a 1 yr delay in male age-at-first-breeding. Emigration exceeded immigration by nearly 30%, making a balanced-dispersal model implausible. Although the urban subpopulation was a source, the primary recipient subpopulation was not a sink; urban emigrants appeared to have a competitive advantage obtaining exurban nest sites. High urban winter prey abundance supported year-long residency among urban female Cooper's Hawks, whereas nearly all exurban females migrated. Resident urban females that emigrated settled on exurban nesting territories before migrants returned, and thus without direct competition from them. Previous metapopulation models do not incorporate the concept that differences in dispersal behavior between subpopulations can drive dispersal dynamics in a metapopulation. These findings provide further evidence that patch dynamics in a metapopulation can be complex, and may be governed by factors other than just demographic rates and connectivity.

AB  - As most of Europe's metropolitan landscapes grow, a change is occurring in their surrounding rural environment. The consequences thereof mainly involve losses of traditional land uses and changes in the socioecomic structures of the local population. The lack of coupling urban society-countryside' can be considered to constitute a driving force of this process. The present paper focuses upon the rural-urban network around the metropolis of Madrid (Central Spain). We developed a quantitative model to explain the socio-ecological rural-urban linkages, taking into account the influence of the metropolis in the network of neighbouring municipalities. The results show a rural landscape gradient ranging from silvo-pastoral to agricultural land uses and maintaining different interactions with the local socioeconomy. Urban-rural polarisation of the territory and accessibility to the metropolis are the main factors influencing the landscape dynamics. Territorial cohesion among municipalities and connectivity with the metropolis are factors determining the socio-ecological structure. The agricultural area presents good social cohesion, but a weak connection with the City. The silvo-pastoral landscape, on the contrary, maintains prominent links with the metropolis, but a non-significant interconnection between the small towns. The model tested constitutes a useful tool for analysing socio-ecological connectivity and for quantifying, designing and promoting territorial cohesion policies.

AB  - Being major transportation infrastructure of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the impacts of railways on cities have highly directed urban studies,. deforming material edge of cities, encouraging urban extension, forming new territories, and speeding up urban development. However, in recent decades, with newly emerging landscape infrastructure practice, a new idea for a more integrated infrastructure and landscape system has started to be formulated. Railway strips, occurring as territories where solid-void morphology of cities becomes illegible, emerge as generators in the formation of urban green network. Within this framework, Ankara commuter line that mark outs a route approximately 37 kilometers in length in the city, is a remarkable case for a motivating discussion on railway and landscape confrontation. Penetrating the city in east-west direction, the commuter line integrated with a rural landscape -covering orchards, truck gardens and creeks- that was serving as a recreational field for citizens until 1950s. However, the transformative nature of the railway encouraged the development of new urban lands, industrial areas and neighborhoods along its route, and erased the characteristic landscape fabric. The continuous landscape integrated with green, water and railway infrastructure became fragmented covering only some splits of green and water. In this respect, this study dwells on the lost landscape of the commuter line by mapping the fragmented continuity of the railway, green and water infrastructure from 1950's until today to show the limited, but potential interaction of these three systems in the current urban fabric.

AB  - With cities growing at a rapid pace, animal species must either retreat to patches of intact natural habitat or adapt to novel conditions in urban areas. While this disturbance causes most species to be in local decline, some show specific behavioural plasticity, facilitating success in a new habitat. The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a common small mammal species which occurs in high numbers in urban environments. To determine which characteristics enable its success, we investigated space use and activity budgets of seven free-ranging individuals living in semi-natural and urban habitats within a large city. We did not find significant differences in animals' space use between habitat types but tendencies towards smaller home ranges and increased home range overlap existed among individuals in the urban site. Squirrels differed between sites in both overall activity levels and temporal activity patterns: urban animals spent less time active and activity onset was later compared to semi-natural conspecifics. This is likely explained by a combination of dense and reliable supplementary food sources in the urban habitat, reducing foraging effort, and restrictions to movement imposed by higher fragmentation. Flexibility in space use and activity budgets, as well as the ability to exploit anthropogenic food sources and tolerate reduced habitat connectivity, are likely the most important factors contributing to the squirrels' success in cities. Accordingly, these traits could be used as indicators of low sensitivity towards urbanisation when assessing other species' potential resilience. However, they do not immunise squirrels against extirpation. Further research on individuals' foraging ecology and population health may reveal possible threats to urban red squirrels and help predict their future persistence in this challenging habitat.

AB  - Ecologists have many ways to measure and monitor ecosystems, each of which can reveal details about the processes unfolding therein. Acoustic recording combined with machine learning methods for species detection can provide remote, automated monitoring of species richness and relative abundance. Such recordings also open a window into how species behave and compete for niche space in the sensory environment. These opportunities are associated with new challenges: the volume and velocity of such data require new approaches to species identification and visualization. Here we introduce a newly-initiated acoustic monitoring network across the subtropical island of Okinawa, Japan, as part of the broader OKEON (Okinawa Environmental Observation Network) project. Our aim is to monitor the acoustic environment of Okinawa's ecosystems and use these space-time data to better understand ecosystem dynamics. We present a pilot study based on recordings from five field sites conducted over a one-month period in the summer. Our results provide a proof of concept for automated species identification on Okinawa, and reveal patterns of biogenic vs. anthropogenic noise across the landscape. In particular, we found correlations between forest land cover and detection rates of two culturally important species in the island soundscape: the Okinawa Rail and Ruddy Kingfisher. Among the soundscape indices we examined, NDSI, Acoustic Diversity and the Bioacoustic Index showed both diurnal patterns and differences among sites. Our results highlight the potential utility of remote acoustic monitoring practices that, in combination with other methods can provide a holistic picture of biodiversity. We intend this project as an open resource, and wish to extend an invitation to researchers interested in scientific collaboration.

AB  - Human population growth is a major cause of species extinction worldwide, and tropical fresh waters are among the most imperilled ecosystems. The identification of major drivers of human impacts on fish can benefit conservation programmes and management plans. The influences of the proximity to urban centres and human population size on six ecological indicators of fish communities (abundance, biomass, richness, diversity, average size, and size dominance pattern) were investigated in 48 floodplain lakes of five main rivers of the Brazilian Amazon (Tocantins, Tapajos, Negro, Solimoes, and the Lower Amazon). These ecological indicators were also compared among the rivers studied and checked for any influence of the environmental variables of lakes (size, shape of natural shoreline, distance to the main river channel, depth, transparency, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen). Lake distance to urban centre was positively related to average fish size and dominance of large fish, indicating direct human effects caused by fisheries or indirect effects by habitat alteration (e.g. deforestation). Unexpected positive relationships between human population size and the richness and diversity of fishes were found, and may be caused by ecological compensatory effects, the abundance of rare non-fished species, or the proximity of an urban centre to ecotone areas. The other ecological indicators were unrelated to anthropogenic variables. Environmental factors affected fish communities, but did not change the conclusions regarding the effect of the anthropogenic variables. River basin was strongly related to species richness, diversity, biomass, and abundance of fish. Distance to the river channel was positively related to fish biomass. The disappearance of large fish threatens the food security of riverine communities, and may harm essential ecosystem services. Conservation measures, including local management initiatives, protected areas, fisheries monitoring, and the enforcement of existing fishing rules need to be improved or established near urban centres in order to restore healthy fish communities in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB  - Instream barriers (e.g. dams, weirs and road crossings) fragment aquatic habitat and prevent the upstream movement of fish, impairing the ability of fishes to complete critical life stages, access critical habitat and for dispersal among local populations. Mitigation efforts have improved aquatic connectivity to some degree, but it has been challenging to quantify the overall improvement in connectivity without long-term and costly field assessments. The development of spatially explicit habitat connectivity indices make it possible to evaluate current stream connectivity, and quantify the improvement prior mitigation projects have had on connectivity. We combined a list of instream barrier mitigation projects completed in five watersheds in the Toronto (Ontario, Canada) area from 1987-2016 (mitigated barriers) and a previously established inventory of all known instream barriers in 2016 (current barriers). The cumulative improvement to connectivity was measured for potadromous (remain in tributaries) and diadromous (move between tributaries and lake) fish species using the dendritic connectivity index. Aquatic connectivity improved for diadromous species between 0 and 14.5% and for potadromous species between 0.1 and 4.4% in the five studied watersheds. Some variation in improvement among the watersheds can likely be attributed to differences in mitigation strategies among the watersheds and a historical emphasis on mitigating instream barriers to benefit migratory salmonid species.

AB  - This paper describes a novel methodology for identifying critical nodes in urban public transportation networks. The methodology, which is based on graph theory, transportation and urban planning, seeks to optimize the use of city resources. The term "criticality" is defined in terms of the connectivity and activity density of a transportation node over time. The connectivity of a node is defined by the operational characteristics of the system (e.g., vehicle capacity, velocity, distance and frequency) whereas the urban activity density is based on urban planning indicators (e.g., population density, land use and urban form) along with the time factor. These two components are used to create the enhanced connectivity index that reflects the interaction between a transportation network and an urban environment. Detecting critical nodes in a transportation network over time is important because knowledge about the nodes that are likely to be more occupied supports strategy development, public resource management and funding prioritization. Moreover, the enhanced connectivity index can be used to enhance the intelligence of existing transportation systems. The application of the methodology to the bus system of a medium-sized city provides valuable insights into the spatial and temporal distributions of critical nodes. The results demonstrate that node criticality fluctuates considerably over time, because nodes with high activity during the morning hours are less critical during the evening hours, and vice versa. Additionally, high functional connectivity does not necessarily imply high node criticality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Considering that urban expansion and increase of human activities represent important threats to biodiversity and ecological processes in short and long term, developing protected area (PA) network with high connectivity is considered as a valuable conservation strategy. However, conservation planning associated with the large-scale network in China involves important information loopholes about the land cover and landscape connectivity. In this paper, we made an integrative analysis for the identification of conservation priority areas and least-cost ecological corridors (ECs) in order to promote a more representative, connected and efficient ecological PA network for this country. First, we used Zonation, a spatial prioritization software, to achieve a hierarchical mask and selected the top priority conservation areas. Second, we identified optimal linkages between two patches as corridors based on least-cost path algorithm. Finally, we proposed a new framework of China's PA network composed of conservation priority and ECs in consideration of high connectivity between areas. We observed that priority areas identified here cover 12.9% of the region, distributed mainly in mountainous and plateau areas, and only reflect a spatialmismatch of 19% with the current China's nature reserves locations. Fromthe perspective of conservation, our result provide the need to consider new PA categories, specially located in the south (e.g., the middle-lower Yangtze River area, Nanling and Min-Zhe-Gan Mountains) and north regions (e.g., Changbai Mountains), in order to construct an optimal and connected national network in China. This information allows us better opportunities to identify the relative high-quality patches and draft the best conservation plan for the China's biodiversity in the long-term run.

AB  - An accurate description of spatial urban growth is a prerequisite step in order to implement appropriated policies to improve the ecosystem service performance of green spaces in a city. Such information is, however, absent in Lubumbashi, the second metropolis of the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite its high demographic growth rate and an unplanned spatial urban growth. This study was designed to characterize the spatial pattern of green spaces and the extent of changes driven by the urbanization along the urban-rural gradient using a combination of landscape metrics and floristic plots. Our results revealed that the number of patches was directly proportional to the degree of urbanization of the city, whereas the area of the green spaces and the index of the largest patch showed an inverse relationship with the urbanization degree. Urban green spaces were dominated by attached and roadside spaces that are more equipped and present a higher occurrence of cultivated plants. By contrast, peri-urban green spaces were characterized by buffer zones, fields, abandoned areas, and informal spaces, with an elevated proportion of invasive species and natural vegetation. Moreover, it was found that the number of exotic species increased with the degree of urbanization, reaching values considered a threat to the indigenous flora. The current results underline the need for urgent measures oriented both toward increasing the spatial connectivity between green spaces (e.g., by creating new green spaces planted with indigenous species) while reducing the spread of invasive species in the city.

AB  - Green roofs are important green spaces in order to improve vegetated area in urban landscapes. They can support ecosystem functionality, including stormwater management, cooling and insulation of buildings, moderation of urban heat island effect, contribution to human health and habitat provisioning. In addition they provide habitats in areas deprived of natural wildlife areas, providing green corridors linking fragmented existing habitats, improve wildlife movement and dispersal, thereby increasing population connectivity and act as refuges for declining or rare species. Unfortunately populations living in urban areas continue to rise and are expected to reach 61% in 2030, which is likely to negatively impact urban green spaces. The aim of this research was to investigate the importance of green roof systems on urban biodiversity. A literature review was undertaken to discover the importance of green roof systems on urban biodiversity. Additionally, feasibility analysis of the planting project of possible extensive green roof application in semi-arid climatic conditions of Cyprus was carried out. Positive effects of the plants on the roof are also discussed. Feasibility analysis was carried out for the NEU car factory management building which was planned as 820 m(2). The following plant species have been suggested for the vegetation of sustainable green roof system in Cyprus; Sedum angelina, Sedum spurium, Sedum glaucophyllum, Thymus vulgaris, Santolina spp., Gaura lindheimeri, Lavandula angustifolia, Rosmarinus officinalis. According to research results 820 m(2) of extensive green roof will cost approximately 37107 Euro. Under Cyprus climatic conditions, this cost analysis estimated that extensive green roof application would cost around 49 Euro per square meter. This research provides valuable information for the importance of green roof establishments within the Mediterranean cityscapes and also has suggestions of vegetation types and roof layers for future green roof projects for the Mediterranean region.

AB  - Body size is intrinsically linked to metabolic rate and life-history traits, and is a crucial determinant of food webs and community dynamics(1,2). The increased temperatures associated with the urban-heat-island effect result in increased metabolic costs and are expected to drive shifts to smaller body sizes'. Urban environments are, however, also characterized by substantial habitat fragmentation', which favours mobile species. Here, using a replicated, spatially nested sampling design across ten animal taxonomic groups, we show that urban communities generally consist of smaller species. In addition, although we show urban warming for three habitat types and associated reduced community-weighted mean body sizes for four taxa, three taxa display a shift to larger species along the urbanization gradients. Our results show that the general trend towards smaller-sized species is overruled by filtering for larger species when there is positive covariation between size and dispersal, a process that can mitigate the low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings(5). We thus demonstrate that the urban-heat-island effect and urban habitat fragmentation are associated with contrasting community-level shifts in body size that critically depend on the association between body size and dispersal. Because body size determines the structure and dynamics of ecological networks(1), such shifts may affect urban ecosystem function.

AB  - Community-driven vertical greenery provides a previously under-appreciated resource that could be an important component of tropical urban ecology. While the corridors of buildings have been designed to facilitate the circulation of residents between spaces, this study shows that such corridors incidentally served as an informal space for community-driven vertical greenery. Across 1.86 ha of surveyed corridors, a total of 265 plant species and cultivars were present, with an average richness of 124 species per hectare. This is beneficial to urban ecology through its high species diversity, occurrence of endangered and vulnerable native species. Based on a classification of specific plant attributes referenced from literature, provision of food and medicinal resources (77.5%), and aesthetic benefits (72.3%) were the key ecosystem services provided by the species present. Community-driven vertical greenery could function as refugia for native species of conservation interest through providing an additional buffer against further losses in the wild. It also provides immediate opportunities for interactions between humans and nature. This study finds that corridors with larger areas and simpler geometries typically hold a higher abundance of plant pots. Future efforts to increase the abundance and diversity of vertical greenery, and its concomitant increase in the provision of ecosystem services, could be driven by local communities, rather than be formally planned by landscape architects, engineers and urban planners.

AB  - Traditional culture of Kanazawa, is mainly derived from the biological diversity of the city. Linkage between the bio-cultural diversity can be clearly observed in the gardens and tea-ceremonies. Gardens considered as unique hubs for urban biodiversity, provide the habitant for the diverse network of living organism. They facilitate the movement of the species around the urban landscape, i.e became the refuge for the moss and many endangered species in the city. Besides, for the centuries these gardens were linked with the traditional cultures, such as Tea ceremonies, and construction of traditional Tea Houses. In this study we have decided that gardens and tea ceremonies would be ideal places and practices, to raise the awareness on the linkage between the biological and cultural diversity, and conduct participatory educational fieldtrips for 12 international students into five historic gardens of Kanazawa with different designation in the preserved levels. Fieldtrips were as following: sensually observed (visual and listening) of traditional and modern gardens, hands-on practices like cleaning, tea-ceremony performances, traditional architectures and visiting community centers. After the courses students have found a strong linkage between traditional culture with the sustainable living. Besides, the senses like appreciation and attachment to the traditional culture were increased after the fieldtrips, and motivations to take care after those traditional assets was raised. Moreover, students submitted the recommendations and classified the learned aspects within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Fieldworks into the traditional sites of the city helped to raise the awareness on urban bio-cultural diversity, however on future studies we need to conduct more analysis to link traditional culture with modernized urban development.

AB  - Edges are ecologically important environmental features and have been well researched in agricultural and urban landscapes. However, little work has been conducted in flammable ecosystems where spatially and temporally dynamic fire edges are expected to influence important processes such as recolonization of burnt areas and landscape connectivity. We review the literature on fire, fauna, and edge effects to summarize current knowledge of faunal responses to fire edges and identify knowledge gaps. We then develop a conceptual model to predict faunal responses to fire edges and present an agenda for future research. Faunal abundance at fire edges changes over time, but patterns depend on species traits and resource availability. Responses are also influenced by edge architecture (e.g., size and shape), site and landscape context, and spatial scale. However, data are limited and the influence of fire edges on both local abundance and regional distributions of fauna is largely unknown. In our conceptual model, biophysical properties interact with the fire regime (e.g., patchiness, frequency) to influence edge architecture. Edge architecture and species traits influence edge permeability, which is linked to important processes such as movement, resource selection, and species interactions. Predicting the effect of fire edges on fauna is challenging, but important for biodiversity conservation in flammable landscapes. Our conceptual model combines several drivers of faunal fire responses (biophysical properties, regime attributes, species traits) and will therefore lead to improved predictions. Future research is needed to understand fire as an agent of edge creation; the spatio-temporal flux of fire edges across landscapes; and the effect of fire edges on faunal movement, resource selection, and biotic interactions. To aid the incorporation of new data into our predictive framework, our model has been designed as a Bayesian Network, a statistical tool capable of analyzing complex environmental relationships, dealing with data gaps, and generating testable hypotheses.

AB  - Regional-scale pond diversity is supported by high variation in community composition. To effectively and efficiently conserve pond regional diversity, it is essential to recognize the community types in a focal region and the scales of the factors influencing the occurrence of respective community types. Based on a flora survey and GIS analysis of 367 ponds in western Japan, we developed a multinomial regression model that describes the relationship between aquatic macrophyte community type (based on cluster analysis) and five environmental factors that differ in the spatial scale at which they operate (i.e., landscape or local scale) and origin (i.e., natural or anthropogenic). A change in topographic configuration resulted in a transition of the community types with high species richness. Increasing urban and agricultural area around ponds resulted in a decrease in species-rich community occurrence; an increase in urban area increased the probability of a pond having no macrophytes, whereas that of paddy field increased the probability of a pond having only a few macrophytes. Pond surface area and proportion of artificial embankment significantly defined the pond community: greater embankment proportions increased the probability of ponds having few or no macrophytes. Our results suggest that conserving regional pond biodiversity will require actions not only at a local scale but also at a sufficiently large spatial scale to cover the full gradient of topographic configurations that influence the macrophyte species composition in ponds.

AB  - In urban development, the difference of construction time series and the diversity of the aesthetic standard all lead to the fragmentation of the urban landscape and the lack of effective integration. The research on urban landscape design based on sustainable development innovation was put forward in this paper. The background of the development of urban landscape design was expounded firstly, and the development status of urban landscape design under the concept of sustainable development innovation was introduced; then the urban landscape design method under the concept of sustainable development was put forward, and the urban landscape planning and design of a city was taken as an example and divided into three functional areas; in addition, the stereoscopic traffic planning, the landscape corridor design and the landscape design planning of water system were proposed. This study is of certain guiding significance for the actual urban landscape planning design.

AB  - Cities are increasingly considered important places for biodiversity conservation because they can harbor threatened species and because conservation in cities represents an opportunity to reconnect people with nature and the range of health and well-being benefits it provides. However, urbanization can be catastrophic for native species, and is a well-known threat to biodiversity worldwide. Urbanization impacts can be mitigated by urban design and development improvements, but take-up of these practices has been slow. There is an urgent need to incorporate existing ecological knowledge into a framework that can be used by planners and developers to ensure that biodiversity conservation is considered in decision-making processes. Here, we distill the urban biodiversity literature into five principles for biodiversity sensitive urban design (BSUD), ranging from creating habitat and promoting dispersal to facilitating community stewardship. We then present a framework for implementing BSUD aimed at delivering onsite benefits to biodiversity, and that is applicable across a range of urban development types and densities. We illustrate the application of the BSUD framework in two case studies focusing on the: (1) protection of an endangered vegetation remnant in a new low-density subdivision; and (2) persistence of an endangered reptile in an established suburban environment.

AB  - Urban vegetation is an essential requirement in cities for mitigating pollution, heat island effects and providing food and shelter to urban fauna. Efforts to conserve and augment green cover in cities, however, often lack data on the genetic diversity of urban trees, which could be crucial to the success of such programmes. We investigate the population genetics of the cluster fig Ficus racemosa, which occurs naturally in Indian cities and is a keystone species for urban fauna. Genetic analysis of 51 F. racemosa trees in urban Bangalore, India, shows no evidence of inbreeding; the overall inbreeding coefficient (F (is) ) across 12 microsatellite markers (0.0366) was non-significant with no evidence of heterozygote deficit. Spatial genetic structure (SGS) analysis of 47 trees showed an overall negative relationship between kinship coefficient and spatial distance, with strong SGS at distances < 1 km. The absence of heterozygote deficit is likely due to the fig's obligate mutualistic association with fig wasps which pollinate their flowers even across long distances. However, the strong SGS at short distances could result from clumped seed dispersal close to natal trees. Therefore, the pattern of population genetics for F. racemosa from urban Bangalore likely results from short-distance seed dispersal and long-distance pollen flow. Despite the scattered and fragmented nature of green areas within cities, these gene mobility factors maintain robust population genetics in F. racemosa even at low population densities. The same may not apply for Ficus species that are planted as vegetative cuttings in cities and therefore may have limited genetic diversity.

AB  - Biological communities are increasingly faced with novel urban habitats and their response may depend on a combination of biological and habitat traits. The response of pollinator species to urban habitats are of particular importance because all species involved in the pollination mutualism may be affected. Nectarivorous bird communities worldwide show varying tolerances to urban areas, but studies from Africa are lacking. We investigated nectarivorous bird communities in a medium-sized South African city and asked which biological and garden traits best predict the community assembly of specialist and opportunistic nectarivorous birds. Information was collected on garden traits and the frequency of nine nectarivorous bird species for 193 gardens by means of a questionnaire. Information on biological traits of birds was obtained from published literature. Habitat generalism and tree nesting were identified as the most important biological traits influencing bird occurrence in gardens. A greater diversity of indigenous bird-pollinated plants and the presence of sugar water feeders increased the numbers of nectar specialist birds and species richness of nectarivorous birds. While bird baths increased the species richness of nectar specialist birds, opportunistic birds' urban adjustment was further facilitated by large vegetated areas in gardens and limited by the distance to the nearest natural habitat. In conclusion, though some biological traits and dispersal barriers seem to limit urban adjustment, a combination of natural and artificial nectar resource provisioning could facilitate this adjustment.

AB  - Globally, many natural grasslands are becoming increasingly urbanised, with non-native plants invading as local and regional environmental attributes are altered. Using multiple linear regression models, we examined the functional trait composition of non-native plants in 69 native urban grasslands in Melbourne, Australia, against the spatial attributes of remnant patches and the surrounding road network at multiple spatial scales. We predicted that (1) urbanisation favours non-native plants with evolved characteristics conferring resistance to urban environments, (2) high road density in the immediate vicinity of remnants drives high non-native functional diversity, and (3) non-native plants that spread and become abundant do so through an investment in competitive traits. Non-native plants contributed to 31% of total grassland cover, with regionally widespread species dominant within sites. Non-native perennial grass cover, rather than annual grass cover, was positively associated with road density across the urban landscape, and community-weighted Specific Leaf Area was negatively associated with road density. At local scales, non-native plant functional diversity was positively associated with road density in the immediate vicinity of grasslands. Urbanisation favoured non-native plants invested in persistence over resource acquisition, potentially in response to the urban climate and declines in fire frequency. Re-introducing historic fire regimes may therefore have the potential to be a key strategy in reducing competition from non-native plants. High non-native functional diversity in areas of high local road density was the expected response to high propagule pressure. Urban planning that protects grasslands from road encroachment may therefore reduce invasion.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical study of the globalizing urban landscape in the post-Soviet region. In order to understand the position of cities in relation to each other in the context of economic globalization, the study considers the transnational city network in the post-Soviet region. At the center of analysis are the locational strategies of global service firms operating in the former Soviet cities. We adapt the interlocking network model proposed by the Globalization and World Cities research (GaWC) network to the regional level to uncover the interurban relations. Unlike the classical studies of the GaWC, this study focuses on the analysis of intraregional spatial patterns of globalization. The research shows that the globalizing regional city system is in the midst of substantial restructuring and that the state of former Soviet Union (FSU) cities in relation to Moscow is altering. The integration of FSU cities into the global economy mostly occurs through capital cities. However, under the current political and economic circumstances, the position of each capital city within the region has become diversified. The analysis indicates that the globalization of cities within a particular region reproduces similar processes on a world scale, which are characterized by spatial concentration and hierarchical relations. However, our research has shown that patterns of urban globalization at the regional level significantly depend on the historical context and national economic and political tendencies, thus creating conditions for the penetration of the world economy into cities.

AB  - The establishment of protected areas is one of the most common environmental policy tools which can effectively contribute to landscape protection, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem services provision. In this sense, the Brazilian Law on Native Vegetation Protection establishes the legal reserves, mandatory protected spaces within private rural lands, which seek to maintain and restore ecological functions and promote biodiversity conservation. This paper aims to present an approach that attempted to locate potential protected spaces, in the form of legal reserves, in the East Zone of Ribeirao Preto - a recharge zone of the Guarani Aquifer System. We made use of seven criteria to create five possible scenarios with varying priorities for native vegetation protection or restoration. Then, we used eight landscape metrics, as well as the level of compliance with the law, to discuss the viability of each scenario in terms of ecological thresholds and landscape indicators. We found only one scenario (the broader perspective on recovering the natural vegetation corridors) capable of meeting the ecological and legal requirements. We conclude that using less data-demanding methods, such as the one applied in this research, could be useful in assisting decision-making regarding the selection of areas for conservation or restoration.

AB  - To accommodate for increase in human population, development of cities and urban areas is necessary. This call for changes in land use. The transition from natural to build environment has affected the natural landscape in many ways; one of which is pollution. Consequently, the native biodiversity within the urban landscape is stressed to maintain an optimum level of ecosystem service in order to sustain ecological integrity. This is where the urban green lung plays its role; to provide for carbon sequestration, oxygen generation, acting as filters to noise and dust, and offers aesthetical values. The study area, Bukit Soga Perdana Recreational Forest is a well-known green lung of Batu Pahat, Johor; the second largest industrial town in Johor. This paper aims to study the biodiversity of butterflies in Bukit Soga and discusses its impact on the urban ecological landscape. Species abundance and habitat characterization based on plant nativity, canopy and vegetation coverage, and disturbance type analysis such as human pressure, were studied. Collection resulted in 43 species of butterflies. Total abundance was 88 individuals, sampled throughout Dec to June 2017. Majority are primary forest species that requires adequate canopy coverage. As for plants, in Bukit Soga most are native with exception to the herbs garden. Surprisingly, habitat disturbance such as human movement does not affect the spatial distribution of primary or secondary forest butterfly species. However, their distribution is largely affected by canopy coverage, as it should be. This suggests that despite the growing recreational activities in Bukit Soga, this urban green lung still play an important role in maintaining the ecological integrity in Batu Pahat.

AB  - Most Chinese cities face a series of 'urban diseases' or problems during rapid urbanization, and of which urban precipitation and subsequent water-logging is a severe hotspot. A better understanding of the influence of urban land-use patterns on water-logging will be helpful for enhancing urban flood resistance. The relationship between the characteristics of land-use patterns and the risk of urban water-logging and flood disaster (UWLFD) was analyzed in this paper, using landscape pattern indicators to describe the land-use structure. These included patch density (PD), edge density (ED), landscape division index (DIVISION), contagion (CONTAG), Shannon's evenness index (SHEI), and Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). The risk of UWLFD was measured using the topographic slope and urban surface cover. Based on GIS and remote sensing data in 2003 and 2013, a case study of the metropolitan region of Kunming City showed that the risk of UWLFD had a positive correlation with landscape fragmentation (e.g., PD and ED), and strong negative correlation with landscape contagion (e.g., CONTAG) during the study period. This implied that landscape fragmentation aggravated the risk of UWLFD while landscape connectivity reduced the risk. Measures such as unified and long-term urban planning and design and the construction of green infrastructure will reduce the risk of UWLFD. The relationship between the landscape pattern and the risk of UWLFD provides a new perspective for systematic urban planning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species assemblages are related to environmental factors acting at different landscape scales. Local habitat heterogeneity also contributes to maintain the regional species pool. Understanding factors determining species presence is therefore crucial for formulation of successful conservation and management strategies. Odonates can reveal much about patterns of species assemblages since their presence at a site reflects both their dispersal ability and life cycle constraints. Odonate assemblages were studied at 31 ponds located in three different landscapes: forest, urban and field. The impact of pond geographical distribution and their local characteristics (i.e., vegetation, suspended matter, freshwater macroinvertebrates, pond area and temporariness) on odonate composition, species richness and larval presence were studied. According to their intrinsic requirements, damselfly and dragonfly presence on ponds depended on local characteristics. Some species of the two orders were only detected in field or forest ponds. Moreover, some species were never detected in urban ponds. Differences in odonate assemblages were mainly related to vegetation, freshwater macroinvertebrates and pond area. Species richness was related to predator abundance and pond area, especially for dragonflies. The presence and abundance of odonate larvae were both related to aquatic vegetation, and to contrasted aquatic variables of ponds. Therefore, this study confirms that vegetation within and around ponds determines odonate presence. Interestingly, in a pond, species detected at the adult stage were not always detected at the larval stage, highlighting the need to really consider both parts of the lifecycle when studying odonate assemblages. Diversity of local habitats within and around ponds depends strongly on the surrounding landscape and influences the assembly of odonates. Forest and field ponds presented particularly dissimilar species assemblages. Urban ponds had no specific environmental habitats compared to the other contexts. Species present on these ponds are rather generalist and able to support human disturbances. Overall, this study confirms that pond heterogeneity may be a key factor in maintaining the regional pool of odonate species.

AB  - As urban areas continue expanding, major cities become connected forming megacities. Urban encroachment into natural areas transforms the landscape into a built environment with heterogeneously distributed patches of novel habitat. Community structure within novel habitats is influenced by anthropogenic factors including fragmentation and species interactions. Alterations in complex biodiversity patterns may be used to assess how urban stressors impact community assemblages which, ultimately, may inform sustainable management decisions. To manage algal blooms, Aquashade (R) is applied directly to ponds. We investigated the effects of Aquashade (R), nutrient loading and dispersal on local species diversity and compositional turnover of zooplankton communities from suburban ponds in Columbia, MD, USA using a mesocosm approach. We found that Aquashade (R) acted as an environmental filter by increasing local species diversity and decreasing compositional turnover. This ultimately could have an overall homogenizing effect on the regional species pool (or gamma-diversity). The same pattern was observed in mesocosms that received simulated dispersal events of zooplankton. Nutrients, overall, increased autotrophic biomass andwhile Aquashade (R) had no effect on autotrophic biomass, the interaction of nutrients and Aquashade (R) similarly caused a homogenization of the zooplankton community. Additionally, there was an overall increase in cladoceran ephippia in mesocosms receiving Aquashade (R) compared to those not, suggesting there is a 'trigger' switching cladocerans from parthenogenic to sexual reproduction. Taken together, our results show the application of Aquashade (R), nutrient loading and dispersal shift biodiversity patterns in urban zooplankton communities. We hypothesize these shifts originate at the resource level through alterations in the phytoplankton community either through composition or nutritive value in ponds receiving Aquashade (R). Our study illustrates the importance of investigating multiple-scales of community assemblages when assessing impacts of anthropogenic stressors. Consideration of how to best manage green spacesmay include planned un-managed areas to maintain regional biodiversity and heterogenous communities within the urban environment.

AB  - Green roofs are valuable ecosystems that enhance the biodiversity value of urban landscapes in northern Alberta. Using pitfall traps on green roofs and adjacent ground sites, we show that roof arthropods are characteristic of native grasslands that are threatened in Alberta. Although we found lower abundance of spiders and carabids on roofs, species richness as assessed by rarefaction did not differ between roof and nearby ground sites. Thus, arthropod communities of these extensive green roofs do not seem to be impoverished compared to ground habitats, despite differences in local environmental variables (e.g. substrate depth, surface, vertical isolation). Seasonal distribution of larval and adult captures in pitfall traps, and observation of egg sacs in spiders suggest that a number of species have established reproducing populations on these green roofs. Interestingly, carabid assemblages differed markedly in species composition between roofs and ground sites, but spider assemblages were much more similar. We explain this in relation to differences in dispersal ability between these taxa. Green roofs are likely valuable for urban conservation allowing native species characteristic of native grasslands to permeate through urban landscapes.

AB  - Background and aims - In spite of the cosmopolitan distributions of myxomycetes, relatively few studies have been conducted in subtropical forests of Southeast Asia particularly in Northern Vietnam, where comprehensive reports of myxomycetes are lacking up to this date. Hence. a rapid biodiversity assessment was conducted in protected and unprotected plantation forests of Thai Nguyen City to compare the species composition of myxomycete communities between the two different forest management types.
   Methods - A total of 360 substrate samples were haphazardly collected within 5 m x 5 m plots established within three protected and three unprotected forests. The moist chamber cultures prepared from these samples were regularly checked for myxomycete fructifications over a period of 12 weeks. Analyses of diversity (species richness) and community composition were performed using the software EstimateS and the vegan package in R.
   Key results - The study yielded a total of 505 records representing 54 species belonging to 17 genera. All species recorded herein were new records for Northern Vietnam:, among them five were new for the entire country. The rarefaction curves showed higher numbers of myxomycete species to be expected for protected forest (43.0) in comparison to unprotected forests (39.4). However, calculations of species diversity indices showed higher values in unprotected forest than in protected forest. The species composition between the two forest types showed clear overlaps with many shared (56%) species.
   Conclusions - Forest conservation strategies do not affect freely dispersing myxomycetes implicating that spore dispersal of myxomycetes is caused not only by natural factors but also by anthropogenic activities. The production of high number of myxomycete species for this study seems to point out that the subtropical forests of Vietnam harbours many undiscovered myxomycete species for Southeast Asia.

AB  - Urbanisation is causing rapid land-use change worldwide. Populations of freshwater turtles are vulnerable to impacts of urbanisation such as habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, because many species require interconnected aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Understanding the processes that underpin survival in urban areas is critical in managing species that may vary in their responses to urbanisation. Here, we conducted a mark-recapture study of a common freshwater turtle (Chelodina longicollis) at 20 wetlands over five years across a broad geographical gradient in a large and expanding Australian city. Our aim was to examine relationships between survival and a broad suite of local and landscape environmental variables, and body condition. Using capture-recapture models, we found a positive relationship between the probability of survival of C. longicollis and the proportion of green open space in a 1-km radius around a wetland. There was a positive relationship between survival of female C. longicollis and body condition. Survival probabilities generally did not differ substantially among males, females or juveniles, or seasons. We found evidence of adult turtle mortality resulting from recreational fishing. Our results demonstrate the importance of terrestrial habitat surrounding wetlands for freshwater turtle survival in an urban environment. Our results suggest that management actions for C. longicollis in urban areas need to protect green spaces surrounding wetlands (e.g. parks and remnant vegetation) and discourage human actions that threaten turtle survival. Our study adds to mounting evidence that conserving freshwater turtle populations in urban areas requires managers to consider life cycle requirements over broad spatiotemporal scales.

AB  - Green roofs, especially productive ones (e.g. of edible biomass), are urban ecosystems developed in response to the scarcity of arable areas in urban environments. Their installation is also perceived as a possible way to preserve biodiversity in cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting biodiversity, especially soil biodiversity, has rarely been studied. In order to orient the ecological engineering of green roofs, it is crucial to understand the resulting biodiversity patterns. We hypothesised that a functional trait-based approach could be used to investigate different ways of colonisation. We investigated collembolan communities in both extensive and productive green roofs. Surprisingly, no difference was observed in either taxonomic or functional structures of collembolan diversity between extensive and productive green roofs. Conversely, according to the functional composition, two ways of colonisation are suggested: a passive wind dispersal - the "flying" collembolans - and a settlement through compost inputs. We conclude that stakeholders should take into account the spatial connections of green roofs with other green spaces in order to support soil biodiversity. Further studies are needed to more accurately elucidate the importance of green roof types for collembolan communities and associated ecological networks.

AB  - Green roofs, which have become mandatory on new flat-topped buildings in many cities, increase habitat connectivity for wildlife and have contributed to a boom in urban beekeeping. The ecological benefits or risks of green roofs for wild bees (bee species other than the domesticated honey bee, Apis mellifera), however, have not been comprehensively analyzed. We therefore reviewed studies on insects caught on green roofs in Asia, Europe, or North America between 1992 and early 2017 and extracted information on wild bees. The resulting species list includes 236 Apidae identified in 35 studies, with thermophilic species probably overrepresented because roofs provide warm and dry habitats. The percentage of cavity-nesting bees on roofs is higher than that on nearby ground, while the percentage of pollen specialists is lower. Data are almost completely lacking on the reproductive success of bees on green roofs, the effect of roof age on bee diversity, and the genetic or demographic benefits of increased habitat connectivity. Our list of the bee species so far reported on green roofs will help in the selection and implementation of suitable soils, nesting aids, and plantings.

AB  - Complex landscapes with high resource availability can support more diverse natural enemy communities and better natural pest control by providing resources and facilitating organism dispersal. Moreover, in agricultural landscapes, local agroecosystem management can support biodiversity maintenance and pest control by adding resources in less complex landscapes with fewer resources. However, we lack an understanding of how local and landscape factors interact to affect natural enemy communities and their site fidelity to agroecosystems in urban landscapes (i.e., cityscapes).
   To better understand how local and landscape factors influence natural enemies in urban agroecosystems, we used urban community gardens as a model system to test if and how local resource manipulation and differences in cityscape quality affect natural enemy (ladybird beetles, parasitoid wasps) communities and their fidelity to urban habitats.
   We performed two manipulations. First, we added local floral resources in 6 of 12 gardens situated in different cityscapes to measure differences in natural enemy biodiversity. Second, in those 12 gardens, with and without resource additions, we manipulated populations of a common natural enemy, Hippodamia convergens, to assess fidelity to the gardens.
   Floral resource additions increased parasitoid abundance and changed community composition, but had little effect on ladybeetle abundance, richness or site fidelity. Rather, ladybeetle fidelity to gardens was lower in gardens in low quality cityscapes with high impervious cover.
   Cityscape quality influences natural enemies in and fidelity to gardens. Landscape-moderated biodiversity patterns observed in rural landscapes likely differ from urban contexts with implications for pest control.

AB  - In Sri Lanka, there are 31 species of bats distributed from lowlands to mountains. To document hat diversity and their habitat associations, 58 roosting sites in Maduru-Oya National Park periphery were surveyed. Fifteen bat species were recorded occupying 16 different roosting sites in this area. Among all the species recorded, Rhinolophus roouxii was the most abundant species per roosting site whereas Kerivoula pieta was the least abundant. A road-kill specimen similar to genus Phoniscus was found during the survey, a genus so far only documented in Southeast Asia and Australasia. Although our study area provided habitats for a diverse chiropteran community, the colony size per roost was remarkably low. Although our study area is supposedly a part of the park's buffer zone, many anthropogenic activities are threatening the bat community: felling large trees, slash-and-burn agriculture, excessive use of agrochemicals, vengeful killing, and subsidized predation. We strongly recommend adoption of wildlife-friendly sustainable land management practices in the buffer zone such as forest gardening, agroforestry (alley cropping, mixed-cropping), and integrated farming. Bat conservation in this region should take a landscape-scale conservation approach which includes Maduru-Oya National Park and other surrounding protected areas into a regional conservation network. Extents of undisturbed wilderness are dramatically declining in Sri Lanka; thus, future conservation efforts must be retrofitted into anthropocentric multiuse landscapes and novel ecosystems like areas surrounding Maduru-Oya National Park.

AB  - Mounting evidence suggests declines in the abundance and diversity of wild bees. Increasing habitat that provides forage and nesting sites could boost struggling populations, particularly in urban, suburban and agricultural landscapes. The millions of acres beneath aerial electric transmission lines, sometimes referred to as easements or rights-of-way, must be kept free of tall-growing vegetation and hence have the potential to provide suitable habitat for many native species. Prior work has demonstrated that bee communities in easements managed using alternatives to episodic mowing were more diverse than in nearby open areas, however true control sites within the easements were unavailable. In order to compare vegetation management protocols, we conducted a two-year study which enabled us to directly compare transmission line easements in three locations currently undergoing Integrated Vegetation Management-a dynamic form of management involving spot removal and herbicide treatment of unwanted species (treatment) with nearby sites undergoing standard management protocols of yearly or biyearly mowing (control). Results show that treatment sites had significantly higher abundance and species richness than controls. Seasonal differences were pronounced, with the spring fauna most affected by differences in vegetation management. In addition, the older treatment sites house more social bees, more parasitic species and a more even distribution of bees across nesting guilds. Finally, we established that treatment sites had distinct bee communities, further increasing their value as sources for native bee populations in the landscape. Overall, the data clearly show the value of implementing alternative active vegetation management in the land under powerlines to achieve an increase in the abundance and diversity of wild bees.

AB  - Urbanization has tremendous impacts on most native species. This is especially true in land snails, which are surprisingly understudied organisms. Due to their low mobility and dispersal potential, land snails are valuable indicators of ecosystem disturbance. For this study, land snails were collected in 54 city parks along an urban gradient to understand impacts of urbanization on snail communities. Sampled parks include small extensively landscaped downtown parks, neighborhood and community parks, district parks, and large nature parks, each with variable vegetation, soil characteristics, disturbance regimes, and human activities. Sampling recovered 12,153 individual snails, representing 20 families, 43 genera, and 95 species. Seven new Tennessee state and 87 new county occurrences were recorded. Five non-native and one extra-limital non-native species were found, four of which are new Tennessee state records. Results show that urbanization greatly alters land snail community structure. Nature and district parks have significantly greater species richness, species diversity and species evenness than community, neighborhood, and downtown parks. Degradation of parks, distance from the park to the commercial city center and percent of coarse woody debris accounted for most of the variation between park types. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and pairwise Jaccard indices indicate that downtown snail communities are more similar whereas snail communities in nature parks are more distinct. This suggests that urbanization promotes homogenization among land snail communities. We also show that this homogenization is thus far driven mainly by synanthropic, broadly adapted native species rather than non-native snail species.

AB  - As part of the urban environment, urban water bodies, lakes and rivers consist in oxygenating surfaces that support and simplify the functions of the urban landscape. Our research, undertaken for the first time in Romania, aims to establish the place and role of lacustrine water bodies and the manner we define the structure and functions of urban oxygenating surfaces, for the quality of natural capital and urban biodiversity. We used cartographic sources which we corroborated with field data in order to calculate quantitative indicators. We obtained a hierarchy of existent urban lakes in cities located in the South-West Oltenia Development Region. Also, to highlight the importance and role of urban lakes in the structure and ecological, social and economic functions of oxygenating surfaces, we calculated a series of indicators: the surface share of urban lakes to the administrative-territorial unit and oxygenating surfaces; the lakes' surface per capita and per administrative-territorial unit population; the distance between urban lakes and residential areas, the centrality level of lakes within a city; the level of accessibility; the share of urban lakes within the constructed surface; the social diversity on the proximity of urban lakes (number and type of housing - private, collective; number of schools, kindergartens or cultural institutions) and sensitive urban areas. We also established a hierarchy of the analyzed cities by the way urban lakes are valued (for recreation, water sports, sport fishing, water transportation or educational activities). Our main results consist in an extensive database that will help decision-makers implement solutions for a better urban planning and manage the natural capital in a sustainable way. Our study will be continued and improved with results on the topo-phobia and topo-philia of urban oxygenated surfaces and urban lakes. We also consider important to establish the role of water bodies as ecological corridors, for increasing urban biodiversity.

AB  - In aquatic ecosystems, tributaries play an important role in maintaining the populations and diversity of aquatic organisms throughout the drainage basin, but because of their small catchments, these ecosystems are often more susceptible to the effect of land-use changes and flow-regime alterations. Here, we examined anthropogenic effects on benthic macroinvertebrate diversity in the tributary lagoons, collectively called "Naiko," surrounding Lake Biwa. We sampled macroinvertebrates and determined the environmental characteristics of 20 tributary lagoons. We identified the environmental factors determining the diversity of macroinvertebrates and found that turbidity significantly diminished species diversity. We assessed the anthropogenic stressors that contributed to the increase in turbidity and found that human population density and the proportion of paddy fields in the watershed area were positively correlated with turbidity, most likely caused by erosion of terrigenous organic matter from the paddy fields and urban areas. In addition, the presence of sluice gates and the lengths of channels connecting to the main lake were positively correlated with turbidity, suggesting that these factors lowered hydrologic connectivity and retained organic matter. We concluded that changes to the landscape and decreased hydrologic connectivity caused by human activity increased turbidity, which in turn decreased macroinvertebrate diversity. The identification of these factors in tributaries is vital for developing a strategy for habitat restoration to conserve the entire ecosystem of the Lake Biwa basin.

AB  - Human-modified landscapes (HMLs) are composed by small, isolated and defaunated forest fragments, which are surrounded by agricultural and urban areas. Information on species that thrives in these HMLs is essential to direct conservation strategies in local and regional scales. Since HMLs are dominant in the Atlantic Forest, we aimed to assess the mammalian diversity in a HML in southeastern Brazil and to propose conservation strategies. We collected data of terrestrial (small-, medium-and large-sized) and volant mammals in three small forest fragments (10, 14 and 26 ha) and adjacent areas, between 2003 and 2016, using complementary methods: active search, camera trapping, live-traps, mist nets and occasional records (i.e., roadkills). In addition, we used secondary data to complement our species list. We recorded 35 native mammal species (6 small-sized, 16 medium- and large-sized, and 13 bats) and seven exotic species in the HML. The recorded mammal assemblage (non-volant and volant), although mainly composed of common and generalist species, includes three medium-and large-sized species nationally threatened (Leopardus guttulus, Puma concolor and Puma yagouaroundi) and two data deficient species (Galictis cuja and Histiotus velatus), highlighting the importance of this HML for the maintenance and conservation of mammal populations. Despite highly impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, the study area harbors a significant richness of medium-and large-sized mammals, being an important biodiversity refuge in the region. However, this biodiversity is threatened by the low quality of the habitats, roadkills and abundant populations of domestic cats and dogs. Therefore, we stress the need of conservation strategies focusing on the medium-and large-sized mammals as an umbrella group, which could benefit all biodiversity in the landscape. We recommend actions that promotes biological restoration, aiming to increase structural composition and connectivity of the forest fragments, reducing roadkills and controlling the domestic cats and dogs' populations, in order to maintain and improve the diversity of mammals in long-term.

AB  - Apex predators fulfil potentially vital ecological roles. Typically wide-ranging and charismatic, they can also be useful surrogates for biodiversity preservation, making their targeted conservation imperative. The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), an endangered, endemic sub-species, is the island's apex predator. Of potential keystone importance, this carnivore also fulfills "umbrella" and "flagship" criterion and is of high ecological and existence value. Apex predator conservation requires identifying factors underlying distribution, so we used multi-scale maximum entropy modelling with sampling bias correction to investigate a broad suite of relevant ecological, climatic and anthropogenic factors in order to identify potentially suitable leopard habitat. Presence locations were determined from 15 years of surveys, observations and verified reports. The best bias correction procedure and scale were uncertain, so we employed a novel method of using information from all models across analyses to determine top models and identify influential variables. Leopard presence was most strongly linked to the landscape proportion encompassed by Protected Areas strictly limiting human presence, with more porous Protected Areas less influential. All three forest composition and configuration metrics investigated (area weighted mean patch size, patch density and forest connectivity) were influential, with increased patch size and higher connectivity predicting better habitat suitability for leopards. Habitat suitability was also better where cropland extent and urban patch size were small. In summary, ground-level protection and natural forest extent and connectivity are of profound importance to Sri Lankan leopard distribution and are key factors in ensuring the ecological integrity of the island's faunal assemblages.

AB  - The rapid and large-scale urbanization of peri-urban areas poses major and complex challenges for wildlife conservation. We used population viability analysis (PVA) to evaluate the influence of urban encroachment, fire, and fauna crossing structures, with and without accounting for inbreeding effects, on the metapopulation viability of a medium-sized ground-dwelling mammal, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus), in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We surveyed two metapopulations over one and a half years, and parameterized the PVA models using largely field-collected data. The models revealed that spatial isolation imposed by housing and road encroachment has major impacts on I. obesulus. Although the species is known to persist in small metapopulations at moderate levels of habitat fragmentation, the models indicate that these populations become highly vulnerable to demographic decline, genetic deterioration, and local extinction under increasing habitat connectivity loss. Isolated metapopulations were also predicted to be highly sensitive to fire, with large-scale fires having greater negative impacts on population abundance than small-scale ones. To reduce the risk of decline and local extirpation of I. obesulus and other small-to medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals in urbanizing, fire prone landscapes, we recommend that remnant vegetation and vegetated, structurally-complex corridors between habitat patches be retained. Well-designed road underpasses can be effective to connect habitat patches and reduce the probability of inbreeding and genetic differentiation; however, adjustment of fire management practices to limit the size of unplanned fires and ensure the retention of long unburnt vegetation will also be required to ensure persistence. Our study supports the evidence that in rapidly urbanizing landscapes, a pro-active conservation approach is required that manages species at the metapopulation level and that prioritizes metapopulations and habitat with greater long-term probability of persistence and conservation capacity, respectively. This strategy may help us prevent future declines and local extirpations, and currently relatively common species from becoming rare.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and destruction are currently the main causes of biodiversity decline. One of the habitat conservation strategies is the creation of ecological corridors that are areas of connectivity between isolated fragments. This study was carried out in the municipality of Braganca Paulista, in the scope of the Atlantic Forest, covering the Mantiqueira Corridor in the Piracicaba-Juqueri-Mirim in the Environmental Protection Area. The objectives of this work were: i - to evaluate the isolation of native forest remains based on the landscaped parameters defined as size, shape, interior area and connectivity; and, ii - to identify potential areas for ecological corridors formation in the study area. The applied methodology was based in a Geographic Information System and the database used was composed by the Forest Inventory of the State of Sao Paulo, developed by Forest Institute; topographic maps of Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Eestatistica, in scale of 1:50,000, associated with an shapefile data constituted by the municipal boundaries of the Instituto Geografico e Cartografico do Estado de Sao Paulo, all based on vector format. The results indicated that the great majority of the fragments are small, elongated, with low index of interior area and low connectivity, which makes the landscape of Braganca Paulista and its surroundings quite fragmented. However, it should be noted that this region still contains important forest remnants, both when considering the area of some fragments and the connectivity between them. The ecological corridors identified in the study area, known as the Jaguari Corridor and Baronesa-Iguatemi Corridor, include 74% of all forest cover studied and, if implemented in Braganca Paulista city, can contribute to the formation of a green belt in the municipality with the function of Protect the Jaguari River's water resources and for the maintenance the local and regional biodiversity.

AB  - The Dong'an Wetland was designated as the site for one of Sanya's first pilot projects of urban environmental remediation and ecological restoration because of its key position in the regional ecological pattern, especially for urban stormwater management. The project aims at integrating leisure and recreational functions with landscape elements including ponds, forest on water, terraced vegetable garden, and trait loop, while promoting water circulation, improving water quality, and retaining rainwater and regulating water reuse, acting as a resilient urban sponge for rainwater management. The newly built project transforms an ignored grey place into a new home for egrets, an outdoor classroom for children's nature education, and a destination for citizens to evoke their memories.

AB  - Invasive species have been causing important and irreversible impacts to native species and communities of ecosystems. They distort ecosystem functions by degrading forest lands, wetlands, and agricultural habitats and replace the native vegetation and reduce biodiversity, forest productivity, and suitable wildlife habitat. To address disturbances caused by invasive species occurrence, further information is needed regarding the occurrence, extent, and dispersal of invasive species and how land use may increase the spread of these species. The objective of this study was to find the frequency and dominance of three invasive species common to riparian areas of east Alabama: Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet), Elaeagnus pungens (silverthorn), and Triadica sebifera (Chinese tallow tree). Surveys of these species in riparian forests in and around Auburn, Alabama were conducted to show the relative extent of these shrubs and their relation to urban land use. It was expected to see the highest levels of invasive species in the city center with decreasing levels radiating outward into rural areas. Another objective was how urban land use may affect the presence-absence and prevalence of these non-native plant species within study sites. The results showed that around the city center and suburban lands, cover of both Chinese privet and silverthorn tended to increase. In contrast, Chinese tallow tree density percent cover showed an opposite trend with landscapes close to city center often having slightly less cover. This study shows that urban land use may be an important association with distribution of invasive plant species.

AB  - There is sufficient evidence to show that both humans and fauna are profoundly affected by landscape pattern composition and configuration in relation to adaptation to climate change impacts in urban landscapes. Despite this, global-scale research that ranks which components of landscape pattern play the most pivotal roles in this process is absent. Also lacking is in-depth examination of the potential areas of conflict between biodiversity conservation targets and those that pertain to human dimensions of climate change adaptation goals in relation to landscape patterns. The research aim was to determine how to identify, rank, and weight the most important components of landscape pattern affecting urban biodiversity in the changing climate and how to address areas of conflict between biodiversity conservation and human dimensions of climate change adaptation goals in terms of the spatial patterning of land cover classes distributed across urban landscapes. To do this, a global survey of 87 participants from 69 academic centres involved in at least 325 research projects between 2000 and 2017 was conducted. Of the eight components of landscape pattern identified and ranked by participants worldwide, the three most important components are respectively patch size, connectivity and proximity, and land cover heterogeneity. This research reveals that opinions of participants with experience in conducting research in the Southern Hemisphere in general and Oceania in particular influence this ranking. While a range of recommendations from specialists have been gathered and weighted, there is still much more research required to address areas of conflict between what fauna and humans need in the face of climate change.

AB  - We evaluate whether landscape variables surrounding urban remnant forest fragments influence ant diversity and its components in urban areas. The study was conducted in six riparian forest fragments in midwestern Minas Gerais State, Brazil, by sampling epigaeic and arboreal ants. Arboreal ants respond to fragment isolation with changes in alpha, beta and gamma diversities. Isolation likely hinders dispersion and re-colonization such that the more isolated a fragment is, the less likely that new species arrive there. On other hand, epigaeic diversity did not show any response to variables of the surroundings or fragments, probably because natural periodic floods constitute a more severe disturbance for these ants. In addition, throughout the process of urbanization, anthropogenic improvements, such as paving, that prevent the natural percolation of water, increase the flooding of riparian soil. Arboreal ant species composition responds to percentage of urban area, fragment area and distance from the urban center, while epigaeic ants respond only to fragment area and percentage of urban area. We believe that even with the loss of species diversity and anthropogenic influences on fragments within urban centers, these areas are still important for species conservation. We also suggest the development of environmental protection projects for riparian areas within urban centers, including investments in ecological corridors connecting fragments and public policies seeking to preserve these areas.

AB  - Urbanization modifies landscape structure in three major ways that impact avian diversity in remnant habitat: habitat amount is reduced and habitat configuration and matrix quality are altered. The relative effects of these three components of landscape structure are relatively well-studied in agricultural landscapes, but little is known about the relative effect of urban matrix quality. We addressed this gap by investigating the relative effects of forest amount, forest configuration, and matrix quality, indicated by degree of urbanization and agriculture amount, on the diversity of three guilds of forest birds using data from 13,763 point counts from Pennsylvania, USA. Forest amount had the largest independent effect on forest bird diversity, followed by matrix quality, then forest configuration. In particular, urbanization had strong negative effects on the relative abundance and species evenness of all forest birds and the relative abundance of forest generalist birds. To our knowledge, these are the first results of the effect of urban matrix quality on forest bird relative abundance and species evenness independent of forest amount and forest configuration. Our results imply that conservation practitioners in human-modified landscapes prioritize maximizing forest amount, then reducing the effects of disturbances originating in the matrix, and then preserving large, spatially-dispersed forest patches to most effectively conserve forest birds.

AB  - Despite the existence of well-established international environmental and nature conservation policies (e.g., the Ramsar Convention and Convention on Biological Diversity) ponds are largely missing from national and international legislation and policy frameworks. Ponds are among the most biodiverse and ecologically important freshwater habitats, and their value lies not only in individual ponds, but more importantly, in networks of ponds (pondscapes). Ponds make an important contribution to society through the ecosystem services they provide, with effective conservation of pondscapes essential to ensuring that these services are maintained. Implementation of current pond conservation through individual site designations does not function at the landscape scale, where ponds contribute most to biodiversity. Conservation and management of pondscapes should complement current national and international nature conservation and water policy/legislation, as pondscapes can provide species protection in landscapes where large-scale traditional conservation areas cannot be established (e.g., urban or agricultural landscapes). We propose practical steps for the effective incorporation or enhancement of ponds within five policy areas: through open water sustainable urban drainage systems in urban planning, increased incentives in agrienvironment schemes, curriculum inclusion in education, emphasis on ecological scale in mitigation measures following anthropogenic developments, and the inclusion of pondscapes in conservation policy.

AB  - Natural ecosystems in estuaries are modified by the effects of runoff from disturbed watersheds and are frequently replaced by armoured estuarine shorelines. Whilst the effects of these 2 stressors are widely recognised, they are typically studied in isolation, and it is not clear how these contrasting types of urbanisation interact to shape faunal assemblages. In this study, fish assemblages were surveyed with underwater videos arranged in a 200 m grid throughout the lower reaches of 3 estuaries in eastern Australia (resulting in >= 63 sites per estuary and 277 sites in total) which differed in their extent of shoreline and watershed urbanisation. Overall, the least urbanised estuary supported more than twice the number of fish species and a significantly greater abundance of fish. The spatial patterns of fish diversity and abundance within estuaries were related to the proximity of urbanised shorelines, with most fish groups aggregating near armoured shorelines. These effects of distance from urbanised shorelines were, however, modified by the degree to which the entire estuary had been modified. We show that the ecological effects of urbanisation can extend across estuaries and suggest that coastal landscapes should therefore be managed as interlinked mosaics of both natural and artificial habitats.

AB  - This special issue considers food growing in the city. It presents a series of papers which explore the interface between urban growing initiatives and the planned city, and identifies the development of the movement in different world regions and situations. It explores the characteristics of different food growing and urban gardening scenarios regarding the inherent properties of the urban agriculture/food growing complex as an urban movement, its drivers and the niche that it occupies within the city. The papers address circumstances of food growing in highly developed western planning systems, typically represented in Europe, but also other global regions which show different historical and development contexts. These demonstrate that urban food growing initiatives are largely activist-led and tend to fall outside of, or conflict with current city planning models. Where these initiatives are incorporated, they have the potential to provide effective urban landscape solutions that respond to local circumstances, new markets, engendering social and environmental improvement. Taken together, the papers suggest that urban agriculture models need to be recognised more widely within mainstream urban planning and the urban development process.

AB  - Over the past twenty years or so, cities have been including literature and writers on architectural and urban projects, by more readily asking them to participate in the urban policy creation process. In response to requests, writers have collaborated with architects on planning projects involving tangible depictions of literature in the city. The present article proposes an analysis of this increasing literary presence within urban planning and landscapes: How is literature physically incorporated into the layout and management of today's cities? Results from qualitative surveys conducted across various French and European cities over the past several years help frame this investigation. A number of "literary" urban planning projects built in French cities during the mid 1990's will serve as a focal point for this endeavor. The projects analyzed herein were executed by members of the OuLiPo movement (a literary group dedicated to enhancing the potential of literature). Intended for both scholars and practitioners alike, this study explores how such new literary practices interact with the modem city, in revealing the professional realignments and changes in operating patterns occurring in both urban planning and urban design. It also critically assesses the models, values and paradoxes underlying today's cityscapes. The integration of literature into urban projects influences modem spaces in a way that contrasts: between striving towards democratization and social inclusion, between an initially subversive project and a shift favoring the mainstream, between a collaborative contextual approach and the dual effects of exclusion and relegation, all of which stem from stamping a "high-minded culture" on the city.

AB  - Parking lots are flexible and multifunctional spaces that can positively contribute to relieve the city of the increasing presence of cars. The disappearance or the reduction of the traditional monofunctional parking lots constitutes a way to create new relations between the city and its variety of complex environments and to improve social realm. Born with the standardization of the car in the early 20th century, they are valued largely for their technical character neglecting its landscape potential, and usually they are mere asphalt surfaces to storage cars, with no design intention or economic investment. But their importance within an ecological and sustainable framework is major. The proper use of its materials can help reduce impervious surfaces, fight heat islands, and contribute to the control of water runoff and effective groundwater recharge; a correct use of vegetation can improve natural habitats and biodiversity. We will focus into the case study of the area Ostiense-Valco San Paolo in Rome. Located in the southwest of the city, Ostiense was the industrial neighborhood of Rome, mixing industry with high-density residential constructions. The presence of the Tevere and its dense planted banks dramatically contrast with the large parking surfaces, asphalt deserts with no trees or green inclusions. The aim of this paper is to propose the transformation of parking lots into urban forests, calculating the number of trees for each car needed to compensate the daily pollution they create. At the very same time, these vegetated spots could be connected and with the Tevere creating a larger network, changing completely the image of the area and participating in the public realm and the intermediate scale of landscape.

AB  - The biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia hosts high levels of endemism (74% of flora) that is threatened increasingly by climate change, habitat reduction, and invasive species. The fruit-eating red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) is currently invading the main island of the archipelago, and its recent dispersal out of urbanized habitats raises questions about its potential to disperse noxious plant seeds along urban corridors and beyond. Indeed, the red-vented bulbul is considered a vector of several introduced plant species in its alien range including Miconia calvescens, Lantana camara, and Schinus terebinthifolius. We conducted a quantitative assessment of the bulbul's fruits consumption by analyzing the gut contents of shot birds. We estimated gut passage times for four species of fruit found in gut contents (S.terebinthifolius, Myrtastrum rufopunctatum, Passiflora suberosa, and Ficus prolixa) and tested the effects of bird digestion on seed germination rates for two species. Finally, we monitored the movements of individual VHF radio-tagged red-vented bulbuls. All of the consumed fruit species we identified here have red fleshy diaspore, including fruit of the shrub M.rufopunctatum that occurred frequently (9.6%) in bulbul gut samples. Median gut passage times were short (15-41min), corresponding to short-distance seed transportation (77-92m). The effect of gut passage was positive for the germination of the invasive S.terebinthifolius and negative for the endemic M.rufopunctatum, suggesting a potential bias in the contribution to the dispersal toward alien species. This study provides the first integrated assessment of mechanisms involved in the seed dispersal effectiveness of this high-concern invasive bird species that is expected to face similar plant communities in most of its alien range in tropical islands. More generally, our results enhance knowledge of synergies between non-native frugivores and plant species dispersal.

AB  - Flood estimation methods in ungauged basins rely upon generalized relationships between flows and catchment properties. Generally such catchment properties are based on low-resolution national datasets from low density urbanized basins and do not consider location, connectivity and patch size. Such factors are more routinely represented in landscape metrics employed in ecology, and could be particularly useful for representing the diversity of urban land-use. Here, hydrologically relevant landscape metrics are brought together with refined land-use classes and catchment descriptors routinely applied in UK flood estimation methods to estimate the median annual flood (QMED) in order to evaluate the potential role of such metrics. The results show that using higher resolution geospatial data can improve the representation of the urban environment, having particular effects on the delineation of urban water features and catchment area, but not urban extent. Refinement of landscape metrics based on correlations resulted in 12 metrics and 5 catchment descriptors being tested against observed QMED at 18 sites using a weighted least squares regression. The revised equation showed that certain landscape metrics can better represent the hydrological complexity of an urban catchment in a single distributed numerical form, leading to improved estimates of QMED over non-distributed descriptors, for the selected case study sites. The ability of landscape metrics to express connectivity and relative size and location of urban development promises significant potential for application in urban flood estimation and catchment-scale hydrological modelling.

AB  - This paper introduces the special issue and explains the diversity as well as common features of mobilization practices present in cities around the world. The paper starts with presenting the specificity and history of urban movements worldwide, as well as the development of right to the city' frame. Drawing on the existing literature, it focuses on presenting different forms of urban activism and interpretations of right to the city' slogan. This paper strives to fuse the framework of social movements as networks (Diani, in: Diani, McAdam (eds) Social movements and networks, Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp 299-318, 2003) of challengers (Gamson in The strategy of social protest, Wadsworth Publishing, Belmont, 1990) with the concepts of diffusion and translation of ideas, borrowed from Finnemore and Sikkink (Int Org 52(4):887-917, 1998). It also illustrates the application of the theoretical concepts of incumbents and challengers (Gamson 1990), organizational platform and norm life cycle (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998) as well as the development on movement networks within and between localities (Diani in The cement of civil society: studying networks in localities, Cambridge University Press, New York, 2015). The theoretical model helps to explain the rapid global spread of the notion of the right to the city.' The paper concludes with a discussion of the urban context, both 'glocal' and global, as an arena of social mobilization around different aspects of the 'right to the city.'

AB  - The cognizing of connectivity among small mammal populations across heterogeneous landscapes is complicated due to complex influences of landscape and anthropogenic factors on gene flow. A landscape genetics approach offers inferences on how landscape features drive population structure. Through a landscape genetics approach, we investigated influences of geographical, environmental, and anthropogenic features on populations of Apodemus agrarius, the striped field mouse, the prime vector of hemorrhagic fever by a landscape genetic approach. We identified landscape features that might affect the population structure of striped field mice by analyzing microsatellite markers of 197 striped field mice from 21 populations throughout South Korea. We developed Maximum-likelihood population effects models based on landscape distances and resistance matrices and pairwise F-ST values for meta-populations of striped field mouse. We also conducted Mantel and partial Mantel tests to investigate geographic patterns of genetic similarities. In Mantel and partial Mantel tests, the F-ST was significantly correlated with all three models of movement; movement cost, Euclidian distance and least-cost distance, although the magnitudes of correlations varied. The 4 top-ranked models included three variables; temperature, precipitation and one human disturbance factor (population). We did not attain a significant effect for anthropogenic factors on genetic similarities among populations in the Korean striped field mouse, but we confirmed a significant association for genetic similarity with climatic features (temperature and precipitation).

AB  - Green infrastructure (GI) is a strategically planned network of high quality natural and semi-natural areas and provides a range of ecosystem services and protects biodiversity in urban settings. It is very important to increase understanding of the role of GI from a scientific and a socio-economic perspective. The main goal was to understand and assess the ways that tourists use from experiencing urban green infrastructure in the cities they visit. An interview questionnaire survey took place among tourists of the following countries and cities: Latvia (Riga and Jelgava) and Portugal (Lisbon and Faro). The questionnaire includes perception, psychological aspects and preferences, behavior and activities and general questions as well as biographical information about tourists. The study represents that no significant differences have been found between respondent groups in Latvia and Portugal. The results of the survey show that in future there is a need to improve the linkage between GI and social-cultural activities in cities. Therefore, studies for tourists' perceptions, preferences and uses of GI will provide the alternative management approaches for urban planning and tourism development in future.

AB  - The urban water ecosystems, such as the landscape ponds are commonly considered under the influence of anthropogenic disturbances, which can lead to the deterioration of the water quality. The prokaryotic communities are considered as one of the best indicators of the water quality. However, there are significant gaps in understanding the ecological processes that shape the composition and function of prokaryotic communities in the urban water ecosystems. Here, we investigated the biogeographic distribution of prokaryotic assemblages in water environments including landscape ponds, drinking water reservoirs, influents (IFs) and effluents (EFs) of wastewater treatment plants of a coastal city (Xiamen), China, by using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Our results indicated that the ponds had higher alpha-diversity of prokaryotic communities than those in the reservoirs, while there were significant variations in the community compositions among ponds, reservoirs, IFs and EFs. Moreover, ponds harbored a significantly higher proportion of sewage- and fecal-indicator taxa than those in the reservoirs, suggesting the occurrence of exogenous pollution in the urban ponds. Null model analysis revealed that dispersal limitation was the main ecological processes resulting in the divergence of prokaryotic community compositions between ponds and other environments, while dispersal limitation and variable selection played an essential role in the formation of unique prokaryotic assemblages in the reservoirs. Function predication analysis demonstrated that the ponds shared more similar functional profiles with IFs or EFs (e.g., chemoheterotrophy, fermentation, chlorate reducers, nitrate reduction and respiration) than the reservoirs, whereas dominance of photoautotrophy was observed in the reservoirs. Overall, this study provides a profound insight of the ecological mechanisms underlying the responses of prokaryotic communities in the urban landscape ponds to the anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Background: Urbanization is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. Wildlife responses to urbanization, however, are greatly variable and, paradoxically, some threatened species may achieve much larger populations in urban than in natural habitats. Urban conservation hotspots may therefore help some species avoid regional or even global extinctions, but not conserve their often overlooked ecological functions in the wild. We aim to draw attention to this issue using two species of globally threatened parrots occurring in the Dominican Republic: the Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis) and the Hispaniolan parakeet (Psittacara chloropterus).
   Methods: We conducted a large-scale roadside survey in June 2017 across the country to estimate the relative abundance of parrots in natural habitats, rural habitats, and cities. We combined this with informal interviews with local people to collect information on past and current human impacts on parrot populations. We also looked for foraging parrots to assess their potential role as seed dispersers, an ecological function that has been overlooked until very recently.
   Results: Relative abundances of both parrot species were negligible in rural areas and very low in natural habitats. They were generally between one and two orders of magnitude lower than that of congeneric species inhabiting other Neotropical ecosystems. Relative abundances were six times higher in cities than in natural habitats in the case of the Hispaniolan parakeet and three times higher in the case of the Hispaniolan amazon. People indicated hunting for a source food and to mitigate crop damage as causes of parrot population declines, and a vigorous illegal trade for parrots (131 individuals recorded, 75% of them poached very recently), mostly obtained from protected areas where the last small wild populations remain. We observed parrots foraging on 19 plant species from 11 families, dispersing the fruits of 14 species by carrying them in their beaks and consuming them in distant perching trees. They discarded undamaged mature seeds, with the potential to germinate, in 99.5% of cases (n = 306), and minimum dispersal distances ranged from 8 to 155 m (median = 37 m).
   Discussion: The loss of ecological functions provided by some species when they disappear from natural habitats and only persist in cities may have long-term, unexpected effects on ecosystems. Our example demonstrates how two cities may soon be the last refuges for two endemic parrots if overharvesting continues, in which case their overlooked role as seed dispersers would be completely lost in nature. The functional extinction of these species could strongly affect vegetation communities in an island environment where seed-dispersal species are naturally scarce. While conservation plans must include urban populations of threatened species, greater efforts are needed to restore their populations in natural habitats to conserve ecological functions.

AB  - Watershed urbanization leads to chemical and thermal pollution of urban streams and significant declines in aquatic biodiversity. Most investigators have focused on variation in total watershed impervious surface cover (ISC) as the primary driver of urban stream degradation. We asked instead whether the degree of connectivity between ISC and urban stream channels alters its effect. We compared 7 streams in the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area of the southeastern USA that drained watersheds with similar amounts of pavement (ISC = 7-16% of watershed area) but spanning a wide range of hydrologic connectivity between these pavements and their receiving streams via both subsurface (pipe density range: 1.1-6.9 km/km(2)) and surface (road density range: 5.8-10.7 km/ km(2) ) flowpaths. Despite draining watersheds with similarly low levels of development, these 7 streams exhibited remarkable variability in their hydrologic and thermal regimes and varied in their macroinvertebrate diversity from a low of only 11 taxa to a high of 22. Both macroinvertebrate community composition and the tissue concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn in 3 stream invertebrate taxa (Cambaridae, Tipulidae, and Hydropsychidae) found across all sites were correlated with watershed hydrologic connectivity. These results suggest that the connectivity of ISC may drive considerable variation in the magnitude of ecosystem degradation associated with the same level of watershed development, with less connected or disconnected impervious surfaces having proportionally lower negative effects on aquatic organisms.

TI  - Urban and global populism: An analysis of Jakarta as Resilient City
T2  - FRIENDLY CITY 4 FROM RESEARCH TO IMPLEMENTATION FOR BETTER SUSTAINABILITY
LA  - English
CP  - 4th International Conference on Friendly City - From Research to Implementation For Better Sustainability
AB  - One of the important elements of friendly city is its cordiality towards diversity. Cities will naturally attract people from different nationalities to live, study and work. The rapid development of cities has long been regarded as major drive of urbanization from other areas which contributed to the high level of ethnic and race diversities. However diversity is currently seen under threat due to the rise of global populism that is mainly fuelled by anxiety over economic condition. The growth of nationalist movement, anti-immigrant parties and xenophobia is gaining foothold across the planet. Against this backdrop, this paper aims at investigating the nexus between diversity and inequality in Jakarta. The current local election provides example of these two competing concepts. Jakarta as emerging global city with diverse communities had been marred by public protest and narration of identity issues. On the other hands, populism has deep root in severe economic inequality among the residents. A robust development in Jakarta has been marked by concentration of wealth in the hands of few. This paper presents case study on the root causes of growing populism and its relations with inequality in Jakarta.

AB  - There are overwhelming proofs of how urbanization contributes to the increase of carbon emissions. However, it has been unclear how structural and functional changes in urban carbon flows evolve with socioeconomic development in a long run, which is important for a more systemic and efficient carbon mitigation policy. The present study probes into the interaction between urban carbon metabolism and socioeconomic activities from a systems perspective. Taking Beijing as a case study, we model the dynamics between the changing carbon metabolism and variation in socioeconomic conditions over 1985-2030, based on a collection of system-based indicators from ecological network analysis. We find an "inverted V curve" carbon transition in Beijing, and the turning point occurred around 2010. This transition is widely observed in the variation in total embodied emission, total system throughflow, boundary flow and system capacity. Continuing improvement in efficiency is expected to lessen the pressure from carbonization in 2020 and 2030 without sacrificing the diversity of economic activities. We suggest that network analysis has a unique potential in unfolding the interplay between carbon transition and socioeconomic development that most "accounting approaches" fail to penetrate.

AB  - In discussions of human-environmental dynamics and climate change, treatments of water usually focus on the problem of drought. Monsoon environments constitute a different set of parameters for landscape interactions because of seasonal episodes of water abundance. In this paper, we evaluate the microscale management of routine and anticipated high-water events for the ancient Indian subcontinent, where people used the monsoon cycle to engage in rice farming that in turn supported the growth of cities. Rice production would have encompassed two fluctuating inputs: rural labor, which may have become scarce when villagers left farmlands to become city dwellers; and water, the quantity of which varies dramatically on both a seasonal basis because of the monsoon and on an occasional basis because of tropical cyclones. The abundance of water (even with its risks of overabundance) encompassed numerous logistical challenges but also permitted high productivity within short distances of urban centers. The case study of the ancient city of Sisupalgarh in eastern India illustrates that high levels of productivity per land area enabled city residents to engage in short-distance economies for food production, while maintaining regional contacts through durable-goods trade to mitigate occasional episodes of crop failure in times of major flooding.

AB  - The research deals with an old concept in its inception, but it is modern in its applications and theses it deals with. The concept of compact city is one of the latest strategies for the sustainable development of cities.
   The research tackled the concept of compactness and the characteristics of the compact city as well as the concept and characteristics of the Traditional Arabic city, A combination of common indicators was found (Mix land use, density and intensification, movement and transport, accessibility, harmony, diversity). These indicators also include several sub-indicators, as these indicators can provide an appropriate basis for the possibility of a shift towards sustainability.
   The practical aspect was the conduct of field surveys of the study area (old city of Najaf) to identify the planning characteristics of it, and then the indicators derived from the theoretical framework were applied. The research found that there was a great approach to four indicators (density, movement, transport, accessibility, compactness, diversity and vitality), which achieved quantitative values appropriate to the rate specified in the specifications of the compact cities, The land use mix index was partially achieved as it approached the minimum limits specified in the horizontal mix and was receded from the vertical mix.
   Thus, it is possible to draw the conclusion that the type of fabric and its degree of compactness have exerted a great influence on the indicators. This was reflected in the high and moderate density, which encouraged a mix land uses, created diversity and vitality and provided high accessibility to the region.

AB  - Catania covers an area of 180 km(2), with a population of 313,000 inhabitants, and a density of 1,733 inhabitants km(-2), but it provides services for all city-users who enter the city every day (the conurbation size is about 800,000). Undoubtedly, in the next few decades, urban communities will be the main actors for mitigation and adaptation activities since city areas are the places where climate change strikes in the most extreme way, with challenging weather conditions, pollution, congestion, etc. Unfortunately, to date most Italian municipalities have not finalised any strategies to prevent and/or mitigate the new events related to climatic changes and too often they continue to adopt interventions in emergency situations after the damage has occurred. The present study, following some good practices of an integrated approach, involves the metropolitan area of Catania, based on cooperation between the University and Municipality of Catania, with the view to evaluate the main risks associated with climate change (desertification, soil erosion, urban heat island effect, flooding, etc.) and to develop new policies for urban landscape planning based on a green infrastructure. Drawing on great sources of biodiversity (Nature 2000 sites, including the Mt. Etna National Park and the Simeto River estuary and reserve) the study suggests building an urban green LID network in order to increase the resilience, the efficiency and the sustainability of the Catania metropolitan area. Additionally, by linking the city to the Nature 2000 sites by a peri-urban agro-forestry belt these goals can also be met.

AB  - This article stresses the importance of positive image and perception of dynamic ecological processes for the implementation and care of areas which provide ecosystem services within the city. Those in turn secure the resilience of our urban environment. Aesthetic experience with emphasis on highlighting and revealing the presence of ecological dynamics, processes and cycles can increase the acceptance and interest for sustainable goals and projects within the city. Thus, several European cities are currently implementing strategies not only to enhance the capacity of their green networks for ecological services and resilience but most importantly to enhance the acceptance and active use of such areas. They are integrating the public in an open debate about implementing new attractive ecological amenities within a green network, and also stimulating landscape architects to find ways to design important ecological processes and functions in an eye-catching and spectacular way. The natural dynamics and cycles are thus brought to the attention of the people and present an important artistic and cultural component of resilience.

AB  - Cities face several challenges regarding public space and urban regeneration. Some of them are the depersonalization and lack of interest of citizens in their own city, privatization, gentrification, technologization and gender-insecurity. Public spaces lose their character as articulator and generator of human relations, while in neighborhoods lose their role as the basic unity of community and urban identity. Nowadays, many bottom-up strategies have arisen as manifestations of neighborhoods inhabitant's will that produce cultural diversity and civic engagement, with a placemaking effect. Urban art is one of them. While social and economic products of urban art have been studied, the spatial manifestation and impact of art has been largely absent from the discourse of urban morphology. Spatial conditions in cities are not just representational of social practices like art, but form and perpetuate these practices through structuring patterns of movement, encounter and separation in the city (Cartiere & Zebracki, 2016). This study aims to discover the spatial relation between urban art display and the network of public spaces, and whether this pattern has a role in neighborhood regeneration. Using Space Syntax analysis and spatial clustering combined with a survey of geographically located public urban art (extracted from social networks data), land prices and land uses in Shoreditch, London, relations between urban art, the spatial layout and regeneration processes will be stablished. Further research can look at other bottom-up strategies for regeneration and relate them to the urban form.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances can have negative effects on species assemblages. This study was established to form baseline data on the environmental structure and reptile assemblages within a planned energy corridor in Pinal County, Arizona, prior to construction. We emphasized evaluating the differences in reptile assemblages in two subdivisions of the Sonoran Desertscrub, the Lower Colorado River Valley (LCV) and Arizona Uplands (AZU). Surveys were conducted on 50 sites (LCV = 15; AZU = 35) along the proposed 67.1-km long energy corridor through environmental surveys and 50 drift-fence trapping arrays with 400 box funnel traps. Vegetation height, number of burrows, and percent rock, ground cover, and coarse woody debris were significantly higher in the AZU than in LCV. Eighteen reptile species (n = 995 captures) were detected on the energy corridor including 8 lizard species (n = 952 captures) and 10 snake species (n = 43 captures). Species richness, evenness, and capture rates were not significantly different between the LCV and AZU; however, species diversity was significantly higher in the LCV. Reptile abundance (LCV = 281; AZU = 714) differed in the two subdivisions, yet rank-abundance curves revealed no difference in dominance of species. Post hoc examination revealed that the geographic separation of sites within the LCV and the location of the study area (along the ecotone) may have contributed to our results. We conclude that both subdivisions are equally important to the maintenance of local biotic diversity and recommend that any future land set-asides consider both subdivisions.

AB  - From the perspective of system functions, the study analyzes the evolutionary characteristics of Shanghai's 17 districts based on the dynamic spatial and temporal differences of functional assessment of the eco-space recreational system from 2001 to 2011. Taking into consideration the functional coordination of complex systems, the elements of structural component are taken as the base of assessment framework (Diversity-Scale-Fit-Accessibility). By analyzing the results of the discrete data features, the differences and evolution of spatial pattern are studied. The studies suggest that the urban development and planning, the demographic factors in the region and the developmental stages of recreational demands are the main drivers of the pattern evolution. Furthermore, the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions are proposed.

AB  - Birds and figs are conspicuous members of the tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Because they are easily observed and very speciose, their relationships have been well studied in many areas, and the figs are considered a keystone resource for many bird species which are efficient fig seed dispersers. Taiwan has a relatively high endemism rate for many taxa (17% of bird species) but because of its high human population density, most lowland habitats are heavily developed, of which much of it covered by dense urban habitation. To establish the importance of urban figs for birds, we focused our surveys mostly on three common urban fig species (Ficus caulocarpa, F. microcarpa and F. subpisocatpa). We observed trees with ripening figs from July 2013 to December 2016 in order to determine the composition of the fig-consuming bird community. In addition, we added all the information available in the scientific literature and birdwatchers' observations which we could find. In total, we observed 42 bird species consuming 18 fig species. The bird diversity in urban areas was non-negligible even during winter. Therefore, there are two reasons why figs are important for Taiwan's bird avifauna: in cities, the tree diversity is generally low so that figs provide a stable food resource; and since figs are fruiting all yearround, they are one of the few reliable resources available during winter when many migrant birds overwinter in Taiwan. Already crucial for many species in tropical and subtropical forests, fig trees may also be essential for urban birds in tropical and subtropical regions.

AB  - Although the vulnerability assessment of forest parks is used to determine the threats they face, a rapid and holistic framework has not been established well. The primary objective of this study is to adopt a framework for rapid assessment of forest parks vulnerability, examined in Lavizan forest park in Tehran (Iran) as the case study. The vulnerability assessment has been conducted, using the evaluation matrix on the basis of landscape and ecological values and threats. In this model, the most important values and threatening factors of the Lavizan forest park have been identified and assessed, based on the intensity of their effect as well as occurrence probability. Finally, this article proposes five strategies to reduce the vulnerability. Results from this research indicate that the most important values have been air purifcation, wildlife, flora and fauna species, environment regulation, mental health, and scientific resources and the most important threats have included reduction of habitat diversity, intensive exploitation of the resources, fire, woodcutting, and reduction of ecological connectivity. Based on these vulnerabilities, the most important strategies propose the use of affordance strategy formulation framework to preserve and enhance ecological and landscape values of the park.

AB  - Urban areas' population has grown during the last century and it is expected that over 60% of the world population will live in cities by 2050. Urban parks provide several ecosystem services that are valuable to the wellbeing of city-dwellers and they are also considered a nature-based solution to tackle multiple environmental problems in cities. However, the type and amount of ecosystem services provided will vary with each park vegetation type, even within same the park. Our main goal was to quantify the trade-offs in ecosystem services associated to different vegetation types, using a spatially detailed approach. Rather than relying solely on general vegetation typologies, we took a more ecologically oriented approach, by explicitly considering different units of vegetation structure and composition.
   This was demonstrated in a large park (44 ha) located in the city of Almada (Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal), where six vegetation units were mapped in detail and six ecosystem services were evaluated: carbon sequestration, seed dispersal, erosion prevention, water purification, air purification and habitat quality.
   The results showed that, when looking at the park in detail, some ecosystem services varied greatly with vegetation type. Carbon sequestration was positively influenced by tree density, independently of species composition. Seed dispersal potential was higher in lawns, and mixed forest provided the highest amount of habitat quality. Air purification service was slightly higher in mixed forest, but was high in all vegetation types, probably due to low background pollution, and both water purification and erosion prevention were high in all vegetation types.
   Knowing the type, location, and amount of ecosystem services provided by each vegetation type can help to improve management options based on ecosystem services trade-offs and looking for win-win situations. The trade-offs are, for example, very clear for carbon: tree planting will boost carbon sequestration regardless of species, but may not be enough to increase habitat quality. Moreover, it may also negatively influence seed dispersal service. Informed practitioners can use this ecological knowledge to promote the role of urban parks as a nature-based solution to provide multiple ecosystem services, and ultimately improve the design and management of the green infrastructure. This will also improve the science of Ecosystem Services, acknowledging that the type of vegetation matters for the provision of ecosystem services and trade-offs analysis.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has dramatically spurred economic development since the 1980s, especially in China, but has had negative impacts on natural resources since it is an irreversible process. Thus, timely monitoring and quantitative analysis of the changes in land use over time and identification of landscape pattern variation related to growth modes in different periods are essential. This study aimed to inspect spatiotemporal characteristics of landscape pattern responses to land use changes in Xuzhou, China durfing the period of 1985-2015. In this context, we propose a new spectral index, called the Normalized Difference Enhanced Urban Index (NDEUI), which combines Nighttime light from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System with annual maximum Enhanced Vegetation Index to reduce the detection confusion between urban areas and barren land. The NDEUI-assisted random forests algorithm was implemented to obtain the land use/land cover maps of Xuzhou in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015, respectively. Four different periods (1985-1995, 1995-2005, 2005-2015, and 1985-2015) were chosen for the change analysis of land use and landscape patterns. The results indicate that the urban area has increased by about 30.65%, 10.54%, 68.77%, and 143.75% during the four periods at the main expense of agricultural land, respectively. The spatial trend maps revealed that continuous transition from other land use types into urban land has occurred in a dual-core development mode throughout the urbanization process. We quantified the patch complexity, aggregation, connectivity, and diversity of the landscape, employing a number of landscape metrics to represent the changes in landscape patterns at both the class and landscape levels. The results show that with respect to the four aspects of landscape patterns, there were considerable differences among the four years, mainly owing to the increasing dominance of urbanized land. Spatiotemporal variation in landscape patterns was examined based on 900 x 900 m sub-grids. Combined with the land use changes and spatiotemporal variations in landscape patterns, urban growth mainly occurred in a leapfrog mode along both sides of the roads during the period of 1985 to 1995, and then shifted into edge-expansion mode during the period of 1995 to 2005, and the edge-expansion and leapfrog modes coexisted in the period from 2005 to 2015. The high value spatiotemporal information generated using remote sensing and geographic information system in this study could assist urban planners and policymakers to better understand urban dynamics and evaluate their spatiotemporal and environmental impacts at the local level to enable sustainable urban planning in the future.

AB  - As urban environments differ from the natural environment, the ability of a species to move in and use variable land composition types determines its fate in the urban environment. In many mammalian species, the selection of home ranges mainly occurs during natal dispersal. Thus, habitat selection of juvenile individuals greatly determines where animals are found in the city. Here, our goal is to understand how an originally forest-dwelling rodent selects components of an urban habitat. We used radio telemetry to record the habitat and nest use of Eurasian red squirrels (Sciunts vulgaris) in the city of Turku in southwestern Finland, with the main focus on habitat use during natal dispersal. We found that although the red squirrels preferred areas with more trees available than in the surrounding urban landscape they nevertheless often used sites with only a few trees. This result was highlighted by the analysis of the home range scale, as the area used did not differ greatly from the habitat composition of the available landscape. Juvenile red squirrels used the deciduous land cover type more often during movements in the natal area than during dispersal and explorative movements; however, they also settled in areas with less deciduous land cover type than in the natal area. Our results show that in urban areas movements of red squirrels are not restricted to their natural habitat type, which is a coniferous forest, but that they seem to be well adapted to urban areas, being able to utilize urban structures.

AB  - Different aspects of human activities can cause environmental change that endanger species persistence, alter species distributions, and lead to changes in antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, whereas deforestation and flooding of riparian forest results in landscapes consisting of patchily distributed riparian forest fragments in a matrix of pastures, plantations, and urban areas. Therefore, we assessed the richness, abundance, and trophic interactions of trap-nesting Hymenoptera and their parasites at four patches of restored riparian forest and at one reference natural fragment, of different sizes and ages, located at the Volta Grande Reservoir, in Minas Gerais and So Paulo states to answer the following questions: (1) Does the richness and abundance of cavity-nesting bees and wasps differ in riparian forest fragments according to the seasonal periods? (2) Does the composition of cavity-nesting bees and wasps vary among restoration and reference sites and between climate seasons (wet and dry)? (3) How do the degrees of specialization of the parasites vary among the patches of forest? We recorded 12 species of wasps, eight of bees, and nine species of parasites. Areas with longer time since restoration (reference site) showed higher species richness. However, the abundance was higher in most recent areas. The composition of bee and wasp assembly has not significantly changed between the climate seasons, although it is different between sampling areas. The richness and abundance were higher in warmer and rainy periods. The rate of bee and wasp mortality was high. The degree of specialization of parasites varies among sampling units, and the network of host-parasite interaction has a modular configuration with generalists and specialists. We concluded that the restored areas with more complex habitat could provide better conditions for the reestablishment of ecological interactions among these insects, the local flora, and other invertebrates, which together contribute to the success of the restored environments.

AB  - Although biodiversity in cities is essential to ensure the healthy functioning of ecosystems and biosecurity over time, biodiversity loss resulting from human interventions in land cover patterns is widespread in urban landscapes. In the Southern Hemisphere, climate change is likely to accelerate the process of landscape upheavals, and consequently biodiversity loss.
   The aim of this research is to test the potentials of landscape pattern composition and configuration in safeguarding indigenous avifauna against the local impacts of climate change in urban landscapes, with reference to New Zealand. To build up a platform for landscape pattern interpretation, the literature was reviewed and semi-structured interviews with six subject-matter experts were conducted to provide information about the most important avifauna in the study area, key information on their ecological traits and niches, possible impacts of climate change on their primary habitats, and spatial requirements for ongoing species survival as the climate continues to change. A spatial analysis of land cover patterns was undertaken in Wellington, New Zealand using GIS and FRAGSTATS.
   Although there are still opportunities for biodiversity conservation in the study area, the current land cover patterns are unlikely to safeguard the selected species against climate change impacts.
   Eight implications for avifauna persistence under climate change are discussed for the first time in relation to a New Zealand context. These implications can give rise to a higher level of informed decision-making on a wide range of practices for biodiversity conservation related to uncertainties associated with climate change.

AB  - The current goals of the standards-based reform environment can be limiting to teachers' freedom and creativity. This occurs at a time when immigrant diversity transforms U.S. cities and innovative pedagogical responses are increasingly necessary. The confluence of these two processes is underexplored. Ethnography in New York City and Los Angeles demonstrated how, in classrooms serving immigrant ELs often characterized as the forgotten, neglected "margins" (hooks, 1994) three teachers responded to their transnational, multilingual contexts by developing creative practices. Case studies describe teachers as designers who enacted (a) contextually relevant curriculum making, (b) epistemically open assessment, and (c) critical languaging. It is argued that teachers who work with immigrant ELs in complex contexts are provided with opportunities to be creative designers-an opportunity currently limited by the standards-based reform movement in schools.

AB  - The tropical mosquito Aedes aegypti is the major vector in the transmission of human arboviruses, including chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever viruses. All provinces in the Indonesian archipelago have reported incidences of dengue. In order to study the genetic diversity and the dispersal of Ae. aegypti in Central Java, genetic analyses based on mitochondria cytochrome oxidase 1 gene (mtCOI) were performed on Ae. aegypti isolated in five cities along the national North Coast road of Central Java. Seventeen representative mtCOI fragments from either larvae or adult mosquitoes were PCR-amplified, sequenced and analyzed for sequence polymorphism, haplotype and genetic differentiation. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using maximum likelihood method and general time reversible model. There were seven haplotypes and the presence of different haplotypes in the cities was indicative of the heterogeneity of Ae. aegypti in Central Java. Gene flow and genetic differentiation analyses revealed no differentiation among populations from the cities. The possible gene flow between populations may reflect an active dispersal of Ae. aegypti among the cities as a result of movement of traffic along the national North Coast road of Central Java.

AB  - High-intensity human socio-economic activities pose a great threat to the ecological environment, thus resulting in the decline of biodiversity in ecologically fragile areas and serious problems over regional eco-security. The regional scale provides a reasonable spatial context for exploring the eco-security of mega-cities or metropolitan areas. However, the existing research lacks a comprehensive understanding of the influencing factors for biodiversity at a regional scale. Therefore, the study on landscape ecological planning represented by the theory of eco-security patterns has become increasingly significant. In this study, the "DPSIR-LM" model at a regional scale is adopted to analyze the positive and negative factors that affect the eco-security of Guangzhou's biodiversity, and obtain the spatial differentiation result of the eco-security assessment on Guangzhou's biodiversity. In terms of the conservation of Guangzhou's biodiversity, an innovative approach is taken to integrate ecological assessment into the construction of the eco-security pattern, so as to propose a novel method to construct the eco-security pattern. First, a holistic study on the urban eco-security pattern is conducted and the eco-security pattern of Guangzhou's biodiversity is established from the perspectives of government decision-making, socio-economic indicators and data, as well as the science and technology level. Then, the main geographical distribution and its causes are further analyzed to provide a corresponding protection strategy for each security pattern, contributing to the ecological space planning of Guangzhou's biodiversity conservation. The "DPSIR-LM" model given in this paper enhances the assessment of the positive and negative influences on biodiversity by quantifying the inner differences of the region, and it is more accurate and scientific in source selection, resistance evaluation and result optimization for the pattern construction. The research provides a valuable reference for the study and construction of eco-security patterns at a regional scale.

AB  - Butterflies (Insects: Lepidoptera) contribute to the ecosystem services and thereby qualify as a group deserving conservation effort. Information on the butterfly-plant links is used as a foundation to sustain population and enhance conservation and management. Thus, in the present study, the structure of a butterfly-plant network in an urban landscape like Kolkata, India, was deciphered highlighting metrics like degree distribution, nestedness, and interaction strength and specialization index. A total of forty eight butterfly species associated with thirty different angiosperm plant species were observed during the study period of one year. While Lantana camara was observed to be the dominant plant species with 37 links to different butterflies, the Catopsilia pyranthe butterfly species was dominant in terms of the generalist pattern of links (21 links) with the plants. Differential ability of the shrubs and herbs in the sustenance of the butterflies was reflected in the network indices using the herbs and the shrubs, separately. In urban landscapes with restricted variety of flowering plants, an estimate of relative strength of interactions enables identification and further use of the concerned species in sustaining butterfly populations. In accordance with these propositions, the butterfly-plant network illustrated in the present instance may prove useful in selection of plant species required for the enhancement of population of desired butterfly species in urban areas like Kolkata, India.

AB  - The present research was conducted to assess the anthropogenic impacts on avian diversity around the river Chenab, Pakistan. The avian diversity was recorded on different landscapes along the river Chenab, that is, forest, agricultural, rural, and urban habitats. The data on diversity and distribution of various avian species were collected through linear count along with direct count methods viz. personal observations and sound records and indirect count methods viz. presences of carcasses and meeting with local communities. The habitat preferences of birds varied significantly. A decline in avian diversity was observed from forest habitat to urban landscapes. One year of bird surveys compiled a total of 150 species from all habitats along the river Chenab. Computed statistical data show that Shannon's index provides a quantitative report of diversity which was highest at forest habitat (4.261) followed by rural forest habitat (3.746), agrierural habitat (3.746), agriculture habitat (3.623), WLH (2.723), urban vegetative habitat (3.215), and very least at urban nonvegetative habitat (2.247). It can be concluded from the present study that many of the avian species have specific habitats and also noted that corridors and connections among different landscapes are important for the conservation of avian diversity.

AB  - Ecological significance of trees growing in urban and peri-urban settings is likely to increase in future land-use regimes, calling for better understanding of their role as potential reservoirs or stepping stones for associated biodiversity. We studied the diversity of fungal endophytes in woody tissues of asymptomatic even aged pedunculate oak trees, growing as amenity trees in a peri-urban setting. The trees were classified into three groups according to their phenotypic vitality (high, medium, and low). Endophytes were cultured on potato dextrose media from surface sterilized twigs and DNA sequencing was performed to reveal the taxonomic identity of the morphotypes. In xylem tissues, the frequency and diversity of endophytes was highest in oak trees showing reduced vitality. This difference was not found for bark samples, in which the endophyte infections were more frequent and communities more diverse than in xylem. In general, most taxa were shared across the samples with few morphotypes being recovered in unique samples. Leaf phenolic profiles were found to accurately classify the trees according to their phenotypic vitality. Our results confirm that xylem is more selective substrate for endophytes than bark and that endophyte assemblages in xylem are correlated to the degree of host vitality. Thus, high vitality of trees may be associated with reduced habitat quality to wood-associated endophytes.

AB  - The overall aim in the development of the Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT) was to design a web-based tool that could provide quickly obtained quantitative data on ecological risk to assist landowners when making land-use change decisions. The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool works for almost any region in the world and uses freely available satellite imagery, biotic and abiotic data from existing global databases, models and algorithms to deliver a customised report for a selected area within one hour of job submission. Biotic data automatically obtained for a selected landscape includes terrestrial vertebrate and plant species occurrence data, information on their conservation status and remotely sensed vegetation productivity. Abiotic information obtained includes temperature, precipitation, water availability, insolation, topography, elevation, distribution of urban infrastructure and location of wetlands. The tool performs a number of analyses on the biotic and abiotic data to produce maps for the selected area at a 30m resolution depicting land cover type, numbers of globally threatened terrestrial vertebrate and plant species, beta-diversity of terrestrial vertebrates and plants, habitat intactness, wetland habitat connectivity, numbers of migratory species and vegetation resilience. Results are also aggregated to produce a summary map demonstrating areas of high and low ecological risk across the selected area. The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool has been designed to be intuitive to use, requiring no specialised software or user expertise. Input is extremely easy and requires the user to highlight the area of interest on a map or using grid co-ordinates. Output is delivered via the web application and comprises a customised PDF containing the maps and a zip file of geographical information system (GIS) data for the area requested. Users may run an unlimited number of LEFT analyses and download reports free of charge. In addition to the free tool described in this paper, there is also a paid service: individual LEFT analyses can be upgraded for a charge to allow access to the geographically subsetted datasets generated for each report. These data are supplied as a zip file containing raster datasets for the layers in the LEFT analysis in GeoTIFF format. These can be opened and queried in a GIS software package.

AB  - Freshwater species often show high levels of endemism and risk of extinction owing to their limited dispersal abilities. This is exemplified by the stenotopic freshwater crab, Johora singaporensis which is one of the world's 100 most threatened species, and currently inhabits less than 0.01km(2) of five low order hill streams within the highly urbanized island city-state of Singapore. We compared populations of J. singaporensis with that of the non-threatened, widespread, abundant, and eurytopic freshwater crab, Parathelphusa maculata, and found surprisingly high congruence between their population genomic histories. Based on 2,617 and 2,470 genome-wide SNPs mined via the double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequencing method for similar to 90 individuals of J. singaporensis and P. maculata, respectively, the populations are strongly isolated (F-ST=0.146-0.371), have low genetic diversity for both species (also for COI), and show signatures of recent genetic bottlenecks. The most genetically isolated populations for both species are separated from other populations by one of the oldest roads in Singapore. These results suggest that anthropogenic developments may have impacted stream-dependent species in a uniform manner, regardless of ubiquity, habitat preference, or dispersal modes of the species. While signs of inbreeding were not detected for the critically endangered species, the genetic distinctiveness and low diversity of the populations call for genetic rescue and connecting corridors between the remaining fragments of the natural habitat.

AB  - Urbanization is a process that heavily alters marine and terrestrial environments, though terrestrial urban ecosystems have been studied far more intensively. Terrestrial studies suggest that urbanization can facilitate mesopredators by enhancing food and shelter resources and reducing predation pressure from apex consumers. This in turn has considerable consequences for ecological communities. We evaluated spatial distribution patterns and habitat-use of the marine mesopredator, giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini), relative to terrestrial urbanization intensity in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. Using field surveys and citizen-contributed data for E. dofleini, we examined whether: (1) Distribution was related to urbanization, (2) Abundance was related to the extent of benthic anthropogenic debris, and (3) Diet differed as a function of urbanization and den cover. Our results suggest that urbanization impacts may differ with depth. Mixed-effects logistic regression model estimates for the probability of occurrence increased with urbanization in deep-water (> 24 m), and decreased with urbanization in shallow water (< 18 m). Accompanying field surveys indicated that E. dofleini abundance was correlated with the number of benthic anthropogenic debris items, and that E. dofleini diets were not affected by urbanization intensity or den cover. Though E. dofleini may be synanthropic within certain urban environments, the mechanisms driving this pattern likely differ from those affecting common urban mesopredators on land, with den provisioning from man-made structures being more important than altered food resources.

AB  - Brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) are a globally distributed pest. Urban habitats can support large infestations of rats, posing a potential risk to public health from the parasites and pathogens they carry. Despite the potential influence of rodent-borne zoonotic diseases on human health, it is unclear how urban habitats affect the structure and transmission dynamics of ectoparasite and microbial communities (all referred to as parasites hereafter) among rat colonies. In this study, we use ecological data on parasites and genomic sequencing of their rat hosts to examine associations between spatial proximity, genetic relatedness and the parasite communities associated with 133 rats at five sites in sections of New York City with persistent rat infestations. We build on previous work showing that rats in New York carry a wide variety of parasites and report that these communities differ significantly among sites, even across small geographical distances. Ectoparasite community similarity was positively associated with geographical proximity; however, there was no general association between distance and microbial communities of rats. Sites with greater overall parasite diversity also had rats with greater infection levels and parasite species richness. Parasite community similarity among sites was not linked to genetic relatedness of rats, suggesting that these communities are not associated with genetic similarity among host individuals or host dispersal among sites. Discriminant analysis identified site-specific associations of several parasite species, suggesting that the presence of some species within parasite communities may allow researchers to determine the sites of origin for newly sampled rats. The results of our study help clarify the roles that colony structure and geographical proximity play in determining the ecology of R.norvegicus as a significant urban reservoir of zoonotic diseases. Our study also highlights the spatial variation present in urban rat parasite communities, indicating that rats across New York City are not reservoirs for a homogenous set of parasites and pathogens. As a result, the epidemiological risks may be similarly heterogeneous for people in urban habitats.

AB  - Many studies have shown that the quality of biodiversity influences the well-being of citizens. Nevertheless, the drivers that shape biodiversity in urbanized zones are poorly understood. Although tree bases present reduced surface areas, they occur in great numbers in a deliberate spatial arrangement and may play an important ecological role in urban environments by offering limited favorable spaces for the development of spontaneous flora. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence the composition of plant communities harbored by tree bases in an urban district. We analyzed floristic inventory data collected in 2014 about plants growing at the bases of the 1474 trees on the 26 streets of the Bercy district in Paris (France).
   Our results indicated that the plant communities growing in the urban tree bases varied according to different factors. The abundance and distribution of these species were dependent on their biological traits (seed longevity in the soil bank) as well as the tree base characteristics (tree trunk diameter, equipment type around the tree bases, soil compaction, animal excrement, solar radiation, and urban tree species), the street orientation according to the air flow following the Seine River, and the geographic structure of the district (the influence of the presence of green spaces). The results of this study showed that the tree bases could be considered favorable stepping-stone habitats for certain species between more important green spaces such as parks and gardens. Thus, these areas actively participate in the enhancement of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Conservation planning is increasingly using "coarse filters" based on the idea of conserving "nature's stage". One such approach is based on ecosystems and the concept of ecological integrity, although myriad ways exist to measure ecological integrity.
   To describe our ecosystem-based index of ecological integrity (IEI) and its derivative index of ecological impact (ecoImpact), and illustrate their applications for conservation assessment and planning in the northeastern United States.
   We characterized the biophysical setting of the landscape at the 30 m cell resolution using a parsimonious suite of settings variables. Based on these settings variables and mapped ecosystems, we computed a suite of anthropogenic stressor metrics reflecting intactness (i.e., freedom from anthropogenic stressors) and resiliency metrics (i.e., connectivity to similar neighboring ecological settings), quantile-rescaled them by ecosystem and geographic extent, and combined them in a weighted linear model to create IEI. We used the change in IEI over time under a land use scenario to compute ecoImpact.
   We illustrated the calculation of IEI and ecoImpact to compare the ecological integrity consequences of a 70-year projection of urban growth to an alternative scenario involving securing a network of conservation core areas (reserves) from future development.
   IEI and ecoImpact offer an effective way to assess ecological integrity across the landscape and examine the potential ecological consequences of alternative land use and land cover scenarios to inform conservation decision making.

AB  - The water fronts are sensitive areas, not only in environmental terms but also considering the continuity requirements with cities. Usually the spatial planning rules for the places of contact in between the urban fabric and water are focused on building issues and urban development questions rather than of ecological approaches. In this sense, this article aims to present solutions of rethinking the territories of contact in between cities and water fronts, having as pivotal concern, ecological solutions, friendly to the environment. The presented urban project is a requalification solution in order to promote the urban continuity from the buildings to the water, focused on river activities, sports and the preservation of architectural heritage.
   The urban project solution has as case study, a small town in the central region of Portugal, which is very well known by its thermal baths, with roman roots. The city of Sao Pedro do Sul is a very pleasant place for holidays, being visited for those who are looking for improving their health condition going to the Thermal Care Centre, or the contact with nature going to the water front of Vouga river. This is a low-density place, where the majority of constructions are single houses, and the main architectural landmark is the old train station, a building from the 19th century. Nowadays, there are no more trains arriving to Sao Pedro do Sul and the train track line is working as an ecological corridor for pedestrians and bicycles. However, besides this effort of improving the local environmental conditions, the contact of the city with the river is yet badly considered. There are still lots of urban voids, buildings in bad status of conservation or a lack of diversity and facilities in functional terms. The urban projects were designed in an academic background, comprising several teams of international students coming from Portugal, Greece, Brazil, Slovakia, Lithuania and Poland. A pioneer teaching methodology was tested at the Urban Planning Unit of the Master Degree in Architecture at the University of Beira Interior, as a result of an agreement with the local authority. The students were organized in groups in order to propose the urban design projects to the Train Station surroundings, ensuring the continuity of the urban fabric with the Vouga water front. The best projects won several pecuniary prizes, sponsored by the city hall, which was a stimulus for students along to the designing process. The conclusions show that the presented solution was concerned with strategies to preserve and to enhance the ecological identity of the place. This article will present the contents, options and solutions of the best urban project, designed by a team of students from Brazil and Portugal considered by the jury as the most ecological proposal, friendly of the natural features.

AB  - Urbanisation as a major driver of changes leads to the extinction of some species while others increase in abundance, especially non-native species. Spatiotemporal distribution patterns of these successful species are likely to be shaped by their response and tolerance to urban features. This study assesses the anthropo-ecological requirements of two co-occurring bird species, the native range-shifting jackdaw Corvus monedula and the non-native invasive ring-necked parakeet Psittacula krameri. We built yearly models over an eight-year period using an ensemble modelling approach assessing response differences through time and between species. Predictors describing human-made structures, socio-ecological proxies and resources availability were extracted from temporally coincident databases. Dispersal and habitat constraints were implemented in final models to provide more realistic forecasts of species future distributions. Ensemble models evaluated with a random partition of the training dataset showed a higher accuracy than those evaluated with an independent dataset from another time period. Our results highlight temporal variations in the relative importance of predictors for both studied species. Single-season occurrence data may thus be insufficient to characterize species ecological requirements. The ring-necked parakeet and the jackdaw showed different responses to urban features. Jackdaws preferred the more urbanized part of the city while the distribution of parakeets was strongly positively associated with the density of exotic ornamental trees. We concluded that ring-necked parakeet range expansion is likely to be driven by its effective ability to exploit urban resources which native species do not or under exploit, suggesting an open window of foraging opportunities. However, the jackdaw may be misled by a high cavity availability and a large amount of low-quality anthropogenic food in the urban core. We suggest that dynamic SDMs are a critical tool not only to forecast the future expansion of invasive species but also for a better understanding of processes driving urban biodiversity persistence.

AB  - This paper is based on exploratory interventions in a small city in the south-eastern part of Sweden. The interventions were inspired both by the art movement of Situationists and site-specific games. The activities were also supported by a diversity of theoretical perspectives. During winter 2016 eight women explored by developing playful methods what a city, understood both as a social and material space, could mean for a group of women recently moved to the city. Through the playful approach the project opened up room for participatory design and abled the group to formulate eight rules, also available for other city explorers in other cities.

AB  - The article explores the notions of post-city and post-city studies in the imaginal-ontological context and outlines the basic ontological models that help us imagine a large city of Modern and describe its radical spatial transformations. The author introduces the concept of co-spatiality, which determines the prospects for phenomenological studies of post-urban realities, and discusses the importance of the phenomena of borderlineness and post-nomadism in the formation of the post-urbanism and non-urban forms of settlement. The urban space ceases to be a city space in the traditional sense; it is rather divided into numerous "fractals" coexisting with space, constantly updated local situational events that can be interpreted ontologically and semantically in a variety of ways. The space of a big city, a megalopolis of the mature Modernity, is primarily an apophatic negativity of the growing and expanding movement, as if it denies that it grows parallel to the phenomenology of complete and local dissociation. The phenomenon of co-spatialitiy(ies) can be considered as the key discourse, taking into account the ontological point of view when analyzing the concept of post-city / post-metropolis. At the same time, the dynamic development of large cities of late Modernity led to the emergence and development of the phenomenon of interdimensionality. On the one hand, the physical representation of the urban environment is some sort of a "bait", a manifestation of the sociocultural and communicative appeal of large cities; on the other hand, they indicate, as a rule, a meta-visualization of emptiness, dis-communication and the formation of powerful ontological zones of "invisibility", which can occur parallel to coexisting communication flows, boundaries, nodes and places. Post-urbanism, apparently, should act, for the most part, as a boundary concept that describes and characterizes the boundary worlds of the accompanying spaces, only touching upon, but not intruding deeply into the dominant visual, sound and verbal affects of the physical reality of cities.

AB  - Estuarine seascapes are a mosaic of habitat types that are connected, to varying degrees, by the movement of organisms. In these seascapes, the attributes of the habitats themselves, as well as the spatial context in which they are embedded, can shape faunal assemblages. Here, we explicitly test how habitat and connectivity interact to shape fish assemblages across estuaries. Our model system comprised 6 distinct estuarine habitats (log snags, mangroves, rocky outcrops, seagrass, sand/mud and urban structures), which represent the full diversity of estuarine habitats and seascape contexts in our study systems. Fish were sampled with cameras at 318 sites in 13 subtropical estuaries in eastern Australia. Habitat type was the principal predictor of fish assemblage composition, an effect that was shaped by spatial connections to other habitats, particularly seagrass beds. Seagrass structured fish assemblages, not only by providing a complex habitat that contained more species and individuals than all other habitats, but also by having a 'footprint' beyond the edge of meadows. Fish were more diverse and abundant in non-seagrass sites that were closer to seagrass meadows. Two other seascape attributes, proximity of sites to the sea and to mangroves, also influenced the composition of fish assemblages, albeit less consistently than distance to seagrass. Conservation and fisheries management programs that seek to enhance or restore fish populations in subtropical estuaries should prioritise seagrass conservation initiatives, which encompass critical ecological linkages with other habitats in estuarine seascapes.

AB  - Many wildlife populations are either naturally, or as a result of human land use, patchily distributed in space. The degree of fragmentation-specifically the remaining patch sizes and habitat configuration-is an important part of population dynamics. Demographic stochasticity is also likely to play an important role in patchy habitats that host small local populations. We develop a simulation model to evaluate the significance of demographic stochasticity and the role fragmentation plays in the determination of population dynamics and the risk of extinction of populations on habitat patches. Our model is formulated as a Markov-chain stochastic process on a finite, spatially explicit array of patches in which probability of successful dispersal is a function of interpatch distance. Unlike past work, we explicitly model local population dynamics and examine how these scale up to the entire population. As a test case, we apply the model to the American pika (Ochotona princeps) population living on the ore dumps in the ghost mining town of Bodie, California. This population has been studied nearly continuously for over four decades and has been of conservation concern as the southern half of the population declined precipitously beginning in 1989. Our model suggests that both the specific configuration of habitat and landscape heterogeneity are necessary and sufficient predictors of the eventual extinction of the southern constellation of patches. This example has important implications, as it suggests that fragmentation alone can lead to regional extinctions within metapopulations.

AB  - This article discusses the political-economic transformations triggered by the capitalism restructuring and its repercussion in urban spaces, essentially cities that are commonly transformed into places of strategic development, urban entrepreneurship and overlap extraction. These changes lead to social contradictions and inequality among classes, especially for a precarious and neglected population facing deprivation of essential elements. In this study, we refer to this population as Precarious Mobilizers. We analyzed the work of a homeless movement in the cities of Recife and Jaboatao dos Guararapes, evaluating the conjuncture of their social base (political, economic and social) and the political repercussion of these collective subjects in the conquest of the houses and in facing an exclusionary model. We used empirical monitoring of occupational nuclei in the aforementioned cities and questionnaires among the families that are part of the movement in question. The study describes their methods to fight inequality and characterize the families involved in the movement.

AB  - This paper presents the results of my PhD research in architecture and urbanism, which analyzes an urban form and its use as a territorial planning tool. The object of study was the protected historic cities listed on the Brazilian coast, which have restrictions on building construction. These cities are influenced by urban flows, the impact of the metropolitan dynamics, and contemporary transformations. The research discusses the rigidity of the building legislation in the urban perimeter of these cities, while urban transformations and informal growth take place in peripheral areas in varied forms, types and arrangements. It aims to identify classify and conceptualize the morphological types that appear as urban occurrences and consolidate as dispersed informal nuclei. Such urban occurrences are due to the building restrictions, the lack of territorial planning, and the contemporary globalized model of life, which shapes social inequality in urban expansion. The research methodology consisted of a perimeter survey of the 27 heritage listed cities on the Brazilian coast, according to the parameters obtained by New Brazilian Forest Law (12.651/2012) and Brazilian Urban Land Parceling Law (Law 6.766/1979). Also, imagery collected by Google Earth was used to identify urban formations that deviate from legislation, similarly to the object of study. As a result, 16 types of urban forms were classified, which consolidated as nuclei of dispersed formations and were linked to an informal urban structural network. Also, territorial planning guidelines were designed, using the analysis of urban forms as a tool for urban transformation.

AB  - By using the Life Watch database a European e-science infrastructure on native and alien plant occurrence collected from a wide set of Italian terrestrial sites we estimated the occurrence of alien species in a cross habitat framework in relation to propagule pressure (P), abiotic (A) and biotic (B) conditions. The research represents an example of macro-ecological assessment of invasion risk at national scale claimed by the recent European regulation (EU 1143/2014) on invasive alien species. Based on a large vegetation dataset, we estimated alien and native species richness across a set of 19 Italian terrestrial sites. By using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we investigated the relationship between the proportion of alien occurrence across sites and habitat types (EUNIS) at family level with PAB putative drivers derived from Life Watch and other open access geographic databases. Our results support the full model as the best-fitting option, highlighting that plant invasion in the Italian terrestrial ecosystems is a function of the combination of PAB conditions. In the first step of the invasion process, the accessibility time from towns plays a major role. By contrast, the abiotic filter imposed by environmental condition (high temperatures and low precipitations) as well the competition with the native community (high species richness) may pose a limit to the settlement and spread of alien species. Because of the high availability of similar data on PAB conditions worldwide, this study represents an effective and easy tool to design appropriate biodiversity conservation policies focused on the prevention of alien spread.

AB  - Many wildlife species occupy landscapes that vary in the distribution, abundance, and quality of food resources. Increasingly, urbanized and agricultural habitats provide supplemental food resources that can have profound consequences for host distributions, movement patterns, and pathogen exposure. Understanding how host and pathogen dispersal across landscapes is affected by the spatial extent of food-supplemented habitats is therefore important for predicting the consequences for pathogen spread and impacts on host occupancy. Here we develop a generalizable metapopulation model to understand how the relative abundance of provisioned habitats across the landscape and how the host dispersal responses to provisioning and infection influence patch occupancy by hosts and their pathogens. We find that pathogen invasion and landscape-level infection prevalence are greatest when provisioning increases patch attractiveness and disperser production and when infection has minimal costs on dispersal success. Alternatively, if provisioning promotes site fidelity or reduces disperser production, increasing the fraction of food-supplemented habitats can reduce landscape-scale infection prevalence and minimize disease-induced declines in host occupancy. This work highlights the importance of considering how resources and infection jointly influence host dispersal for predicting how changing resource distributions influence the spread of infectious diseases.

AB  - Development of road network is one of the strongest drivers of habitat fragmentation. It interferes with ecological processes that are based on material and energy flows between landscape patches. Therefore, changes in temporal patterns of roads may be regarded as important landscape-level environmental indicators. The aim of this study is to analyze road development and associated agricultural land use change near the town of Erdemli located in the eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The study area has witnessed an unprecedented development of agriculture since the 2000s. This process has resulted with the expansion of the road network. Associations between agricultural expansion and road development were investigated. High-resolution satellite images of 2004 and 2015 were used to analyze spatial and temporal dimensions of change. Satellite images were classified using a binary approach, in which land areas were labeled as either "agriculture" or "non-agriculture." Road networks were digitized manually. The study area was divided into 23 sublandscapes using a regular grid with 1-km cell spacing. Percentage of landscape (PL) for agriculture and road density (RD) metrics were calculated for the earlier (2004) and later (2015) years. Metric calculations were performed separately for each of the 23 sublandscapes in order to understand spatial diversity of agriculture and road density. Study results showed that both RD and PL exhibited similar increasing trends between 2004 and 2015.

AB  - The aim of this article is to explore urban knitting as a worldwide social movement, rather than solely a kind of inoffensive urban graffiti made with knitted fabric. Building on the available literature and original research, the article argues that this movement weaves together elements from craftivism, domesticity, handicraft, art, and feminism. It then explores a specific urban knitting initiative, called Mettiamoci una pezza (Let's patch it), carried out in L'Aquila, Italy, 3 years after the earthquake that devastated the city in 2009. To analyze the sociopolitical aspects of this initiative, a series of qualitative research studies was conducted over time, to which were added semistructured interviews with the initiative's local organizers. The findings show that the initiative in L'Aquila clearly exhibits the five original features of the urban knitting movement that emerge from the literature as being characteristic of this movement.

AB  - Ecological traps attract biota to low-quality habitats. Landscape traps are zones caught in a vortex of spiralling degradation. Here, we demonstrate how short-range endemic (SRE) traits may make such taxa vulnerable to ecological and landscape traps. Three SRE species of mygalomorph spider were used in this study: Idiommata blackwalli, Idiosoma sigillatum and an undescribed Aganippe sp. Mygalomorphs can be long-lived (>43 years) and select sites for permanent burrows in their early dispersal phase. Spiderlings from two species, I. blackwalli (n = 20) and Aganippe sp. (n = 50), demonstrated choice for microhabitats under experimental conditions, that correspond to where adults typically occur in situ. An invasive veldt grass microhabitat was selected almost exclusively by spiderlings of I. sigillatum. At present, habitat dominated by veldt grass in Perth, Western Australia, has lower prey diversity and abundance than undisturbed habitats and therefore may act as an ecological trap for this species. Furthermore, as a homogenising force, veldt grass can spread to form a landscape trap in naturally heterogeneous ecosystems. Selection of specialised microhabitats of SREs may explain high extinction rates in old, stable landscapes undergoing (human-induced) rapid change.

AB  - Conservation authorities invest heavily in the restoration and/or creation of wetlands to counteract the destruction of habitat caused by urbanization. Monitoring the colonization of these new wetlands is critical to an adaptive management process. We conducted a turtle mark-recapture survey in a 250 ha artificially created wetland complex in a large North American city (Toronto, Ontario). We found that two of Ontario's eight native turtle species (Snapping turtle (SN), Chelydra serpentina, and Midland Painted (MP) turtle, Chrysemys picta marginata) were abundant and both were confirmed nesting. The Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) was present but not well established. Species richness and turtle density were not equally distributed throughout the wetland complex. We noted SN almost exclusively populated one water body, while other areas of the wetland had a varying representation of both species. The sex ratios of both SN and MP turtles were 1:1. We tracked the movement of Snapping and Blanding's turtles and found that most turtles explored at least two water bodies in the park, that females explored more water bodies than males, and that 95% of turtles showed fidelity to individual overwintering wetlands. We performed DNA analysis of two Blanding's turtles found in the created wetlands and could not assign these turtles to any known profiled populations. The genetic data suggest that the turtles probably belong to a remnant local population. We discuss the implications of our results for connectivity of artificial wetlands and the importance of the whole wetland complex to this turtle assemblage.

AB  - Tidal creeks in large coastal deltas can be important habitat for fish but are often highly modified by human activities. Connectivity between tributary creeks and mainstem channels is often constrained by structures such as dikes and floodgates, designed to protect urban and agricultural areas from flooding. While they play important roles in flood mitigation, floodgates can diminish habitat quality and block fish from accessing tidal creeks. It is likely that floodgates differ in their operations and may consequently open for different amounts of time; however, floodgate operations and their effects are not well quantified. We asked the question: how does the mechanical functioning of these floodgates affect fish communities in tidal creeks? We used time-lapse cameras and quantified the timing of gate openings for 22 tributaries of the Lower Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada, and related these operational data to differences in fish communities above and below floodgates. Floodgate operations varied substantially, with some floodgates opening daily while others opened less than 20% of the day, on average. Sites with floodgates that seldom opened were associated with greater differences in fish communities and with reduced upstream native species richness by about one species on average. Where floodgates opened infrequently, we also found lower upstream dissolved oxygen concentrations than at sites where floodgates opened for longer periods of time. Thus, floodgate operations can influence fish communities as well as water quality. These data indicate a large scope for improving floodgate operations for connectivity.

AB  - At the present time, rehabilitation of polluted urban areas and the restoration of their soil are environmental priorities. The creation of constructed soils appears to be a tempting way to restore, lastingly, a contaminated urban soil provided that they can become fertile and host a functional biodiversity delivering essential ecosystem services.
   To ensure this, the recolonization of newly established technosols composed of a mixture of compost and in situ deep alluvion was monitored using judiciously chosen bioindicators: springtails, mites, earthworms, carabid beetles and woodlice. These technosols were part of an experimental plot located inside the future "Ecoquartier de l'Union" (Roubaix, France).
   The results show that, if the connection of the technosols with an element of the local landscape (in this case a railway hedgerow) plays a part chiefly in aiding the first stages of recolonization, notably for earthworms and springtails, technosols management has a lasting impact on the colonization dynamics and the implantation of the different taxa.
   Establishing an herbaceous cover (flowering meadow, lawn) or a hedge was especially profitable to the pedofaunic communities, which were richer and more abundant, as well as to the technosols functioning (better litter degradation, diversified collembolan communities with regards to functional traits). The same is true for the addition of RCW (Ramial Chipped Wood) which benefits earthworm and mesofauna through the organic components released and the associated fungal development.

AB  - BackgroundUrban forests are under increased pressure from invasion by exotic (alien) species. The vegetation present in the matrix of urban sites is a rich source of alien invasive propagules, which increases the risk of alien invasion in forests within an urban space, leading to a decline in indigenous species. Therefore, determining the distribution patterns of native and exotic species as influenced by environmental factors can assist in quantifying the impact of exotic species at broad scales based on responses on a finer scale. Quantifying the effects of multiple environmental factors on the distribution patterns of both indigenous and alien species in the ecosystem may help in prescribing suitable management efforts.MethodsFifteen forest patches were sampled in the eThekwini (Durban) Municipality and data collected from 74 100-m(2) plots with different degrees of invasion. Indigenous and alien species of trees, shrubs and climbers occurring in ten and more plots were considered for analysis and the CANOCO 5.1 package was used to run various constrained ordination analyses. Variation partitioning analysis was used to assess the impact of environmental variables at different spatial scales, namely the plot and patch scales.ResultsCanopy gaps are the major controlling factor for invasive alien plants (IAPs) occurrence at fine scale. At patch level, residential and industry areas outside the boundaries (buffer area) of forest patches have a high influence on the distribution of IAPs. Communities dominated by the invasive Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King are most common on the lowland coastal forests while communities dominated by either Litsea glutinosa (Lour.) C.B.Rob. or Cardiospermum grandiflorum Sw. can prevail in both lowland coastal and scarp forests.ConclusionsCanopy gaps in lowland forests can facilitate the transition of native forests to novel communities containing a variety of alien plant species. Communities of shrub, climber and tree IAPs occur in lowland coastal forests while climber and tree IAPs dominate the high-elevation scarp forests. The resilience shown by some native species to the tree, shrub and climber IAPs by remaining when IAPs establish makes these species very suitable for restoration projects. Forest patches surrounded by a high incidence of residential and industrial areas in the buffer matrix are likely to have a high diversity of IAPs. Larger patch size and high connectivity to nearby native forests are key in reducing invasion by IAPs.

AB  - Socio-ecological systems maintain reciprocal interactions between biophysical and socioeconomic structures. As a result of these interactions key essential services for society emerge. Urban expansion is a direct driver of land change and cause serious shifts in socio-ecological relationships and the associated lifestyles. The framework of rural-urban gradients has proved to be a powerful tool for ecological research about urban influences on ecosystems and on sociological issues related to social welfare. However, to date there has not been an attempt to achieve a classification of municipalities in rural-urban gradients based on socio-ecological interactions. In this paper, we developed a methodological approach that allows identifying and classifying a set of socio-ecological network configurations in the Region of Madrid, a highly dynamic cultural landscape considered one of the European hotspots in urban development. According to their socio-ecological links, the integrated model detects four groups of municipalities, ordered along a rural-urban gradient, characterized by their degree of biophysical and socioeconomic coupling and different indicators of landscape structure and social welfare. We propose the developed model as a useful tool to improve environmental management schemes and land planning from a socio-ecological perspective, especially in territories subject to intense urban transformations and loss of rurality.

AB  - For the first time in the Anthropocene, the global demographic and economic trends that have resulted in unprecedented destruction of the environment are now creating the necessary conditions for a possible renaissance of nature. Drawing reasonable inferences from current patterns, we can predict that 100 years from now, the Earth could be inhabited by between 6 and 8 billion people, with very few remaining in extreme poverty, most living in towns and cities, and nearly all participating in a technologically driven, interconnected market economy. Building on the scholarship of others in demography, economics, sociology, and conservation biology, here, we articulate a theory of social-environmental change that describes the simultaneous and interacting effects of urban lifestyles on fertility, poverty alleviation, and ideation. By recognizing the shifting dynamics of these macrodrivers, conservation practice has the potential to transform itself from a discipline managing declines ("bottleneck") to a transformative movement of recovery ("breakthrough").

AB  - Life history adaptations and spatial configuration of metapopulation networks allow certain species to persist in extreme fluctuating environments, yet long-term stability within these systems relies on the maintenance of linkage habitat. Degradation of such linkages in urban riverscapes can disrupt this dynamic in aquatic species, leading to increased extinction debt in local populations experiencing environment-related demographic flux. We used microsatellites and mtDNA to examine the effects of collapsed network structure in the endemic Santa Ana sucker Catostomus santaanae of southern California, a threatened species affected by natural flood-drought cycles, "boom-and-bust" demography, hybridization and presumed artificial transplantation. Our results show a predominance of drift-mediated processes in shaping population structure and that reverse mechanisms for counterbalancing the genetic effects of these phenomena have dissipated with the collapse of dendritic connectivity. We use approximate Bayesian models to support two cases of artificial transplantation and provide evidence that one of the invaded systems better represents the historic processes that maintained genetic variation within watersheds than any remaining drainages where C.santaanae is considered native. We further show that a stable dry gap in the northern range is preventing genetic dilution of pure C.santaanae persisting upstream of a hybrid assemblage involving a non-native sucker and that local accumulation of genetic variation in the same drainage is influenced by position within the network. This work has important implications for declining species that have historically relied on dendritic metapopulation networks to maintain source-sink dynamics in phasic environments, but no longer possess this capacity in urban-converted landscapes.

AB  - Dispersal is a fundamental process that facilitates population and range expansion by providing a mechanism for colonization and metapopulation linkages. Yet quantifying the dispersal process, particularly long-distance dispersal events, has been inherently difficult due to technological and observational limitations. Additionally, dispersal distance calculated as the straight-line distance between initiation and settlement fails to account for the actual movement path of the animal during dispersal. Here, we highlight six long-distance dispersal events, representing some of the longest dispersal distances recorded for red foxes. Cumulative dispersal movements ranged from 132 to 1036 km and occurred within both sexes (1 female, 5 males). With one exception, dispersal events ranged from 7 to 22 days and tended to be directed north-northwest. Importantly, cumulative movements were up to five times longer than straight-line distances, with two foxes traveling an additional 114 and 256 km before returning to, and settling in, areas previously encountered during dispersal. This suggests a role of habitat assessment and homing behavior during dispersal and indicates that the capacity and potential for dispersal are not limiting factors to either sex in a red fox population. Dispersal capacity should thus be considered regarding transboundary management and disease control of red fox populations.

AB  - Urban agriculture (UA) has turned into a diverse and complex movement. Important challenges will be to set accurate expectations by civil society in relation to UA development, and to find ways to discuss UA in governance and collaboration networks from an aggregate point of view. However, analytical tools that allow comprehensive study of UA initiatives (UAIs) are absent. This article elaborates on a conceptual framework from the COST Action Urban Agriculture Europe (Prove et al. 2015) and evaluates findings that result from applying the framework to four UAIs. We found that, analytically, the framework generates in-depth information on UAIs, and argue that it can be a useful tool in networks that are responsible for collaboration, support, or governance within the UA movement. We also discuss its usability issues and discuss future research.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration planning requires an integrated approach considering many components of the natural system when prioritizing where and what to restore. Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and partners have developed a multi-discipline and multi-benefit approach to restoration planning that facilitates effective restoration works, which contribute to realizing regional watershed objectives pertaining to natural system functions. Through various long term monitoring and modeling initiatives, Toronto and Region Conservation Authority has amassed a wealth of knowledge on terrestrial biodiversity, aquatic ecosystems, hydrology, and headwater conditions. The aim of Integrated Restoration Prioritization is to identify impairments and threats to ecosystem function as a means to improve the delivery of ecological goods and services. Consolidating data and comparing discrete areas based on different parameters and thresholds can help direct decision making for future restoration initiatives. The first iteration of the Integrated Restoration Prioritization analyzed existing datasets, identified gaps, and made recommendations for future monitoring. This approach will assist with delisting Beneficial Use Impairments #14 Loss of Fish and Wildlife Habitat and #3 Degradation of Fish and Wildlife Populations within the Toronto Remedial Action Plan area. Further, the Integrated Restoration Prioritization will assist in implementing the recommendations made in watershed planning documents pertaining to fisheries and natural heritage management. Specifically, the Integrated Restoration Prioritization will identify where impairments to ecological function are located, ensure habitats and corridor linkages are protected or restored, and prioritize local and upstream catchments that could contribute most to improving the natural system if restored.

AB  - Cities and adjacent regions represent foci of intense human activity and provide unique opportunities for studying human-mediated dispersal and gene flow. We examined the effect of landscape features on gene flow in the invasive grass Brachypodium sylvaticum across an urban-rural interface at the edge of its expanding range. We used genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism surveys of individuals from 22 locations. Resistance surfaces were created for each landscape feature, using ResistanceGA to optimize resistance parameters. Our STRUCTURE analysis identified three distinct clusters, and diversity analyses support the existence of at least three local introductions. Multiple regression on distance matrices showed no evidence that development, roads, canopy cover or agriculture had a significant influence on genetic distance in B. sylvaticum. Geographical distance was a mediocre predictor of genetic distance and reflected geographical clustering. The model of rivers acting as a conduit explained a large portion of variation in genetic distance, but the lack of evidence of directional gene flow eliminated hydrochory as a dispersal mechanism. These results and observations of the distribution of populations in disturbed sites indicate that the influence of rivers on patterns of dispersal of B. sylvaticum probably reflects seed dispersal due to human recreational activity.

AB  - Land use and climate change are increasingly important stressors affecting freshwater ecosystems. Although their effects on freshwater organisms have been widely studied, most studies applied traditional statistical methods, which only focus on single stressor and simple cause-effect relationships without considering the complex interactions among stressors. Therefore, we developed an integrated method by combining Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) and Bayesian Networks (BNs) to estimate the interactive effect of land use and climate change on freshwater macroinvertebrates. A field investigation was conducted in August 2009 in Taizi River Basin, Northeast China, and samples of stream macroinverterbates and water chemistry were collected from 211 sites. The SEM-BN models were developed to explore the complex relationships among land use cover (crop, forest and residential land), water quality (total phosphorus, total nitrogen and dissolved oxygen), physical factors influenced by climate change (water temperature, flow velocity), other habitat characteristics (slope and substrate composition) and macroinvertebrate EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) indices (the percentage of EPT taxa, EPT richness, EPT abundance and the Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index of EPT). Three scenarios were designed to assess the possible responses of EPT indices to land use change, climate change and their interactions. Our results showed that when the change of land use and climate were considered alone, increasing crop and urban land led to declines in EPT indices whereas moderate rise of air temperature and more rainfall had opposite effects. However, the combined effect showed that the positive effects caused by climate change could weaken some negative effects, but land use change still had stronger effect on EPT indices. Our results provided more detailed understanding on how environmental stressors affect freshwater organisms, and further catchment management should integrate the combined effect of different environmental stressors on streams.

AB  - Avoiding foraging under increased predation risk is a common anti-predator behaviour. Using artificial light to amplify predation risk at ecologically valuable sites has been proposed to deter introduced mice (Mus musculus) and ship rats (Rattus rattus) from degrading biodiversity in island ecosystems. However, light may adversely affect native species; in particular, little is known about invertebrate responses to altered lighting regimes. We investigated how endemic orthopterans responded to artificial light at Maungatautari Ecological Island (Waikato, New Zealand). We predicted that based on their nocturnal behaviour, ecology and evolutionary history, tree weta (Hemideina thoracica) and cave weta (Rhaphidophoridae) would reduce their activity under illumination. Experimental stations (n = 15) experienced three evenings under each treatment (order randomised): (a) light (illuminated LED fixture), (b) dark (unilluminated LED fixture) and (c) baseline (no lighting fixture). Weta visitation rates were analysed from images captured on infra-red trail cameras set up at each station. Light significantly reduced the number of observations of cave (71.7% reduction) and tree weta (87.5% reduction). In observations where sex was distinguishable (53% of all visits), male tree weta were observed significantly more often (85% of visits) than females (15% of visits) and while males avoided illuminated sites, no detectable difference was observed across treatments for females. Sex could not be distinguished for cave weta. Our findings have implications for the use of light as a novel pest management strategy, and for the conservation of invertebrate diversity and abundance within natural and urban ecosystems worldwide that may be affected by light pollution.

AB  - Some concepts travel worldwide, although they remain unobtrusively attached to the contexts in which they were produced and, therefore, are insufficiently abstract and general. Gentrification is a travelling concept with lingering attachments to the Anglo-American urban context. Three issues related to gentrification's global reach are discussed in this paper. The first is the definition of gentrification. The simple definition adopted by the current gentrification research agenda leads us to accept gentrification's global reach literally by definition. The second issue is the question of contextual boundaries. Boundaries that are too broad and ill-defined - such as the metropolis of the Global North versus the metropolis of the Global South - conceal what contextual difference may be about. The third issue is the reification of cultural differences, which may lead to them being used to explain attitudes towards gentrification, even though such attitudes could be explained by more prosaic socioeconomic motives compatible with Western rationalism. This paper concludes that the metamorphoses of gentrification through its different waves in the Anglophone world do not provide the script for understanding other cities' urban histories and making sense of their urban restructuring processes. These cities must realize that new processes emerging under increasingly neoliberal policy orientations are regressive compared with previous arrangements, especially when they tend to exclude political alternatives. The Anglo-American world may have been a pioneering laboratory for the application of gentrification policies, but other parts of the world have shown more effective resistance that can be an asset in future struggles and sociopolitical arrangements and make a difference in people's lives.

AB  - The past 10 years witnessed a resurgence of youth activism in East Asia. While some may consider it as simply reflecting a broader, general trend of young people reacting to the neoliberalizing world, this paper pays special attention to the changing cultural geographies of East Asia that underlie part of the picture. In 2014, the Sunflower movement in Taiwan was triggered by a group of young people who occupied the Legislative Yuan, paralyzed the establishment for 23 days, and brought about alternative politics, which soon was echoed by the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong during 26 September to 15 December the same year. This paper is interested in understanding how young people, walking away from the aforementioned urban uprising with their memories of participating in a sort of exceptional city for short time, carried on their aspiration for alternatives in their everyday lives. Finding inspiration from Victor Turner's notion of liminoid and anti-structure, it attends to the activism embedded in everyday life. It also attends to the translocal, transnational interaction among young actors across cities in East Asia, with a focus on the act of place-fixing, which enables connection, collaboration, and circulation (of resources) through materialistic, transactive practices and can be compared to place-making.

AB  - As most of the world population live in cities with over 60% increase in population in 2030 presenting major challenges related to noise pollution that leads to health concerns, there is a demand for a smart solution that mitigates noise pollution in cities before it reaches dangerous levels. In this paper, we propose a smart city architecture through the internet of things (IoT) to mitigate noise pollution. Mitigation includes the detection and reporting of affected areas and the prediction of possibly affected areas in a city. To evaluate the proposed architecture, we designed Noise Pollution Monitoring System (NPMS) that locates the areas, the time, the level of noise and any related events in the area to provide intelligence throughout applying data mining techniques. Intelligence includes determining if a city is suffering noise pollution, frequent locations where noise pollution needs to be mitigated and the time typically noise pollution occurs in correspondence with nearby occurrences e.g. rush hour, or reported incidents (events) in the city local news agencies. We designed noise pollution detection endpoints that can be deployed at certain locations to collect information including location, time and sound volume. We deployed the endpoints at two major intersections to collect noise levels in order to detect if an area suffers noise pollution and then utilized Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers to create a model of prediction of noise pollution before it occurs. Finally, we report the validity of prediction algorithm as well as the functional system.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative study of the expected changes in load curves of two major cities in India, if their respective rooftop PV potentials are achieved. Rooftop PV potential assessments studies done for the city of Mumbai concluded that the city has around 1.72 GW potential. Based on similar studies, the city of Delhi is reported to have around 2.56 GW potential. Load pattern of the cities were obtained from the data from 'load dispatch centers' of the respective cities and PV generation patterns were simulated using PVSyst software. It was observed that, in Indian cities, the summer load curve has two peak demand points, one at midday and one in the late evening. In winter, the peak occurs in the morning. If we can have a fairly distributed rooftop PV system in the city (so that the local fluctuations in generation due to cloud movement, etc., can be neglected) the city's peak load demand during the midday can be easily met using distributed PV systems. Similarly, the maximum ramping rates of demand before and after the integration of PV were comparable, but time shifted, thus would not pose any major threat to the stability of the grid.

AB  - Management of wildlife in habitats fragmented by urbanisation requires an understanding of a species' habitat use. Known populations of the critically endangered western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis) are largely restricted to bushland remnants in rapidly urbanising areas of south-western Australia. Habitat use is thought to be driven by nutritional content, structure and connectivity of canopy vegetation. At the southernmost extent of the species' range, habitat use is largely unknown, although it is expected to be different from previous descriptions due to differences in vegetation characteristics. We used VHF and global positioning system tracking collars to determine short-term home-range size, diurnal refuge use and night-time tree use of western ringtail possums in bushland remnants within Albany City. Possums had small home ranges (0.88ha) that were negatively correlated with percentage canopy cover; used a variety of daytime refuges (predominantly dreys); and preferentially utilised marri (Corymbia calophylla) and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) at night. These results confirm that differences in habitat use among populations exist and suggests that the species is reasonably flexible in its use of habitat. Management of western ringtail possums needs to be population specific and will benefit from further examination of habitat use in the variety of occupied habitats.

AB  - Urbanization often negatively impacts biological diversity. Some organisms, however, have traits that are preadapted to urban environments and thus may thrive. Reticulitermes flavipes is one such organism. Indigenous to the Eastern US, it has been introduced into multiple countries. In France, R. flavipes causes major damage to buildings. Although Paris is one of the country's most infested cities, the factors determining R. flavipes' distribution and propagation are poorly understood. Using data on termite occurrence, termite genetics, and environmental variables, our study aims to identify factors that explain the distribution and spread of R. flavipes within Paris. First, we explored the association between several environmental variables and the termite's distribution pattern in Paris; since 2000, a total of 2106 infestations have been recorded. Second, we inferred termite population and colony genetic structure at 66 sample locations using 9 microsatellite loci. Third, we used least-cost models and partial Mantel tests to study the effects of environmental variables on the termite's population genetic structure. Our analyses revealed that building-related variables were significantly associated with termite infestations and could thus help explain the termite's spatial distribution pattern. Furthermore, railway networks also explain termite propagation and genetic patterns. Additionally, we found that the termite's spread is likely driven by budding dispersal, which may be constrained by buildings and roads. Even if budding dispersal could facilitate R. flavipes' spread in urban areas, it cannot explain the termite's distribution in Paris all on its own. Indeed, termite propagation seems to be significantly driven by anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Landscape conversion to agriculture is the primary cause for habitat loss worldwide. As partial mitigation, agricultural landscapes may be designated as ecological corridors due to their presumed habitability and permeability to wildlife. Behavioral changes following anthropogenic disturbance can affect species' spatio-temporal activity patterns and modify interactions, and thus influence habitat preferences. Understanding how human activity affects wildlife behavior and how such behavioral changes scale up to the community may enhance the effectiveness of conservation schemes. We used camera traps to measure the activity of five mammal species along a disturbance gradient in an agricultural -natural mosaic landscape designated as a national ecological corridor. Wildlife diurnal activity was minimal around towns, where humans were active during the day. Nevertheless, predator activity increased near towns and at other sites of high disturbance. Although attracted to highly disturbed areas, predators avoided humans temporally by restricting activity to night-time, whereas prey activity relative to less disturbed areas was negligible. We conclude that perceived threat from humans during daytime combined with elevated nocturnal predation risk exclude prey species from large areas of an agricultural region designated as ecological corridor. Human activity may have triggered a cascading effect mediated by predators' diel activity shifts, which reduced landscape permeability to prey. Our study underlines the need to consider wildlife diel activity patterns for conservation and environmental management planning.

AB  - Tourism in mountainous regions is a significant source of revenue generation. However, it has also been associated with many adverse environmental consequences. This study aims at assessing the negative impacts of the incessant upsurge in tourism development on the physical environment of Mussoorie, a well-known mountain tourist destination in India. The impact indicators for the region were identified and assessed by qualitative and quantitative analysis of field observations. The observations indicated the aggravation of traffic congestion, atmospheric pollution, undisposed solid waste, water scarcity and infrastructure unavailability as the prevalent issues, especially during the peak tourist months. The extent of the consequential damage to the environment was evaluated by conducting an assessment of tourism-induced human disturbance on the natural landscape of the town. Slope, slope aspect, vegetation cover, road network and drainage network were incorporated as the determining landscape attributes to prepare thematic maps of landscape quality (perceivable intrinsic properties) and landscape fragility (vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances) using GIS technique. An absorption capacity map was finally prepared to characterize the study area into regions of different conservation needs. The results identified the need for planning appropriate preservation strategies for different tourist places in the town. The study can be used by the policy makers for implementing the regulatory measures against potential disturbances due to mass-tourism.

AB  - Roads are the link between geographic space and human socio-economic activities, promoting local economic development, and simultaneously causing various negative effects, such as segmentation, interference, destruction, degradation, and pollution. In China, the construction of roads is rapid, which might affect wildlife movement, landscape pattern, and land use change, thereby, affecting the conservation of heritage sites. In the present study, the minimum cumulative resistance model, along with geographic information system technology, was adopted to compute the ecological corridor for wildlife movement between the source patches and to analyze ecological corridor changes under two conditions (road presence/absence) at two time points in Kanas, nominated as a World Natural Heritage site. The relationships between the ecological corridor changes and various factors, including the cutting index of the road-effect zones', terrain, and road geometric characteristics, were examined using the geographical detector model to identify the influencing factors and mechanisms of the corridor changes, in order to rationally simulate the potential ecological corridors. In addition, the detached and fragmented ecological patches can be connected to effectively protect the biodiversity, biological habitats, and species, which are important means to achieve regional sustainable development and ecological construction.

AB  - Mutualistic interactions between plants and animals can play a critical role in invasion by alien plants. We investigated the expansion patterns of the loquat Eriobotrya japonica in urbanized areas of Tokyo, Japan, and the potential contribution of crows (Corvus spp.) to this process. The loquat produces large fleshy fruits, and preliminary observations suggest that the Jungle Crow C. macrorhynchos is the main vector for loquat seed dispersal in the area. We searched for loquat plants between the 29 stations of the Yamanote Line, a railroad that encircles central Tokyo. We identified the origin of each plant (invasive or planted), and recorded their growth and fruiting patterns. Then, we investigated the relationships between fruit/seed sizes of the plant and the gape sizes of two crow species occurring in the area, along with other possible seed-dispersers (four bird species), to assess their effectiveness as seed dispersers. We confirmed that a considerable number of loquat plants have invaded the area, and that some of them have grown sufficiently large to produce fruits. Both invading and planted loquats were concentrated in the northern parts of the Yamanote Line, and their densities in each section were correlated. Comparison of fruit/seed sizes with avian gape widths suggests that only the two crow species have gapes of sufficient size to be able to consume loquat fruit, and swallow the seeds; thus they are the most likely agents of loquat seed dispersal. We concluded that, although the loquat has a limited range of seed dispersers, crows play a critical role in the invasion and expansion of the species.

AB  - This article addresses the connection between Pentecostalism and a movement of people who had occupied urban land in an effort to gain legal residence. Based on an investigation of the "Ocupacao Gloria" land settlement in the city of Uberlandia, Brazil, we analyse the ways in which demands for the right to housing are associated with Pentecostal dynamics and cosmologies. We examine how Pentecostals contribute to a movement to legalize unauthorized settlements in urban space, and establish an overlapping of political struggle and spiritual battle. We also investigate how the practices of evangelical churches in the "Ocupacao Gloria" at times work in juxtaposition and at times in opposition to other modalities of the social movement that operate in the settlement.

AB  - Habitat loss and urbanisation in the tropics have been recognised as major drivers of species extinctions. Concurrently, novel habitats such as urban parks have been shown to be important as habitats and stepping stones in urban ecosystems around the world. However, few studies have assessed long-tenn patterns of species extinctions and discoveries in response to these drivers in the tropics. We know little about long-term persistence and utility of novel habitats in tropical urban ecosystems. In this study, we produced an updated and exhaustive butterfly checklist of species recorded from Singapore till December 2017 to investigate trends in butterfly extirpations (local extinctions), discoveries (new country records) and rediscoveries and how these relate to land use change in 28 years (1990-2017) in Singapore. Up to 144 butterfly species were identified to be extirpated in Singapore by 1990. From 1990-2017, an additional nine butterfly extirpations have potentially occurred, which suggests a maximum of 153 butterfly extirpations to date. The rate of extirpations between 1990 to 2017 (< 0.33 extirpations per year) was much lower than the rate of extirpations between 1926 to 1989 (> 1.52 extirpations per year). The majority of potentially extirpated butterflies between 1990 to 2017 were species restricted to mature forests. Over this period, 51 new species were discovered, while 65 species were rediscovered, which collectively represent 24% of the total and 35% of the extant butterfly fauna of Singapore. Interestingly, 33% of discovered species were only observed in degraded secondary forests or urban parks in Singapore, the former maturing with age and the latter having increased in area during the same time period. We hypothesise that the current slowdown in butterfly extirpations may be representative of habitat recovery and/or improved habitat connectivity, lower undetected extirpations, and/or lengthening of extinction debts. A slowdown in extirpations and an increased utilisation of novel habitats by discovered species present a window of conservation opportunity to restore native habitats and increase habitat connectivity among existing patches of managed vegetation.

AB  - This editorial introduces the special feature on the social-ecological system of a fire-prone forest landscape in Oregon, USA. Research into social-ecological systems of fire-frequent landscapes is in its infancy and this special feature highlights one of the first attempts to understand a fire-dependent forest landscape from this perspective. An agent-based landscape modeling framework, Envision, was the primary tool for the research. The papers in this special feature examine three major questions: (1) What is the landscape structure of forest conditions, fire regimes, ownerships, and attitudes toward fire and forest management?; (2) How are social networks of the study region structured and how might they influence attitudes and actions of landowners?; (3) How do land management policies, institutions, and decisions interact to influence future fire occurrence, biodiversity, and ecosystem services? The findings of the empirical research and simulation modeling reveal how the high ecological and social (e.g., landownership and management goals) diversity of the region contributes to very different fire potentials, attitudes, and management approaches across space. The social network analysis reveals that the social network is divided into fire protection and fire restoration subnetworks that only a few organizations were able to bridge. The simulation modeling shows how difficult it can be to affect fire behavior across large areas, and what the trade-offs of different management actions might be in terms of ecosystem services and fire risk. The special feature also includes papers that examine how social science research is influenced by the use of an agent-based model, and what has been learned about the process of conducting social-ecological research and engaging with stakeholders with the goal of improving understanding of and adaptation to fire-frequent landscapes.

AB  - The aim of the paper was to analyze the 'Orti e arte' project realized by the Municipality of Catania to provide a peripheral and degraded district (Librino with over 70,000 inhabitants) with spaces devoted to urban gardens. When completed, the project will see the construction of urban gardens for 50,000 m(2). The survey was carried out in 2017; to evaluate the results of the initiative, a multidisciplinary approach has been used, which has taken into account environmental, economic, social, agronomic and biological aspects. The survey of the first 10 lots produced has highlighted the coexistence of traditional techniques and innovative means. The crop scenario is characterized by high biodiversity and dominated by specialty crops and landraces. In relation to the degraded area where the urban gardens are located, they could represent the hope of having safe spaces, landscape improvement, and a different form of social inclusion. The most important benefits in the social aspect are the maintenance of public spaces at no cost, the social inclusion, the economics of saving food and the short chain while under the environmental aspect the protection of biodiversity and the health safety become important.

AB  - Recently, some studies have shown that human movement patterns are strongly associated with regional socioeconomic indicators such as per capita income and poverty rate. These studies, however, are limited in numbers and they have not reached a consensus on what indicators or how effectively they can possibly be used to reflect the socioeconomic characteristics of the underlying populations. In this study, we propose an analytical framework - by coupling large scale mobile phone and urban socioeconomic datasets - to better understand human mobility patterns and their relationships with travelers' socioeconomic status (SES). Six mobility indicators, which include radius of gyration, number of activity locations, activity entropy, travel diversity, k-radius of gyration, and unicity, are derived to quantify important aspects of mobile phone users' mobility characteristics. A data fusion approach is proposed to approximate, at an aggregate level, the SES of mobile phone users. Using Singapore and Boston as case studies, we compare the statistical properties of the six mobility indicators in the two cities and analyze how they vary across socioeconomic classes. The results provide a multifaceted view of the relationships between mobility and SES. Specifically, it is found that phone user groups that are generally richer tend to travel shorter in Singapore but longer in Boston. One of the potential reasons, as suggested by our analysis, is that the rich neighborhoods in the two cities are respectively central and peripheral. For three other mobility indicators that reflect the diversity of individual travel and activity patterns (i.e., number of activity locations, activity entropy, and travel diversity), we find that for both cities, phone users across different socioeconomic classes exhibit very similar characteristics. This indicates that wealth level, at least in Singapore and Boston, is not a factor that restricts how people travel around in the city. In sum, our comparative analysis suggests that the relationship between mobility and SES could vary among cities, and such relationship is influenced by the spatial arrangement of housing, employment opportunities, and human activities.

AB  - Macrofauna are important contributors to estuarine ecosystem services within and outside of seagrass beds. Here we documented the natural recolonisation of a temperate seagrass (Zostera muelleri) community over 15 years in an urban estuary (Waitemata Harbour, North Island, New Zealand). We also investigated the change in macrofaunal communities in relation to seagrass cover over time, from transition from bare sandflat to seagrass. Colonisation by seagrass was associated with an increase in macrofaunal species diversity (from an average of 32 species per core in 2001 to 46 species per core in 2015) and abundance (from 482 to 2273 individuals per core), as well as an increase in sediment mud (from 4.09% to 12.37%) and organic matter content (from 0.90% to 1.41%). The most abundant species within both seagrass and adjacent unvegetated sandflat were similar, the polychaetes Heteromastus filiformis, Aricidea sp., and Prionospio aucklandica, and the amphipod Paracalliope novizealandiae. The difference in macrofaunal community structure between seagrass and unvegetated sandflat was primarily associated with higher abundance of P. novizealandiae and lower abundance of Pseudopolydora sp. in seagrass. A successional effect was observed in macrofaunal communities over the 15 years following seagrass expansion, primarily associated with an increase in the abundance of Aricidea sp., H. filiformis, and P. novizealandiae, and a reduction in the abundance of the bivalve Linucula hartvigiana. This study is the first to document long-term changes in seagrass and their associated communities during a natural recolonisation event, providing insight into timeframes required both for the regrowth of a seagrass meadow from initial colonisation of individual patches, as well as the trajectories and timeframes of change from a sandflat to a seagrass-associated macrofaunal community. This research enhances our understanding of how changes in seagrass distributions due to seagrass loss or restoration may affect macrofaunal community composition and ultimately ecosystem function.

AB  - Habitat loss and degradation linked to urbanization threaten amphibian populations globally, yet studies examining amphibian behaviour and habitat use in cities are rare. Through the use of radiotelemetry, we examined the postbreeding (May-October) movement behaviour and habitat use of adult Wood Frogs (Lithohates sylvaticus (LeConte, 1825)) at natural and constructed urban wetlands in Edmonton, Alberta, located in the semiarid, aspen parkland of Canada. Movement from breeding wetlands was limited, with most tracked individuals remaining within 25 m of ponds in grassy riparian areas. Long-distance migratory movements were rare and only occurred at natural sites with relatively high proportions of forested land surrounding wetlands. In general, tracked frogs showed a preference for habitat close to water that provided shelter from desiccation and predation (e.g., unmowed grass and stands of shrubs). Our findings have implications for the management of wetlands and conservation of amphibian populations in urban environments.

AB  - Urbanization directly affects the ecological status of streams and rivers: Their beds and drainage basins are often heavily transformed and their habitat conditions disturbed. The aim of the study was to evaluate the extent of human impact in streams in the city of Lodz, Central Poland (similar to 700,000 inhabitants), by pattern recognition analysis of benthic diatom assemblage samples using a Kohonen artificial neural network, principal component analysis, and indicator species analysis. The study also determined the ecological status of the streams using five diatom indices: Multimetric Diatom Index, Specific Pollution Sensitivity Index, Generic Diatom Index, Biological Diatom Index, and Trophic Diatom Index. The samples demonstrated considerable variation in ecological status. Examples of poor and bad ecological status were observed, clearly resulting from strong human pressure; however, good status and moderate status were also recorded, both at natural sites and, unexpectedly, those which were severely transformed, whose beds were covered with concrete and which were located downstream from combined sewer overflows. Such sites demonstrated high water conductivity of up to 1440 mu S/cm, but this was accompanied by other more favorable conditions: The water flowed from upstream stretches enclosed in downtown underground canals with a fast current, low water temperature, and high average concentration of dissolved oxygen (approximately 10 mg/dm(3)). These conditions had a mitigating effect, shaping the diatom assemblages to a specific form with the highest species richness and the highest number of indicator taxa observed in the study. In summary, the hydromorphological transformation of streambeds may result in seemingly good ecological status at heavily degraded sites. Therefore, conclusions based on diatom-based biomonitoring of urban streams and rivers should be drawn with caution.

AB  - Currently, the increasing frequency of inhalant allergy is often linked to the urbanization effect. The pollen forecasts for a given city are most often prepared using data from one aerobiological station. However, there is evidence that the pollen concentrations in the air might differ depending on the city area and the height of the pollen trap. This study evaluated the spatial differences in the daily concentrations of alder and birch pollen grains in an urban area in relation to the proximity of the pollen sources and meteorological parameters. Pollen grains were sampled in Rzeszow in 2014-2016 by three volumetric traps located at the roof and nose levels in two city areas that differed in the numbers of alder and birch trees. The daily pollen concentrations were categorized into three allergy symptom thresholds. The relationship between the daily pollen concentrations and meteorological variables was examined using a redundancy analysis and circular statistics. There were spatial differences in the pollen season intensity and, to a lesser extent, the variability in its course. Generally, higher concentrations were registered at the roof level and in the city suburbs than at the nose level and in the downtown area where alder and birch trees were less numerous. Despite the spatial variability of the pollen concentrations and the differences in the proximity and abundance of pollen sources, the risks for allergy sufferers were similar throughout the city. It was concluded that the main cause of this phenomenon is the high dispersal abilities of Alnus and Betula pollen grains. Although temperature seems to be a crucial factor that influences the airborne pollen of both taxa, several weather variables were found to have complex impacts on the daily concentrations.

AB  - Suitability evaluation of urban construction land is critical for both urban master planning and the proper utilization of land resources. Using the Beihu New District of Jining City, China, as a case study, this paper introduces a novel research approach for comprehensive suitability evaluation based on vertical-horizontal processes. First, by considering both the land development potential and ecological constraint resistance, the potential-resistance (PR) model was developed and used to analyze the suitability for urban construction of vertical processes. Then, given the results of the vertical suitability analysis, the current urban built-up areas were selected as the sources of urban expansion, and the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model was applied to evaluate the suitability for urban development in terms of horizontal processes. The study area was regionalized into four categoriespriority, suitable, restricted, and prohibited areas-which were defined based on the development threshold. The results showed that restricted and prohibited areas for urban construction occupied most of the study area. Totally, 648.51 km(2) was categorized as restricted or prohibited, accounting for 12.89% and 54.75% of the total area, respectively. Priority and suitable areas for urban construction covered a total area of 310.37 km(2), accounting for 16.55% and 15.81% of the total area, respectively. These areas were mainly distributed around urban centers and urban built-up areas. These findings reflect the substantial potential for future urban development and construction in the study area. The newly developed principles and methods of suitability evaluation for urban construction land presented in this paper provide more appropriate scales and spatial location for urban development and an ecological baseline for future urban growth.

AB  - When a disastrous event occurs and an urban area suffers from collapsed buildings, Urban Search and Rescue (USaR) teams require a fast and thorough building damage assessment, to focus their rescue efforts accordingly. After the evaluation process, their observations/results have to be transferred to their base (center of operation-COP) for further assessment and orchestration of the survival extraction actions. In this work, a communication scheme that can be used in emergency situations is introduced. The proposed solution doesn't depend on existing functional cellular networks such as GSM, 3G, 4G, etc., neither assumes Wi-Fi connectivity to the Internet, since in disaster scenarios they could be unavailable or they could have large interruptions and delays. On the contrary, we propose a low-cost solution that is easy to build and deploy and is modular to expand from a small area to a large part of an urban setup, based on the needs of the USaR activities. Particularly, a wireless mesh-network is designed to cover the needs of the first responders in the actual disaster area, whereas a long-range wireless network is designed to transfer the data securely back and forth to the center of operation.

AB  - Urbanization is associated with shifts in human lifestyles, thus possibly influencing the diversity, interaction and assembly of gut microbiota. However, the question regarding how human gut microbiota adapts to varying lifestyles remains elusive. To understand the relationship between gut microbiota and urbanization, we compared the diversity, interaction and assembly of gut microbial communities of herdsmen from three regions with different levels of urbanization, namely traditional herdsmen (TH), semi-urban herdsmen (SUH) and urban herdsmen (UH). The relative abundance of Prevotella decreased with the degree of urbanization (from TH to UH), whereas that of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Blautia showed an opposite trend. Although the alpha diversity measures (observed OTUs and phylogenetic diversity) of gut microbiota were unaffected by urbanization, the beta diversity (Jaccard or Bray-Curtis distances) was significantly influenced by urbanization. Metagenome prediction revealed that the gene functions associated with metabolism (i.e., carbohydrate and lipid metabolism) had significant differences between TH and UH. Network analysis showed that the modularity increased with the degree of urbanization, indicating a high extent of niche differentiation in UH. Meanwhile the trend of network density was opposite, indicating a more complex network in TH. Notably, the relative importance of environmental filtering that governed the community assembly increased with the degree of urbanization, which indicated that deterministic factors (e.g , low-fiber diet) play more important roles than stochastic factors (e.g., stochastic dispersal) in shaping the gut microbiota. A quantification of ecological processes showed a stronger signal of variable selection in UH than TH, implying that different selective pressures cause divergent gut community compositions due to urban lifestyles. Our results suggest that beta diversity, network interactions and ecological processes of gut microbiota may reflect the degree of urbanization, and highlight the adaptation of human gut microbiota to lifestyle changes.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to analyze the spatio-temporal changes in land cover and land use (1984-2010), as well to simulate future land cover for 2030 in the Neka River Basin (NRB), including the Hyrcanian forest, in northern Iran. For this purpose, we used detailed land cover maps for the years 1984, 2001 and 2010. The results showed that the highest deforestation occurred in the boundaries between forest and agriculture areas between 1984 and 2010. Comparing the observed and predicted land cover in 2010 yielded agreement of 96.41%. From 1984 to 2010, landscape metrics showed that the forest area evolved to more fragmentation, with less shape complexity and less connectivity. Projections for the future are consistent with observed changes for the Neka landscape, with a tendency to continue disaggregating and increasing diversity in a number of different patch types. Between 2010 and 2030, we observed the arrival of new crops, rangelands, and urban areas within the remaining areas of homogeneous forest. Changes in the Hyrcanian forest will cause alteration in ecosystem services, such as erosion control, water yield, timber harvest, and ground water reservation. Results of this work may represent a useful tool to provide strategies and territorial planning for sustainable management of the fragile Hyrcanian forest ecosystems in the Neka Basin.

AB  - For those who are interested in radical changes, it is important to analyze the forms of resistance that promote self-managed practices, also at apparently very small scale. In Italy the experience of community gardens is usually named orti urbani. In the last 10years, the occupation of abandoned urban spaces to set up orti urbani has increased within the squatting movement. The case of the city of Rome is interesting because there has been a widespread activity to organize self-managed spaces to grow fruit and vegetable plants. These initiatives make up not only potential spaces of dense social networking, political action and discussion on environmental issues, but also supporting large food autonomous configurations such as Genuino Clandestino, that are challenging dominant food production. A proliferation of orti urbani located in Social Centers, squatted houses or other abandoned spaces represents a scalar strategy to re-appropriate and commune urban space.

AB  - Watersheds in urban areas are often heavily degraded due to human activity, which can have negative impacts on freshwater fishes. Monitoring the genetic characteristics of urban populations can provide insights into the impact of development on aquatic ecosystems. We performed a genetic analysis of coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) inhabiting urban tributaries in Portland, OR. By analyzing nuclear microsatellite genotypes, we were able to assess population structure, genetic diversity, and effective population size for six locations across two tributaries on opposite sides of the Willamette River. Genetic diversity was generally equivalent across all sampling locations, although populations from smaller tributaries higher in the stream network had lower levels. Levels of effective population size were low but within expected ranges for small salmonid populations. As anticipated, smaller populations had higher levels of inter-individual relatedness. The primary genetic structure divided populations on opposite sides of the Willamette River, although there was evidence of dispersal between the two groups. Our results suggest that cutthroat trout inhabiting metropolitan areas are not necessarily genetically impoverished and may exhibit characteristics typical of populations in more 'natural' environments. Understanding how fish, especially anadromous species, respond to urban environments is essential to evaluating the value of these areas for conservation planning.

AB  - Universities are dealing with strategies in order to improve their performances in terms of ranking classification, struggling for a good position. At the spatial planning and urban design domains the river fronts are very challenging territories to deal with, because they are sensitive areas, not only in environmental terms but also considering the requirements of the urban continuity. Urban projects for the places of contact in between the urban fabric and rivers are mainly focused on building issues and urban development questions, rather than of ecological approaches encouraging the contact of inhabitants with nature. Therefore, this research presents solutions of rethinking the territories of contact in between the urban fabric and the river water fronts, having as pivotal concern the ecological solutions. These urban projects are focused on the requalification solutions in order to ensure a better urban continuity from the buildings to the water front. The strategy is driven by the river activities, nautical sports, low density buildings, preservation of local heritage and paths for pedestrians.
   The case study is a quiet town in the central region of Portugal, well known by its thermal baths, which are coming from the roman times. Every year, the city of Sao Pedro do Sul is visited by many tourists, looking for a very pleasant place, allowing them to improve their health condition going to the thermal baths, or the contact with nature going to the Vouga river water front. This is a city plenty of greenery, high natural potential, no pollution, and where the majority of dwellings are single houses. The main architectural landmark of the case study area is the old train station, a building from the 19th century. In fact, since a long time ago, there are no more trains arriving to this city. Recently, the train track line was converted into an ecological corridor for pedestrians and bicycles. Besides of this effort, the place remains waiting for an urban rehabilitation opportunity as a whole, with several urban voids, buildings in bad status of conservation, car parking with no planning or a lack of functional diversity. Its huge potential regarding the presence of the river water front is, consequently, not preserved nor enhanced. In this sense, there was an international research, on behalf of the Urban Planning Unit at the Master Degree in Architecture at the University of Beira Interior, resulting from an agreement with the Municipality of Sao Pedro do Sul. The urban project solutions were proposed in this academic environment comprising several teams of international students, not only coming from Portugal, but also from Greece, Brazil, Slovakia, Lithuania and Poland. There was a competition and monetary prizes to the best urban projects, sponsored by the city hall. This was a motivation for students along to the project process. The conclusions show that all the solutions are proposing strategies to preserve and to enhance the ecological identity of the place. Thus, this article will present the contents, options and solutions of the second best urban project, which was designed by a team of international students from Poland. This experience is an example of a key strategy in the internationalization process of the university.

AB  - The conflict between humans and wild animals is a special type of phenomena between human development and wild animal conservation, not only leading to massive economic loss to local residents, but also imposing severe impacts upon the production and living activities and even personal safety of the residents. Human-elephant conflict has existed as a phenomenon of human settlement development for more than 20 years in Xishuangbanna, China. There are periodic incidents of wild elephants hurting/killing people as well as feeding on and destroying subsistence and cash crops. It is an increasingly urgent and important issue for China to resolve while protecting and managing Asian elephants. Our study employed an Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis model to perform a risk assessment of areas where the Asian elephant currently is distributed and to predict future risks. It employed a Circuit Theory model based on random walk theory to predict multiple potential movement or migration pathways of Asian elephants within Xishuangbanna. The results indicated that: (1) the regions with human-elephant conflict risk in Xishuangbanna Prefecture had an area of about 4349.08 km(2), accounting for 22.77% of the total prefecture area, with the risk regions primarily present in the middle and north parts of Menghai County and Jinghong City and in Mengla County in which there was a wide geographical distribution covering from the south to the north; (2) The regions of agriculture and garden that were close to Asian elephant distribution and roads were likely occurring risk; (3) There were more potential movement paths of elephants within Mengyang and Menghai distribution regions, which indicated that the connection of these areas was better. While the potential movement paths of elephants within Mengla and Shangyong were little; (4) There were some potential movement paths between different distribution areas of Asian elephant, but the migration possibility of elephants in different distribution areas was decreasing due to natural barriers (Mengyang-Menghai has Lancang river) and discontinuous potential paths between Mengla and Shangyong. Additionally, we discussed that created ecological corridors between different natural reserves to allow more dispersal and gene flow of elephants and diminish conflict between human and elephant. We also put forward compensation suggestions in different risk area. We hope our analytical methods can be applied, improved and expanded to other areas with similar wildlife damage.

AB  - The article takes into consideration the spatialised action of self-managed Social Centres in Northern Italy over the last 20years. Considering Genoa, Turin and Milan, we outline the passage from the Fordist era to the post-industrial cities reconversion, which gave the spaceboth physical and politicalfor the emergence of Social Centres. The changes that occurred in the three cities in the following years introduced new features in urban space configuration and organisation. In this frame, we focus on three case studies that serve the purpose of illustrating the role of Social Centres contesting unfair space transformations: Genoa's Expo Colombiane in 1992, Turin's Winter Olympic Games in 2006 and Milan's Expo in 2015. The opposition to these mega-events allows us to analyse the changes related to the forms of conflict put into practice by urban social movements throughout time, and the learning process they underwent.

AB  - Since the 1980s, cultural policy has been progressively understood as a tool for the urban and socio-economic transformation of cities. In this sense, an increasing attention has been addressed at explaining how public action in the cultural sphere has changed according to the objectives and discourses that legitimize it. However, less attention has been paid to understanding the elements that explain its continuity and persistence, inertias and resistances to change of this public polity. Likewise, in the last decade, the growing criticism of the creative city paradigm and its negative effects has led to develop an alternative proposal of cultural policy within the framework of the so-called "new politics" inherited from the 15M movement. This perspective tries to encourage new ways of understanding culture in the local domain, which has been described as pro-common. This article seeks to give an answer to the question about the extent to which there has been a change or, instead, continuity in the development local cultural policies in two relevant cases where this phenomenon has occurred, Madrid and Barcelona between 2015 and 2018. Moreover, it analyzes the structural reasons for the relative continuity in forms and results of the cultural policy despite a discursive change regarding its objectives.

AB  - Arid regions around the world comprise approximately 41 percent of the global surface area. These drylands are inhabited by 1/3 of the global population, are home to several mega-cities and nurture a multimillion dollar economy annually. However, continuous population growth and changing precipitation patterns created the phenomenon of water scarcity. To stabilize the local economy and facilitate population growth projections, governments around the world extend their water-energy-network to access foreign watersheds. As part of a comparative design research project under the Harvard based Charles Eliot Fellowship, this article addresses the global issues of water scarcity. It studies the effects of drought in arid regions, documents territorial water systems and outlines the socio-economic and socio-ecological effects of megaprojects. By revealing these processes, the article discusses the current water discourse from the perspective of landscape architecture and endorses a paradigm of abundance. To illustrate this complex social and economic proposition, a survey of international case studies provides the understanding of the territorial gap and demonstrates decentralized action on a local scale. Ultimately, to challenge water scarcity, a plurality of interventions at multiple scales are inevitable. The key for interdisciplinary planning and design lays in the hybridity of systems, which are framed by a landscape-based approach.

AB  - Accurate information on, and human interpretation of, urban land cover using satellite-derived sensor imagery is critical given the intricate nature and niches of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors occurring at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Foresta non-parametric ensemble classifier-has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km(2) in 1972 to 378 km(2) in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

AB  - Social cohesion is a pertinent issue especially in China where the restructuring of the urban landscape has influenced the social make-up of urban communities. This study investigated neighborly interaction as a form of social cohesion in Songjiang New Town, Shanghai, and used the negative binomial regression to analyze which factors influence neighborly interaction. The results confirmed previous literature regarding a number of individual determinants but more importantly revealed that while hukou was significant in establishing weak social ties, it was not influential in maintaining strong social relations. Nevertheless, the study argued that the institutional limitations arising from hukou status might be an imposed condition of low social contact among non-Shanghai hukou holders. Furthermore, the study revealed that relocation and commodity mixed developments were a factor of low social cohesion, contending for improved planning and design measures which mitigate for the dislocation experienced by relocates.

AB  - Background: Numerous studies have thus far characterized the temporal dynamics of the skin microbiota of healthy individuals. However, there is no information regarding the dynamics of different microbial association network properties. Also, there is little understanding of how living conditions, specifically cohabitation and household occupancy, may be associated with the nature and extent (or degree) of cutaneous microbiota change within individuals over time. In this study, the dynamics of the skin microbiota, and its association networks, on the skin of urban residents over four seasons were characterized.
   Results: Similar to western cohorts, the individuals of this cohort show different extents of variations in relative abundance of common skin colonizers, concomitant with individual-and household-associated changes in differential abundances of bacterial taxa. Interestingly, the individualized nature of the skin microbiota extends to various aspects of microbial association networks, including co-occurring and excluding taxa, as well as overall network structural properties. Household occupancy is correlated with the extent of variations in relative abundance of Propionibacterium, Acinetobacter, and Bacillus over multiple skin sites. In addition, household occupancy is also associated with the extent of temporal changes in microbial diversity and composition within a resident's skin.
   Conclusions: This is the first study investigating the potential roles household occupancy has on the extent of change in one's cutaneous microbiota and its association network structures. In particular, we show that relationships between the skin microbiota of a resident, his/her cohabitants, and those of non-cohabitants over time are highly personal and are possibly governed by living conditions and nature of interactions between cohabitants within households over 1 year. This study calls for increased awareness to personal and lifestyle factors that may govern relationships between the skin microbiota of one individual and those of cohabitants, and changes in the microbial association network structures within a person over time. The current study will act as a baseline for future assessments in comparing against temporal dynamics of microbiota from individuals with different skin conditions and for identifying residential factors that are beneficial in promoting the dynamics of the skin microbiota associated with health.

AB  - Free-roaming dogs (FRDs) pose a significant health threat to humans, other animals and the environment. Yet, the effects of their movements and habitat use within cities and adjacent rural areas are poorly known, especially in relation to predation and the transmission of diseases that can impact human health (i.e., cystic echinococcosis and rabies). We explored the temporal and spatial distribution of owned FRDs for a remote Patagonian city surrounded by a grasslands rural ecosystem by superimposing GPS coordinates of tracked dogs on satellite images (Google map). Using logistic regressions, we evaluated the potential effect of age, body condition score (BCS) and distance from their initial recorded GPS fix (at or near the owner's home) to the rural boundary (RD) as predictors of home range (HR) and maximum distance (MD) travelled from home. Our study revealed that owned FRDs in Puerto Natales, Chile have a high site fidelity to the urban environment and especially their owners home, seldom venturing into rural areas. We observed that even FRDs living in close proximity to the city boundary spent most of their time within the urban environment. On average, FRDs had a HR of 0.65 km(2) (65 ha) and travelled a MD of 1.05 km. There were two individuals that travelled significantly further, and hence occupied a larger HR than the rest. Additionally, our results indicated that BCS was a predictor of HR, while age and RD were predictors of MD. These findings add to the range of predictors known to affect roaming dog HR size and used across different studies, suggesting that site-specific factors are likely affecting dog behavioral ecology. The study findings provide useful and original data on the movement ecology and site fidelity of owned FRDs in a remote city in Patagonia. We recommend that to make meaningful and cost-effective management decisions regarding owned FRDs in urban areas, future studies should also include the collection of sociocultural information on the interactions between of dogs and people.

AB  - The evolution of structure in biology is driven by accretion and diversification. Accretion brings together disparate parts to form bigger wholes. Divers cation provides opportunities for growth and innovation. Here, we review patterns and processes that are responsible for a 'double tale' of accretion and diversification at various levels of complexity, from proteins and nucleic acids to high-rise building structures in cities. Parts are at first weakly linked and associate variously. As they diversity, they compete with each other and are selected for performance. The emerging interactions constrain their structure and associations. This causes parts to self-organise into modules with tight linkage. In a second phase, variants of the modules evolve and become new parts for a new generative cycle of higher-level organisation. Evolutionary genomics and network biology support the 'double tale' of structural module creation and validate an evolutionary principle of maximum abundance that drives the gain and loss of modules.

AB  - Mt. Hakodate, Hokkaido, is a small mountain geographically isolated by the sea and urban area, and some red foxes (Lidpes wipes) live there. In consideration of the specific geographical environment, we made a hypothesis that the fox population on Mt. Hakodate is small in size and isolated, and consequently its genetic variation is low, and then tested it. To investigate the genetic variation, we genotyped microsatellite loci using fecal samples collected noninvasively from 2009 to 2011. As the result, we successfully identified 35 foxes for the three years (12 in 2009, 11 in 2010, and 22 in 2011), and presumed eight of them were adults, indicating that the population size is extremely small. The genetic structures and degree of differentiations showed that the Mt. Hakodate population was genetically differentiated from those of the other populations. The urban area of Hakodate City could have played a role of a dispersal barrier for foxes. Additionally, the genetic diversity of the Mt. Hakodate population was lower than those of the other populations in Hokkaido. Our results suggested that the Mt. Hakodate population have low genetic diversity due to restricted gene flow and the small population size, supporting our hypothesis.

CP  - IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) / Workshop on Integrating UAVs into 5G
AB  - The landscape of the contemporary IoT radio access technologies (RATs) is excessively diverse, especially when it comes to such a complex environment as Smart City. On the one hand, this diversity offers operators sufficient flexibility to select the most appropriate RAT for their target application. On the other hand, it becomes a severe limiting factor leading to high level of uncertainty for the IoT device vendors, who need to decide, which technology to support in their hardware. In this paper, we consider the provisioning of the low-power wide area network (LPWAN) devices supporting multiple RATs. First, we briefly discuss the parameters of several potential radio technologies as well as analyze the pros and cons of combining them in a single device. Next, we prototype a real-life device capable of communicating via two perspective LPWAN technologies, namely, LoRaWAN and NB-IoT, and report on the initial results of its performance evaluation. These confirm the feasibility of instrumenting dual-mode devices as well as reveal several important aspects related to the development of multi-radio IoT equipment and its performance. In our view, due to their higher flexibility, reliability, and dependability, the devices such as the one developed can be beneficial for various Smart City applications, with smart energy grids and road traffic control being only two of many examples.

AB  - The world is becoming increasingly urbanized, with more than half of the global population now living in cities. Understanding the factors impacting natural communities in fragmented landscapes is therefore crucial for predicting how the remaining ecosystems will respond to global change. Ground-active arthropods, which are important in nutrient cycling, are likely sensitive to habitat changes resulting from urbanization.
   We addressed two questions: (1) What is the relative importance of local and landscape factors in shaping ground-active arthropod communities in urban woodlands? (2) How does body size (as a surrogate for dispersal ability) affect sensitivity to landscape-level factors?
   In the summers of 2010 and 2011, we sampled ground-active arthropod communities in 19 woodlands in the Chicago metropolitan region using pitfall traps. We also assessed local plant and soil characteristics, as well as landscape-level variables using GIS.
   Redundancy analyses and variation partitioning revealed that local factors, particularly invasive woody-plant cover and soil nitrate, had the most influence on arthropod communities, explaining 12% of the total variation. Of the landscape-level variables, landscape richness, which is one measure of landscape fragmentation, explained the most variation; however, the shared variance between landscape and local variables was responsible for half (16%) of the total explained variation (32%). Landscape factors alone explained only 4% of variation. No relationship between arthropod body size and landscape variables was observed, but several groups (e.g. ants and ground beetles) were correlated with landscape-level factors.
   Our research shows that both local and landscape variables are important in influencing ground-active arthropods, but the majority of explained variance is attributed to the covariation between landscape richness, invasive woody-plant cover, and soil nitrate. We therefore conclude that landscape fragmentation is likely affecting the ground-active arthropods through its positive influence on invasive woody plants and soil nitrogen.

AB  - A strong movement in urban planning and geography literature discusses identity places problematique in the context of the comprehensiveness of urban planning. Increasing demand of different cultural identities to be visible in urban space, as well as migration, asylum and population mobility, caused "identity places" phenomenon an important issue for urban planning (Healey, 1997; Sandercock, 2000; Germain and Gagnon, 2003; Gale, 2005). The focus of the discussions on the meaning of the city's multiculturalism has shifted to the discussion on the needed means of planning by the multiculturalism, today. (Ponzini, 2014; Tasan-Kok and Ozogul, 2017). These efforts have not yet taken place in the agenda of current urban planning profession in Turkey. On the contrary, place organizations are being organized with standard techniques for standardized social activities. However, ethnic-religious clusters seeking to register their presence in the city, appear with the new concepts and demands outside the standards of the planning institutions. This situation revealed the urban facility area standards, such as cultural identity places, religious or sacred places, places of worship, have to be rethought in the spatial planning practices. This debate becomes concrete in the demand and ongoing struggle of Alevis, for the recognition of Cem-houses as places worship in Turkey. In this context, the problem of spatial representation of social and cultural identities by the planning institution in Turkey will be addressed in the context of the experience and perception of minority communities, especially Alevis.

AB  - The paper aims at exploring the relationship between commons, resistance strategies and cultural production in Catania through analysing different cases of occupation of spaces for (counter) cultural production and consumption, thus rejecting the commodification logics of the neoliberal "creative city". Resulting from fieldwork, in-depth interviews and document analysis, our research aims at evaluating the overlapping between artistic-cultural reasons and discursive practices inspired by the urban commons and participative democracy, as well as the relations with both institutional actors and the socio-economic and cultural milieu of the city.

AB  - The European Communication on Green Infrastructures encourages the use of wildflower verges, green walls, green roofs, etc. to mitigate the artificiality of the urban and rural environment. Green roofs are engineered ecosystems occupying underutilized urban spaces that rely on the plant cover to provide services, such as the reduction of temperature, retention of storm-water and enhancement of urban biodiversity. In this framework we explored the ability of some wild perennial species of arid and semi-arid grasslands to survive and colonize the substrate of the extensive green roofs of the Agricultural Sciences School of the University of Bologna. In mid-June 2015 young plants of Festuca ovina L., Thymus serpyllum L., Hieracium pilosella L., Acinos alpinus (L.) Moench, Sanguisorba minor Scop. and Achillea millefolium L., coming from wild local populations, were transplanted into containers (54x54x9 cm depth) forming the upper cover of a green roof. The plants were fertilized and then irrigated throughout the summer of 2015. The growth of the species (coverage and space occupation) was monitored approximately once a month, from August 2015 to May 2016. F. ovina reached the highest values of coverage, without any significant seasonal variations. T. serpyllum and H. pilosella reached moderate coverage values depending however on the seasons. A. millefolium showed very effective dispersal abilities, but poor coverage potential. It can be used as a filler species in multi-species green roofs. Our results showed that the wild local flora can be an important, though still poorly explored, reserve of biodiversity for a new generation of extensive green roofs, designed, following a careful selection of species, for the best possible performances of the services they provide.

AB  - Immigrant taxi drivers in metropolitan cities are exposed to experiences of discrimination and occupation-based health risks. Given the structural differences in health care systems in the United States and Canada, we investigated the differences in reports of discrimination, health conditions and concern about health conditions between taxi drivers in New York City and Toronto, Ontario. Participants were recruited for a taxi driver Needs Assessment Survey as part of a Taxi Network needs assessment project using a street side convenience sampling technique in New York City and Toronto. The matched sample contained 33 drivers from Toronto and 33 drivers from NYC. All Toronto drivers in our sample reported having health insurance while over a quarter of NYC drivers did not have health insurance. Toronto drivers reported greater everyday and workplace discrimination. Drivers in both cities experienced higher rates than average, and reported concern about, major health conditions. We also found preliminary evidence suggesting a relationship between experiencing discrimination and reporting chronic pain. Our findings suggest the need for future research to more closely examine the associations between discrimination and health among the taxi driver population.

AB  - The rapidly growing coastal population in East Africa has led to increased exploitation of shellfish and incidences of habitat degradation. This study analysed fragments (554 base pairs) of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene and eight microsatellite loci from 199 DNA extracts of giant mud crabs collected from anthropogenic-polluted mangroves of mainland Tanzania in order to describe the patterns of genetic diversity and gene flow. Correlation and regression analysis showed that the measured indices of genetic diversity and connectivity are not associated with the reported levels of trace metal pollution. Both mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA did not show significant differentiation, suggesting that gene flow is high enough to counteract the effect of pollution on genetic diversity and differentiation. Apart from that, microsatellite DNA showed that mangroves in major coastal cities and mangroves affected by salt farming activities are associated with low effective population size compared to mangroves in protected areas. Since the human coastal population is expanding rapidly, measures should be taken to strengthen the existing marine parks and reserves and to promote sustainable use of coastal resources.

AB  - Despite severely depressed property markets, housing in declining U.S. cities can be surprisingly unaffordable for poor residents. Yet the characteristics of decline, such as abundant vacant property and constrained economic/political conditions, also provide opportunity for squatting. This article explores survival squattingillegal occupation of property as a means for procuring suitable housing by marginalized residents. Drawing on a 4.5-year ethnography in Detroit, I examine the mechanisms by which people strategically choose squatting as a method of sheltering in the context of local conditions, and the experiences and conditions of this practice. I situate these empirical findings within a broader discussion comparing squatting and other forms of housing that have received considerable attention by researchers (e.g., shelter use, sleeping rough, doubling up). Squatting is particularly risky and unstable, and often very hidden. Substandard housing conditions prevail, and substance abuse is common. Squatting may have negative implications for child welfare, but may also provide measures of independence, self-determination, and comfort for illegal occupiers. There is a critical need for further research in this area, both to inform comprehensive housing policies and to anticipate how squatters' well-being is impacted by other urban initiatives, such as blight demolition.

AB  - The central variables in any urban model are distance and attraction (Wilson 2000). Space Syntax research has contributed to the development of new geometric descriptions and measures of distance that have proven successful when it comes to capturing pedestrian movement. However, the description and measurement of attractions has not been central to the field. An important exception is the development of Place Syntax analysis, which concerns new methodologies and software that opens for analysis not only of different kinds of accessibilities in the street network in itself but also analysis of the accessibility within the network to different forms of attractions, for instance, residents or retail (Stahle et al 2005). Place Syntax analysis is a generic form of analysis, why we may choose to analyse the accessibility to particular socio-economic attractions, but we may also conceive of a model of 'pure 'spatial form - a kind of architectural model of the city. For instance, Place Syntax analysis has been applied in different kinds of density analysis, transforming density measures from area-based measures to location-based measures (Stahle et al 2005). In this paper, we extend such spatial attraction to not only include the variable of density but also diversity and present results from an extensive empirical study including four European cities, paving the way towards a more complete architectural model of the city including both the analysis of distance and attractions.

AB  - Widespread shallow coral reef loss has led to calls for more holistic approaches to coral reef management, requiring inclusion of ecosystems interacting with shallow coral reefs in management plans. Yet, almost all current reef management is biased towards shallow reefs, and overlooks that coral reefs extend beyond shallow waters to mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; 30-150 m). We present the first detailed quantitative characterization of MCEs off Cozumel, Mexico, on the northern Mesoamerican Reef in the Mexican Caribbean, and provide insights into their general state. We documented MCE biodiversity, and assessed whether MCEs adjacent to a major town and port, where coastal development has caused shallow reef damage, have similar benthic and fish communities to MCEs within a National Park. Our results show that overall MCE communities are similar regardless of protection, though some taxa-specific differences exist in benthic communities between sites within the MPA and areas outside. Regardless of protection and location, and in contrast to shallow reefs, all observed Cozumel MCEs were continuous reefs with the main structural habitat complexity provided by calcareous macroalgae, sponges, gorgonians and black corals. Hard corals were present on MCEs, although at low abundance. We found that 42.5% of fish species recorded on Cozumel could be found on both shallow reefs and MCEs, including 39.6% of commercially valuable fish species. These results suggest that MCEs could play an important role in supporting fish populations. However, regardless of protection and depth, we found few large-body. fishes (greater than 500 mm), which were nearly absent at all studied sites. Cozumel MCEs contain diverse benthic and fish assemblages, including commercially valuable fisheries species and ecosystem engineers, such as black corals. Because of their inherent biodiversity and identified threats, MCEs should be incorporated into shallow-reef-focused Cozumel National Park management plan.

AB  - Influential research on the negative effects of living in a disadvantaged neighborhood assumes that its residents are socially isolated from nonpoor or "mainstream" neighborhoods, but the extent and nature of such isolation remain in question. We develop a test of neighborhood isolation that improves on static measures derived from commonly used census reports by leveraging fine-grained dynamic data on the everyday movement of residents in America's 50 largest. cities. We analyze 650 million geocoded Twitter messages to estimate the home locations and travel patterns of almost 400,000 residents over 18 mo. We find surprisingly high consistency across neighborhoods of different race and income characteristics in the average travel distance (radius) and number of neighborhoods traveled to (spread) in the metropolitan region; however, we uncover notable differences in the composition of the neighborhoods visited. Residents of primarily black and Hispanic neighborhoods-whether poor or not-are far less exposed to either nonpoor or white middle-class neighborhoods than residents of primarily white neighborhoods. These large racial differences are notable given recent declines in segregation and the increasing diversity of American cities. We also find that white poor neighborhoods are substantially isolated from nonpoor white neighborhoods. The results suggest that even though residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods travel far and wide, their relative isolation and segregation persist.

AB  - BackgroundThe transmission dynamics of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in tropical countries remain unclear. Further understanding of the genetic diversity of the virus could aid in HMPV vaccine design and improve our understanding of respiratory virus transmission dynamics in low- and middle-income countries.
   Materials & MethodsWe examined the evolution of HMPV in Peru through phylogenetic analysis of 61 full genome HMPV sequences collected in three ecologically diverse regions of Peru (Lima, Piura, and Iquitos) during 2008-2012, comprising the largest data set of HMPV whole genomes sequenced from any tropical country to date.
   ResultsWe revealed extensive genetic diversity generated by frequent viral introductions, with little evidence of local persistence. While considerable viral traffic between non-Peruvian countries and Peru was observed, HMPV epidemics in Peruvian locales were more frequently epidemiologically linked with other sites within Peru. We showed that Iquitos experienced greater HMPV traffic than the similar sized city of Piura by both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods.
   ConclusionsThere is extensive HMPV genetic diversity even within smaller and relatively less connected cities of Peru and this virus is spatially fluid. Greater diversity of HMPV in Iquitos compared to Piura may relate to higher volumes of human movement, including air traffic to this location.

AB  - Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) populations in south-east Queensland are in decline. Although various studies have looked at broad-scale tree preference and habitat quality, there has been little attempt to quantify fine-scale activity shifts from one year to the next or examination of activity at the mesoscale. This study quantified koala activity levels in a 909-ha forest patch at Karawatha Forest Park, in south Brisbane. The Spot Assessment Technique was used to quantify activity and tree selection on 33 long-term monitoring plots in 2009 and 2010. In total, 843 trees were searched and koala pellets were found underneath 34 and 47 trees in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A higher proportion of pellets was found underneath Eucalyptus tindaliae and E. fibrosa and there was weak selection for larger trees. A low occurrence of revisits and a minor shift in activity distribution from 2009 to 2010 indicate that the koala population exists at a low density. Rapid declines in koala populations are occurring in primary habitats. Hence, stable low-density koala populations are important for maintaining genetic diversity and connectivity in fragmented urban landscapes.

AB  - Hong Kong is exemplary of predatory capitalism. Not only are most of the newly created public spaces being corporatized by the oligarchic land powers in the process of urban growth or gentrification, but the state is also obsessive about sterilizing the city in the attempt to craft Hong Kong into 'Asia's World City'. FM Theatre Power (FMTP), the largest alternate independent theatre group in the city since its establishment in 2001, has incorporated a deep-seated mission of challenging the state hegemony over public space management-particularly the restrictions concerning citizens' freedom of performance in public spaces. Equipped with the craft of public art-impromptu art that involves the audience, performances in public space, and insurgent art that reflects political issues-FMTP began to illegally occupy part of the pedestrian zone in Mong Kok for regular performances. Rounds of verbal warnings, arrests, and prosecution have not deterred their determination; instead, they have expanded their 'sphere of influence' to other tourist areas with flash mob performances. Such actions have successfully attracted copycats that have quickly filled the Mong Kok pedestrian zone with street performers. This has indirectly led the local council to relax restrictions on street performances, and such acts have even been embraced. In this chapter, I investigate the progression of the struggle of FMTP in the creation of alternative urban space by exploring how this public art movement endeavoured to integrate the excluded, linking insurgent art with the lives of ordinary people, cultivating their capabilities in the creative expression of ideas, and scaling up the social resistance that led to policy and finally success reclaiming the lost public space. Yet the contradictions generated by the movement, both within the community and with mainstream society, led to the movement's eventual demise.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from urban office buildings energy usages (BEC) constitute a substantial component of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission, and are set to rapidly increase with further urbanization. Establishing a concise, accurate, and realistic model that can predict future emissions is challenging but essential for strategies to develop low carbon construction and sustainable development in urban areas. In this paper, the operational energy use for 294 office buildings across China was collected and analyzed. We focus on four main variables, and analyze a further ten second-level variables, to elucidate the role that a building's occupants, its structural characteristics, and localized natural conditions play in determining energy consumption. Using general regression neural network (GRNN), the factors' direct and indirect effects on energy consumption were tested. A building's structural attributes had the most impact on energy-related CO2 emissions, followed by the relevant socioeconomic conditions, the micro-climate, and finally the regional climate. A version of the model that was constructed with interaction between the four main variables was found to be the most precise. GRNN combined with urban development scenarios was used for the prediction of cities' future CO2 emissions. Economic development and improving standards in the construction industry could have significant impacts on future CO2 emissions. This study provides a detailed method that could be used to explore the dynamics of office energy use and competing options for the construction of low-carbon office buildings.

AB  - The geographic enchainment of this article has as scale of analysis the Caldas river watershed, located in the tourist town of Caldas Novas, Goias, Brazil. The main objective is to present the current conditions of water used in the watering places of the lodging facilities and the capacity of the domestic sewage collection service in the public sanitation network, the green areas occupied with residences and districts adjacent to the Caldas river watershed. The development of this research meets the method and techniques of qualitative and quantitative research, which emphasize the participation of researchers in the investigated context. Among the main results obtained, only 59% of the lodging facilities have a Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and 41% do not comply with the existing legislation. The article also shows that 57% of the districts are not served by a sewage system, a contemporary urban model based on growth at any cost, devastating nature and aggravating the life and environmental quality of the city. In this context, the research asserts a total lack of preoccupation for the environment, both by public authorities and hotel managers.

AB  - This article builds on the geographic literature of nonviolence with the feminist literature of care ethics and positive security to explore the potential for a praxis that promotes relational urban social justice. We examine two cities-Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Orumiyeh, Iran-that have historically endured political struggles that continue to undermine the quality of urban life. We analyze vulnerability to political, environmental, and infrastructural violence in these two urban landscapes with an eye toward "just praxis" and "positive security," as we outline the ways in which Belfast and Orumiyeh are reinjured by institutional practices that purportedly seek urban social justice. First, we argue for the importance of care praxis in the light of the entanglement of a murder investigation with the Boston College oral history program "The Belfast Project," which recorded testimony from former and current members of paramilitary groups. Second, we examine an environmental justice movement in Orumiyeh, where activists navigate a contested political terrain shaped by state violence toward ethnic minorities and punitive economic sanctions from the international community. From this perspective, a just praxis acknowledges the ubiquity of violent conflict while it distinguishes global readings that occur from a distance to the intimate and interminable experiences of violence that take place in urban places. We argue that a more critical engagement with the relationship between care and vulnerability reveals the enormous potential of imagining geographies of existing and evolving relationalities of care rather than global assumptions from afar about vulnerable communities.

AB  - The land sparing-sharing model provides a powerful heuristic and analytical framework for understanding the potential of agricultural landscapes to support wild species. However, its conceptual and analytical strengths and limitations remain widely contested or misunderstood. Here, I review what inferences can and cannot be derived from the framework, and discuss eight specific points of contention and confusion. The land sparing-sharing framework is underpinned by an ethic that seeks to minimise harm to non-human species. It is used to quantify how good farmland is for different species, in relation to appropriate reference land uses, and at what opportunity cost. The results of empirical studies that have used the model indicate that most species will have larger populations if food is produced on as small an area as possible, while sparing as large an area of native vegetation as possible. The potential benefits of land sharing or intermediate strategies for wild species are more limited. I review disagreements about the scope of analysis (food production cf. food security), the value of high-yield farmland for wildlife, the (ir)relevance of the Borlaug hypothesis, scale and heterogeneity, fostering human connections to nature, the prospects for land sparing in heavily-modified landscapes, the role of land sparing in improving connectivity, and the political implications of the model. Interpreted alongside insights from social, political and economic studies, the model can help us to understand how decisions about land-use will affect the persistence of wild species populations into the future.

AB  - New Urbanism (NU) is an urban planning movement that aims to curtail suburban sprawl. Critics argue that NU actually contributes to sprawl. However, such claims overlook the diverse ways in which NU is implemented. This article contributes to the study of suburban development by examining two different types of NU projects in suburban Minneapolis-St. Paul and comparing these with a control case. Using surveys of the projects' built environments and residents' travel behavior and attitudes toward neighbors, the article finds that the NU projects break away from the physical and functional dimensions of sprawl, yet reproduce the social dimensions.

AB  - In this paper we examine, from a historical perspective, how neoliberal policies become the underlying causes that affect cultural built heritage in the southern portion of Mexico City, at present. First, we document the development of cultural built heritage in Mexico during the 20th century. We underline that this idea is accompanied, however, by a series of destruction processes concerning cultural built heritage at the same time, as the urban sprawl of Mexico City expands far south. Then, we focus on morphological and functional transformations that occurred in Periferico Sur and Insurgentes Sur urban corridors. Quantitative data that support an amalgamation of building complexes and land uses is presented, which is strongly related to the tertiary sector. We highlight the contradictions concerning the preservation of cultural built heritage within the region in current days. A first case study deals with Cuicuilco Archaeological Zone and the lack of public investment in its maintenance. Second, we assess the reconversion of an old factory into a shopping mall with support of private investment. Finally, we deal with a group of monumental sculptures that remained abandoned by their owners, but also lack of any kind of official protection by the Mexican institutions, for years.

AB  - Litoria cyclorhyncha is a hylid frog native to southwest Western Australia (WA). It was first recorded in South Australia (SA) in 2000 and has established a breeding population in Streaky Bay on the western Eyre Peninsula since at least 2011. L cyclorhyncha is a relatively large predatory frog that presents a potential threat to fauna and ecosystem processes in SA and eastern Australia. This study examines the invasion history and current and potential future distributions of this frog using historical records, field surveys and species distribution modelling (SDM). The historical records in SA suggest human-assisted dispersal through transport networks. Field surveys throughout the Eyre Peninsula during 2016-2017 detected three native species of frogs but no additional breeding populations of L. cyclorhyncha outside of Streaky Bay. Within Streaky Bay, frog abundance appears to be concentrated around permanent water bodies, but the species is also well established in urban habitats. SDM suggests that suitable environmental conditions exist for L. cyclorhyncha in southern and eastern Australia. This, and the frog's ability to disperse over long distances, suggests considerable potential for the species to become invasive. As L. cyclorhyncha has potential to significantly impact biodiversity and ecosystems, management strategies are urgently needed.

AB  - The intensification and subsequent closing down of industrial activities during the last century has left behind large surfaces of derelict lands. Derelict soils have low fertility, can be contaminated, and many of them remain unused. However, with the increasing demand of soil surfaces, they might be considered as a resource, for example for non-food biomass production. The study of their physico-chemical properties and of their biodiversity and biological activity may provide indications for their potential re-use. The objective of our study was to investigate the quality of six derelict soils, considering abiotic, biotic, and functional parameters. We studied (i) the soil bacteria, fungi, meso- and macro-fauna and plant communities of six different derelict soils (two from coking plants, one from a settling pond, two constructed ones made from different substrates and remediated soil, and an inert waste storage one), and (ii) their decomposition function based on the decomposer trophic network, enzyme activities, mineralization activity, and organic pollutant degradation.
   Biodiversity levels in these soils were high, but all biotic parameters, except the mycorrhizal colonization level, discriminated them. Multivariate analysis showed that biotic parameters co-varied more with fertility proxies than with soil contamination parameters. Similarly, functional parameters significantly co-varied with abiotic parameters. Among functional parameters, macro-decomposer proportion, enzyme activity, average mineralization capacity, and microbial polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degraders were useful to discriminate the soils. We assessed their quality by combining abiotic, biotic, and functional parameters: the compost-amended constructed soil displayed the highest quality, while the settling pond soil and the contaminated constructed soil displayed the lowest. Although differences among the soils were highlighted, this study shows that derelict soils may provide a biodiversity ecosystem service and are functional for decomposition. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The field of eco-engineering has burgeoned in recent years in response to the proliferation of artificial structures. Adding water-retaining features to seawalls has been successful in increasing biodiversity relative to the surrounding structure. Artificial rock pools may not, however, completely mimic natural rock pools. Here, we compared natural colonisation, through dispersal and recruitment, of intertidal mobile species to water-retaining flowerpots on seawalls with that into rock pools. This represents the more usual 'passive' approach to ecoengineering where features are built to enhance biodiversity and are allowed to colonise naturally, as opposed to seeding or transplanting organisms to features. While flowerpots supported some mobile species not found on the seawall, other species common on natural shores did not recruit to flowerpots. Thus, in a second experiment we tested the effectiveness of an 'active' approach through transplanting mobile organisms to flowerpots to expedite the colonisation process. For the species examined, however, most individuals did not stay in the flowerpots for more than 24 h after being transplanted. Further understanding of the processes (e.g. dispersal distances, recruitment) influencing colonisation of eco-engineered habitats is needed to effectively inform management of marine infrastructure, particularly for projects targeted at restoration rather than enhancement.

AB  - Reserve design is a process that can address ecological, social, and political factors to identify parcels of land needed to sustain wildlife populations and other natural resources. Acquisition of parcels for a large terrestrial reserve is difficult because it typically occurs over a long timeframe and thus invokes consideration of future conditions such as climate and urbanization changes. In central Florida, the U.S. government has authorized a new protected area, the Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge. The new refuge will host important threatened and endangered species and habitats, and will be located to allow for species adaptation from climate change impacts. For this study we combined habitat objectives defined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and projections from two urbanization models to provide guidance for Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge design. We used Marxan with Zones to find near-optimal solutions for protecting explicit amounts of five target habitats. We identified parcels for inclusion into the reserve design that the models allocated among two zones representing different methods of protection: fee-simple purchase (up to 20,234 ha authorized by the U.S. government), and conservation easement agreements (up to 40,469 ha authorized). As expected, for all scenarios we found an increase in costs as the proportion of fee-simple purchases was increased, reflecting the lesser cost of easements, but the number of parcels required for protection differed little among scenarios. The two urbanization models showed considerable agreement over which habitat patches they did not forecast to be developed, and some agreement over which parcels might be developed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may benefit from focusing on parcels that our analyses select frequently under both urban scenarios because these parcels are more likely to be in areas where there are fewer urbanization threats and a lower demand for land. The reserve designs we generated met U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service habitat goals within fee and easement zone restrictions, and we found reserve configurations that fell well below the mandated size limit.

AB  - Research on moving objects and analysis of movement patterns in urban networks can help us evaluate urban land-use types. With the help of technologies such as global positioning systems, spatial information systems and spatial data the study of movement patterns is possible. By understanding and quantifying the patterns of pedestrian trajectories, we can find effects of and relations between urban land-use types and movements of pedestrians. Understanding urban land-use and their relationships with human activities has great implications for smart and sustainable urban development. In this study, we use the data of various urban land-use types and the trajectory of pedestrians in an urban environment. This paper presents a new approach for identifying busy urban land-use by semantic spatial trajectory in which urban land-uses are assessed according to the pedestrian trajectories. Undoubtedly, the extraction of popular urban land-uses and analysis of the association between popular places and the spatial and semantic movement allow us to improve the urban structure and city marketing system. In this regard, for semantic analysis of urban land-use, all stop points are extracted by a time threshold and they are enriched according to semantic information such as age, occupation, and gender. We examine if and how habits of using land-use types depend on qualities such as age, gender and occupation. For analysis of effects of various urban land-use types, all stop points near each urban land-use are detected. Determining what type of urban land-use cause pedestrian traffic and high absorption coefficient and what relation such high traffic has with semantic information such as age, occupation and gender. By clustering the stop points, the results indicate that stop at urban networks for each gender have a spatial correlation. Also, the results show that some urban land-use types have high traffic and we have a correlation with some semantic information such as age, gender and occupation.

AB  - Studies to determine the population fluctuation of Diaphorina citri, vector of Candidatus Liberibacter sp., have been carried out mainly in commercial plantations, whereas less have focused in urban areas and their synchrony. The objectives of this work were to monitor D. citri adult populations in Murraya paniculata (OJ) in urban areas and in Persian lime (LM) orchards, to estimate the effect of some environmental factors and to evaluate the synchronization between these populations. Sampling was performed from September 2012 to August 2014 in Veracruz, Mexico. Five urban areas and five commercial Persian lime plots close to each other were selected. Adult D. citri catches were made monthly with yellow traps. Vegetative shoots, temperature and relative humidity were measured throughout the sampling period. Adults of Diaphorina citri were captured in all the sampling sites throughout the two-years sampling period and the populations were more abundant in summer. Significant factors affecting trap catches were the presence of new shoots and temperature. Temperature and relative humidity enclosed a comfort zone between 26 and 28 degrees C and 75 to 85% respectively. Cross-correlation values were positive across hosts within the same locations and between locations, regardless of the distance, thus suggesting a spatial synchronization in trap catches. This spatial relationship represents a risk of infestation between host species because of the potential movement and dispersal.

AB  - In recent years many authors have called for the broad integration of ecological principles into planning to improve conservation of biodiversity. Based on this, the issue of this research is to link the relationship between planning and biodiversity, namely the extent to which local planning units overcome biodiversity conservation in their planning and policies. The purpose of this study is to uncover problems and information needs on the environment. To achieve these objectives, the researchers first identify environmental issues, especially related to biodiversity which is a significant issue in the local government, then mapping the need for reporting biodiversity accounting. This study operates discourse analysis methods. Discourse in this perspective is interpreted as multiple and irregular pronunciations, then using universal norms or standards will organize regular meanings. The findings of this study show that environmental problems raise some anxiety about ecological damage. The rapid development of urban development is one of the main driving factors in the emergence of environmentalism movement and increases the need for the importance of reporting biodiversity accounting as a form of government accountability.

AB  - Background: Understanding white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) habitat use in coastal areas adjacent to large cities, is an important step when formulating potential solutions to the conservation conflict that exists between humans and large predatory sharks. In this study, we present the findings of a 2.5-year study of white shark occurrence and movement patterns adjacent to the City of Cape Town in False Bay, South Africa, with a focus on spring and summer months. Fifty-one white sharks were monitored annually at three offshore and twelve inshore sites by VR2 acoustic receivers, over 975 days from 1 May 2005 to 31 December 2007.
   Results: Occurrence patterns at inshore sites during spring and summer were analysed using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) with a spatial term (longitude, latitude), time of day and year included as explanatory variables for site use. We found that sharks occurred more frequently at inshore sites along the northern and northwestern shores, compared to the rest of the bay, and they transitioned most frequently between four adjacent beach sites that encompass the most popular recreational water use areas in Cape Town. There was significant diel variation, with higher shark occurrence around midday, and a peak in shark occurrence in 2005, when human-shark interactions also peaked. However, we found no effect of shark size on occurrence patterns at inshore sites.
   Conclusions: White sharks showed the highest levels of occurrence at specific inshore sites between Muizenberg and Strandfontein beach, and thus inclusion of these sites within False Bay's marine protected area (MPA) network or recognition as Ecological or Biological Significant Areas (EBSAs) should be a future consideration. These insights into white shark habitat use at inshore sites in False Bay are important for successfully applying the principles of marine spatial planning (MSP) and for making science-based policy decisions. Furthermore, this information can be used to reduce potential shark-human conflict by incorporating it into future shark safety education campaigns.

AB  - Development of water infrastructure benefits water security and agriculture but poses risks to habitat and aquatic fauna. Wyaralong Dam was constructed on Teviot Brook in 2010 to provide future urban water supplies for South East Queensland, Australia. Construction of the dam created a large impoundment area and environmental impact assessment predicted significant impacts upon resident freshwater turtle species and their habitats. Differences in habitat requirements, life-history characteristics and sensitivity to change between the Macquarie River turtle (Emydura macquarii macquarii) and the common saw-shelled turtle (Myuchelys latisternum) were expected to influence the impact of the dam on the spatial and temporal abundance of these species. The relative abundance of each species was monitored at sites located within, upstream and downstream of the impoundment across wet and dry seasons during the dam's first five years of operation. The results of this monitoring program indicate that spatial and temporal variability in the relative abundance of E. macquarii macquarii and M. latisternum occurred during the study but not all expected impacts were realised. Contrary to expectation, the relative abundance of E. macquarii macquarii did not increase over time within, upstream or downstream of the dam. M. latisternum showed greater temporal variability at some sites; however, no clear relationship between relative abundance and operational years was observed during the monitoring program. Spatial variability in relative abundance between sites was dependent upon season, with trends generally consistent across both turtle species. Where differences between species were observed, these are suspected to have resulted from the influence of environmental conditions on species-specific movement behaviours. The monitoring program confirmed the use of the upper limits of the impoundment and the plunge pool below the dam wall by both turtle species but relative abundance within the main body of the impoundment remained low throughout monitoring. The results of the study allow for consideration of the suitability of predefined management measures and the development of recommendations for future monitoring programs prescribed for water infrastructure developments.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems across the Amazon are largely comprised of small streams and headwaters of riparian zones. These areas are legally protected within private landholdings in Brazil, but recent changes in the environmental legislation have slackened protection requirements, with unpredictable consequences to the integrity and functioning of these freshwater environments. Local drivers of riparian forest loss and degradation should be understood by considering context-dependent land management practices and pressures within a region. Here, we examine the spatial determinants of the total amount and spectral quality of both headwater and overall riparian forests within private landholdings within a highly fragmented region of southern Amazonia. We built generalized linear models to assess how the amount and spectral quality of headwater and riparian forests respond to landholding size and distance to roads and an urban center, and document landholder compliance rates according to both the current and previous Brazilian environmental legislation. Although forest loss and degradation are typically associated, forest degradation responded independently to the same drivers. Headwater forests were generally more degraded than riparian forests, and smallholders complied less often with legal requirements than largeholders. Proximity to roads and the nearest town had a detrimental effect on both headwater and riparian forest amount and quality, and distance to the nearest town affected all variables, except for headwater forest quality. Compliance with environmental legislation is the first step in protecting riparian and headwater forests, but alternative landscape management strategies must be explored, particularly focusing on smallholdings, which are most vulnerable to deforestation and forest degradation.

AB  - Outdoor recreation is a valuable ecosystem service permitted in most protected areas globally. Land-use planners and managers are often responsible for providing access to natural areas for recreation while avoiding environmental impacts such as declines of threatened species. Since recreation can have harmful effects on biodiversity, reliable information about protected-area visitation patterns is vital for managers. Our goal was to quantify recreational use in a fragmented urban reserve network and identify factors that influenced visitation. We empirically measured visitation rates at 18 reserves in San Diego County, California. Using random forest models, we identified biophysical and socioeconomic factors that influenced spatial variation in visitation rates and made projections to 27 additional reserves, validating with an expert opinion survey. Visitation rates varied widely across the reserve network. Accessibility variables, such as numbers of housing units and parking lots, were key explanatory variables that had positive relationships with visitation rates. To illustrate the applications of our models, we assessed the exposure of 7 species and subspecies of conservation concern to recreation by comparing predicted occurrence to projected visitation intensities. We found that several species and subspecies, including the orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra), western spadefoot (Spea hcunmondii), and the federally-threatened coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica), are likely exposed to high levels of recreational activity. Our results can be used to identify species for further research, highlight areas with potential conflict between recreation and conservation objectives, and forecast future changes in visitation.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a correction of the Mobility Entropy indicator (ME) used to describe the diversity of individual movement patterns as can be captured by data from mobile phones. We argue that a correction is necessary because standard calculations of ME show a structural dependency on the geographical density of observation points, rendering results biased and comparisons between regions incorrect. As a solution, we propose the Corrected Mobility Entropy (CME). We apply our solution to a French mobile phone dataset with approximate to 18.5 million users. Results show CME to be less correlated to cell-tower density (r=-0.17 instead of -0.59 for ME). As a spatial pattern of mobility diversity, we find CME values to be higher in suburban regions compared to their related urban centers, while both decrease considerably with lowering urban center sizes. Based on regression models, we find mobility diversity to relate to factors like income and employment. Additionally, using CME reveals the role of car use in relation to land use, which was not recognized when using ME values. Our solution enables a better description of individual mobility at a large scale, which has applications in official statistics, urban planning and policy, and mobility research.

AB  - Cairo has components that present its distinctiveness; the changes occured in a city are due to the alteration in the urban form of them. Its recognition is achieved when movement occurs through a street space; Walking is a remarkable mode; an interaction that exists between people and a place. Hence, it is essential to design and plan pavements to ensure potential for walking and promote the presence of people in the street space.
   This paper focuses upon the significance of pavements in hosting pedestrians and discusses how it contributes to the discovery of a city. It explains the role of pavements in encouraging the presence of people in a street space, which acts as a lens for identifying a city through the recognition of its physical fabric. Finally, the paper recommends tools to address absent or deteriorated pavements, and based on successful designs, demonstrates how good pavement planning and design can reveal a city's identity.

AB  - The limited seed dispersal range of cycads, longevity of individuals, including a long juvenile phase, coupled with dioecy, suggest that the impacts of habitat fragmentation are not straightforward. Cycas megacarpa K.D. Hill. is an endangered cycad that occurs in a highly fragmented landscape derived from past agricultural land clearing. Current threats continue to be land clearing for both urban and rural developments and major infrastructure development for coal seam gas. This study investigated the effect fragmentation has had on C. megacarpa populations across its entire range. Twelve microsatellite loci were developed with next generation sequencing and used to analyse 992 samples from 33 populations. Geographic information system (GIS) analysis of the total reduction in suitable regional ecosystem (RE) habitat in Queensland revealed a 69% loss between 1960s pre-clearing records and 2009 with only 29% of remaining habitat occurring in protected areas. Populations are highly variable with many small populations, and there is evidence of possible declining recruitment of seedlings. The relatively low proportion of adult sized plants that reproduce synchronously promotes outcrossing; however, there is some evidence that reduced population sizes may lead to inbreeding. Genetic diversity is not correlated with population size but it is weakly correlated with isolation. There is evidence of considerable historic gene flow among populations and little genetic differentiation among broad geographic regions. The results show genetic clustering and are consistent with hypotheses that C. megacarpa existed as a set of metapopulations historically linked by gene flow. This has maintained diversity in small populations but suggests that fragmentation that increases population isolation has and will continue to reduce the species viability. The persistence of adult cycads through multiple generations may allow rare alleles to remain within populations over a longer period of time.

AB  - The expansion of cities and agricultural plantations have unpredictable impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Yet some species are capable of tolerating anthropogenic impacts and continue to provide ecological services in highly disturbed landscapes. The objective of this study was to use DNA barcoding to identify digested plant materials and seeds in the faeces of frugivorous bats (Cynopterus brachyotis) and investigate whether (1) C. brachyotis in urban and agricultural areas exploit cultivated and exotic plants as a novel food resource and as a consequence, potentially facilitate the invasion of cultivated and exotic plants, or whether (2) C. brachyotis exploit native plants and as a consequence, potentially promote forest regeneration. A native species, Ficus fistulosa, was the most frequently detected plant and the seeds were found in bat faeces from all sampling sites suggesting the potential of fruit bats in dispersing seeds. However, we also detected several exotic plants in the faeces of C. brachyotis which suggests that the fruit bats exploit novel food resources at all sites. We recorded a diverse diet of C. brachyotis at an oil palm plantation which indicated that the fruit bats are not predominantly feeding on oil palm fruits. By using DNA barcoding, we detected plants that have not been reported in previous studies of the diet of C. brachyotis, although we could not identify which part of the plant was being consumed by the fruit bats. Given the varied diet of C. brachyotis, the potential of this bat to adapt to changing landscapes is high and they are likely dispersing seeds of native pioneer plants (Ficus).

AB  - Sediment bacterial communities play a critical role in biogeochemical cycling in lotic ecosystems. Despite their ecological significance, the effects of urban discharge on spatiotemporal distribution of bacterial communities are understudied. In this study, we examined the effect of urban discharge on the spatiotemporal distribution of stream sediment bacteria in a northeast Ohio stream. Water and sediment samples were collected after large storm events (discharge > 100 m) from sites along a highly impacted stream (Tinkers Creek, Cuyahoga River watershed, Ohio, USA) and two reference streams. Although alpha (a) diversity was relatively constant spatially, multivariate analysis of bacterial community 16S rDNA profiles revealed significant spatial and temporal effects on beta (13) diversity and community composition and identified a number of significant correlative abiotic parameters. Clustering of upstream and referenc'e sites from downstream sites of Tinkers Creek combined with the dominant families observed in specific locales suggests that environmentally-induced species sorting had a strong impact on the composition of sediment bacterial communities. Distinct groupings of bacterial families that are often associated with nutrient pollution (i.e., Comamonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Pirellulaceae) and other contaminants (i.e., Sphingomonadaceae and Phyllobacteriaceae) were more prominent at sites experiencing higher degrees of discharge associated with urbanization. Additionally, there were marked seasonal changes in community composition, with individual taxa exhibiting different seasonal abundance patterns. However, spatiotemporal variation in stream conditions did not affect bacterial community functional profiles. Together, these results suggest that local environmental drivers and niche filtering from discharge events associated with urbanization shape the bacterial community structure. However, dispersal limitations and interactions among other species likely play a role as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban areas are centres of business and innovation. Freight transport is indispensable for the proper functioning of any modern urban society. Urban areas cannot function without an appropriate freight transport system, due to the need to replenish stocks of food and other goods in retail shops. The complexity of the decisions concerning implementation of measures to improve the movement of goods in the city requires tools designed to support this process. In this context, a research gap and a research problem occur-how to obtain a reliable set of factors for development of sustainable urban freight transport (UFT). The purpose of this article is to introduce the possibility of applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as well as the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Method (DEMATEL) in choosing a set of measures and in analysing the field of distribution logistics, which will help to solve delivery problems and streamline cargo flow in Szczecin, in the context of sustainable development. This paper presents the findings of a survey in which experts evaluate the main coefficients for sustainable freight transport in the city area. Using both AHP and DEMATEL methods, we have concluded that: (i) all coefficients from administrative, financial, technical and promotional measures are highly interconnected; (ii) strategy of freight transport development should take into consideration how these coefficients influence each other; (iii) P2-eco-driving trainings, T4-alternative delivery systems and P1-promotional campaigns for sustainable transport are the most important criteria and should be priorities for investments; (iv) A1-implementation of loading/unloading and transit restrictions-highly influences other coefficients; (v) T2-intelligent route guidance in freight transport is greatly influenced by them.

AB  - The asylum model produced the exclusion of madness from social life, adopting the principle of therapeutic isolation, which led to the institutionalization of the person with mental suffering and their removal from the city and the social participation, subtracting from them the right to the city and the condition of citizenship. Currently, psychiatric reform in Brazil is one of the most important processes of criticizing the psychiatrisation of madness, promoting a deconstruction of the forms of social exclusion and the debate in society about the citizenship of the subjects in mental suffering and social vulnerability. Several innovative fronts, including work, art, culture, political activism and occupation of the city, have set new possibilities for life and expression for the people, in a new conception of madness and difference, in which the diversity of individuals have the right to the city and social participation.

AB  - Watershed integrity is the capacity of a watershed to support and maintain the full range of ecological processes and functions essential to sustainability. Using information from EPA's StreamCat dataset, we calculated and mapped an Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) for 2.6 million watersheds in the conterminous US with first-order approximations of relationships between stressors and six watershed functions: hydrologic regulation, regulation of water chemistry, sediment regulation, hydrologic connectivity, temperature regulation, and habitat provision. Results show high integrity in the western US, intermediate integrity in the southern and eastern US, and the lowest integrity in the temperate plains and lower Mississippi Valley. Correlation between the six functional components was high (r = 0.85-0.98). A related Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) was developed using local drainages of individual stream segments (i.e., excluding upstream information). We evaluated the ability of the IWI and ICI to predict six continuous site-level indicators with regression analyses three biological indicators and principal components derived from water quality, habitat, and combined water quality and habitat variables using data from EPA's National Rivers and Streams Assessment. Relationships were highly significant, but the IWI only accounted for 1-12% of the variation in the four biological and habitat variables. The IWI accounted for over 25% of the variation in the water quality and combined principal components nationally, and 32-39% in the Northern and Southern Appalachians. We also used multinomial logistic regression to compare the IWI with the categorical forms of the three biological indicators. Results were consistent: we found positive associations but modest results. We compared how the IWI and ICI predicted the water quality PC relative to agricultural and urban land use. The IWI or ICI are the best predictors of the water quality PC for the CONUS and six of the nine ecoregions, but they only perform marginally better than agriculture in most instances. However, results suggest that agriculture would not be appropriate in all parts of the country, and the index is meant to be responsive to all stressors. The IWI in its present form (available through the StreamCat website; https://www.cpa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat) could be useful for management efforts at multiple scales, especially when combined with information on site condition. The IWI could be improved by incorporating empirical or literature-derived relationships between functional components and stressors. However, limitations concerning the absence of data for certain stressors should be considered.

AB  - Growing demands for potable water have led to extensive reliance on waterways in tropical megacities. Attempts to manage these waterways in an environmentally sustainable way generally lack an understanding of microbial processes and how they are influenced by urban factors, such as land use and rain. Here, we describe the composition and functional potential of benthic microbial communities from an urban waterway network and analyze the effects of land use and rain perturbations on these communities. With a sequence depth of 3 billion reads from 48 samples, these metagenomes represent nearly full coverage of microbial communities. The predominant taxa in these waterways were Nitrospira and Coleofasciculus, indicating the presence of nitrogen and carbon fixation in this system. Gene functions from carbohydrate, protein, and nucleic acid metabolism suggest the presence of primary and secondary productivity in such nutrient-deficient systems. Comparison of microbial communities by land use type and rain showed that while there are significant differences in microbial communities in land use, differences due to rain perturbations were rain event specific. The more diverse microbial communities in the residential areas featured a higher abundance of reads assigned to genes related to community competition. However, the less diverse communities from industrial areas showed a higher abundance of reads assigned to specialized functions such as organic remediation. Finally, our study demonstrates that microbially diverse populations in well-managed waterways, where contaminant levels are within defined limits, are comparable to those in other relatively undisturbed freshwater systems.
   IMPORTANCE Unravelling the microbial metagenomes of urban waterway sediments suggest that well-managed urban waterways have the potential to support diverse sedimentary microbial communities, similar to those of undisturbed natural freshwaters. Despite the fact that these urban waterways are well managed, our study shows that environmental pressures from land use and rain perturbations play a role in shaping the structure and functions of microbial communities in these waterways. We propose that although pulsed disturbances, such as rain perturbations, influence microbial communities, press disturbances, including land usage history, have a long-term and stronger influence on microbial communities. Our study found that the functions of microbial communities were less affected by environmental factors than the structure of microbial communities was, indicating that core microbial functions largely remain conserved in challenging environments.

AB  - Sand dunes occupy a vast expanse of desert area in Iran and they are considered as a threat for urban areas and agricultural lands. Erg is an area of desert covered with shifting sand dunes. Saduq (Ashkezar) city, located in the west and northwest of the Yazd City, Iran, is surrounded by these mobile sand dunes. The aim of this study was the risk assessment of sand dune disaster in relation to geomorphic properties and vulnerability. The methods of satellite imageries, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and geographic information system (GIS) were used. Sand dunes changes were mapped, and field surveys were carried out to resolve any ambiguities. The results show that the sand dunes in the center of Erg have moved closer to the city and agricultural lands. The dunes displacement (movement) was dependence to size, cover and shape and direction of them. These analyses can help to city governor and mayor for preventing of dunes offense toward the city.

AB  - The subtidal rocky reefs that surround the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, California, USA are subject to multiple anthropogenic impacts, including many (at least partially) human-induced landslides over the past half century, which have resulted in chronic sedimentation (e.g., reef burial and scour) and associated turbidity effects along a major stretch of this coastline. The amount of rocky reef habitat has significandy decreased; as such, determining the optimum technique for restoring this lost habitat is the focus of this study. Over the past decade, we mapped and intensively surveyed the nearshore physical and biological characteristics both inside this impacted area and in surrounding reference areas that contain extensive rocky reef habitat with established kelp forests. Notable among all survey locations is a relatively high-relief (similar to 5 m) area of reef within the sediment impacted area that consistently has the highest fish bio-mass density among anywhere on the peninsula. The high structural relief prevents sediment accumulation, scour, and subsequent reef burial, and this reef ultimately served as the example for the design of sets of quarry rock reef "blocks" that together form the proposed restoration reef. Our primary objective was to use the 63,500 metric tons of quarry rock the budget would allow us to create the most productive habitat by restoring the natural reef environment while balancing scientific study design considerations (i.e., replicated reef components at multiple spatial scales) with maximizing the potential for an effective restoration effort across the range of important species and overall kelp forest biodiversity. To meet this objective, we considered multiple criteria that incorporated engineering specifications and biological performance and were informed by the scientific literature and results of natural and artificial reef surveys in this region. Ultimately, the design incorporated heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales while attempting to maximize high relief components, surface area to volume ratio, perimeter, ecotones, and small-scale current flow features and nutrient flux and while being consistent with the size of natural reefs along the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Further, placement and spacing of individual reef blocks (i.e., 2 X 48 m heterogeneous quarry rock reefs) included space for sand channels between blocks to permit sediment transport and create sand/rock ecotone habitats while remaining close enough to each other and existing natural reefs to maintain biological connectivity. Reef blocks were also located at the depth (15-20 m) where the most productive reef habitat in the region was observed. Finally, we discuss a proposed pre- and post-construction monitoring program and additional studies that could be performed that would leverage the replicated elements in the restoration reef design to inform future reef restoration programs.

AB  - Wetlands are important ecosystems on earth due to their capability of preserving water sources, mediating flooding, providing habitats for wildlife, and stabilizing coastlines. Wetlands play a critical role in regional sustainable development because of their ability to enhance resilienceagainst extreme weather events. Maintaining coastal sustainability requires consideration of both the health of coastal wetlands and the resilience of urban systems while mitigating the conflict among social, economic, and environmental goals in land usages around coastal wetland environment. This study investigates a sensitive coastal wetland system located at central Taiwan for demonstration of a sustainable planning practice with an integrated model based on network topology in a socio-ecological context. There are two parts of the integrated model. Whereas a Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model helps delineate the complex behaviors among different stakeholders by identifying various indicators, the analytic network process (ANP) quantifies the network topology of DPSIR. According to the survey via questionnaires answered by a group of experts, the DPSIR model is composed of 32 major indicators that can be networked by ANP. The results reveal that an effective ecological conservation depends on a series of mitigation actions, including river and habitat restorations, pollution control, green tourism, and integrated community development via better zoning policies.

AB  - Background: Temperate urban landscapes support persistent and growing populations of Culex and Aedes mosquito vectors. Large urban mosquito populations can represent a significant risk for transmission of emergent arboviral infection. However, even large mosquito populations are only a risk to the animals they bite. The purpose of this study is to identify and assess spatial patterns of host-use in a temperate urban landscape with heterogeneous socio-economic and ecological conditions.
   Results: Mosquito blood meals were collected from neighborhoods categorized along a socio-economic gradient in Baltimore, MD, USA. Blood meal hosts were identified for two Aedes (Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus) and three Culex (Cx. pipiens, Cx. restuans and Cx. salinarius) species. The brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) was the most frequently detected host in both Aedes species and Cx. salinarius. Human biting was evident in Aedes and Culex species and the proportion of human blood meals from Ae. albopictus varied significantly with neighborhood socio-economic status. Aedes albopictus was most likely to feed on human blood hosts (at 50%) in residential blocks categorized as having income above the city median, although there were still more total human bites detected from lower income blocks where Ae. albopictus was more abundant. Birds were the most frequently detected Culex blood hosts but were absent from all Aedes sampled.
   Conclusions: This study highlights fine-scale variation in host-use by medically important mosquito vectors and specifically investigates blood meal composition at spatial scales relevant to urban mosquito dispersal and human exposure. Further, the work emphasizes the importance of neighborhood economics and infrastructure management in shaping both the relative abundance of vectors and local blood feeding strategies. The invasive brown rat was an important blood source across vector species and neighborhoods in Baltimore. We show that social and economic conditions can be important predictors of transmission potential in urban landscapes and identify important questions about the role of rodents in supporting urban mosquito populations.

AB  - Continuous increase of population and automobile-to-population ratio in cities has had an impact not only on transport accessibility of urban infrastructural facilities, freedom of movement and choice of route, but also on increasing number of congestions in the street and road networks and imbalance between the length of communication routes and transportation demand of urban population. Streets and city roads are designed with regard to long-range capacity growth, however, high loading level of all lanes prevents change of lane and other manoeuvres. The main features of formationof traffic conditions are transport, road and meteorological factors. Solution of regularly occurring engineering challenges requires regular updatesof representative information on conditions and properties of traffic streams. Based on the analysis of international and domestic experience, different methodsof street and road network monitoring were studied in order to obtain up-to-date, accurate and mode-related data, most of which require large human, resource and material expenses Taking into account the prospects of development, minimization of labour costs and financial expenses, one of the most efficient methodsof registration of transport-related properties of streets and urban roads is application of geoinformation systems, namely the remote satellite-based monitoring type of them, the main pointof which is the fact that static parameters (traffic density and number of lanes) of the traffic stream are determined based on the resulting image by means of online sources, and then other road properties are determined according to different formulas based on the premises of the traffic stream theory.

AB  - The population structure of invasive species is determined both by species-specific breeding strategies and by region-specific conditions and events during the history of invasion. In this context, we investigate the role of human land-use policy on the gene flow within population of the widespread invasive tree, Ailanthus altissima. We predicted that genetic diversity would be elevated in urban environments and reduced in exurban, and that human mediated dispersal would allow propagules to break geographic isolation. Six populations of A. altissima, divided evenly among urban, exurban and suburban sites, were surveyed using a set of eight microsatellite loci. A total of 276 individuals were sampled. Populations were assessed for partitioning of genetic variation, gene flow between sites, and genetic cluster estimation. Effective population size based on genetic variation was also modeled using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Despite a strong propensity for clonal growth, the microsatellite data revealed no evidence of clonal reproduction at the population level. Gene flow between sites was found to be independent of geographic distance; instead, gene flow was correlated with the level of human traffic at a site. Genetic diversity was found to generally increase in correlation to human development; however, reduced admixture at managed sites suggests that land management practices were effective at inhibiting gene flow into managed sites.

AB  - The intelligent and connected transportation system (ICTS) is a significant and mandatory component of the smart city architecture. Multimedia content sharing, vehicle power management, and road navigation are all examples of ICTS services. As smart cities continue to deploy different technologies to improve the performance and diversity of vehicular cloud services, one of the main issues that prevails is efficient and reliable service discovery and selection for smart vehicles. Furthermore, cloud service providers (SPs) are limited to the availability, variety and quality of services made available to vehicular cloud subscribers. Smart vehicles rely on a number of SPs to acquire the required services while moving. It therefore becomes challenging for vehicular cloud subscribers to acquire services that meet their quality of experience (QoE) preferences. This paper introduces a new service provision scheme to provide continuous availability of diversified cloud services targeting vehicular cloud users through a cluster-based trusted third party (TTP) framework. TTPs act as cloud service mediators between cloud service subscribers and providers. Vehicles that are considered to have similar patterns of movement and service acquisition characteristics are grouped into service-specific clusters. TTPs communicate with service providers and cluster heads to negotiate for services with high QoE characteristics. A location prediction method is adopted to determine a vehicle's future location and allow services to be negotiated for before the vehicle's arrival. We provide simulation results to show that our approach can adequately discover and deliver cloud services with increased QoE results, minimal overhead burden and reduced end-to-end latency.

AB  - The ancient 'Silk Roads' formed a vast network of trade and exchange that facilitated the movement of commodities and agricultural products across medieval Central Asia via settled urban communities and mobile pastoralists. Considering food consumption patterns as an expression of socio-economic interaction, we analyse human remains for carbon and nitrogen isotopes in order to establish dietary intake, then model isotopic niches to characterize dietary diversity and infer connectivity among communities of urbanites and nomadic pastoralists. The combination of low isotopic variation visible within urban groups with isotopic distinction between urban communities irrespective of local environmental conditions strongly suggests localized food production systems provided primary subsistence rather than agricultural goods exchanged along trade routes. Nomadic communities, in contrast, experienced higher dietary diversity reflecting engagements with a wide assortment of foodstuffs typical for mobile communities. These data indicate tightly bound social connectivity in urban centres pointedly funnelled local food products and homogenized dietary intake within settled communities, whereas open and opportunistic systems of food production and circulation were possible through more mobile lifeways.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) pose a serious socio-economic and traffic safety issue. We investigated factors affecting the location and number of WVC on the expressway "Tri-City Bypass" in a suburban area in N Poland. We analysed WVC with large-sized (LSM; ungulates; 54% of roadkills) and small-sized mammals (SSM; mainly carnivores; 46% of roadkills) and both groups combined (AM). We identified WVC hotspots and analysed factors affecting their spatial distribution with Poisson regression based on four sets of landscape and road-related features (area, patchiness, presence and other features). The most frequent mammal victims of WVCs were wild boar Sus scrofa (31%), roe deer Capreolus capreolus (21%) and European badger Meles meles (13%), among LSM, and red fox Vulpes vulpes (27%) among SSM. In general, our results indicated that most WVCs occurred in areas with a higher number of forest patches and a higher total length of forest edge (AM, LSM), in curvy sections of the road (LSM). The number of WVCs was lower in locations covered by urbanized areas and grassland (LSM), in the sections with fences, exits and overpasses (LSM, AM). The road sections where there is a higher risk of severe collisions (involving large species) are situated in areas where the Tri-City Bypass bisects a highly forested area, which serve as movement corridors for LSM between fragmented forest complexes. We conclude that the number of WVCs can be reduced by preventing animals from accessing the road and ensuring a safe road crossing. This could be achieved by extending fencing and retrofitting some existing underpasses.

AB  - Hedgerows, flowering strips, and natural areas that are adjacent to agricultural land have been shown to benefit crop production, via the provision of insect pollinators that pollinate crops. However, we do not yet know the extent to which bee habitat in the form of urban gardens might contribute to pollination services in surrounding crops. We explored whether gardens might provision pollinators to adjacent agricultural areas by sampling bees from gardens in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, and estimating typical foraging distances in the context of commercial- and residential-scale pollination-dependent crops up to 1000 m from garden study sites. We estimate that garden bees could forage outside of the garden in which they were collected, and that when pollination-dependent crops (commercial-scale or residential-scale) are nearby, 30-50% of the garden bee community could potentially provide pollination services to adjacent crops, if urban bees readily cross boundaries and forage among habitat types. Urban gardens might thus be well-positioned to provision neighboring farms and food gardens with pollination services, or could serve as a refuge for pollinators when forage is scarce or crop management practices are inhospitable. The actual capacity of gardens to serve as a refuge for pollinators from agricultural fields depends upon the extent to which bees forage across habitat types. However, relatively little is known about the degree to which bees move among habitat patches in heterogeneous landscapes. We thus propose a research agenda that can document the extent to which gardens contribute to pollinator health and pollination services at the interface of urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes. In particular, more data is needed on how landscape context impedes or promotes garden bee movement between habitat types.

AB  - Migratory species provide ecosystem goods and services throughout their annual cycles, often over long distances. Designing effective conservation solutions for migratory species requires knowledge of both species ecology and the socioeconomic context of their migrations. We present a framework built around the concept that migratory species act as carriers, delivering benefit flows to people throughout their annual cycle that are supported by the network of ecosystems upon which the species depend. We apply this framework to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) migration of eastern North America by calculating their spatial subsidies. Spatial subsidies are the net ecosystem service flows throughout a species' range and a quantitative measure of the spatial mismatch between the locations where people receive most benefits and the locations of habitats that most support the species. Results indicate cultural benefits provided by monarchs in the U.S. and Canada are subsidized by migration and overwintering habitat in Mexico. At a finer scale, throughout the monarch range, habitat in rural landscapes subsidizes urban residents. Understanding the spatial distribution of benefits derived from and ecological support provided to monarchs and other migratory species offers a promising means of understanding the costs and benefits associated with conservation across jurisdictional borders.

AB  - Traffic surveillance has been one of the essential attributes in smart city concept. Nowadays, in such applications rotating camera is preferred over static camera. Motivation behind this substitution is to reduce the cost of data transmission and Total of cost of ownership. To design an optimal and performant wireless 'smart city area network' for video surveillance systems, this paper focuses on some key areas, namely, transmission efficiency, lossless video data coding, data congestion, edge computing at transmission nodes. The end objective is to achieve high quality received video stream in spite of compressed data transmission. Some research initiatives in this domain are pertinent. For example, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) based rate distortion optimization is an effective tool in enhancing the perceptual video quality in wireless environments. However, prevailing system does not consider the network congestion conditions, affecting quality of received video. Also, effect of distortion introduced by 'channel noise' is unattended. This motivated us to propose a new dual metric traffic control mechanism, wherein both metrics i.e. distortion and data congestion are considered. It is based on an 'improvised SSIM' method which incorporates the 'Rate of allocation' algorithm as a function. Experimental results unveil that the proposed traffic control using similarity index under noise diversity can achieve better video quality and more data throughput.

AB  - Patterns of human development are shifting from concentrated housing toward sprawled housing intermixed with natural land cover, and wildlife species increasingly persist in close proximity to housing, roads, and other anthropogenic features. These associations can alter population dynamics and evolutionary trajectories. Large carnivores increasingly occupy urban peripheries, yet the ecological consequences for populations established entirely within urban and exurban landscapes are largely unknown. We applied a spatial and landscape genetics approach, using noninvasively collected genetic data, to identify differences in black bear spatial genetic patterns across a rural-to-urban gradient and quantify how development affects spatial genetic processes. We quantified differences in black bear dispersal, spatial genetic structure, and migration between differing levels of development within a population primarily occupying areas with >6houses/km(2) in western Connecticut. Increased development disrupted spatial genetic structure, and we found an association between increased housing densities and longer dispersal. We also found evidence that roads limited gene flow among bears in more rural areas, yet had no effect among bears in more developed ones. These results suggest dispersal behavior is condition-dependent and indicate the potential for landscapes intermixing development and natural land cover to facilitate shifts toward increased dispersal. These changes can affect patterns of range expansion and the phenotypic and genetic composition of surrounding populations. We found evidence that subpopulations occupying more developed landscapes may be sustained by male-biased immigration, creating potentially detrimental demographic shifts.

AB  - Anthropogenic alteration of the landscape has facilitated plant community change and non-native species invasion in urban areas. We used species occurrence data from over 2000 wetlands within the Chicago metropolitan region to classify urban wetlands into community types and examined non-native species composition across community types. Non-native species were widespread across the region, occurring in over 99% of wetlands. On average, 35% of the plant species in individual wetlands were non-native. A single non-native species, Phalaris arundinacea, was present in 74% of wetlands. Six wetland community types were identified (wet meadows, marshes, forested wetlands, farmed wetlands/mudflats, roadside marshes, and an undetermined wetland type), with each having aggressively spreading non-natives amongst the most common plant species. We conducted canonical correspondence analysis to evaluate the contribution of surrounding land cover, roads, and location of wetlands to plant community composition in these wetlands, and found that similar changes to the landscape have resulted in similar combinations of native and non-native species. Differences in species composition reflected spatial gradients in land use from urban to rural areas across the region, as well as proximity to major roads. Anthropogenic drivers have resulted in profound and pervasive changes to wetland communities across the region, creating novel habitats and ultimately novel community types.

AB  - The interaction between native fleshy-fruit plants and introduced fruit consumers contributes to the dynamics of highly fragmented environments. Such interactions can occur through pollination and seed dispersal. Here, we investigated the potential of seed dispersing by a non-native primate, the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), in an urban Atlantic forest fragment in north-eastern Brazil. Fleshy fruits from non-native plants were preferentially exploited by the squirrel monkeys. We measured 147 seeds (width and length) from 20 of 106 faecal samples. The dispersed seeds were from five plant species (four families). We found a positive correlation between the size of seeds found in faecal samples with their availability in the habitat. Only one seed was found visually damaged after passage through the squirrel monkeys' guts. The defecated seeds were uniformly distributed (variance to mean ratio index) in the home range of squirrel monkeys, and there was a lack of specific latrines (i. e., habitat preference for defecation). Our data provide evidence that non-native S. sciureus may in be (i) acting as a potential seed disperser of native plants in the Atlantic forest fragment, (ii) contributing to the ecological role of native frugivores, and (iii) potentially contributing to the regeneration process of the highly degraded study site.

AB  - Urban migrant women worldwide utilize a creative combination of food insecurity coping strategies to procure food for themselves and their families. Using in-depth interviews with 72 migrant women in Medellin, Colombia, and Washington, DC, this paper argues that in low-income urban communities these everyday strategies can further their demands for autonomy in determining what foods they produce and consume. Relying on feminist geography and food sovereignty literature, this research explores how migrant women living in poverty rely on informal networks for growing and sharing food, seek out organic, fresh foods, and utilize independent survival strategies to counter exclusionary rhetoric and a food system they view as unhealthy. In doing so, they devise alternative urban imaginaries of a more democratic food system. This research contributes a more nuanced understanding of the food insecurity experiences of urban migrant women.

AB  - Airborne microbes (bacteria, archaea, protists, and fungi) were surveyed over a 7-y period via high-throughput massive sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes in rain and snow samples collected fortnightly at a high-elevation mountain Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network site (LTER-Aiguestortes, Central Pyrenees, Spain). This survey constitutes the most comprehensive mountain-top aerobiology study reported to date. The air mass origins were tracked through modeled back-trajectories and analysis of rain water chemical composition. Consistent microbial seasonal patterns were observed with highly divergent summer and winter communities recurrent in time. Indicative microbial taxa were unveiled as a forensic signature, and ubiquitous taxa were observed as common atmosphere inhabitants, highlighting aerosols as a potentially successful mechanism for global microbial dispersal. Source-tracking analyses identified freshwater, crop-land, and urban biomes as the most important sources for airborne bacteria in summer, while marine and forest biomes prevailed in winter, in agreement with air mass retrotrajectories and the prevailing general and regional atmospheric circulation.

AB  - Sustainable production besides economic, energetic, and environmental aspects should consider social and cultural features of the territory in which it relies. This occurs above all for agriculture that is intrinsically related to the territory. Today, the territory as a landscape represents a complex eco-system (subjects, communities, traditions, cultures, and specific agricultural systems) and a valuable vehicle for art and history and it is also a strategic asset to defend and promote with environmental policies. The topic of urban preservation and regeneration has been increasing by opening up to other factors such as the engagement of local communities and the contribution they can give toward the development of the identity and the symbolic universe of every community especially for historic territories. The main research question of this study is: Can historic territories be described as the landscape of a complex eco-system able to support a new cultural policy? In addition, which type of connections between physical resources and the virtual-cultural ones of that landscape are strategic assets for promoting historic territories? This theoretical manuscript is oriented toward improving territorial policies. In more details, it tries to develop a new model to reach a global community of creativity as a bridge between the networks of historic territories, which is meant as roots of variety to transfer to future generations, and between local and global quality in an emergent landscape. In order to reach this new model, the local community and ecosystem capabilities require a multi-level connection among both art, science, and culture as well as nature, technology, and civic capability. The result is that the new model is able to share common goods, which are both internal and external. Following this path, it is urgent to develop policies in an emergent perspective that are able to combine artistic, ecological, environmental, and cultural assets. In particular, the goals are to: (i) explore the complex value of territorial contexts that develop/evolve from both a medium-term and long-term point of view that is not described by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) standard indicators, (ii) reach the suggestion of a continuous re-articulation of sectors of knowledge proposed by cultural resources, and (iii) highlight that cultural marketing is involved in the interpretation and transmission within a large network of participants, users, institutions, markets, virtual, and territorial places. The starting point is identified as the landscape of historic territory, but an important achievement will be to transfer the main results to other territories by studying specific case histories of urban and non-urban landscapes.

AB  - The abundance of 100 of the most widespread species of macro-moth in the UK and Ireland was estimated from light-trap records reported to the UK and Ireland Garden Moth Scheme between 2005 and 2015. Recording sites were classified into low, medium and high night-time illumination categories by satellite imagery, into land-use types from the dominant use in the 1-2 km surrounding area, and by latitude. Most urban sites were in the group classified as having high night-time illumination. Comparison between medium and low night-time illuminated sites allowed differences between levels of illumination free from the effect of urbanization on moth abundance to be assessed. The medium and low night-time illuminated sites differed significantly in the frequency of grassland and arable land-use types and in geographic location with more grassland and north-western sites in the low-light category. After adjustment for these differences and for variations between taxonomic family groups, the medium to low night-time lighting abundance ratios explained a significant (P < 0.001) 20% of the variance in long-term changes in moth abundance reported by the Rothamsted Insect Survey for the years 1968-2002. This is the first demonstration that artificial night-time lighting has had, in combination with other factors, a significant influence on levels of abundance of moth populations.

AB  - Occupation of Izmir by the Greek on May 15, 1919 was a key event which was engraved in the memory of the Turkish Nation and which constituted one of the turning points of Turkish War of Independence. Indeed, occupation of Izmir was the event which 'Turkish Nation reacted most among occupations in the aftermath of Mudros Armistice. Thus, this event can be considered as the catalyzer of the national resistance. Notably as of the occupation date, meetings were held countrywide starting in the urban and rural districts in Western Anatolia in order to protest the occupation and telegraphs of protest were sent from villages, towns and provinces all over Turkey. So, a social mobilization was triggered by telegraph throughout the country. These telegraphs which are the subject matter of this study were wired to Istanbul (to Sultan, Grand Vizier, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the Interior, and to the Representatives of Entente Powers in Istanbul). This study which is designed to make an analysis on the occupation of Izmir, a significant turning point in our national history contributing to today's social movement studies, will present a novel reading for the current examples in the field and yield concrete data regarding Turkish history of social movements. In this regard, this research, which analyzes telegraphs sent from 14 cities with content analysis, assumes that the spirit emerging from the telegraphs arc the starter of National Struggle movement. As a result, the study reveals the influence of the occupation on the Turkish Nation and the presence of a collective spirit which gives the same reaction throughout the country.

AB  - Dengue transmission is a complex spatiotemporal process with hidden interactions between hosts, vectors, and viruses as well as environment. This study aims to identify the transmission patterns and the driving mechanism that contributed to the dengue epidemics occurred in Guangdong Province of China in 2014. Based on the city-specific epidemiological, meteorological, demographic and geographic data, we first performed wavelet analysis and then integrated the key dynamics (i.e., mosquito population dynamics, human movement, virus transmission, and parameter estimation) into a transmission model. Using these methods, we found a clear temporal sequence and correlation of dengue transmission between cities, and such relationship is associated with socioeconomic factors. We further obtained the specific component of dengue incidence data in each city, and presented the underlying infectivity networks for characterizing how dengue transmits from one location to another. The results showed that the communication of in-out infections with Guangzhou and Foshan could be responsible for the large-scale diffusion of dengue epidemics in Guangdong in 2014. Our findings can offer new insights into how to improve the predictability and risk assessment of dengue transmission. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban colonization by wildlife involves a combination of several different mechanisms, including phenotype or genotype sorting, phenotypic plasticity and microevolutionary adaptation. Combination of these processes can produce a rapid phenotypic, but also genetic divergence of urban versus rural populations. Here, we examined the pattern of genetic differentiation between urban and rural populations of a colonial migratory bird, the black-headed gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus. To this end, we sampled ca 170 individuals from six (two urban and four rural) colonies in northern Poland, and genotyped them at ten microsatellite loci. Our analysis provided evidence for negligible genetic divergence of urban and rural colonies, as assessed with fixation index F-ST and Nei's unbiased genetic distance D (mean pairwise urban-rural comparisons: F-ST=0.003 +/- 0.001 [SE] and D=0.012 +/- 0.006 [SE]). Bayesian clustering methods provided support for homogeneous genetic structure across all urban and rural populations. Also, we found no support for reduced allelic diversity in urban versus rural colonies. These results stand in a stark contrast to the previous findings on the genetic consequences of urbanization in birds. We hypothesize that this pattern could possibly be attributed to the important life-history characters of the black-headed gull, including coloniality, migratoriness, and high dispersal propensity. Our study provides a novel insight into the urban landscape genetics, underlining large variation in the mechanisms of urban colonization and its genetic consequences in wild animal populations.

AB  - Vital for many marine and terrestrial species, and several other environmental services, such as carbon sink areas, the mangrove ecosystem is highly threatened due to the proximity of large urban centers and climate change. The forced fragmentation of this ecosystem affects the genetic diversity distribution among natural populations. Moreover, while restoration efforts have increased, few studies have analyzed how recently-planted areas impact the original mangrove genetic diversity. We analyzed the genetic diversity of two mangroves species (Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia schaueriana) in three areas in Brazil, using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Using the local approach, we identified the genetic diversity pool of a restored area compared to nearby areas, including the remnant plants inside the restored area, one well-conserved population at the shore of Guanabara Bay, and one impacted population in Araca Bay. The results for L. racemosa showed that the introduced population has lost genetic diversity by drift, but remnant plants with high genetic diversity or incoming propagules could help improve overall genetic diversity. Avicennia schaueriana showed similar genetic diversity, indicating an efficient gene flow. The principal component analysis showing different connections between both species indicate differences in gene flow and dispersal efficiencies, highlighting the needed for further studies. Our results emphasize that genetic diversity knowledge and monitoring associated with restoration actions can help avoid bottlenecks and other pitfalls, especially for the mangrove ecosystem.

AB  - We assessed the subsistence-related variation of the human gut microbiome at a fine resolution for two of the main dimensions of microbiome variation, age and geography. For this, we investigated the fecal microbiome and metabolome in rural Bassa and urbanized individuals from Nigeria, including infants, and compared data with worldwide populations practicing varying subsistence. Our data highlight specific microbiome traits that are progressively lost with urbanization, such as the dominance of pristine fiber degraders and the low inter-individual variation. For the Bassa, this last feature is the result of their subsistence-related practices favoring microbial dispersal, such as their extensive environmental contact and the usage of untreated waters from the Usuma River. The high degree of microbial dispersal observed in the Bassa meta-community nullifies the differences between infant and adult intestinal ecosystems, suggesting that the infant-type microbiome in Western populations could be the result of microbiome-associated neotenic traits favored by urbanization.

AB  - As the local strategic surface water source for Beijing City, the Miyun Reservoir catchment is suffering from the challenges of forest landscape degradation (FLD) under various natural and anthropogenic disturbances. This study developed a cause-effect Bayesian network model, consisting of three tiers of nodes, site indicators, external disturbance, and the outcome of FLD, to perform a regional ecological risk assessment to better understand the FLD risks (1998-2013) in the catchment. The effects of the Beijing-Tianjin sandstorm source control (BTSSC) Phase I program, a typical forest landscape restoration program, on the FLD were further examined. Overall, the higher level of either current occurrence or risk probability for FLD suggests the urgency of the following restoration efforts. The dominance of soil erosion for FLD indicates that soil erosion control should be a priority in the following Phase II program. Meanwhile, the uneven spatial distribution of high-risk areas suggests that the following efforts should be focused within the upstream Hebei Province. In addition, based on the comparison of site indicators between different risk areas, the study concluded that community livelihood activities and land degradation due to climate change have been the other two dominant driving forces contributing to FLD. Furthermore, the study found that the forest landscape has not been restored into the best state by the BTSSC program due to the multiple and complex challenges. Thus, the technical concept of nature-based solutions, including close-to-nature forest management technology and a comprehensive community-involvement governance model, was proposed for the following Phase II program.

TI  - Sikhs and Sikhism in Bihar: Their distinctiveness and diversity
T2  - SIKH FORMATIONS-RELIGION CULTURE THEORY
LA  - English
AB  - Medieval Bihar served as an important corridor for Sikh dispersal to other areas in eastern and north-eastern India. It stimulated the birth of native Sikh groups who significantly differ from their Punjabi-speaking counterparts in physical presentation and mother tongue. The essay examines why the native Sikhs' perception of Sikhism differs from Singh Sabha's (1873-1909) narrative of a monolithic Sikh identity, distinct from Hinduism. The study debates whether it is the perceived centrality of Sikhism's self-representation in Punjab that stimulates fissures in the Punjabi-Bihari Sikh relationship - fissures that periodically surface and rupture an imagined, homogenized Sikh identity within the sacred precincts of twenty-first-century Patna city.

AB  - A normal-fault earthquake (M-w = 7.1) occurred in the state limit of Puebla and Morelos on September 19, 2017, exactly 32 years after the 1985 Michoacan Earthquake. A total of 5765 buildings suffered damage in Mexico City and about 300 in Puebla City. The authors carried out a reconnaissance of Mexico City, and some locations in the states of Puebla and Morelos, to identify the affected areas and the extent of damage. This report is a summary of the damage characteristics observed during the survey for both structural and geotechnical aspects. A series of microtremor measurements were taken to understand the ground motion characteristics in three key areas of the Mexico City Basin. The results are presented and compared to the data gathered from the accelerograph network available in Mexico, and the damage characteristics are discussed. Whenever relevant, the conditions before the earthquake are compared with the damage encountered by the inclusion of photographs. In order to understand the extent of the damage incurred by the 2017 earthquake, an overview is provided of the geological and geotechnical conditions of Mexico City, which is renowned for its soft soils and problems associated with those soils. Given that the 1985 Michoacan Earthquake established the standards for seismic design in Mexico City, this report provides background on the effects of the 1985 earthquake and comparisons are made with the Puebla earthquake.

AB  - Identifying the sources of small plastic fragments is challenging because the original source item seldom can be identified. South Africa provides a useful model system to understand the factors influencing the distribution of beach litter because it has an open coastline with four equally-spaced urban-industrial centres distant from other major source areas. We sampled mesodebris (similar to 2-25 mm) at 82 South African beaches in 1994, 2005 and 2015. Plastic items comprised 99% by number and 95% by mass of litter items. Industrial pellets were the most abundant plastic items, but fragments of rigid plastic items comprised most of the mass of debris. Strong correlations between industrial pellets and other plastic items indicate that common factors influence the distribution of both pellets and secondary mesoplastics. The abundance of mesodebris at beaches also was correlated in successive surveys, suggesting that beach-specific factors (e.g. aspect, slope, local currents, etc.) influence the amounts of debris on each beach. Sample year had no effect on mesodebris abundance, indicating that there has been little change in the amounts of mesodebris over the last two decades. There were consistently higher densities of both industrial pellets and other plastic items at beaches close to urban-industrial centres; there were only weak correlations with human population density and no correlation with local runoff. The size of industrial pellets decreased away from local urban centres, further supporting the conclusion that, like macroplastic litter, most mesoplastic pollution on continental beaches derives from local, land-based sources. This finding means that local actions to reduce plastics entering the sea will have local benefits, and that it may be possible to assess the efficacy of mitigation measures to reduce marine inputs of mesoplastic items.

AB  - In New Zealand, where nonprofit and government partnerships have been formally developing since the 1990s, pathways for nonprofits to improve outcomes for affected communities were open when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake occurred in rural Canterbury on 4 September 2010. As more than 13,000 aftershocks followed, including a 6.3 magnitude event on 22 February 2011 that caused fatalities and widespread structural damage in the city of Christchurch, significant action was organized in the nonprofit sector to revitalize the city. New nonprofit initiatives emerged in the central business district to address social concerns and foster engagement across the sector. This case study, undertaken three to four years after the most severe earthquakes, compared experiences from thirty-six local nonprofit organizations regarding collaboration within the nonprofit sector. Results showed that integrating nonprofit commitments to and perceptions of demands for social services into representative collective efforts supported sustainable organizational resilience into midterm recovery. Overamalgamation and prolonged restructuring, however, limited some collective efforts. Longitudinal analysis enabled development of a scalable connective structure for sustaining network resilience into long-term recovery, including collective action and collaborative issue assessment groups. Proactive implementation of similar partnerships might facilitate sustainable resilience in other urban multihazard settings.

AB  - Since the origin of the Modern Movement, there has been a basic commitment to improving housing conditions and the well-being of occupants, especially given the prediction that 2/3 of humanity will reside in cities by 2050. Moreover, a compact model of the city with tall buildings and urban densification at this scale will be generated. Continuous constructive and technological advances have developed solid foundations on safety, energy efficiency, habitability, and sustainability in housing design. However, studies on improving the quality of life in these areas continue to be a challenge for architects and engineers. This paper seeks to contribute health-related information to the study of residential design, specifically the influence of the geomagnetic field on its occupants. After compiling information on the effects of geomagnetic fields from different medical studies over 23 years, a case study of a 16-story high-rise building is presented, with the goal of proposing architectural design recommendations for long-term occupation in the same place. The purpose of the present work is three-fold: first, to characterize the geomagnetic field variability of buildings; second, to identify the causes and possible related mechanisms; and third, to define architectural criteria on the arrangement of uses and constructive elements for housing.

AB  - From the 1980s to the 1990s, squatting for Social Centers (Centri Sociali) has developed as radical left activists engaged in occupying empty buildings all over Italy. While most of the occupations happened in big cities in the Centre and North of Italy, this paper examines the peculiarity of the Social Center Ex-Canapificio, located in a medium-size city of an agricultural plain of Southern Italy. More specifically, three particular points are discussed. First, I show how the Social Center has been able to produce access to rights in a context of informality and illegality. Then, I analyze how the Social Center has allowed the setting up of an original social movement fighting for the rights of the poor immigrant workers living in the Campanian Plain. Finally, I enlighten how Ex-Canapificio's activists have promoted new strategies to succeed in their struggles, despite their geographical distance from the main center of powers. In brief, this paper provides several themes of discussion about the spatialities of squatting and social movements.

AB  - Urban and agricultural development has resulted in drastically modified riverine corridors that are often considered to be detrimental to the recovery of anadromous salmonid populations. Although mitigation features (e.g., large wood and shallow-water areas) are frequently incorporated in flood control infrastructure to offset the impacts of streambank stabilization, little is known regarding their effectiveness and the habitat characteristics associated with enhanced nearshore rearing conditions in large rivers. We evaluated two measures of habitat use by emigrating juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha relative to different shoreline types (rock revetment [riprap], mitigated, and natural) and analyzed associations between environmental characteristics and habitat occupancy using a large number of presence/absence samples in the lower Sacramento River, California. We found both measures of habitat use to be significantly higher at natural shorelines and those including mitigation features than at shorelines consisting predominantly of rock revetment. A predictive logistic regression model suggested that the density of woody material and inundated terrestrial vegetation, depth, and substrate type significantly affected habitat occupancy. Despite a moderate predictive capability (62% of correctly classified records in a leave-one-out simulation), the model was useful in identifying habitat characteristics associated with significantly increased habitat use in this large, low-gradient river, most notably the presence of instream cover (wood or vegetation), gently sloping streambanks, fine substrate, and variable nearshore current velocity. Conversely, habitat occupancy by juvenile Chinook Salmon diminished with large, rocky substrate and increased depth, characteristics favored by introduced predatory Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu. This study illustrates the value of incorporating mitigation features and identifies characteristics that enhance habitat use by emigrating juvenile Chinook Salmon.

AB  - The urban riparian in Malaysia is also known as river reserve. Section 62 of the National Land Code 1965 has stipulated that the State Authority has the power to reserve state land for any public purposes, including river reserves. Nonetheless, its criteria are determined by the width of the reserved land and are highlighted only for bank stabilization, biodiversity, and water quality purposes. Additionally, some studies have proven that vegetated urban riparian promotes thermal reduction, in comparison to those covered with mere hard surfaces. As such, this study looked into the effect of urban riparian structure upon local thermal environment so as to gain an overview of the possible form of heat transfer occurrence. With that, this study investigated two varied formations of river reserve located side-by-side, which is bound by the same river in Johor, Malaysia. Despite of the low-albedo materials, the developed river reserve displayed somewhat lower air temperature, when compared to undeveloped river reserve area. In addition, ambient air temperature and relative humidity of both the investigated sites were linked to some factors, such as shading and wind movement. In fact, vegetation vertical clearance that caused wind flow obstruction could have been influential as well. Therefore, the effect of vegetation structure has to be comprehensively understood. With that, it is possible to determine the multiple functions of a river reserve, especially after implementing several passive cooling strategies within the area.

AB  - This article contributes to the analysis of the various factors that interact in triggering and reactivating of landslides in Bejaia city and its eastern coastal region. These factors are associated with lithologic nature of the various geological formations outcropping, morphology and its evolution during the Quaternary period, rainfall patterns and seismic context; however, other causes exist in this case, anthropogenic factors. The multiplicity of typologies identified types of movement grounds (landslides, mudflows, rock falls, falling, etc.) that reflect the diversity of mechanical behavior of materials encountered, but also the permanent unfavorable conditions and triggering of varying intensity over time encountered at each site.

AB  - Land use changes generally affect the integrity of an ecosystem. The effect of this change can be very severe if the conversion disrupts a crucial habitat of major plants and animals. The degraded Chunati Wildlife Sanctuary is one such area of Bangladesh which is facing a serious problem of rapid land use change. In this study, the future trend of land use change of the area was modelled using Artificial Neural Network. Several driver variables were also incorporated to determine their effect on land use change. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the significance of the drivers of land use change for this region. The analysis shows that nearly 76% of the total land area (8258 ha) was covered by vegetation during 2005. After 2005, that was reduced to 61% (6637 ha) in 2015, a 15% decline from 2005. On the other hand, the coverage of vacant land increased from nearly 10% in 2005 to 22% in 2015. This is indeed a matter of real concern. The critical analysis suggests that Cellular Automata is not a good fit to simulate the future land uses as it misdirects the analysis both spatially and numerically. The incorporation of driver variables gives strength to the Artificial Neural Network to predict the future. The chisquare value for the prediction of land use of the area found from the neural network was 7.815 which was greater than the critical value (3.316). The neural network was found to be a good fit for future land use prediction. The kappa index of variation shows that the overall accuracy of the prediction using neural network was above 90%. Elevation, slope, and distance to the road were the three driver variables which were found statistically significant while predicting the probability of forest land use change. The accuracy of the binary logistic regression was about 61% which was quite satisfactory. The simulation result shows that almost 5732 ha of the total land will be in the forest category of land use during 2020 and it will be further decreased to 5128 ha in 2025. The vacant area will increase from 24% to 31% from 2020 to 2025. Based on the findings and simulated land use map of 2020-2025, the study will help the management authority of this critical habitat to take proper action before further degradation occurs.

AB  - The increasing kangaroo occurrence in expanding peri-urban areas can be problematic when kangaroos become aggressive towards people and present a collision risk to motor vehicles. An improved understanding on kangaroo spatial and temporal activity patterns in the peri-urban environment is essential to manage kangaroo-human conflict. In this study, we used GPS telemetry to determine activity patterns of male Eastern Grey Kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) in a peri-urban community on the north-coast of New South Wales, Australia. Two types of GPS devices were employed; collars and cheaper alternative glue-on units. Kangaroos moved on average 2.39 km a day, with an average movement rate of 1.89 m/min, which was greatest at dawn. The GPS glue-on devices had short deployment lengths of one to 12 days. Despite limitations in attachment time, the glue-on devices were viable in obtaining daily spatial and temporal activity data. Our results aid towards alleviating conflict with kangaroos by providing new insights into kangaroo movements and activity within a peri-urban environment and introduces a potential cheap GPS alternative for obtaining this data relative to more expensive collars.

AB  - The urban advancement is always overpowered by the increasing number of vehicles as the need for movement of people and goods. This can lead to traffic problems if there is no effort on the implementation of traffic management and engineering, and traffic law enforcement. In this case, the Government of Surakarta City has implemented various policies and regulations related to traffic management and engineering in order to run traffic in an orderly, safe and comfortable manner according to the applicable law. However, conditions in the field shows that traffic violations still occurred frequently due to the weakness of traffic law enforcement in terms of human resources and the system. In this connection, a tool is needed to support traffic law enforcement, especially in relation to the reporting system of traffic violations. This study aims to develop an Android-based traffic violations reporting application (E-Traffic Law Enforcement) as part of the traffic law enforcement system in Surakarta City. The Android-apps records the location and time of the traffic violations incident along with the visual evidence of the infringement. This information will be connected to the database system to detect offenders and to do the traffic law enforcement process.

AB  - In March 2017, the issue of urban poor housing was exposed on a national scale when thousands of members of the urban poor group Kadamay forcibly occupied nearly 6,000 abandoned housing units meant for members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police in Pandi, Bulacan. Kadamay members were accused of being mendicant anarchists by their critics, while their supporters lauded their determination in demanding, and winning, their rights to housing. While the issue polarized Philippine society, it is evident that the Occupy Pandi movement revitalized urban poor discourse, and brought back to the fore the contradictions between the promises of the city and the prevalence of poverty and lack of opportunity for the majority of its inhabitants, those belonging to the urban poor sector. This paper aims to contribute towards this discussion by attempting to present urban poor mentalities as formulated by the members of the urban poor themselves, and how they have manifested through art. Among the various member organizations of Kadamay is the cultural group Sining Kadamay or SiKad. Initially formed by Kadamay to serve as its cultural arm, SiKad grew into an organization-member of Kadamay. While Sikad has several art programs, this paper will focus on its theater program, the Teatro Mulong Sandoval, and its one-act play Gapok. Set in an urban poor community threatened by poverty and demolition, what makes Gapok unique is its intimacy, not just in content but also in terms of space, as the play was designed to be performed in urban poor communities, and transform its audience from spectators to spectactors. The paper will scrutinize the dynamics of the art production in Gapok, how accurately it reflects the discourses that the urban poor engage in, and the role of the urban poor in (trans) forming art to serve their sector.

AB  - The effectiveness of peer leaders in promoting health may depend on the position they occupy within their social networks. Using sociocentric (whole network) and behavioral data from the intervention arm of a cluster-randomized HIV prevention trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we used generalized linear models with standardized predictors to examine the association between heath leaders' baseline structural network position (i.e., in-degree and betweenness centrality) and their 12-month self-reported (1) confidence in educating network members about HIV and gender-based violence (GBV) and (2) number of past-week conversations about HIV and GBV. As in-degree centrality increased, leaders reported fewer HIV-related conversations. As betweenness centrality increased, leaders reported greater number of conversations about GBV. Network position was not significantly associated with confidence in discussing either topic. Our results suggest that peer leaders who occupy spaces between sub-groups of network members may be more effective in engaging their peers in sensitive or controversial topics like GBV than more popular peer leaders.

AB  - Townsend's big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii townsendii) is a wide-ranging subspecies found throughout the western United States. Of the 5 subspecies currently recognized within C. townsendii, 2 are federally endangered and 2 others are considered species of concern. In California, C. t. townsendii is a species of concern given its loss of habitat and presumed limited dispersal capabilities. Here, we investigated the genetic structure and diversity of a group of maternity colonies across the Inyo-White Mountains in west-central California. Analysis of both nuclear (microsatellite loci) and mitochondrial (D-loop fragment) data show a lack of structure across the study region and significant isolation-by-distance, supporting gene flow among maternity colonies in a stepping stone pattern. The maternity colonies in our sampling region are thus part of 1 genetically healthy, panmictic population. Despite the overall genetic viability of C. t. townsendii in this region, we suggest maintaining the connection between colonies is a crucial step in the management and persistence of the subspecies.

AB  - Station is one of the nodes of transportation of goods or humans that produce a high enough movement in a region, one of which is Kotabaru Station in Malang City which is the largest station in Malang. One of the triggers of traffic congestion that occurred in the city of Malang is a transportation node in the center of the city such as Kotabaru Station.

AB  - A change in the usage of land is influenced by a variety of driving factors and policies on spatial constraints. On the basis of considering the conventional natural and socio-economic indicators, the landscape pattern indicators were considered as new driving forces in the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent (CLUE-S) model to simulate spatial and temporal changes of land-use in Beijing. Compared with traditional spatial restrictions characterized by small and isolated areas, such as forest parks and natural reserves, the ecological redline areas increase the spatial integrity and connectivity of ecological and environmental functions at a regional scale, which were used to analyze the distribution patterns and behaviors of land use conversion in the CLUE-S model. The observed results indicate that each simulation scenario has a Kappa coefficient of more than 0.76 beyond the threshold value of 0.6 and represents high agreements between the actual and simulated land use maps. The simulation scenarios including landscape pattern indicators are more accurate than those without consideration of these new driving forces. The simulation results from using ecological redline areas as space constraints have the highest precision compared with the unrestricted and traditionally restricted scenarios. Therefore, the CLUE-S model based on the restriction of ecological redline and the consideration of landscape pattern factors has shown better effectiveness in simulating the future land use change. The conversion of land use types mainly occurred between construction land and cropland during the period from 2010 to 2020. Meanwhile, a large number of grasslands are being changed to construction lands in the mountain towns of northwest Beijing and large quantities of water bodies have disappeared and been replaced by construction lands due to rapid urbanization in the eastern and southern plains. To improve the sustainable use of land resources, it is necessary to adopt the construction and development mode of satellite towns rather than encouraging a disorderly expansion of downtown areas.

AB  - This article explores activism, education, and the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Using critical race theory (CRT), I analyze what this emergence of primarily youth-led activism means in the context of decades of neoliberal education reform. I raise specific questions about how youth-led activism, which has its genesis in and is largely shaped by social media, not only reflects limited robust mainstream discourses on race but also a failure of education, particularly schools and districts that serve students of color in under-resourced urban communities, to teach about and contextualize other historical movements for justice and racial equity.

AB  - Policy scholars need to better describe the diversity of actors and interests that forge collective political action through nonformal social networks. The authors find extant theories of collective action to only partially explain such heterogeneity, which is exemplified by the urban protest movements in Hong Kong. A new concept, that of the narrative-network, appears better able to describe movements chiefly characterized by heterogeneity. Instead of simple commonalities among members, a relevant property is the plurivocity of narratives told by members of the coalition. Analyzing ethnographic interviews of members of the movement, the authors illustrate the utility of narrative-network analysis in explaining the complex and multiple motivations behind participation. Narrativity and the shared act of narration, within an inclusive and democratic community, are part of what sustains the movement. The research further develops the theory of the narrative-network, which helps explain the rise of street protest in Hong Kong as an emergent, alternative form of civic engagement.

AB  - Modeling human mobility is a critical task in fields such as urban planning, ecology, and epidemiology. Given the current use of mobile phones, there is an abundance of data that can he used to create models of high reliability. Existing techniques can reveal the macropatterns of crowd movement or analyze the trajectory of a person; however, they typically focus on geographical characteristics. This paper presents a graph-based approach for structuring crowd mobility transition over multiple granularities in the context of social behavior. The key to our approach is an adaptive data representation, the adaptive mobility transition graph (AMTG), which is globally generated from citywide human mobility data by defining the temporal trends of human mobility and the interleaved transitions between different mobility patterns. We describe the design, creation, and manipulation of the AMTG and introduce a visual analysis system that supports the multifaceted exploration of citywide human mobility patterns.

AB  - Background: Intense landscaping often alters the plant composition in urban areas. Knowing which plant species that pollinators are visiting in urban areas is necessary for understanding how landscaping impacts biodiversity and associated ecosystem services The cave nectar bat Eonycieris spelaca is an important pollinator for many plants and is often recorded in human-dominated habitats. Previous studies of the diet of E. spelaea relied on morphological identification of pollen grains found in faeces and on the body of bats and by necessity disregarded other forms of digested plant material present in the faeces (i.e., plant juice and remnants). The main objective of this study was to examine the diet of the nectarivorous bat, E. spelaea, roosting in an urban cave at Batu Caves, Peninsular Malaysia by identifying the plant material present in the faeces of bats using DNA metabarcoding.
   Methods : Faeces were collected under the roost of E. spelaea week from December 2015 to March 2016, Plant DNA was extracted from the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified at ITS2 and rbcL, regions and mass sequenced. The resultant plant operational taxonomic units were searched against NCBI GenBank for identification.
   Results: A total of 55 species of plants were detected from faeces of E. spelaea including Artocarpus heterophyllus, Duabanga grandiflora and Musa spp. which are likely to be important food resources for the cave nectar bat.
   Discussion: Many native plant species that had not been reported in previous dietary studies of E. spelaea were detected in this study including Bauhinia strychnoidea and Urophyllum leucophlaeum, suggesting that E. spelaea remains a crucial pollinator for these Plants even in highly disturbed habitats. The detection of many introduced plant species in the bat faeces indicates that E. spelaea are exploiting them, particularly Xanthosternon chrysanthus, as food resources in urban area. Commercial food crops were detected from all of the faecal samples, suggesting that E. spelaea feed predominantly on the crops particularly jackfruit and banana and play a significant role in pollination of economically important plants. Ferns and figs were also dedected in th faeces of E. spelaea suggesting future research avenues to determine whether the 'specialised nectarivorous' E. spelaea feed opportunistically on other parts of plants.

AB  - Halyomorpha halys is an invasive stink bug pest originating from East Asia. In Europe, it was first detected in Switzerland in 2004. It is now present in thirteen countries, and seems to be spreading throughout the continent. In Italy, where it has been recorded since 2012, other than being an urban nuisance, it is causing severe damage in commercial fruit orchards. An integrated approach, using current and previous observational data in space and time and molecular information, was used to identify the genetic diversity of this pest in Europe, its invasion history, and the potential pathways of entry and diffusion. The analysis of 1175 bp of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase I and II genes (cox1, cox2) led to the identification of twenty previously unknown haplotypes. The European distribution of H. halys is the result of multiple invasions that are still in progress, and, in some cases, it was possible to identify the specific Asian areas of origin. Moreover, secondary invasions could have occurred among European countries by a bridgehead effect. In Italy, the data were more clearly related to their temporal occurrence, allowing for a clearer reading of the patterns of invasion and dispersion. After having successfully established in localized areas, H. halys further expanded its range by an active dispersion process and/or by jump dispersal events due to passive transport. The multiple introductions from different areas of the native range together with the different patterns of diffusion of H. halys, may hamper the pest management strategies for its containment.

AB  - The medically important mosquito, Aedes albopictus is native to Asia and has become a major health concern in most Asian countries including Malaysia. Being recognized as a dengue vector, a clearer understanding of how mosquito populations are geographically connected, may therefore represent a profound yet significant understanding of control strategies. There are no documented reports on the genetic structure of Ae. albopictus populations from different developed settlements inferred from microsatellite DNA markers in Malaysia, particularly in Penang Island (Northern Peninsular Malaysia). Here, we assessed the molecular population genetics of Ae. albopictus in terms of their allelic variation, genetic diversity and population structure. A total of 42 mosquitoes were sampled from Jelutong, Batu Maung and Balik Pulau which represented urban, suburban and rural areas in Penang Island respectively and analysed for polymorphism at six microsatellite loci. All of the microsatellite markers were successfully amplified and were polymorphic, showing low genetic structure among geographic populations (F-ST=0.0362). It is supported with admixture individuals observed in STRUCTURE and FCA and this suggests that high gene flow has been experienced between populations. These findings implicate passive dispersal through human-aided transportation; as a factor shaping the genetic structure of Ae. albopictus populations in Penang Island.

AB  - The robustness of cargo ship transportation networks is essential to the stability of the world trade system. The current research mainly focuses on the coarse-grained, holistic cargo ship transportation network while ignoring the structural diversity of different sub-networks. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of the global cargo ship transportation network based on the most recent Automatic Identification System (AIS) data available. First, we subdivide three typical cargo ship transportation networks (i.e., oil tanker, container ship and bulk carrier) from the original cargo ship transportation network. Then, we design statistical indices based on complex network theory and employ four attack strategies, including random attack and three intentional attacks (i.e., degree-based attack, betweenness- based attack and flux-based attack) to evaluate the robustness of the three typical cargo ship transportation networks. Finally, we compare the integrity of the remaining ports of the network when a small proportion of ports lose their function. The results show that 1) compared with the holistic cargo ship transportation network, the fine-grain-based cargo ship transportation networks can fully reflect the pattern and process of global cargo transportation; 2) different cargo ship networks behave heterogeneously in terms of their robustness, with the container network being the weakest and the bulk carrier network being the strongest; and 3) small-scale intentional attacks may have significant influence on the integrity of the container network but a minor impact on the bulk carrier and oil tanker transportation networks. These conclusions can help improve the decision support capabilities in maritime transportation planning and emergency response and facilitate the establishment of a more reliable maritime transportation system.

AB  - A number of forests in agroforestry environments are at risk due to urban development or agricultural expansion. These forests often consist of patches of wooded areas scattered in the agricultural and urban grid, and often constitute green corridors that enable a flow between animal and plant species (migration corridors). This study evaluates the composition and structure of riparian forests in agroforestry areas that are subject to various natural and anthropogenic disturbances. This study aims to understand the dynamics of these riparian forest populations and evaluate the effects of the disturbances on the tree stands (e.g. floods, partial cutting), while taking into account their development over space and time based on a diachronic assessment from 1945 to 2010. Although these woodlands are subject to various disturbances, a fairly large diversity of tree species can be noted, and the regeneration of the saplings and small trees follows a normal growth curve (asymmetric) with a high contingency of young tree population comparable to a typical reverse-J distribution. However, lower densities are observed for riparian stands subject to frequent flooding, which could over time compromise recruitment and forest regeneration for some tree species (e.g. woody plants with weak adaptive strategies). The multivariate analyses (Redundancy Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis) conducted over all the soil, environmental and forest data reveal that some variables are more strongly related to the composition of the forest populations, including pH, ground litter and soil drainage. However, these variables must still be considered as being part of a set of interacting soil conditions. Lastly, the future of these woodlands may appear uncertain because there are no government policies or measures to ensure their protection and preservation.

AB  - At this time, public transport is something that cannot be separated from everyone. Public vehicles that have very important components, as well as in development, as well as the center of the economic movement in the city. One of the most effective and efficient public facilities is motorcycle taxi. Ojek people by residents in big cities because of its advantages, that is faster and can pass through the congestion in the city. Usually a motorcycle taxi is available at a crowded intersection, or in a residential area entrance. The more rapid technology of the era, making a lot of people used to innovate, one of which is the use of Internet technology in the field of transportation. Indonesia has an online service that allows candidates not to come to an ojek base. Potential passengers simply order motorcycles from an app on a smartphone, and the motorcycle taxi will come pick up. However, in its development often occurs friction between online transport with conventional transportation. In this journal will be discussed various things that also provide an overview and advantages of each mode of transportation.

AB  - Species are expected to shift their distributions in response to global environmental changes and additional protected areas are needed to encompass the corresponding changes in the distributions of their habitats. Conservation policies are likely to become obsolete unless they integrate the potential impacts of climate and land-use change on biodiversity.
   We identify conservation priority areas for current and future projected distributions of Iberian bird species. We then investigate the extent to which global change informed priority areas are: (i) covered by existing protected area networks (national protected areas and Natura 2000); (ii) threatened by agricultural or urban land-use changes.
   We use outputs of species distributions models fitted with climatic data as inputs in spatial prioritization tools to identify conservation priority areas for 168 bird species. We use projections of land-use change to then discriminate between threatened and non-threatened priority areas.
   19% of the priority areas for birds are covered by national protected areas and 23% are covered by Natura 2000 sites. The spatial mismatch between protected area networks and priority areas for birds is projected to increase with climate change. But there are opportunities to improve the protection of birds under climate change, as half of the priority areas are currently neither protected nor in conflict with urban or agricultural land-uses.
   We identify critical areas for bird conservation both under current and climate change conditions, and propose that they could guide the establishment of new conservation areas across the Iberian Peninsula complementing existing protected areas.

AB  - Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) combines modeling and analysis used to investigate the structure, function, and evolution of ecosystems and other complex systems. ENA is applied to network models that trace the movement of thermodynamically conserved energy or matter through the system. Investigators use ENA to answer a range of questions such as the following. What is the impact of fishing on the marine food web? Which species control the flux of nitrogen in an estuary? What is the ecological relationship among species in the food web when direct and indirect influences are considered? Would a proposed regulation make a city more sustainable? The field has grown since its inception in the 1970s, but it has rarely been systematically reviewed. This absence of reviews likely hinders the development of the field as a whole, obscures the diversity of its applications, and makes it difficult for new investigators to learn, develop, and apply the techniques. The objective of the work presented in this paper was to systematically review ENA research published in 2010 through 2016 to (1) identify the topic diversity, (2) expose methodological development, (3) highlight applications, and (4) assess collaboration among ENA scholars. To accomplish this, we used a combination of bibliometric, network (e.g., social network), and feature analyses. Our search identified 186 records. A topic network built from the bibliographic records revealed eight major topic clusters. The largest groups centered on food webs, urban metabolism, and ecosystem theory. Co-author analysis identified 387 authors in a collaboration network with eight larger components. The largest component contained 56% of the authors. This review shows ENA to be a topically diverse and collaborative science domain, and suggests opportunities to further develop ENA to better address issues in theoretical ecology and for environmental impact assessment and management.

AB  - The number of researches related to ecosystem functions and services has increased almost exponentially in the last decades, which indicates the importance that the scientific community has given to the recognition of the maintenance of the ecosystem base in meeting the demands of society. In the terrestrial portion of coastal zones, these demands usually fail on the supply of space for tourism, urban, port, agricultural, aquaculture, forestry, livestock and mining, among others. The increasing conversion of habitats to such uses has been pointed out as the greatest threat to these ecosystems. The first challenge to a sustainable territorial occupation is therefore to understand the ecosystem functions present in a given region, to identify the more or less sensitive areas for the development of different human activities, and to shape them into a process of Economic Ecological Zoning (ZEE, in Portuguese). To do so, a selection of appropriate indicators is needed to summarize the high complexity and connectivity of ecosystems in a simple and understandable model. This study, developed in Lagoa dos Patos Island Barrier, in the middle segment of the coastal plain of Rio Grande do Sul state, presents a methodological proposal for spatial planning in coastal zones, based on the identification and maintenance of ecosystem functions and services. As a result, three classes of use were defined for a region in order to maintain its structural and functional properties, called Environmental Preservation Zones, Conservation Zones and Development Zones. Since the quaternary genesis of this island barrier is associated to the same physical processes that acted in the formation of the coastal plain of Rio Grande do Sul, it is proposed to apply this method in all the extension of this coastal plain, as already done in the municipality of Rio Grande, on margins of the Lagos dos Patos estuary.

AB  - Most road accidents occur in urban areas and notably at urban intersections, where cyclists and motorcyclists are the most vulnerable. In the last few years, cycling mobility has been growing; therefore, bike infrastructures should be designed to encourage this type of mobility and reduce motorized and/or private transport. The paper presents a study to implement a new cycle path in the existing cycle and road network in Rome, Italy. The geometric design of the new path complies with Italian standards regarding the technical characteristics of bicycle paths, while the Highway Capacity Manual has been considered for the traffic analysis. In particular, a before-after approach has been adopted to examine and compare the traffic flow at more complex and congested intersections where the cycle path will pass. Trams, buses, cars, bikes and pedestrians were the traffic components considered in each analysis. The software package PTV VISSIM 8 allowed the simulations of traffic flows at traffic-light intersections; an original linear process has been proposed to model dynamic intelligent traffic controls, which are not admitted by the software used. The traffic analysis allowed the identification of the best option for each of the five examined intersections. Particularly, the maximum queue length value and the total number of passed vehicles have been considered in order to optimize the transport planning process. The results of this study highlight the importance of providing engineered solutions when a cycle path is implemented in a complex road network, in order to avoid negative impacts on the citizens and maximize the expected advantages.

AB  - Estimation of passenger car unit (PCU) is a vital component of any traffic study conducted in developing countries owing to the heterogeneity in the vehicular traffic. Past studies on PCU factors are majorly limited to intercity and urban roads. However, PCU factors for different types of vehicles on unsignalized intersections have not been investigated so well. This paper presents three methods of estimating PCU factors for different types of vehicles on unsignalized intersections under highly heterogeneous traffic conditions. The first method is based on the occupancy time of a vehicle while clearing the intersection. The second method is based on the capacity of a priority movement estimated in terms of different vehicle categories. Queue clearance rate is used as the basis for PCU estimation in the third method. Data were collected at two unsignalized intersection in semi-urban area of two cities of India and PCU for different types of vehicles is determined using the three methods. The resulting values of PCU factors were found to be logical and are representatives of the actual field conditions.

AB  - Hindustani art music in the metropolis of Bombay/Mumbai played a significant role in the fashioning of both selves and public spaces from the late nineteenth century to the 1960s. With the fall of Awadh in northern India in 1857 and the dispersal of the court that had inherited Hindustani music from the Mughal empire, the singers, instrumentalists and dancers began to migrate in search of new patrons. Many of them found a foothold in Bombay, which came to occupy a central position in assembling the new structures and spaces of performance, pedagogy, recording and consumption of Hindustani music. I suggest that the passion for Hindustani music was strongly linked to the linguistic diversity of Bombay, and that it was the lingua musica which aided the development of the public domain and its cultural vernacular in the twentieth century. Through their musicophilia, the city's inhabitants engaged in fashioning a subjectivity that emerged through that which they shared.

AB  - In the mid-1990s, the grassroots movement Muungano wa Wanavijiji emerged from Nairobi's many slums aiming to resist forced evictions by the Kenyan government. Muungano confronted a nexus of politicians, government administrators and elites all seeking to acquire city land occupied by informal settlements - and in doing so challenged antipathetic attitudes to informality. Joining global advocacy, Muungano has pushed locally for recognition of slums as human settlements, later designing models for upgrading living conditions. Throughout this evolution, the Kenyan state has been the single most prominent precipitant for the strategies Muungano has employed. This paper describes the correlations between a social movement and the state, set within broader changes in state-civil society relations in Kenya. In doing so it seeks to bring out the complexity of a relationship that has varied from conflict to contestation, partnership to collaboration, and separate but parallel efforts to address common issues.

AB  - The preponderance of connected devices provides unprecedented opportunities for fine-grained monitoring of the public infrastructure. However while classical models expect high quality application-specific data streams, the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) is that of an abundance of disparate and noisy datasets from connected devices. In this context, we consider the problem of estimation of the level of service of a city-wide public transport network. We first propose a robust unsupervised model for train movement inference from wifi traces, via the application of robust clustering methods to a one dimensional spatio-temporal setting. We then explore the extent to which the demand-supply gap can be estimated from connected devices. We propose a classification model of real-time commuter patterns, including both a batch training phase and an online learning component. We describe our deployment architecture and assess our system accuracy on a large-scale anonymized dataset comprising more than 10 billion records.

AB  - Roadside plantings along urban and rural road corridors are designed to create visual effects as well as to provide functional benefits such as shading, screening or routing. Considering their potential for daily public use, roads and road corridors, as significant visual impact centers, can attract people's attention and affect their points of view. Poplar species, which grow rapidly and easily along road corridors and can adapt to different ecological conditions swiftly, are used widely in both urban and rural landscapes in Turkey. The main objective of this study was to determine the visual structures dependent on the mad-plant relationships of the poplar compositions that play an important role in shaping the roadside landscapes. For this purpose, compositions of poplar trees in selected urban and rural road corridors throughout Turkey were photographed and visual analysis techniques (VATS) were applied to determine visual preferences. Participants (n= 35) were shown 30 photographs, selected from the nearly 1000 taken, of road corridor poplar plantings and their evaluations were recorded in a questionnaire. In this survey, the people were requested to evaluate their appreciation levels towards the plantings as well as to express their other visual preferences and to assess visual quality. In addition, the association of all these evaluations with the demographic characteristics of the participants were determined. A correlation analysis was then performed to identify the relationships among all the visual assessments and a cluster analysis was conducted according to the visual status of the photographs in order to determine their groups. In the results of the study, the poplar trees, either individually or in the form of compositions, were reported to have a significant visual diversity. Moreover, the cluster analysis found the resulting three groups to be associated with leaf density, seasonal conditions and the trees as individuals or in groups. The seasonal variation factor in particular was shown to be visually effective in the poplar compositions. It was determined that visual perception of the poplar plantations differed in accordance with the demographic differences. This work established that poplar plantations as single trees or in groups and their proximity to the road altered visual preferences, and consequently, some suggestions were made concerning the use of poplars in roadside landscape planning.

AB  - The trans movement in mainland China is at its early stages and rapidly growing. Particularly in the past two years, there has been a strong rise in trans activism and advocacy. There have been more trans individuals willing to be publicly visible, and more efforts are being made within the larger LGB community to support the articulation of trans communities. In December 2016, a two-day conference with trans activists and advocates was held in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo, aiming at not only facilitating exchange to support participants' work but also initiating a community-based consultation to map out the current situation of trans people across the country. This article seeks to present the qualitative information gathered during the event in regard to the communities' most pressing needs in order to provide an informed direction for the trans movement in the country.

AB  - With everything seeming to go global and digital, how can architecture retain a healthily humanist perspective? Having identified four waves of globalisation since the 1980s, Brian McGrath, Professor of Urban Design at New York's Parsons School of Design, explores how architects from the US to Southeast Asia have recently been addressing their various challenges by evolving a new localism - whether through acknowledging typomorphological rules of place, using portable architecture to lighten impact, supporting creative local entrepreneurship, or taking a political stance.

AB  - Seed libraries (SLs) are institutions that support the creation of semi-formal seed systems, but are often intended to address larger issues that are part of the "food movement" in the global north. Over 100 SLs are reported present in California. I describe a functional framework for studying and comparing seed systems, and use that to investigate the social and biological characteristics of California SLs in 2016 and how they are contributing to alternative seed systems based on interviews with 45 SL managers. At a minimum, SLs function as new seed distribution institutions founded and overseen by dedicated, values-driven individuals and groups with goals including education, seed access, local adaptation, biodiversity conservation, community-building, and human health. Annually about 4776 people borrow seeds from, and 238 people return seeds to the SLs in this study, that operate through over 17,000 hours of work/year. These SLs distribute approximately 6456 packets of seed annually, mostly of commercial seeds from small seed companies, but some SLs emphasize local and culturally meaningful seeds. The significance of a 6% seed return rate depends on SL goals and can be investigated once appropriate indicators for those goals are identified and documented. Beyond distribution, the seed system functions accomplished by SLs differ, and all can have consequences for the processes shaping the diversity and adaptation of their crops. The SLs engaged in seed system functions beyond distribution are new forms of socially-motivated community science, poised to develop biological and social innovations reflecting their values and interests.

AB  - Anthropogenic changes, including road network, have strongly influenced biodiversity of Europe. For the past 100 years road networks have become a conspicuous part of European landscape and strongly affected environment and human well-being, including effect by noise. To reduce impact of noise the special barriers (mainly transparent) are installed along a road. Annually thousands of birds die in collision with glass and acrylic screens, and these are important causes of avian mortality. Here we report about and describe how to prevent the lethal hazards that clear and acrylic (plastic) noise barriers along an urban road in eastern Poland pose to birds. A total of 114 fatal strikes representing 26 species were documented along transparent noise barriers. In unmodified sections in both study periods (2012/2013 and 2013/2014) we observed differences in number of fatalities between the seasons, the dead birds were found mostly in the summer, less in the spring and autumn and fewest in winter, but no differences were found between study periods (2012/2013 v. 2013/2014). These result we treat as base line or control data and compare them to experimental modification of the same barriers. After applying a film consisting of horizontal black thick stripes the number of fatal strikes decreased significantly. The average number of fatalities decreased from 1.02 to 0.06 ind./km for all panels of all sections combined and the number of species killed decreased from 19 in unmodified to 4 in modified sections. We highly recommend this effective and inexpensive application as a responsible public utility measure to protect bird life found near roads.

AB  - Background: Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii. This bacterium survives harsh conditions and attaches to dust, suggesting environmental dispersal is a risk factor for outbreaks. Spatial epidemiology studies collating evidence on Q fever geographical contamination gradients are needed, as human cases without occupational exposure are increasing worldwide.
   Methods: We used a systematic literature search to assess the role of distance from ruminant holdings as a risk factor for human Q fever outbreaks. We also collated evidence for other putative drivers of C. burnetii geographical dispersal.
   Results: In all documented outbreaks, infective sheep or goats, not cattle, was the likely source. Evidence suggests a prominent role of airborne dispersal; Coxiella burnetii travels up to 18 km on gale force winds. In rural areas, highest infection risk occurs within 5 km of sources. Urban outbreaks generally occur over smaller distances, though evidence on attack rate gradients is limited. Wind speed / direction, spreading of animal products, and stocking density may all contribute to C. burnetii environmental gradients.
   Conclusions: Q fever environmental gradients depend on urbanization level, ruminant species, stocking density and wind speed. While more research is needed, evidence suggests that residential exclusion zones around holdings may be inadequate to contain this zoonotic disease, and should be species-specific.

AB  - In August 2014, an early-detection program discovered a new infestation of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in Christmas Lake, a small (1.072 km(2)) lake near the Twin Cities, Minnesota. Initial surveys suggested a small introduction localized near a public boat access, prompting a rapid response from local and state partners. In 2014-2015, 7 treatments (areas from 243 m(2) to 41,000 m(2)) were made with 3 different molluscicides (Zequanox, EarthTec QZ, potash); each used in few prior efforts in open waters. Toxicity bioassays (mussels caged on site and in aquaria) were used to help guide treatments. Intensive SCUBA belt transect and settlement sampler surveys up to one year post-treatment showed that of the similar to 5500 mussels in the first treatment area (and 10 found just outside it in May 2015), no survivors were recovered. Yet despite rapid coordinated response, in October 2016, 16 mussels were found on structures removed from untreated sites across the lake. The range of shell lengths suggested a remnant population whose larvae had dispersed and settled in scattered locations, and/or dispersal of juveniles from the infestation site. Lessons from this 1 yr eradication attempt highlight the challenges with partial-lake treatments: locating mussels at low densities, containing them within treatment areas large enough given detection uncertainty, and maintaining lethal molluscicide concentrations. Nevertheless, new understanding of these issues, and experience with toxicity and dosing protocols will advise future work. This case study demonstrates the importance of early detection, immediate responses, post-treatment monitoring, and effective cooperation among partners.

AB  - Developing a sociopreneurial (social-entrepreneurship) ecosystem is a substantial long-term investment. Much like natural ecosystems, there are a multitude of support systems needed to maintain balance and diversity in sociopreneurial ecosystems and their interactions are complex in nature. Yet, the various bene fits that arise from such ecosystems make them a worthwhile investment. Examples of this come from global universities and private companies who have succeeded in creating hubs of innovation and creativity in different cities around the world. These hubs have achieved commendable results and produced quality initiatives. Yet, there is little success beyond the walls of cities, especially in low income communities. Typically, Bottom of Pyramid (BoP) Entrepreneurs must either move to cities to make their entrepreneurial ambitions come true or settle for small business status. This is especially troubling given that their communities are often the ones that need their skills most. The article begins by discussing the concept of Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP) society. It argues that in the context of the knowledge era and the rise of the network society, the BoP is better named "the outer network society". Using Industrial Engineering principles and systems thinking, the researcher designed a product range and upliftment model (collectively known as the ModulaRISE) that helps resolve most of the structural issues with developing a sustainable sociopreneurial ecosystem. The ModulaRISE model provides three core support structures that can assist in reversing this unfortunate brain drain: Education, Operation and Finance. Moreover, an overarching concern resolved with the model is the tiered system that helps bridge cognitive challenges of being exposed to Industry 4.0 futuristic technologies without the proper incentivized build up. The model has already been launched on a small scale with preliminary case studies showing significant promise. The vision is to develop a fully turnkey upliftment in a box model for BoP communities which connects them to the world and allows them to collaborate to mutually enrich their society and the global society. In concluding, it is discussed that since the majority of society (80%) lives in the outer network, it is fundamental for Industrial Engineers to help design new systems that connect these societies to resources (in the broadest sense) that can help them develop socio-economically and cognitively to be able integrate to the global network society.

AB  - To effectively manage multiple biological invasions, information on their distributions must be generated rapidly and over large spatial scales. Using public surveys in a false-positive occupancy framework, we reliably estimate the distributions of three synanthropic invasive species on the Andaman Islands.

AB  - Bufo japonicus formosus (Eastern-Japanese common toad) is endemic to Eastern Japan. As with many Japanese amphibians, little is known about its terrestrial life, especially during the nonbreeding season. This species persists even in highly disturbed urban areas where many other amphibian species have already been extirpated. An understanding of how such species use habitats within remnant landscapes may help to inform management strategies for the conservation of urban ecosystems. We examined the nightly movement patterns, distance traveled, movement range, and microhabitat selection of non-breeding adult B.j. formosus at an urbanized site, using fluorescent powder tracking. We evaluated the usefulness of this tracking method through this survey. We found that the nightly distances traveled by these toads varied greatly among individuals and nights. No sexual differences in movement pattern, distance traveled, and movement range were detected. However, body size significantly affected distance traveled and movement range. We found that toads tended to use areas covered with grasses and mosses more frequently than expected, and to avoid paved areas. Fluorescent powder tracking was effective for the elucidation of movement patterns and habitat selection of amphibians. Our results provide useful information for the conservation of amphibians, especially for species inhabiting urbanized areas.

TI  - Diverse political identities within a working class presence: Revisiting Red Clydeside
T2  - POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
LA  - English
KW  - ASSEMBLAGES
AB  - This paper revisits the histories of Red Clydeside to foreground a diversity of political identities. The paper argues that this diversity is crucial to defining the working class presence found within the West of Scotland during the early twentieth century. By approaching this period through the historical lives of three activists, the paper illuminates the intersecting contributions of traditions such as anarchism, the suffrage movement, communism, and parliamentary activism. The breadth offered by this approach asserts the continued importance of a much-celebrated labour history but also links to ongoing debates within historical, political and labour geography. The paper argues for the inclusion of diverse, yet intersecting, political positions within an account of radical cultures by returning to E.P. Thompson's notion of 'working class presence'. This notion of presence has geographical resonance and is developed here alongside understandings of assemblage, topology and thrown togetherness, to foreground an attentiveness to diversity within place-based politics and spatial connections. The paper utilises this lens to illuminate factors often downplayed in the characterisation of urban memory and to argue for greater diversity in approaches to such political and social histories.

AB  - This paper addresses two major and potentially conflicting movements: the importance of diversity as both a conceptual and political issue and the rise of the evidence-based practice movement in education. This tension is particularly important when evaluating and reporting universal interventions because of their intended applicability across diverse groups of children and adolescents. This study contributes to this discussion through an analysis of published school-based universal social and emotional learning (SEL) intervention evaluations in terms of their theoretical and empirical attention to student diversity characteristics. We defined student diversity in terms of five characteristics: gender, race/ethnicity, SES, disability status, and sexual orientation/gender identity. We assessed how and when demographic characteristics were reported, how these characteristics were analyzed as moderators of program outcomes, and how differential effects based on diversity were incorporated into reported intervention generalizability discussions. Results showed that diversity characteristics were inconsistently reported across articles. Most studies did not test for moderating effects, but those that did found inconsistent effects across diversity characteristics. Further, conceptual and/or empirical support for conducting the moderation analyses was often not provided or sufficiently supported by previous literature or a hypothesis. This research highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of how SEL program effects may be moderated by student demographic characteristics and suggests caution about the generalizability of the reviewed SEL programs across diverse groups of children and adolescents.

AB  - Smart traffic is one of the key pillars of a smart city infrastructure. In the near future, more and more automated shipping systems are going to be used, eliminating the human factor as a possible source of error. In other words, safe operation of automated systems is one of the most important tasks. The direct supply of smart cities and their industrial facilities is best served by road and rail freight and passenger transport. The spreading of laws and automated systems reduces the number of accidents, but it does not completely eliminate it. With regard to the railway disasters that have occurred in recent years, we have observed that the time between the accident and the start of the rescuing process and repair is one of the most important factors for a successful operation. The localization of railway accidents is often difficult or time-consuming due to field conditions. This time can be greatly reduced by a drastic system that helps the work of disaster relief agencies and conscripts. Trolleys and tankers are nowadays equipped with an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) transponder to keep track of shipment movement. In this article we investigate what kind of assistance could a drone equipped with RFID reader and navigation infrastructure provide in case of a traffic accident or a disaster situation, with particular regard to the dangerous goods transported on a fixed track. The goal is to develop the application of a modern and innovative technology that can make a smart city more secure.

AB  - Cystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by E granulosus is a serious helminthic zoonosis in humans, livestock and wildlife. Xinjiang is one of high endemic province for CE in China. A total of 55 sheep and cattle livers containing echinococcal cysts were collected from slaughterhouses in Changji and Yining City, northern region of Xinjiang. PCR was employed for cloning 2 gene fragments, 12S rRNA and C01 for analysis of phylogenetic diversity of E. granulosus. The results showed that all the samples collected were identified as G1 genotype of E. granulosus. Interestingly, YL5 and CJ75 strains were the older branches compared to those strains from France, Argentina, Australia. COI gene fragment showed 20 new genotype haploids and 5 new genotype haplogroups (H1-H5) by the analysis of Network 5.0 software, and the YLY17 strain was identified as the most ancestral haplotype. The major haplotypes, such as CJ75 and YL5 strains, showed identical to the isolates from Middle East. The international and domestic trade of livestock might contribute to the dispersal of different haplotypes for E. granulosus evolution.

AB  - Signs and symptoms of a disease similar to those of armillaria root rot have recently been observed on various native woody plants on the foothills of TableMountain in South Africa, one of the most botanically diverse natural environments globally. This is of concern because the root rot fungus Armillaria mellea has previously been shown to be an alien pathogen of European origin in planted gardens in the City of Cape Town. An aim of this study was to identify the cause of the root rot disease on infected plants. Based on DNA-sequence phylogeny, it was shown that isolates collected from at least 16 native tree and woody shrub species represented the non-native A.mellea. Microsatellite markers were then used to determine the genetic diversity and population structure of the A.mellea isolates from TableMountain and two planted gardens where the pathogen has previously been found. Population genetic analyses revealed low levels of gene diversity and no population differentiation amongst the three populations. The results provide the first firm evidence that A.mellea has escaped the planted environment and invaded a sensitive and ecologically important natural woody environment in South Africa. This is only the second definitive case of a non-native tree pathogen invading a natural ecosystem in the country.

AB  - Shallow-founded structures on liquefiable deposits are often rendered unserviceable due to excessive settlement and rotation incurred during earthquakes. Recent research has exposed the mechanisms by which large strains occur in liquefied soils, leading to foundation's excessive settlement and rotation. The development of these mechanisms may be retarded with appropriate mitigation. Prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) are a popular and economical mitigation measure, which have been shown to limit permanent structural settlement and tilt. However, while the popularity of these drains continues to grow, there are concerns regarding their usage in dense urban environments. This paper compares the performance during centrifuge tests of an isolated 3-story model structure, an identical structure mitigated with a network of PVDs, and a pair of dissimilar structures separated by 3 m, with and without PVDs around the smaller structure. Results show that PVDs should be designed with great caution in dense urban environments, due to their potentially negative impact on the performance of adjacent unmitigated structures.

AB  - Aim
   To develop an approach to model the spatial dynamics of emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in European Russia. This tree-killing pest was detected in Moscow 15years ago and began to spread, posing a threat to ashes all over Europe. The aim was to determine its probable current range and to evaluate the probability of its dispersal to neighboring countries within the next 5years.
   LocationMethodsCities and transport hubs of European Russia and neighboring countries. Ash trees in this region occur mainly in urban plantations and along highways.
   Pairwise distances between all locations were used as the main parameter determining the probability of pest spread. For each location, the probability of detection of A.planipennis was calculated using three simulation recurrent models of long-distance dispersal. Parametrization was made by comparison with results of surveys in 2003-2015. Field data on the range of A.planipennis in 2016-2017 were mapped and used for model verification. A prognosis of spread of the pest by 2022 was made.
   ResultsMain conclusionsA model based on fat-tailed kernel corresponds to both negative and positive results of surveys. According to the model, the current range is likely to be restricted to Russia, but probability of detection of the pest in the east of Belarus, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania by 2022 is 15%-40%.
   The forestry services of neighboring countries probably have about 5years to prepare for the invasion of this pest, but regular surveys are necessary, since the pest can appear at any time. The case considered shows that the simple approach based on a fat-tailed kernel and just one parameterpairwise distance between citiescan be used for modeling long-distance dispersal of alien pests of urban plantations.

AB  - During the 13th century the Czech state became a major power, significantly influencing the political situation in Central Europe. Alongside with the increasing positions of power of the Czech state, important changes also occurred in the interior of the country. Remarkable economic development led to a process of urbanization throughout the country's territory. Concurrently in the wider European region similar political, social and economic changes favored analogous developments, including a new intellectual movement reviving the ancient Greek natural philosophy, including astronomy. It is certain that this fact did not leave unaffected the architectural thought and creativity of the era. The present paper studies the orientation of fifteen of these new Czech towns, developed in the late 13th century, for a possible astronomical connection.

AB  - This study focuses on household disaster preparedness in New York City (NYC) prior to Superstorm Sandy occurrence on October 25, 2012. The purpose of our analysis is to explain the level and patterns of disaster preparedness before a relatively rare natural disaster event occurred and to investigate the factors that influenced the capacity of NYC households to prepare for emergencies and disasters. A random telephone (RDD) survey comprised of 2001 NYC residents across all five boroughs was conducted by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and completed before Sandy struck the City. These data were explored using frequencies, cross-tabs, and factor analysis to build a path model of household disaster preparedness. Findings indicate that household disaster preparedness levels in NYC are high, especially regarding the acquisition of emergency supplies and communication resources. A trust in local government and assistance from one's social network are the strongest predictors of general household preparedness. Exogenous variables in our model - low income households and those with functional and access needs residents - will be more vulnerable during an actual disaster since they are less able to access communication technologies to search for self-protective disaster information and to communicate their needs during an emergency.

AB  - Landscape-scale approaches to assessing the impact of land-use change on species' persistence are necessary because species depend on processes acting at varying scales, yet existing approaches to ecological impact assessment tend only to be site-based. A further major criticism of current ecological impact assessments is that they tend to be qualitative. Here we develop methods that apply the Incidence Function Model (IFM) in real urban planning contexts, by generating repeatable and comparable quantitative measures of ecological impacts. To demonstrate the methods for a case study (Nottingham, UK), we estimated landscape-scale measures of species' persistence that indicate metapopulation viability. We based these on Nottingham's landscape when urban developments were recently proposed, then adjust the land cover to include the proposed developments, and also for two projected landscapes where 10% and 20% of the original natural or semi-natural land cover is lost. We find that the IFM shows promise as a tool for quantitative landscape-scale ecological impact assessment, depending on the size of the impact. We detected minimal differences in the species' viability measures between the original and post -development landscapes. This suggests that for small (around 2%) cumulative losses ofnatural/semi-natural space, current site-based approaches are sufficient. However, when the cumulative effect of continued development was modelled by increasing the losses of natural/semi-natural land cover to 10-20% of existing cover, the impact on many of the species studied was more substantial. This indicates that a landscape scale approach is necessary for larger, prolonged and cumulative habitat losses.

AB  - Aim
   The ability to quantitatively measure the continuum of macroscale patterns of species invasion is a first step toward deeper understanding of their causal factors. We took advantage of two centuries worth of herbarium data, to evaluate a set of metrics to measure macroscale patterns, allowing cross-species comparisons of invasive expansion across large geographic areas.
   Methods
   We used herbarium specimens to reconstruct county-level invasion histories for two non-native plants (Alliaria petiolata and Lonicera japonica), with distinct spatiotemporal distribution patterns over the past two centuries. Using county centroids from species' initial occurrences, we quantified point pattern metrics from multiple disciplines (e.g. urban crime analysis, landscape ecology etc.) that are historically used at smaller spatial scales, to evaluate their ability to detect macroscale spatial diffusion and amount of directional expansion. Metrics were further assessed for their ease of use, data requirements, independence from other metrics and intuitiveness of interpretation.
   Important Findings
   We identified four suitable metrics for distinguishing differences in spatial patterns: (i) standard distance, (ii) number of patches, (iii) Euclidean nearest neighbor summary class statistic coefficient of variation and (iv) mean center that when applied to county-level presence data allowed us to determine the directions by which distributions expanded and if distributions increased via outward expansion, infilling and/or jump dispersal events. These metrics when compared during the same invasion phase are capable of quantifying macroscale variability among species in their distributional and dispersal patterns. Being able to quantify differences among species in these patterns is important in understanding the drivers of species dispersal patterns. These metrics therefore represent a simple yet thorough toolset for achieving this goal.

AB  - The domestication and time of arrival of bananas in South Asia and Africa are unresolved issues. We provide banana seed and leaf phytolith evidence from the archaeological sequence at Fahien Rock Shelter, south-west Sri Lanka, to help understand the geographical configuration of hybridization, dispersal, cultural association and chronology of banana domestication. Phytolith evidence indicates that Musa accuminata subspecies and M. balbisiana existed in the south-western lowland rainforest of Sri Lanka from 44952-47854 to 3845-3985 cal a BP. Rock Shelter occupants exploited those taxa for starchy food. Edible diploid bananas may have been introduced from Indonesia or Papua New Guinea before 5994-6194 cal a BP. From this time onwards, phytoliths morphologically identical to those from triploid banana cultivars appeared in the lowland rainforest of Sri Lanka. This precocity appears unique to Sri Lanka. Dispersal of these triploids to the east coast of Africa may have followed maritime trade networks in the Indian Ocean from the first half of the sixth millennium BP. Northward dispersal, e.g. to urban Harappan sites, occurred in the middle of the fifth millennium BP. This discovery shows the interconnection of prehistoric cultures and their engagement with the management of starchy staples in the lowland rainforests of Sri Lanka.

AB  - Invasive species exert a serious impact on native fauna and flora and have been the target of many eradication and management efforts worldwide. However, a lack of data on population structure and history, exacerbated by the recency of many species introductions, limits the efficiency with which such species can be kept at bay. In this study we generated a novel genome of high assembly quality and genotyped 4735 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers from 78 individuals of an invasive population of the Javan Myna Acridotheres javanicus across the island of Singapore. We inferred limited population subdivision at a micro-geographic level, a genetic patch size (similar to 13-14 km) indicative of a pronounced dispersal ability, and barely an increase in effective population size since introduction despite an increase of four to five orders of magnitude in actual population size, suggesting that low population-genetic diversity following a bottleneck has not impeded establishment success. Landscape genomic analyses identified urban features, such as low-rise neighborhoods, that constitute pronounced barriers to gene flow. Based on our data, we consider an approach targeting the complete eradication of Javan Mynas across Singapore to be unfeasible. Instead, a mixed approach of localized mitigation measures taking into account urban geographic features and planning policy may be the most promising avenue to reducing the adverse impacts of this urban pest. Our study demonstrates how genomic methods can directly inform the management and control of invasive species, even in geographically limited datasets with high gene flow rates.

AB  - The small brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus Fallen, is a major migratory pest from China to Korea and transmits viral diseases of rice plants. In this study, we compared the genetic structures of overwintered indigenous Korean and Chinese populations. The eight Korean populations consisted of 33 haplotypes, and 16 of these were newly identified. The genetic diversity of the Korean population revealed high haplotype diversity (Hd) and low nucleotide diversity (pi) of 0.86 +/- 0.017 and 0.0024 +/- 0.0001 on average, respectively. These values for the Chinese population were Hd = 0.92 +/- 0.016 and n = 0.0026 +/- 0.0002. Overall, genetic distances by pairwise F-ST were generally low, ranging from -0.022 to 0.089. Moreover, the Korean population revealed its ongoing population expansion by showing negative values in the neutrality test (Tajima's D = -1.4, Fu's Fs = -15.8) and a unimodal pattern in the mismatch distribution analysis. The genetic structures and population relationships were determined using 8 indigenous Korean and 30 Chinese populations by Bayesian approaches and population tree construction, respectively. The genetic structure was inferred as five (K = 5), and all indigenous Korean populations as well as 10 Chinese populations from the Shanghai city, Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang provinces were grouped into 'G3'. These results provide partial support for unidirectional gene flow by migratory Chinese populations into Korea. Further analysis conducted using specimens from China and Korea collected in similar periods is necessary to clarify the migration population's origin and its effect on the genetic structure of the indigenous populations.

AB  - Urban gardening has become a growing international movement. Many urban gardens are established, organized, and managed collectively as commons. Particularly in developed countries, these community gardens (a subset of urban gardens) emerge not only in response to a lack of locally produced food, but also in response to a lack of democratic use of public spaces or missing opportunities and time for socializing. They then give rise to social networks that fulfil various social functions. Although community gardens are often listed as examples of commons, they have thus far lacked closer scientific examination. Hence, we present criteria to explore and categorize community gardens as commons by their degree of collectivity. This is based on five components: resource system, infrastructure, resource units, work, social time. We classify these criteria further according to various styles of use, ranging from individual use to sharing. To demonstrate the utility of this model we implement a quantitative study of community gardens located in one of the most urbanized area in Germany, the Rhine-Ruhr Agglomeration. Our results show a high diversity of collective use and the importance of sharing immaterial components in sustaining community gardens, notably social values. We can empirically demonstrate that gardeners develop diverse ways of collective action and social interaction to manage and change their urban environment. To aid in thinking about these issues, we provide an initial typology of community gardens according to their relative degrees of collectivity, reflecting the underlying values of these alternative agricultural system.

AB  - This paper addresses the issue of airborne transmission of diseases in relation to spatial layout in health care facilities. In particular, this study analyzes the occurrence of airborne transmission in the waiting areas of puskesmas, a form of primary health care facilities that are distributed in many cities and villages in Indonesia. The study uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis as a design tool to examine the potential for airborne infection by analyzing the simulated droplet movement in a waiting area layout. The findings of the study identify the distribution of areas where the droplets are likely and unlikely to spread and use this to suggest seating layouts in waiting areas to spatially reduce the potential for airborne infection.

AB  - Unions, health and safety activists, and professionals came together to create Coalitions for Occupational Safety and Health (COSH groups) in a number of cities across the United States beginning in the 1970s. The COSHes have played an important and unique role in advocating worker health and safety since that time, through activities including technical assistance, training and education, and campaigns on workplace and public policies. In New York State, activist coalitions created eight COSH groups distributed around the state. This paper presents a history of New York's COSHes based on interviews with key participants. The interviews shed light on the origins of the COSH movement in New York, the development and activities of the COSHes, and the organizational trajectory of individual New York COSHes in response to both extra and intraorganizational challenges. Participants' accounts of these issues may be useful for those seeking to sustain the COSH movement.

AB  - It seems with the ever more complex instituting of aggressive neoliberal renewal policies comes an intensified effort to use the language of consensus and civic unity. The post-political debate frames this discussion, and it is from this perspective that we propose a fuller consideration of urban renewal policy, and how these forces are embedded within the narrowing of what has been called the "properly political". In bringing together accounts of the dynamic political life of communities and groups of interest who are confronting urban renewal policy in Glasgow, we make a case for recognising an intensification of political articulation, position-taking and action. This recognition comes in response to the argument that we are currently experiencing a post-political consensus and that democracy has been annulled in the process. We see evidence of a Polanyian "double movement" in which the construction of consensual publics is such a marked characteristic across different accounts, and how this appears to have opened up new critical spaces of debate and action within the various communities of interest. We therefore openly question the post-political as a condition, or a process, which seemingly unfolds unimpeded. We fear that "post-political" runs the risk of becoming a citational practice, that through repetition of the term, a narrowing of political articulation and action within the debate starts to occur. Our case studies aim to highlight the blind spots of the post-political debate by focusing on the actually existing spaces of political articulation and position-taking apparent in Glasgow.

AB  - Billions of users of mobile phones, social media platforms, and other technologies generate an increasingly large volume of data that has the potential to be leveraged towards solving public health challenges. These and other big data resources tend to be most successful in epidemiological applications when utilized within an appropriate conceptual framework. Here, we demonstrate the importance of assumptions about host mobility in a framework for dynamic modeling of infectious disease spread among districts within a large urban area. Our analysis focused on spatial and temporal variation in the transmission of dengue virus (DENV) during a series of large seasonal epidemics in Lahore, Pakistan during 2011-2014. Similar to many directly transmitted diseases, DENV transmission occurs primarily where people spend time during daytime hours, given that DENV is transmitted by a day-biting mosquito. We inferred spatiotemporal variation in DENV transmission under five different assumptions about mobility patterns among ten districts of Lahore: no movement among districts, movement following patterns of geo-located tweets, movement proportional to district population size, and movement following the commonly used gravity and radiation models. Overall, we found that inferences about spatiotemporal variation in DENV transmission were highly sensitive to this range of assumptions about intra-urban human mobility patterns, although the three assumptions that allowed for a modest degree of intra-urban mobility all performed similarly in key respects. Differing inferences about transmission patterns based on our analysis are significant from an epidemiological perspective, as they have different implications for where control efforts should be targeted and whether conditions for transmission became more or less favorable over time.

AB  - This paper is the first comprehensive empirical study of earnings, income, and consumption inequality in urban China from 1986 to 2009, conducted using micro-level data from the Urban Household Survey (UHS). We document a drastic increase in economic inequality for the sample period. We find that consumption inequality closely tracks with income inequality, both over time and over the life cycle. We believe that the main driver of this co-movement could be the dramatic increase in uninsurable permanent income shocks that occurred after the early 1990s, a result of the economic transition in urban China.

AB  - This paper uses the context of Cambodia's 2013/14 and 2015 minimum wage campaigns to demonstrate the translocally rural-urban nature of worker agency and activism within global production networks. In doing so, it first highlights the gendered and hierarchical nature of the Cambodian union movement, emphasising in particular the disjuncture between its thriving, inter-occupational grassroots support and the male dominated, top down hierarchies of the union leadership. Secondly, the authors present primary informant testimonies and quantitative figures produced from 13 years of secondary strike data to highlight the key role of agricultural pressures in motivating strike participation. This translocal perspective on protest is used, finally, to demonstrate how certain features of the Cambodian union movement hierarchy, male predominance and structural disjuncture are rooted not in abstract norms, but in the everyday mobilities of translocally rura-urban livelihoods, which have rendered grassroots activism largely independent of the structures that represent it.

AB  - Despite considerable attention to 'valuing diversity' among scholars and practitioners, discrimination, exclusion, and inequality persist in American organizations. In particular, similarly educated African Americans typically have higher unemployment and lower earnings than other groups, and continue to face discrimination in access to jobs and in treatment at work. Black-White wage gaps are higher than they were decades ago, and without significant change, the wealth gap will take centuries to bridge. The solidarity economy, an economic framework that encourages governance that creates equity, shared prosperity, power, and ownership may help provide jobs, help build wealth, and yield other positive outcomes in African American communities. Cooperation Jackson, operating under solidarity economy principles, aims to create sustainable community development, economic democracy, and community ownership in Jackson, Mississippi, a predominantly black city plagued by poverty and unemployment. We discuss ways in which the solidarity economy may help marginalized populations and call for teaching and research on these alternative forms of governance.

AB  - Community psychology is central to understanding how immigrants and more established residents of their new settings join together to develop a shared sense of community and membership. In our present study, we explored how newer (i.e., first- and second-generation immigrants) and more established community members form multiple positive psychological sense of community (PSOC) with one another. We conducted a multinational, qualitative study of PSOC through interviews with 201 first- and second-generation immigrants and third generation or more receiving community members in three contexts (Baltimore-Washington corridor of the U.S.; Torino, Italy; Lecce, Italy). Results indicated numerous similarities among the ways in which participants constructed PSOC in shared and nonshared communities, regardless of immigration/citizenship status, length of community residence, city, country, age, or gender. Small, proximal, and salient communities were often particularly important to building positive PSOC, which was formed around diverse membership boundaries. As intersectional beings, members converged and diverged on many characteristics, providing multiple opportunities for members to bring diversity to their communities while sharing other characteristics deemed essential to membership. Nonetheless, findings point to significant, structural challenges rooted in power and privilege that must be confronted to bridge the community-diversity dialectic and build strong, shared sense of community.
   Highlights
   Immigrant and receiving community members co-construct sense of community in similar ways. Small relational communities are particularly important for developing positive sense of community. Members may belong to a community based on one shared characteristic while diverging on others. Systems that delimit membership and power may obstruct territorial community belonging. We must confront structural challenges rooted in power to bridge the community-diversity dialectic.

AB  - Landsat-like moderate resolution remote sensing images are widely used in land use and land cover (LULC) classification. Limited by coarser resolutions, most of the traditional LULC classifications that are based on moderate resolution remote sensing images focus on the spectral features of a single pixel. Inspired by the spatial evaluation methods in landscape ecology, this study proposed a new method to extract neighborhood characteristics around a pixel for moderate resolution images. 3 landscape-metric-like indexes, i.e., mean index, standard deviation index, and distance weighted value index, were defined as adjacent region features to include the surrounding environmental characteristics. The effects of the adjacent region features and the different feature set configurations on improving the LULC classification were evaluated by a series of well-controlled LULC classification experiments using K nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers on a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image. When the adjacent region features were added, the overall accuracies of both the classifiers were higher than when only spectral features were used. For the KNN and SVM classifiers that used only spectral features, the overall accuracies of the LULC classification were 85.45% and 88.87%, respectively, and the accuracies were improved to 94.52% and 96.97%. The classification accuracies of all the LULC types improved. Highly heterogeneous LULC types that are easily misclassified achieved greater improvements. As comparisons, the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches were also implemented on the same dataset. The results revealed that the new method outperformed GLCM and CNN approaches and can significantly improve the classification performance that is based on moderate resolution data.

AB  - During the afternoon hours of July 27, 2017, an extreme hailstorm struck the most populated city of Turkey, Istanbul. This rapidly growing supercell which produces large hail led to numerous injuries and damaged automobiles, houses, aircrafts, crops, and infrastructure of the city. As a result of the movement of the cut-off cyclone from Middle East to western Turkey, warm air advection penetrated over Marmara, and the land surface temperature of Istanbul reached 34 degrees C (5 degrees C above the mean). The transport of significant amount of moisture, which was caused by excessive heating of Marmara Sea surface temperatures (24.9 degrees C), to the low levels of the atmosphere by strong southwesterly winds enabled the increase of low-level moisture convergence. Both abnormal temperature differences between land and 500-hPa level (41.5 degrees C) and excessive wind shear values (20.3m/s) between surface and 6km above ground level (AGL) increased the thermal instability and updraft conditions of the baroclinic atmosphere. This condition resulted in thunderstorms, stormy and gale wind gusts (31.9m/s 15:20 UTC), extreme lightning activity (totally 2696 cloud-to-ground and 5791 intracloud), large hailstones between 3-6cm diameter and high hourly precipitation amounts (38.7, 36.2, 29.8, and 27.2mm in Sisli, Kadikoy, Uskudar, and Fatih regions, respectively, between 14:00 and 15:00 UTC) in the urban settlements of the city. The stability indices, Showalter, K, Total of totals, SWEAT, and CAPE also showed the high probability of severe thunderstorm occurrence over Istanbul. Based on a comparison among these five indices, the SWEAT index is most appropriate to represent the atmospheric conditions over the city owing to low-level moisture, warm air advection, and low and mid-level wind speed terms in its equation.

AB  - Urban and artificial structures are increasingly added to the world's coasts during a time in which changing climate is forecast to drive shifts in naturally occurring habitats. We ask whether the role of artificial structures as marine habitats will increase in importance relative to their natural counterparts, particularly as natural habitats are negatively affected by ocean warming and acidification. To evaluate this model, we contrasted use of natural (kelp forest and turfing algae) and artificial habitat (plastic pier-piling) by a nest-building amphipod (Cymadusa pemptos) under current and future climate conditions of CO2 and temperature. Under future conditions, amphipod populations in mesocosms increased, but this did not lead to greater proportional colonization of kelp and turf. Instead, colonization doubled in artificial habitats, and there was increasing production and occupation of nests on artificial habitats relative to natural habitats. In an age when human modification of natural substrata is increasingly cited as an agent of wildlife decline, understanding the future role of artificial habitats as replacement dwellings for natural habitats is critical. We pioneer an understanding of the future role of natural and artificial habitats, identifying the possibility that the role of urban structures as marine habitats may only increase.

AB  - Learning analytics is an emerging field of research, motivated by the wide spectrum of the available educational information that can be analysed to provide a data-driven decision about various learning problems. This study intends to examine the research landscape of learning analytics to deliver a comprehensive understanding of the research activities in this multidisciplinary field, using scientific literature from the Scopus database. An array of state-of-the-art bibliometric indices is deployed on 2811 procured publication datasets: publication counts, citation counts, co-authorship patterns, citation networks and term co-occurrence. The results indicate that the field of learning analytics appears to have been instantiated around 2011; thus, before this time period no significant research activity can be observed. The temporal evolution indicates that the terms 'students', 'teachers', 'higher education institutions' and 'learning process' appear to be the major components of the field. More recent trends in the field are the tools that tap into Big Data analytics and data mining techniques for more rational data-driven decision-making services. A future direction research depicts a need to integrate learning analytics research with multidisciplinary smart education and smart library services. The vision towards smart city research requires a meta-level of smart learning analytics value integration and policy-making.

AB  - Inselberg formations rise from the eastern Brazilian landscape like islands interspersed within a matrix of tropical vegetation. As this environment is highly threatened by recent urban expansion and the indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources, the orchid species endemic to these inselbergs have suffered drastic reductions in the sizes of their populations. To verify whether this process has been accompanied by the loss of total genetic variability and stochastic changes of the genetic structure of the remaining populations, the genetic variability and structure of all known relict Cattleya lobata populations were assessed using dominant molecular markers (ISSRs), and their genetic conservation status was defined. High genetic variability was detected (H-e = 0.262; I = 0.463), with most of the variation occurring within the populations (93%), along with a weak but significant genetic structure (Phi(ST) = 0.074; P < 0.001). Pollination by deception and long-distance seed dispersal may explain the higher variability values than those expected for impacted species with small populations. Historical factors, such as a more continuous distribution in the recent past with interconnected populations and perennial habit with long-lived individuals, can contribute to the maintenance of ancestral genotypes and a highly variable and homogeneous gene pool. These factors can reduce the possible effects of genetic drift, even in the most heavily impacted C. lobata populations in the tourist areas of Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - Pelado volcano is a typical example of an andesitic Mexican shield with a summital scoria cone. It erupted ca. 10 ka in the central part of an elevated plateau in what is today the southern part of Mexico City. The volcano forms a roughly circular, 10-km wide lava shield with two summital cones, surrounded by up to 2.7-m thick tephra deposits preserved up to a distance of 3 km beyond the shield. New cartographic, stratigraphic, granulometric, and componentry data indicate that Pelado volcano was the product of a single, continuous eruption marked by three stages. In the early stage, a > 1.5-km long fissure opened and was active with mild explosive activity. Intermediate and late stages were mostly effusive and associated with the formation of a 250-m high lava shield. Nevertheless, during these stages, the emission of lava alternated and/or coexisted with highly explosive events that deposited a widespread tephra blanket. In the intermediate stage, multiple vents were active along the fissure, but activity was centered at the main cone during the late stage. The final activity was purely effusive. The volcano emitted > 0.9 km(3) dense-rock equivalent (DRE) of tephra and up to 5.6 km(3) DRE of lavas. Pelado shares various features with documented "violent Strombolian" eruptions, including a high fragmentation index, large dispersal area, occurrence of plate tephra, high eruptive column, and simultaneous explosive and effusive activity. Our results suggest that the associated hazards (mostly tephra fallout and emplacement of lava) would seriously affect areas located up to 25 km from the vent for fallout and 5 km from the vent for lava, an important issue for large cities built near or on potentially active zones, such as Mexico City.

AB  - Thallium is a trace metal with a toxicity greater than that of Pb, Cd and Hg. This study complements the authors' previous research, with main focus on contamination by Tl and accompanying metals (Pb, Zn, Cd, and Cu) in sediments from an area historically affected by Pb-Zn smelting in Shaoguan city (northern Guangdong Province, South China). In order to provide complex data on the geochemistry of anthropogenic Tl in sediments, total contents and geochemical fractionation of Tl and the other metals were comparatively studied for two different sediment profiles, core A from the Pb-Zn smelter outlet (a major Tl pollution point-source) and core B from the inlet of the North River (natural water courses near the smelter). Surprisingly high enrichment of Tl was observed across both depth profiles, with varying distribution patterns versus depth. Further comparison of Tl contents and its geochemical fractions in the upper, middle and bottom horizons of core A and core B, in combination with mineralogical phases of the sediments, clearly demonstrated both lateral and vertical mobility of Tl, due to complex processes such as mechanical disturbance/mixing, long-term alteration/dissolution of smelter-derived particles, and vertical migration of Tl through colloidal (or microparticle) transport with alumino-phyllosilicates and Fe/Mn (hydr) oxides. Relatively high abundance of Tl in the labile fractions of all selected sediments from both locations highlights a potentially significant environmental risk to the local ecological system in the near future.

AB  - Background: Dengue is the most important arboviral disease in tropical and subtropical countries. Dispersal of the vector and an increase in migratory flow between countries have led to large epidemics and severe clinical outcomes. Over the past 20 years, dengue epidemics have become more wide-spread and frequent. Previous studies have shown that dengue is endemic in Jeddah, Makkah and Al-Madinah in western Saudi Arabia as well as in Jazan region in the southern part of the country. The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) have been reported from western Saudi Arabia. It has been suggested that pilgrims could play a significant and unique role in DENV-1 and DENV-2 introduction into Saudi Arabia, especially in the cities of Jeddah, Makkah and AlMadinah during Hajj and Umrah seasons. However, only limited data on DENV-3 in Saudi Arabia are available.
   Methods: All available DENV-3 sequences published and unpublished from Saudi Arabia and other countries were retrieved from Genbank and gene sequence repository and phylogenetically analyzed to examine the diversity of DENV-3 into the city of Jeddah.
   Results: Based on the analysis of the envelope gene and non-structural 1 (E/NS1) junction sequences, we show that there were at least four independent introductions of DENV-3, all from genotype III into Jeddah. The first introduction was most probably before 1997 as Saudi virus isolates from 1997 formed a cluster without any close relationship to other globally circulating isolates, suggesting their local circulation from previous introduction events. Two introductions were most probably in 2004 with isolates closely-related to isolates from Africa and India (Asia), in addition to another introduction in 2014 with isolates clustering with those from Singapore (Asia).
   Conclusions: Our data shows that only genotype III isolates of DENV-3 are circulating in Jeddah and highlights the potential role of pilgrims in DENV-3 importation into western Saudi Arabia and subsequent exportation to their home countries during Hajj and Umrah seasons. Therefore, it is highly recommended to establish DENV sentinel surveillance programs targeting clinical cases and the mosquito vector in the country to implement effective control measures and to minimize the burden of the disease in the kingdom.

AB  - This paper analyzes the spatio-temporal variability of sunshine duration in the south of the Pampeana region as a first approach to solar climatic analysis, main input for the use of this resource. Hourly sunshine duration records from 1991 to 2015 in eight Argentine cities were analyzed using statistics and geospatial techniques. In addition, we analyzed the frequency of clear sky and overcast days in order to relate it to the sunshine duration variability. Sunshine duration in the Pampeana region presented a linear gradient increasing in an east-west direction. An inverse relationship between the mean sunshine duration and coefficients of variation was found in all the cities. The highest mean values of sunshine duration were recorded located between 62 degrees W and 65 degrees W, where the lowest variability was also registered. The city of Mar del Plata showed the lowest mean values of sunshine duration (4.5 h) and the highest percentage of variability (78.1%), whereas Rio Colorado recorded the highest mean values of sunshine duration (7.5 h) and the lowest variability (51.1%) over the observation period. During the warm season, it was recorded a difference of 3.7 h in the mean SD values between the stations Rio Colorado and Mar del Plata. The spatial distribution of the solar resource in the Pampena region is markedly affected by weather systems playing at the regional scale of South America. In the cold season, the west-east movement of the high pressure cells promotes the occurrence of Sudestadas, which explain the variability of sunshine duration over the coastal areas.

AB  - The chocolate market is experiencing a wave of market differentiation thanks to the emergence of the bean-to-bar movement. Cacao is seeing both a rise in demand for mass markets and a process of market bifurcation into more specialized, high-quality products for wealthy urban consumers. For the specialized market, the quality and origin of the beans are important attributes. Direct trading between chocolate makers and famers seeks to promote the conservation of rare cultivars and traditional agroforestry systems, while lifting farmers out of poverty. Here we assess whether these alternative configurations of the global value chain truly offer smallholders new opportunities, beyond the traditional intensification or marginalization pathways that are generally offered to them. We conducted detailed socio-economic and biophysical surveys with a sample of farms in three of the largest cacao producing provinces of Ecuador. Our results show that, even though smallholders lack the assets needed to join mainstream commodity markets, they have been able to capitalize on the qualities of their traditional varieties to access niche markets. Through strong cooperatives, the knowledge held by buyers about what constitutes a high-quality bean has been transferred to farmers. A unique natural capital may provide smallholders with rewarding pathways to develop their agriculture, exploiting new market opportunities offered by globalization.

KW  - PART
AB  - In 1975, Sydney women's liberation activists received an International Women's Year grant to organise a series of suburban 'women's commissions'. Close to 500 women attended events in Liverpool, Chatswood, Hurstville and Bankstown, many of whom came forward to reveal personal experiences of discrimination and violence. Modelled on previous events that had been based in the city's centre, including the well-known Sydney Women's Commission (1973) and the Women Against the Violent Society Forum (1974), the suburban commissions exemplify 1970s feminists' use of personal testimony as a strategy to connect the 'personal' to the 'political'. Yet the commissions also illuminate tensions that emerged in the process of both 'speaking out' and listening to other women's experiences and the limits of this format as a vehicle for building 'sisterhood'. In revisiting this surprisingly little studied episode in the history of Sydney women's liberation, this article provides new evidence of the movement's presence in the suburbs, at the same time as it illuminates wider feminist debates about diversity, the politics of participation and the ideals of 'sisterhood'.

AB  - The structural variation of the bacterial community associated with particulate matter (PM) was assessed in an urban area of Beijing during hazy and non-hazy days. Sampling for different PM fractions (PM2.5 [< 2.5 mu m], PM10 [< 10 mu m], and total suspended particulate) was conducted using three portable air samplers from September 2014 to February 2015. The airborne bacterial community in these samples was analyzed using the Illumina MiSeq platform with bacterium-specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene. A total of 1,707,072 reads belonging to 6,009 operational taxonomic units were observed. The airborne bacterial community composition was significantly affected by PM fractions (R = 0.157, P < 0.01). In addition, the relative abundances of several genera significantly differed between samples with various haze levels; for example, Methylobacillus, Tumebacillus, and Desulfurispora spp. increased in heavy-haze days. Canonical correspondence analysis and permutation tests showed that temperature, SO2 concentration, relative humidity, PM10 concentration, and CO concentration were significant factors that associated with airborne bacterial community composition. Only six genera increased across PM10 samples (Dokdonella, Caenimonas, Geminicoccus, and Sphingopyxis) and PM2.5 samples (Cellulomonas and Rhizobacter), while a large number of taxa significantly increased in total suspended particulate samples, such as Paracoccus, Kocuria, and Sphingomonas. Network analysis indicated that Paracoccus, Rubellimicrobium, Kocuria, and Arthrobacter were the key genera in the airborne PM samples. Overall, the findings presented here suggest that diverse airborne bacterial communities are associated with PM and provide further understanding of bacterial community structure in the atmosphere during hazy and nonhazy days.
   IMPORTANCE The results presented here represent an analysis of the airborne bacterial community associated with particulate matter (PM) and advance our understanding of the structural variation of these communities. We observed a shift in bacterial community composition with PM fractions but no significant difference with haze levels. This may be because the bacterial differences are obscured by high bacterial diversity in the atmosphere. However, we also observed that a few genera (such as Methylobacillus, Tumebacillus, and Desulfurispora) increased significantly on heavy-haze days. In addition, Paracoccus, Rubellimicrobium, Kocuria, and Arthrobacter were the key genera in the airborne PM samples. Accurate and real-time techniques, such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, should be developed for a future survey of the relationship of airborne bacteria and haze.

AB  - The ongoing geographical expansion of dengue is inducing an epidemiological transition in many previously transmission-free urban areas, which are now prone to annual epidemics. To analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of dengue in these settings, we reconstruct transmission chains in Porto Alegre, Brazil, by applying a Bayesian inference model to geo-located dengue cases from 2013 to 2016. We found that transmission clusters expand by linearly increasing their diameter with time, at an average rate of about 600 m month(-1). The majority (70.4%, 95% CI: 58.2-79.8%) of individual transmission events occur within a distance of 500 m. Cluster diameter, duration, and epidemic size are proportionally smaller when control interventions were more timely and intense. The results suggest that a large proportion of cases are transmitted via short-distance human movement (<1 km) and a limited contribution of long distance commuting within the city. These results can assist the design of control policies, including insecticide spraying and strategies for active case finding.

AB  - The knowledge of roadway capacity and level-of-service (LoS) are important basic input required for planning, design, analysis, and operation of roadway systems. There is a limited body-of-knowledge available about highway capacity and level-of-service (LoS) of multi-lane urban roads in Asian countries including India, where traffic composition and flow behaviour are considerably different from that of the developed world. Traffic flow on multi-lane urban roads in India are designed for high-speed movement, but, heterogeneity in traffic, non-lane based movement, and frequent access provided from service-lane, result in overall reduction of speed of vehicles, at certain times. Such roadway facilities possess following characteristics: dominance of car traffic, higher design speeds, and underpass/overpass at the location of intersection, which also makes it (multilane-urban roads) significantly different from the urban arterial roads. Twelve hours of video were captured on ten-lane divided section using digital camera, covering wide range of traffic flow, and composition prevailing on these facilities. Heterogeneous traffic flow is converted into PCU equivalent using the method proposed by Kumar et. al. Speed-flow relationship is developed for the study section using Van-Aerde model. LoS analysis was carried out using large amount of field observed dataset aggregated at 1-minute intervals to show maximum variation in traffic flow parameters. Empirical studies on some of the important traffic flow parameters such as: flow, density, and area occupancy are highlighted here. LoS clusters were defined using k-mean clustering technique. The findings of this study are also compared with American highway capacity guidelines. The capacity and LoS thresholds estimated along with its methodology may be useful for roadway having similar traffic conditions.

AB  - In forensic entomology, many studies analyze fly activity and succession on dead bodies by using pig cadavers and a variety of small baited traps. Data on real human bodies are very rare. To address this shortcoming, we analyzed the fly fauna of 51 human bodies in Germany. Sex, age, place of discovery, and presumed time of death were noted. Larvae were sampled during autopsy according to body region or tissue. For every infested region, the total number of fly larvae were estimated and classified into categories of 1-10, 11-50, and 50+. All samples were identified to the species level. Besides a descriptive analysis of their occurrence patterns, a categorical PCA was performed, and multispecies generalized linear models and a latent variable model were run. Our results highlight the most forensically important blow flies on human bodies in Central Europe (Lucilia sericata, L. ampullacea, Phormia regina, Calliphora vicina); prove, for the first time, the general transferability of species lists based on succession studies on pig cadavers; recommend a certain set of species, such as the so-far neglected L. ampullacea, for future developmental studies; and reveal competitive occurrence of up to six species on the same body as a potential factor of influence. Assignment to a certain body region was often possible and our data clearly indicate certain tissues, e.g. brain, as of high interest for future developmental studies. Focusing on real scenario settings helps direct research to forensically relevant questions and appraises the plausibility of vital laboratory studies.

AB  - This article presents results on the long-term (from 1837 to 2014) development of land use and a road network in the military training area of Libava, the Czech Republic, and its surroundings. The key hypotheses were that the establishment of military training areas has significant impacts on the development of their land use and the road network, which are manifested mainly in an increase of forest and/or grassland use/cover, and that military training areas are affected by general trends of land use changes; however, trends connected with specific military needs still dominate. Results show that there are indeed differences in the land use development and land use change transitions in the training area and its surroundings. These were most pronounced during the most intensive military activities in the past 70 years. During this period the training area experienced massive grassing, afforestation and vegetation succession, while the surroundings were used for intensive agriculture and economic development, resulting in the spread of arable land as well as the spread of built-up areas. The road network in the area was also affected by the military regime direct connections between towns were lost, and many roads were destroyed or lost their importance. Currently, with the withdrawal of the military from almost a third of the training area, both the training area and its surroundings are again being affected by similar driving forces, namely the spread of organic farming and implementation of agri-environmental schemes, resulting in extensive grassing. This trend will likely continue. We believe that land use development in the military training area can serve as a proxy for future land use development in recently abandoned regions.

AB  - The ancient City Wall of Nanjing (CWN) has suffered various damages since it was built more than 600 years ago. Numerous fractures and dislocations can be found on the wall. Furthermore, deterioration or destruction on several segments of the wall often occurred soon after restoration work was done, and brings some threats again and again on the people who either walk or live near the wall. The characteristics of these damages and their causes are unclear. In this paper the major fractures and dislocations on CWN were investigated through a field survey. It was observed that the apertures and dislocations of the CWN are usually large near the ground surface and decrease upwards and the most active fractures are located in the segments of the wall along a fault in NWW direction (290A degrees). Twelve joint meters were installed across those fractures and the changes of the fractures' aperture were measured monthly from April, 2010 to December, 2011. The measured data show that the fractures' apertures are changing with time significantly, and the maximum cumulative change of apertures is 2.3 mm during 20 months. 80 bases were installed for the GPS measurement on top of the wall, and each site was measured monthly for the same time period as the joint meter measurements, the position of the wall moves significantly with time and the range of the displacement is +/- 15.00 mm with the largest value of 20.00 mm. Based on the field survey and measurement, it is hypothesized that the changes of the fractures' aperture of the wall were caused by the non-uniform crustal movement. A three-dimensional mechanical modeling was built to test the hypothesis and the results confirmed the field observation. The findings from this study are significant and important to protect ancient walls and other human-made structures since the crustal movement may have never been considered before.

Offering to serve as a conduit for men and women who pursued love anonymously in the Petites affiches, he skillfully marketed his "marriages by the classifieds" to lonely, uprooted individuals throughout imperial France. Villiaume pitched his unions as part of a new commercial and social world of movement in Paris. He sought to facilitate the circulation of capital and people by forging family alliances and love matches across multiple social and geographic borders. By linking marital choice and courtship to the vagaries of consumer capitalism, the agent transformed marriage into a form of commercial exchange associated with the new urban values of abundance, pleasure, and social mobility.

AB  - In Hainan island, the Qiongshan M7. 5 occurred in 1605. The recent years see small quakes in a NS trending seismic belt in the northeastern margin as well as the central and eastern segments of the Jiusuo-Lingshui fault. Meanwhile the Ma'anling-Leihuling volcanoes close to the Haikou city have the possibility of potential eruption. These are signs of active tectonics. This paper presents the present-day 3D crustal movement and fault activity derived from the GNSS data collected in 2009-2014 and precise leveling data of the 1970 s,1990 s and 2013. The results show that the horizontal movement is mainly in SEE, consistent with that of the South China Block. Left lateral extensional movement is dominant near the seismic belt. Baseline changes show intermittent movement. In the 1970 s, vertical movement in the northern island shows "uplift in the east and subsidence in the west bounded by Haikou-Tunchang". On either side of the Wangwu-Wenjiao fault, differential movement on different segments are observed. The leveling data surveyed in the 1970 s and 1990 s show an uplift trend relative to the Xiuying port benchmarks. And the southwest was rising with respect to the northeast, an inherited motion. The vertical deformation in the northern island is opposite to that of 1970 s. The data of 1990 s-2013 at the leveling sites show an opposite movement to the last period, with the uplift around the Wenchang-Qionghai-Wanning region and subsidence at other sites. Combining the deformation and geophysical data, we infer that small earthquakes in the NS trending seismic belt were caused by the movement of the Puqian-Boao fault. The north wall of the Manao-Puqian fault is dominated by subsidence. The movement in the east segment of the Jiusuo-Lingshui fault is greater than that of the west section. Earthquakes, deformation and other data imply that the volcanoes are now quiet.

AB  - Background & objectives: Schistosomiasis is a rural endemic disease that has been expanding to urban and coastal areas in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution of breeding sites of the causative vector, Biomphalaria straminea in an endemic municipality for schistosomiasis and to present the predictive models for occurrences and dispersal of this vector snail to new areas.
   Methods: A malacological survey was conducted during January to December 2015 in the municipality of Sao Lourenco da Mata, Pernambuco, Brazil to identify the breeding sites of Biomphalaria. Faecal contamination was determined by means of the Colitag (TM) diagnostic kit. Rainfall data were collected, and correlated with snail distribution data. Kernel density estimation, kriging and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling were used for spatial data analysis, by means of the spatial analysis software packages.
   Results: Out of the 130 demarcated collection points, 64 were classified as breeding sites for B. straminea. A total of 5,250 snails were collected from these sites. Among these 64 sites, four were considered as foci of schistosomiasis transmission and 54 as potential transmission foci. An inverse relationship between rainfall and mail density was observed. Kernel spatial analysis identified three areas at higher risk of snail occurrence, which were also the areas of highest faecal contamination and included two transmission foci. Kriging and MaxEnt modeling simulated the scenarios obtained through the kernel analyses.
   Interpretation & conclusion: Use of geostatistical tools (Kriging and MaxEnt) is efficient for identifying areas at risk and for estimating the dispersal of Biomphalaria species across the study area. Occurrence of B. straminea in the study area is influenced by the rainy season, as it becomes more abundant during the period immediately after the rainy season, increasing the risk of dispersal and the appearance of new transmission foci.

AB  - Environmental stressors associated with human land and water-use activities have degraded many riparian ecosystems across the western United States. These stressors include (i) the widespread expansion of invasive plant species that displace native vegetation and exacerbate streamflow and sediment regime alteration; (ii) agricultural and urban development in valley bottoms that decouple streams and rivers from their floodplains and reduce instream wood recruitment and retention; and (iii) flow modification that reduces water quantity and quality, degrading aquatic habitats. Here we apply a novel drainage network model to assess the impacts of multiple stressors on reach-scale riparian condition across two large U.S. regions. In this application, we performed a riparian condition assessment evaluating three dominant stressors: (1) riparian vegetation departure from historical condition; (2) land-use intensity within valley bottoms; and (3) floodplain fragmentation caused by infrastructure within valley bottoms, combining these stressors in a fuzzy inference system. We used freely available, geospatial data to estimate reach-scale (500m) riparian condition for 52,800km of perennial streams and rivers, 25,600km in Utah, and 27,200km in 12 watersheds of the interior Columbia River Basin (CRB). Model outputs showed that riparian condition has been at least moderately impaired across approximate to 70% of the streams and rivers in Utah and approximate to 49% in the CRB. We found 84% agreement (Cohen's ?=0.79) between modeled reaches and field plots, indicating that modeled riparian condition reasonably approximates on-the-ground conditions. Our approach to assessing riparian condition can be used to prioritize watershed-scale floodplain conservation and restoration by providing network-scale data on the extent and severity of riparian degradation. The approach that we applied here is flexible and can be expanded to run with additional riparian stressor data and/or finer resolution input data.

AB  - For several decades, the student movement of 1968 has become one of the most important events within public memories in Mexico. Remembered for what happened on October 2 in Tlatelolco and symbolized as a watershed in the struggle for political democracy, 1968 has been anchored in both public memories and realms of memory. Among the latter, probably one of the most relevant is the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, in Tlatelolco, Mexico City. In this article we analyze its conformation and meanings as a realm of memory, as well as the place it has been occupying in national and international trauma tourism circuits.

AB  - This is the first survey to investigate the vertical distribution and composition of microplastics >20 mu m at the surface (0-0.2 m; bulk sample) and in the water column (3-58 m depth; pump) of six semi-enclosed bays and two nearshore areas of South Korea. The average microplastic abundance of 41 stations at all sampling depths was 871 particles/m(3), and the microplastic abundance near urban areas (1051 particles/m(3)) was significantly higher than that near rural areas (560 particles/m(3)). Although the average microplastic abundances in the midcolumn (423 particles/m(3)) and bottom water (394 particles/m(3)) were approximately 4 times lower than that of surface water (1736 particles/m(3)), microplastics prevailed throughout the water column in concentrations of 10-2000 particles/m(3). The average sizes of fragment and fiber type microplastics were 197 and 752 mu m, respectively. Although the polymer composition differed by depth depending on the particle size and density, polypropylene and polyethylene predominated throughout the water column regardless of their low density and particle size. Finally, the middle and bottom water samples contained higher abundances of microplastics than predicted by a model based on physical mixing, indicating that biological interactions also influence the downward movement of low-density microplastics.

AB  - Weall need space; unless we have it, we cannot reach that sense of quiet in which whispers of better things come to us gently. (Hill 1883)This article considers legal models for creating new commons as a community resource (green space') in English law. It presents a strategy for creating new' commons to re-purpose' land for public recreation and to (re)-connect people and nature. This will require the creation of common rights-a species of private property right-over private land, to facilitate its registration as common land with open public recreational access. The article considers the types of private property right appropriate and necessary to achieve this overriding purpose, and considers the narratives of locality and identity which this model for new commons' could engender. Victorian philanthropists such as Sir Robert Hunter and Octavia Hill led a defensive response to the old' enclosure movement. Establishing new commons' would, by contrast, start to address some of the concerns raised by the new' enclosure movement, by offering a vision for a model of urban common that can provide spaces for human interaction, interdependence and cooperation from which no one is excluded. This would also contribute to addressing key modern public policy objectives for reconnecting people and nature, and contribute to the development of cultural ecosystem services of the kind envisaged by the UK National Ecosystem Assessment and the Biodiversity 2020 strategy for England.

AB  - This article analyses the relation between the failures that occurred in the water supply network and the road traffic in the city of Cluj-Napoca in Romania. The calculations in this case study were made using the Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis Professional 2011 software. In the case study, the following types of pipes were analysed: steel, gray cast iron, ductile cast iron and high density polyethylene (HDPE). While in most studies only a few sections of pipelines, several types of pipelines and certain mounting depths have been analysed, the case study presented analyses the entire water supply system of a city with a population of 324,576 inhabitants, whose water supply system has a length of 479 km. The results of the research are useful in the design phase of water distribution networks, so depending on the type of pipe material, the minimum depth of installation can be indicated, so as to avoid the failure of the pipes due to road traffic. From this perspective, similar studies could also be carried out regarding the negative influence of road traffic on sewerage networks, gas networks and heating networks.

AB  - Longyearbyen is the major administrative, touristic, and scientific centre in Svalbard and so-called European Gateway' to the Arctic. The number of inhabitants and tourists as well as community infrastructure has significantly expanded over the recent decade, and present-day community faces development thresholds associated with climate warming and disturbance of cold region landscape. Coastal zone is a key interface where severe environmental changes impact directly on Longyearbyen infrastructure. We applied the combination of environmental assessment methods and geographic information system analyses together with field mapping to investigate the scale of degradation of coastal zone in Longyearbyen and examine the impact of coastal hazards on major elements of community infrastructure. Rate of observed coastal changes, the diversity of natural and man-made hazards mapped along the coast, and observed damages in infrastructure suggest a need for coastal change monitoring and coastal protection in Longyearbyen. The part of the Longyearbyen coast that should be monitored and protected are sections spreading between new port and surroundings of Longyearelva delta significantly modified by coastal erosion and landsliding. In order to improve coastal zone protection and safety of town development, we present arguments supporting the incorporation of Longyearbyen into recently established Circum-Arctic Coastal Communities Knowledge Network.

We use daily observations to show that Beijing's urban heat island (UHI) effects largely depend on precipitation, cloud cover, and water vapor but are insensitive to wind speed, during the CNY holiday season. Non-precipitating, clear, and low humidity conditions favor strong UHI effects. The CNY holiday, with some 3 billion journeys made, provides a living laboratory to explore the role of population movements in the UHI phenomenon. Averaged over the period 2004-2013, with the Olympic year of 2008 excluded, Beijing's UHI effects during the CNY week decline by 0.48 A degrees C relative to the background period (4 weeks including 2 to 3 weeks before, and 2 to 3 weeks after, the CNY week). With combined effects of precipitation, large cloud cover, and high water vapor excluded, the UHI effects during the CNY week averaged over the study period decline by 0.76 A degrees C relative to the background period, significant at the 99% confidence level by Student's t test. These results indicate that the impacts of population movements can be more easily detected when excluding unfavorable meteorological conditions to the UHI. Population movements occur not only during the CNY holiday, but also during all the time across the globe. We suggest that better understanding the role of population movements will offer new insight into anthropogenic climate modifications.

AB  - This paper presents a path-loss model based on a radio-frequency (RF) detection scheme for various drones using 5G aerial communication over an industrial, scientific, and medical radio band (ISM band) network. We considered three communication modes of the ISM band for the channel characteristics analysis: the DJI Enhanced Spread Spectrum Technology (DESST) protocol, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The drone signal detection scheme extracts the drone signal from the environment mixed with the general signal. The drone DESST signal is identified through cross-correlation of the received signal. The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals are identified with the singular-value decomposition (SVD) algorithm by using the hopping characteristics. General and drone Wi-Fi signals are separated by in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) phase analysis over the measurement time. The windowed received signal strength indicator (RSSI) moving detection (WRMD) analysis identifies the drone Bluetooth signal according to the movement of the drone. The detected drone signal is channel modeled by the horizontal distance d according to the altitude . Finally, they verify their model by a ray-tracing simulation similar to the real environment. The model provides a simple and accurate prediction for designing future aerial communications systems according to changes in drone movement.

AB  - The "smartphone" is one of the individualized technical objects of the 21st century. This object is like a tool for socio-spatial reading of the territories thanks to the Internet of Things. The integration of geolocalised information with the Internet of Things opens the way to apprehend actual heritage of the cities in different ways.
   The relationship between digital and physical mobility in mapping physical territories in a sensitive way has been investigated only in a few studies and there is controversy about its predictors. Therefore we aimed to investigate the relationships between the invisible and non-visible elements of territories and users with their networks. We hypothesized that the circulations of 10 participants during 7 days in Strasbourg would enable us to trace a sample of images of the collective memory of the city relevant to its architecture and urbanity.
   The study is done by sending screenshots of the applications in use in the public space for at least three times in a day during a period of 1 week in the city of Strasbourg. The participants recorded also their daily journeys during this week via applications "Open GPS Tracker" or "Open GPX Tracker" (two open source applications). At the end of each day, they sent us both screenshots and open tracker gpx files of their journey and a total of 70 journeys were analysed. Afterwards the paths of the participants with their digital activities have been correlated by superimposing cartographically physical places frequented and digital activities carried out on each journey. By digital activities we considered all activities related to the use of smartphones, these activities may be related to the internet or not but they are categorically achievable through smartphones (messaging, communications applications, entertainment, etc.).
   We observed that the flow elements, such as public transport, constituted a good physical place where the diversity of digital activities was increased. Furthermore we saw that the nature of the subject's presence in the public space (rest, passage, movement via the different systems of transport, etc.) was associated with his/her digital movements. Moreover, some physical locations were more appropriate for digital activities than the others interestingly.
   Our work with a modest sample offered clues of the emergence of these new layers by the use of technological devices. Global computer knowledge is transformed into a mobile technical object and shared worldwide via smartphones. These objects are not just mere results of global knowledge, but they also produce socio-territorial knowledge by revealing the relations between the invisible or non-visible elements of territories and users. In other words, the people's digital and physical mobility with new individualized objects forms new layers of territories that we name Mobile Territories. We found and illustrated with many attractive examples, for the first time, that the nature of the digital activities of the participants is shaped according to their physical location and own speed. And vice-versa, the physical location appeared to be augmented according to digital activities. By establishing connections between the digital activities and physical location, we understood that the both are moving in accordance with their relationships.
   Possible readings of the morphological and social characteristics of cities via layers of Mobile Territories, the consequences and the effects of these invisible layers would be remarkable for planners and architects.

AB  - While many jurisdictions have seen the recent failure of market and state mechanisms to respond to a crisis of housing provision and to the collapse of markets, Australia's housing prices have experienced primarily ongoing growth, amongst persistent concerns regarding a lack of affordable stock across all tenures, and the concentration of ownership of housing assets in an ageing and shrinking demographic. In this context and building on a tradition of self-organised housing through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there exists a range of self-organised efforts for housing provision. However, the sector is poorly known and relatively under-researched. Consequently, this paper presents a review of various forms of direct self-organised housing provision in Australia, and of affiliated advocacy and lobbying efforts. The paper uses community economies and slow housing frameworks to present a dynamic and diverse arena for future research.

AB  - In equatorial, hot-humid tropical climates, users of naturally ventilated environments are commonly susceptible to heat discomfort caused by high air temperatures and thus require more air movement to improve thermal comfort. To evaluate the influence of relative humidity and air speed on the occupant's thermal perception, field studies were conducted in naturally ventilated and fan-assisted classrooms in Sao Luis City, North-Eastern Brazil. Indoor environmental variables were measured alongside questionnaires, focusing on thermal environment and air movement evaluation. The results indicated that relative humidity had a significant negative impact on thermal perception when the operative temperature was above 30 degrees C, while airspeed played a key role in reducing thermal discomfort. Despite the contribution of internal air movement, it was concluded that, when the indoor operative temperature exceeded 31 degrees C, mechanical cooling is required to achieve thermal comfort. The results also indicated the great acceptability of indoor conditions, as well as the influence of environmental variables on student's thermal perception in naturally ventilated spaces.

AB  - Ground subsidence occurrences have drastically increased in the Seoul area of the Republic of Korea. The structural defects of underground utilities were found to be the primary cause of ground subsidence based on several field investigations. This paper presents a risk model that assesses the probability of occurrence of ground subsidence along railways. In this study, support vector machine (SVM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) approaches were successfully employed to develop an artificial neural network (ANN)-based risk model. The risk model, in conjunction with a database composed of underground utilities and geological boring data along urban railway networks, was utilized to develop a hazard map system. A limited field experimental program was conducted for the purpose of verification, resulting in a promising tool to effectively maintain railway networks.

This article explores points of convergence and tension between African uprisings and the M4BL, with a focus on two movements at the intersection of education and activism: Nigerian Occupy protests and the Fees Must Fall movement in South Africa. Ultimately, I make the case for more engagement on the part of U.S. scholars and activists with struggles in Africa and other global contexts, in the interest of research and solidarity practices that value Black lives everywhere.

AB  - The ichthyofauna of the Taquari River, one of the main tributaries of the South Pantanal, has been studied since the 1970s; however, there is a gap on the studies about the ichthyofauna present on the small adventitious streams of this highly dendritic system. These streams are small tributaries that flow directly into large rivers (mainstem), at least three orders greater in magnitude. The aim of this study was to analyze the structure of the ichthyofauna of five adventitious streams of the Upper Taquari River, South Pantanal, evaluating its temporal variation (dry and wet season) and the relation to the habitat characteristics and the conservation of the streams. Thirty-seven species were collected, from which 14 are exclusive to the Paraguay River basin, one species [Apteronotus albifrons (Linnaeus, 1766)] could represent a new record for this basin, and six species need taxonomic confirmation. The analysis indicated only the existence of spatial variation in the ichthyofauna structure of the streams sampled, with the similarity patterns related to the distance between the streams and to their conditions of conservation. The stream with greater size and preserved riparian forest was the one with the highest values of fish diversity and evenness. On the other hand, the stream with the smallest percentage of riparian forest and highest proximity to urban area presented the lowest diversity. The small size of these adventitious systems should serve as protection against large predators, which have their access to those areas hampered by their own size. Otherwise, the mainstem may also act as source of dispersal of small-bodied schooling fishes to the adventitious streams, where the greater heterogeneity of habitats and the presence of riparian vegetation should offer shelter and food supply for small species.

AB  - Statistics show that economic activity in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is significantly unequally dispersed over the various regions (44 regions). These regions are also spatially dispersed and it could be argued that such regional diversity and dispersal result in spatial isolation. On the other hand, it seems plausible that there does in fact exist some level of economic integration between the regions. If this is, in fact, the case, the neo-classical Solow (1956) growth model suggests that the regions should experience some level of convergence. The convergence hypothesis is assessed in this article using regional productivity levels as measured by gross value added per worker, which includes an analysis of the degree of convergence between the regions by testing for beta and sigma convergence. This paper applies cross-sectional and panel linear regressions to test for beta-convergence, while sigma-convergence is assessed through the coefficient of variation and unit root hypothesis of the regional productivity levels. The article finds evidence of beta-convergence and sigma-convergence in regional productivity levels across the regions and over the set period.

AB  - Cities are highly dynamic systems, whose resilience is affected by the interconnectedness between "hard" and "soft" infrastructures. "Hard infrastructures" are the functional networks with physical elements providing goods or services. "Soft infrastructures" (culture, governance, and social patterns) encompass the social networks, make the hard infrastructures work, and are vital for understanding the consequences of disasters and the effectiveness of emergency management. Although the dynamic interactions between such infrastructures are highly complex in the case of the occurrence of hazardous events, it is fundamental to analyze them. The reliability of hard infrastructures during emergency management contributes to keep alive the social capital, while the community, its networks, and its own resilience influence the service provided by infrastructural systems. Resilience-thinking frameworks overcome the limits of the traditional engineering-oriented approaches, accounting for complexity of socio-technical-organizational networks, bridging the static and dynamic components of disasters across pre- and postevent contexts. The present work develops an integrated approach to operatively assess resilience for the hard and soft infrastructural systems, aiming at modeling the complexity of their interaction by adopting a graph theory-based approach and social network analysis. The developed approach has been experimentally implemented for assessing the integrated resilience of the hard/soft infrastructures during the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake.

AB  - Unsurprisingly, land use problems usually happened when there are significant changes which give the bad impact especially for the environment change. Land conversion occurred as well as the growth of socio-economic activities which require housing and better facilities. Land conversion often goes hand in hand with problems such as loss of farmland, food security problems, floods, landslides and other issues. The aim of this research is to identify the social capital impacts on land conversion. The object is land use around the national road of Pandaan which connects between Malang and Surabaya City of East Java, Indonesia. The high score of social capital depends on three variables, they are trust, social network and community participation. Data affiliation needed to measure the social capital through questionnaire survey towards total 203 respondents. The research used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and the result shows that trust variable obtain 0,21, community participation on 0,08, social agreement and commitment variable equal to 0,53. It means that all of variables are on the positive value. The trust variable among them affects the community decision to sell their land.

AB  - The movement known as '15M' marked a turning point in Spanish politics, both within the sphere of social mobilisation and in the institutional arena. Not only on account of the swift and broad dissemination of this movement of those who were up in arms, but also in terms of its influence on the agenda of the political parties.
   The movement emerged in May 2011, coinciding with the local elections. Although the epi-centre of this phenomenon was the Puerta del Sol square in Madrid, it underwent a rapid process of dissemination, spreading to Spain's major cities. In Andalusia, the movement quickly made its presence felt, manifested through the strategy of 'taking over' and camping out in town squares until the local elections of 22 May 2011 had come to an end.
   Undoubtedly, one of the most salient elements of this phenomenon of social mobilisation was the speed with which it spread throughout the country and the high level of 'defiance' involved in its collective action, occupying town squares in the days leading up to the local elections.
   We are interested in studying the start of this phenomenon of mobilisation known as the 15M Movement in Andalusia, and its impact on the upcoming local elections. We are focusing our attention on factors that may have influenced the emergence of early manifestations of outrage in the days leading up to the elections, and on the effects of these collective actions on the electoral behaviour of citizens.
   Hence, we shall seek answers to the following questions: a) Which factors facilitated the spread of 'camp-outs' and other public actions that occurred as part of the 15M Movement during the days leading up to the local elections? and b) How did the emergence of 15M influence the increase of 'outraged' voting tendencies?.
   In order to answer the questions that motivated this study, we created two models of analysis: the first aims to explain the fast spread of 'early' expressions of the 15M Movement in Andalusia; and the second seeks to analyse its influence on electoral behaviour.
   More specifically, by applying model A we aim to ascertain which factors might have facilitated the coordination of camp-out actions in the municipalities of Andalusia. In other words, we are looking to identify which local contexts fostered the spread of the collective action that began in the Puerta del Sol square. To do this, the model encompasses many of the major currents that explain the emergence of belligerent collective action. Hence, the analysis incorporates key concepts in the study of initiating movements, such as the Structure of Political Opportunities measured as 'access' to the political system, considering the effective number of parties, in order to account for the political context. It also encompasses factors that provide an account of the social context: networks of micro-mobilisation at a local level, specifically associationism; and urban style, in other words, the size of the municipality. Finally, with regard to socio-economic factors, we included the impact of the financial crisis, measuring the difference in the unemployment rate between 2007 and 2009.
   Model B aims to explain the phenomenon of the 'protest vote' and the potential impact of the 15M Movement on the pull effect with regard to this vote. Specifically, the aim is to determine whether the outrage expressed early on in town squares also translated into what happened in the polling stations of those towns. Ultimately, the aim is to reconstruct the mechanisms that explain a type of electoral behaviour: the manifestation of protest in the polling stations. In this respect, we studied the literature that seeks to explain the influence of the political atmosphere on electoral preferences. To this end, we examined the relationship between the intensity of collective action as part of the 15M Movement as well as the impact of the crisis and the 'protest vote'. The 'protest vote' has been defined as ballot slips that are left blank or voided, or votes cast for minority parties, and it has been expressed as the difference between the local elections of 2011 and 2007.
   This study encompasses municipalities in Andalusia with over 50,000 inhabitants, and so we gathered data about the protest events that took place in these municipalities during the period leading up to the local elections in 2011. The first stage of fieldwork involved designing and applying a detailed search protocol, along the lines of the Protest Event Analysis (Fillieule & Jimenez, 2003), applied to newspapers and other digital resources from each locality, which reported on the presence of camp-outs in the squares of the municipalities included in the study. Hence, the unit of observation is the protest event, which has been defined taking into account the place and date on which it occurred. Having gathered this information, a summary indicator was constructed: the spread of the 15M phenomenon. This indicator was allocated to the database 'Research in the municipality, where the unit of observation was Andalusian municipalities with over 50,000 inhabitants. Furthermore, each municipality in the study was assigned the variable 'protest vote', constructed as the difference of the sum total of votes left blank or voided, and votes cast for minority parties, based on data provided by Spain's Interior Ministry.
   We carried out multivariate analyses for each of the models, and the main finding yielded by this research is that the political and social dimensions provide better explanations than the economic dimension for the expression of 'outrage' in the street. Furthermore, it clearly shows that formal and informal political factors seem to be key when explaining indignation and outrage at the polling stations.
   Specifically, this study has clarified that the effects of the economic crisis have not had a relevant effect on collective action; on the contrary, the early emergence of the 15M movement is associated with a crisis of political representation, given that the 'besieged squares' are located in municipalities with less political party plurality in the legislative sphere. Furthermore, they present structural factors that facilitate collective action, such as urban style and the density of their micromobilisation networks. Moreover, the contextual effect of these acts of defiance by early adopters of the 15M Movement had an important impact at the polling stations, promoting the option of protest voting among citizens.

AB  - Coastal developments continue to increase in Western Australia (WA) despite limited information on environmental consequences for coastal dolphins. As an example, a gas processing facility was constructed near the town of Onslow in the Pilbara region in 2012-2015. Boat-based surveys to estimate abundance, density and movement patterns of two species of coastal dolphins in waters around the Onslow development site and Thevenard Island began in 2015. Employing POPAN mark-recapture models, the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) total abundance estimate corrected for the unmarked proportion of the population was 79 SE +/- 24 (CI 43-148) for Onslow. There were insufficient resightings of Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis) to model abundance accurately. The densities were similar between both sites for each species; 0.59 bottlenose dolphins per km(2) in coastal Onslow waters versus 0.83 bottlenose dolphins per km(2) around Thevenard Island and 0.36 humpback dolphins per km(2) at Onslow and 0.38 humpback dolphins per km(2) around Thevenard Island. The density of humpback dolphins, although low, is comparable to estimates across their range. Movements of the two species between the island and coastal waters of the mainland was not detected. The Australian snubfin dolphin was not sighted during these surveys. The study confirms that Indo-Pacific bottlenose and Australian humpback dolphins use the waters near Onslow, however the low re-capture rates suggest that their home ranges are larger than, and only partially overlapping, the 128 km(2) area. More intense sampling effort would be required to precisely estimate abundance for humpback dolphins. Crown Copyright (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper is aimed at stressing the political, moral and intellectual legacy of Carlo Rosselli, eighty years after his assassination together with his brother Nello, occurred in France in 1937. While a vast historical literature is devoted to the movement of Justice and Freedom and many political circles are dedicated to the Rosselli brothers in several Italian cities, despite some exceptions, the significance of Rosselli's liberal socialism has not been yet adequately reconsidered from the viewpoint of political philosophy. Therefore, the following paper is aimed at reconstructing the main theoretical significance of both Liberal socialism and the movement Justice and Freedom in the light of present debates on social justice and liberal democracies. In the end I will try to support the idea that liberal socialism is a persistent tradition because of the relentless claims for social justice, the defense of individual freedoms and the respect of human dignity.

AB  - Editors Alana Gerecke and Laura Levin frame the central concerns and interventions of the issue. They insist that in this historical moment of Women's Marches, Black Lives Matter, Occupy, and the Idle No More round dance revolution,' of flash mobs and pop-up culture, of relational art and postdramatic performance practices, we must think seriously about what is at stake in gathering and moving together in public spaces. Increasingly mainstream and increasingly evident, these collective reimaginings of quotidian practices, cultural consumption, and political resistance challenge the atomized ways we normally move through cities. In doing so, they pose questions of aesthetics, use, access, exclusion, density, and mobility in resolutely physical terms (Gerecke 42). What does it mean to show up and, more specifically, move together in these collective arrangements? How do different choreographic arrangements of public assembly shape and re-shape the social, the aesthetic, and the political?

AB  - With more and more high-rise building springing into the cities, the movement of pedestrians on stairs is of great importance for the evacuation of these facilities; the topic of human performance on stairs has attracted a lot of researcher to study. However, there is still a lack of analysis of specific situations, such as mid-landing and merging behaviors. In this paper we employ a modified version of the Optimal Steps Model, modified by taking block-based floor field into consideration under open boundary conditions, to reproduce movement at mid-landing and study performance of occupants in stairwell. Movements on this kind of stairs are simulated and studied with the help of extended model: achieved results are in accord with previous research in respect of specific flow and fundamental diagram. Lane formations on stairs come into being before mid-landing area through simulations. Furthermore most people reach at the mid-landing by the outside stairs at higher density due to more space and less force from other agents, which is induced that outside of the stairs is good for evacuation. At last the model is implemented to study the effect of stairs geometry on merging behaviors, and it is found when corridor is connected to the landing opposite to the incoming stairs, this structure is biased in favor of occupants from stairs. The work in this paper is intended to better understand movement during stair evacuations and develop a technical foundation for codes and standards requirements as well as egress modeling techniques.

AB  - Considering that urban areas may suffer more substantial losses than riparian farmlands during floods, diverting floodwater into riparian areas for temporal detention is expected to mitigate flood damage in downstream urban areas. In this study, an assessment has been conducted to evaluate the effect of flood mitigation through riparian detention in response to a changing climate in the Tou-Chien River basin of Taiwan. An integrated 1D-2D flow model was used to simulate the movement of flood wave in the main stream and the overbank flow inundating into the nearby lowlands. Based on the numerical simulation results, the flooding extents in the basin corresponding to different return periods of flood using existing flood prevention infrastructures were investigated. A detention strategy by lowering the levee along the riparian farmlands was proposed to avoid severe flooding in the densely populated urban areas of the basin. Research findings showed that the proposed detention measure can completely protect the downstream areas from overbank flooding when a flood having 20-yr period occurs, and can effectively alleviate the downstream flooding area from 27.4 to for a flood possessing 200-yr period.

AB  - This article aims to analyze the interaction among the different territories of male prostitution in Goiania, state of Goias, and the basic concepts regarding the subject. For that purpose, we adopted as methodology both bibliographic and qualitative researches. Through a bibliographic survey, we mapped the territory, along with its conceptions within the scope of Geography and other areas of knowledge. Four participants answered a structured interview reporting observations about male prostitution. We observed that territories are part of a broader context, not restricted to geographic areas, including image, text and body. Goiania has fixed prostitution territories, comprised of a quadrangle in the city's Central neighborhood. In this area, the so-called male escorts and their symbolic and mobile territories are found. Hence, this research identified the movement and the formation of mobile and symbolic spots in the above-mentioned region. Fixed spots occur during non-business hours.

AB  - The article analyzes the repression of the occupation of the urban public space in Brazil by the subalternized layers of the population, from episodes that occurred at distinct and distant times and in space - the destruction of the "Cabeca de Porco" Rio de Janeiro - RJ), the occupation/destruction of the community of Pinheirinho (Sao Jose dos Campos - SP), Cracolandia (Sao Paulo - SP) and the building occupied by the "Lanceiros Negros" (Porto Alegre - RS). The general objective of the research is to discuss the biopolitical management of the subalternized classes of the Brazilian urban population throughout the history of the country. The research problem lies in the following question: to what extent, in contemporary times, the institutions of the country still remain committed to the "absolutist fantasy" of a control of the bodies that was characteristic of the spaces of production marked by the slave regime? It is based on the hypothesis that the truculent/violent mode such as the evictions analyzed in the text were conducted, together with the justifications used to legitimize them, allow us to highlight a undulating movement between democracy and absolutism that marks the history of Brazilian institutions. The research was envisaged using the phenomenological method.

Sediment cores collected from the floor of oxbow lakes indicate the increasing contamination of lakes with heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr) over the last fifty years, owing to the development of transport and industry. Little is known, however, about how various factors can enhance or impede the migration of metallic contaminants between the pollution source and lake ecosystems. To untangle these complex processes, the metal distribution was studied throughout the waters and sediments of an urban zone-river-oxbow lake systemin the Middle Odra Valley, Germany/Poland. As expected the degree of metal contamination is highest (>10 enrichment) at low distance (<1 km) from the human source of pollution. Using correlations with highly mobile in water Na+ and Cl- ions, we reveal, however, that due to hydrological factors some metals (Cu, Cd, and Pb) are up to >5 times enriched in the sediments of lakes even >10 km distant from the nearest source of pollution. The lakes that are permanently connected with the Odra River or that are frequently flooded are most vulnerable for contamination. Although the metal concentrations are especially enriched in the smallest grain size fractions, this portion of metals seems to be less bioavailable with respect to that accumulated with in the larger grain size fractions. Concentrations of metallic contaminants in the bottom sediments of the Middle Odra lakes are generally lower than in other oxbow lakes. Having untangled the variety of processes controlling metal migration in a complex river-oxbow lake system operating on these low metal concentrations, allows us to believe that our approach could become a paradigm for future trace element studies in a variety of similar lowland systems across the World.

AB  - The disappearance of 43 students from Ayotzinapa in 2014 breathed life into a broad social movement. What occurred this time to generate a broad mobilization of citizens? To answer this question, I believe we need to understand why and how Mexican society has framed the Ayotzinapa events. My starting hypothesis is that the Ayotzinapa events have produced a social process of collective trauma, and I will support this with Jeffrey Alexander's proposal of cultural trauma, rarely used when analyzing collective action. The analysis is based on ethnographic work carried out over one year (September 2014-2015) during the different demonstrations to show solidarity with the parents of the disappeared students, which were held in Mexico City, and 70 interviews held at the national demonstration on 26th September 2015 to commemorate a year since the 43 rural teachers' college students went missing.

AB  - The widespread use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine to treat pathogenic bacteria has resulted in the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). Wild animals may enable the spread of pathogenic and non-pathogenic ARB when they are exposed to reservoirs (e.g., contaminated soil, water, or crops) and carry ARB in and on their bodies to other environments. We tested for the presence of ARB in four songbird species in southwest Michigan across a gradient of land use. Our specific objectives were to: 1) quantify the prevalence of ARB found in the gut microbiome of birds; 2) identify the specific bacteria exhibiting resistance; 3) assess whether ARB prevalence and identity varied among bird species; and 4) assess whether anthropogenic land use influenced the prevalence and identity of ARB found on birds. We sampled birds across a land use gradient consisting of urban, agricultural, and natural land covers using a randomized, spatially-balanced sampling design and cultured bacteria from fecal samples in the presence of three different antibiotics (amoxicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin). Overall prevalence of ARB was high, with 88% of total birds carrying ARB resistant to one of three antibiotics that we tested. Resistance to amoxicillin was more common (83% of sampled birds) than resistance to tetracycline (15%) or ciprofloxacin (1%). Identified ARB were diverse, and included 135 isolates representing 5 bacterial phyla and 22 genera. There was no effect of land use on ARB prevalence, with 90% of sampled birds captured in rural sites and 85% of sampled birds in urban sites carrying ARB. We provide the first analysis of ARB prevalence across multiple bird species and land uses utilizing a spatially-balanced, randomized study design. Our results demonstrate that nearly all sampled birds carried at least some ARB, and that they may serve as important dispersal agents of ARB across large spatial scales. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

CP  - 11th International Conference on Mechanical Engineering, Automation and Control Systems (MEACS)
AB  - At present, cyber-security issues of industrial control systems occupy one of the key niches in a state system of planning and management Functional disruption of these systems via cyber-attacks may lead to emergencies related to loss of life, environmental disasters, major financial and economic damage, or disrupted activities of cities and settlements. There is then an urgent need to develop protection methods against cyber-attacks. This paper studied the results of cyber-attack interval forecasting with a pre-set intensity level of cyber-attacks. Interval forecasting is the forecasting of one interval from two predetermined ones in which a future value of the indicator will be obtained. For this, probability estimates of these events were used. For interval forecasting, a probabilistic neural network with a dynamic updating value of the smoothing parameter was used. A dividing bound of these intervals was determined by a calculation method based on statistical characteristics of the indicator. The number of cyber-attacks per hour that were received through a honeypot from March to September 2013 for the group 'zeppo-norcal' was selected as the indicator.

AB  - Zoonotic Visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a neglected tropical disease that in the Americas is caused by the infection of Leishmania infantum and the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is the main parasite reservoir in urban areas. The parasite is mainly transmitted by populations of the sibling species Lutzomyia longipalpis that has been spreading in countries including Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and more recently Uruguay. Although bionomic parameters such as population survival and the duration of the gonotrophic cycle are critical in evaluating vector capacity, field studies have rarely been applied to sand fly populations. The present study sought to evaluate basic bionomic parameters related to the vectorial capacity of the (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B population of the Lu. longipalpis complex in a visceral leish-maniasis area of Sao Paulo state. The daily survival rate, the duration of the gonotrophic cycle and the dispersal pattern were evaluated through the mark-release-recapture method. A total of 1,547 males and 401 females were marked and released in five experiments carried out between February 2013 and February 2014. The higher recapture rates occurred within 100 meters of the release point and the estimated daily survival rates varied between 0.69 and 0.89 for females and between 0.69 and 0.79 for males. The minimum duration of the gonotrophic cycle observed was five days. The absolute population size, calculated ranged from 900 to 4,857 females and from 2,882 to 9,543 males. Our results demonstrate a high survival rate of this vector population and low dispersal that could be associated with the presence of all necessary conditions for its establishment and maintenance in the peridomiciles of this area. Our findings contribute to the basic data necessary for the understanding of ZVL dynamics and the evaluation of the implementation of prevention and control measures.

AB  - Contemporary studies demonstrate that rodent bites do not occur frequently. However, a huge number of cases were reported from Peshawar vale, Pakistan during 2016. Two species, the local black rat Rattus rattus (Linnaeus, 1758) and the invasive brown rat Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout, 1769) might be the suspected cause. Several studies indicated the invasion of brown rats into Pakistan presumably via port city of Karachi. In this study, we modeled geospatial distribution of rodent bites for risk assessment in the region. Bite cases reported to tertiary care lady reading hospital were monitored from January 1 to August 31, 2016. Among 1747 cases, statistically informative data (n = 1295) was used for analyses. MaxEnt algorithm was employed for geospatial modeling, taking into account various environmental variables (temperature, precipitation, humidity, and elevation) and anthropogenic factors (human population density, distance from roads, distance from water channels, and land use/land cover). MaxEnt results revealed that urban slums (84.5%) are at highest risk followed by croplands (10.9%) and shrublands (2.7%). Anthropogenic factors affecting incidence of rodent bites included host density (contribution: 34.7), distance from water channels (3.2), land use/land cover (2.8), and distance from roads (2). Most of the cases occurred within a radius of 0.3 km from roads and 5 km from water channels. Rodent bite incidence is currently at its peak in Peshawar vale. Factors significantly affecting rodents' bite activity and their distribution and dispersal include urbanization, distance from roads, and water channels. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of invasion by brown rat on bite incidence.

AB  - The purpose of this review is to expand understanding of the ways culturally, ethnically, and racially diverse youth have begun to reimagine urban and rural spaces using digital storytelling and photovoice, two methods that often fall under the broad field of youth participatory action research. To explain the conditions under which these methods favor movement toward socially just ideas and actions, we also build on and extend research in critical youth empowerment to call attention to the relational nature of the kind of work that positions youth as coresearchers and democratically engaged citizens. Of importance are the availability of safe, nurturing spaces that foster youth engagement, the quality of relationships between youth and adults, and the extent to which decisions and actions remain in the hands of youth. Finally, this review considers the implications for further research and what it could mean to reimagine schools and communities as spaces where youth have a voice as civically engaged citizens.

AB  - Among the climate change-induced threats to coastal regions, sea level rise is considered as the most serious one. Most large and prosperous cities in China are located along coastal regions and are thus likely to suffer huge economic impacts when a sea level rise occurs. The effects on coastal regions can also be transmitted to inland regions through movement of labor and trade, thus affecting regional disparity. To strengthen evidence-based policies of abatement and adaptation, it is essential to assess the economic impacts of sea level rise in addition to the physical impacts already investigated in the literature. Based on data from GIS analysis of flooded areas, this study uses a state-of-the-art technique (TERM-China, a multiregional general equilibrium model of China) to evaluate the economic impacts of sea level rise. The simulation results suggest that if the sea level rise coincides with sudden-onset extreme storm surges, the coastal regions' GDP loss would reach 11% in 2050, wherein Tianjin, Shanghai, and Jiangsu would have the most severe losses with over a 20% decline in their individual GDP in 2050. At the sectoral level, high capital-intensive sectors have more significant output losses. Our results also indicate that sea level rise could cause more unemployment in developed coastal regions, drive people to other developing inland regions, and even convert some mega-cities into middle-scale cities.

AB  - There are several primate species with high risk of extinction in small forest fragments disturbed by human activities. However, some species exhibit high ecological plasticity, which allows them to persist in human-modified landscapes. The main goal of this study is to examine the relative roles of vegetation (mean distance among trees and mean canopy cover), human disturbance (distance to the road, distance to the fragment edge and edge type), and habitat spatial configuration (spatial autocorrelation index, category of quadrat - position within the fragment/fragment type) on the habitat selection of the black-tufted marmoset Callithrix penicillata in forest patches. We selected forest patches near and away from roads/urban areas, in southern Minas Gerais state, south-eastern Brazil. We used generalized linear mixed models to explain the presence of black-tufted marmoset in those patches. Our results show that black-tufted marmoset tend to occupy forest fragments closer to roads/urban areas, and consequently are under the influence of anthropic disturbance. In addition to the area delimited by these fragments, there is a preference for edge environments, where disturbances are exacerbated and the ecological conditions are suitable for exploitation by the black-tufted marmoset (supply of gum trees and reduced risk of competition). We suggest that a cross-habitat spillover by marmoset occur from forests to small habitat patches close to human-modified areas, such as those in proximity to roads and urban zones.

AB  - Towards the end of the decade long Iran-Iraq war, Saddam Hussein launched a deadly attack against the Kurds, known as the Anfal Campaign, killing more than a hundred thousand. One of the largest acts of genocide occurred on 18 March 1988 in the Kurdish city of Halabja. On that day, sweet-smelling poison gas was poured over the city, killing at least five thousand. Since 2001 Kurdish moviemakers have memorialized the tragedy of the Halabja massacre by producing cinematic dramas and narrative documentaries. These films are part of a discourse of authenticity and a politics of culture that permeate the Kurdish independence movement. This essay proposes that Halabja films can be divided into three stages: the era of consolidation, 2000 to 2009; the golden era, 2009 to early 2014; and the fall which followed the fall of Mosul to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Each era reveals new attitudes towards politics, society, and the massacre.

AB  - Modern land development is regarded as having begun in the 1960s and since then the pattern of land cover has changed considerably in many parts of the world. The majority of change detection studies have used Landsat MSS, TM, ETM +, and Landsat LDCM imagery and other satellite imagery to quantify and map land use changes for many parts of the globe from the early 1970s. In most applications however, (e.g., Balcik, Sanli, Goksel, Ulugtekin, & Dogru, 2009) land use changes dating back to the 60s are desirable. Given that most images start from the 70s, one possibility of overcoming this is to extend the timeline of change detection analysis beyond the first Landsat satellite imagery by cross-referencing with CORONA imagery to include the 1960s. The main objective of this study is to employ CORONA and Landsat images to perform change detection analysis using the Kurdistan region as a case study. Kurdistan region covers an area of 44957.1 km(2) and the study period ranges from 1969 to 2014. The results of the maximum likelihood classification process for CORONA images show that these images may be classified successfully and accurately, showcasing the fact that the timeline of change detection analysis may be extended by using CORONA's unique historical images to include the period prior to the start of Landsat missions in 1972. For Kurdistan region, CORONA played a pivot role as baseline map as many of the changes occurred after 1974, when the Kurdish revolution ended. Its land use and land cover changes have been significant and may be divided into three stages: the first stage involves the destruction and demolition of the landscape between 1974 and 1991. The second stage is the stage of Kurdish freedom and peace involving minor changes in the landscape of the Kurdistan region that began in 1992 and lasted until 2002. Finally, the last stage is between late 2003 and the present date, period which, economic growth and population increase were the main factors influencing urban growth in the Kurdistan region. A positive non-linear relationship (R-2 = 0.89) was found between population increase and urban growth using regression analysis for the study area during period 1969 to 2014. This case study therefore highlights the possibility of combining both CORONA and Landsat to study LULC change of any region prior to 1970s.

AB  - The Asia Pacific Leaders in Malaria Alliance (APLMA) have committed to eliminate malaria from the region by 2030. Papua New Guinea (PNG) has the highest malaria burden in the Asia-Pacific region but with the intensification of control efforts since 2005, transmission has been dramatically reduced and Plasmodium vivax is now the dominant malaria infection in some parts of the country. To gain a better understanding of the transmission dynamics and migration patterns of P. vivax in PNG, here we investigate population structure in eight geographically and ecologically distinct regions of the country. A total of 219 P. vivax isolates (16-30 per population) were successfully haplotyped using 10 microsatellite markers. A wide range of genetic diversity (H-e = 0.37-0.87, R-s= 3.60-7.58) and significant multilocus linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed in six of the eight populations (I-A(S) = 0.08-0.15 p-value < 0.05) reflecting a spectrum of transmission intensities across the country. Genetic differentiation between regions was evident (Jost's D = 0.07-0.72), with increasing divergence of populations with geographic distance. Overall, P. vivax isolates clustered into three major genetic populations subdividing the Mainland lowland and coastal regions, the Islands and the Highlands. P. vivax gene flow follows major human migration routes, and there was higher gene flow amongst Mainland parasite populations than among Island populations. The Central Province (samples collected in villages close to the capital city, Port Moresby), acts as a sink for imported infections from the three major endemic areas. These insights into P. vivax transmission dynamics and population networks will inform targeted strategies to contain malaria infections and to prevent the spread of drug resistance in PNG.

AB  - Alteration of estuarine shorelines associated with increased urbanization can significantly impact biota and food webs. This study determined the impact of shoreline alteration on growth and movement of the estuarine fish Fundulus heteroclitus in a tributary of the Delaware Coastal Bays. Fundulus heteroclitus is abundant along the east coast of the USA, and is an important trophic link between marsh and subtidal estuary. The restricted home range of F. heteroclitus allowed discrete sampling, and fish growth comparisons, along 35-65-m long stretches of fringing Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis marsh, riprap, and bulkhead. Fundulus heteroclitus were tagged with decimal Coded Wire Tags. Of 725 tagged F. heteroclitus, 89 were recaptured 30-63 days later. Mean growth rate (0.06-0.15 mm day(-1) across all shoreline types) was greatest at riprap, lowest at Spartina and Phragmites, and intermediate at bulkhead, where growth was not significantly different from any other shoreline. This suggests that discernible environments exist along different shoreline types, even at the scale of tens of meters. No difference in movement distance was detected at different shoreline types; most individuals displayed a high degree of site fidelity. Forty-seven percent were recaptured within 5 m of their tagging location, although alongshore movements up to 475 m were recorded. Estimates of relative F. heteroclitus productivity, using relative density data from a concurrent study, were highest along Spartina and Phragmites, intermediate at riprap, and lowest at bulkhead. Therefore, despite greater growth rates along riprap than at vegetated shores, armoring reduces abundance sufficiently to negatively impact localized productivity of F. heteroclitus.

AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal, 1855) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is native to East Asia and was first detected in Europe in 2004 in Switzerland. In Hungary, it was first recorded in the capital, Budapest, in 2013. Halyomorpha halys is an invasive polyphagous species, which is able to cause severe damage to a wide range of crops, and it is also considered an urban pest in America and Europe. By 2018, the status of H. halys as an agricultural pest causing major damage to cultivated plants in Hungary has been confirmed only by a single study carried out in 2016 at a farm located in Budapest. In the past few years, the pest has received significant media coverage in Hungary due to the increasing nuisance problems. However, detailed and reliable information on its spread were still missing. Therefore, in 2016, an extensive survey was initiated to obtain data on the distribution of H. halys in the country. This study was primarily based on the use of citizen science, which was completed with information requests from the members of professional organizations as well as active data collection by the authors. The results of this first extensive survey revealed the wide distribution of H. halys in Hungary, with mass occurrence of the species at several locations throughout the country, especially in the region of Budapest. These data highlight the rapid dispersal of H. halys and call for attention to the threat the pest poses to Hungarian plant production.

AB  - This article addresses debates in the post-Occupy movement' over the resistant potential of prefigurative politics, and asks how prefiguration can be conceptualized as resistance in relation to activists' understanding of politics, power and social change. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with activists in New York City, it looks at anarchist politics after Occupy Wall Street (OWS). Here, the absence of spectacular moments of confrontation and the removal of OWS's space of mobilization and organizing challenged activists to adjust their prefigurative politics to the shifting spaces post-Occupy. This paper advances our understanding of prefigurative politics by conceptualizing prefiguration as resistance in consideration of the elements of intent', recognition', opposition/confrontation' and creation'. Following this, it introduces the logic of subtraction' as a concept to understand the resistant potential of prefiguration. Here, I argue that rather than being in an antagonistic relationship with dominant power, resistant prefiguration aims for the creation of alternatives while subtracting power from the state, capital or any other external authority in order to render it obsolete. This understanding allows for a nuanced consideration of the proactive and creative potential of prefiguration, as well as of the difficulties of prefigurative practices in shifting movement spaces.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are thought to be potential incubators of antibiotic resistance. Persistence of commonly used antibiotics in wastewater may increase the potential for selection of resistance genes transferred between bacterial populations, some of which might pose a threat to human health. In this study, we measured the concentrations of ten antibiotics in wastewater plant influents and effluents, and in surface waters up- and downstream from two Charlotte area treatment facilities. We performed Illumina shotgun sequencing to assay the microbial community and resistome compositions at each site across four time points from late winter to mid-summer of 2016. Antibiotics are present throughout wastewater treatment, and elevated concentrations of multiple antibiotics are maintained in moving stream water downstream of effluent release. While some human gut and activated sludge associated taxa are detectable downstream, these seem to attenuate with distance while the core microbial community of the stream remains fairly consistent. We observe the slight suppression of functional pathways in the downstream microbial communities, including amino acid, carbohydrate, and nucleic acid metabolism, as well as nucleotide and amino acid scavenging. Nearly all antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potentially pathogenic taxa are removed in the treatment process, though a few ARG markers are elevated downstream of effluent release. Taken together, these results represent baseline measurements that future studies can utilize to help to determine which factors control the movement of antibiotics and resistance genes through aquatic urban ecosystems before, during, and after wastewater treatment.

AB  - Morrowan, Atokan, and Desmoinesian (Lower-Middle Pennsylvanian) clastic strata in the Forest City (Iowa, northwest Missouri, eastern Nebraska, and Kansas) and Illinois Basins on the North American midcontinent record the interaction between fluctuations in eustatic sea-level and major tectonic events. One of three major Paleozoic eustatic sea-level lows occurred near the Mississippian/Pennsylvanian boundary and was followed by a eustatic rise that continued into Late Pennsylvanian time. Alleghenian mountain building that is linked to the creation of the Pangean supercontinent also began during latest Mississippian time and continued until latest Pennsylvanian or earliest Permian time. Detrital-zircon geochronology and stratigraphic descriptions allow reconstruction of sediment dispersal patterns associated with these events. Our detrital-zircon signatures from Morrowan-lower Desmoinesian strata in the Illinois Basin are interpreted to reflect a change from regional drainages that reworked underlying Mississippian strata to extensive extrabasinal fluvial systems that supplied detritus shed from southeastern New-England. By middle Desmoinesian time, detrital-zircon signatures in the Illinois Basin are more similar to those from coeval units in the central Appalachian Basin, indicating a southward shift in the provenance of the fluvial systems. In the Forest City Basin, Morrowan strata are absent and our detrital-zircon data indicate that Atokan-early Desmoinesian sedimentation was dominated by regional fluvial systems that recycled underlying strata. The introduction of extrabasinal fluvial systems with New England headwaters in the middle Desmoinesian coincided with the overtopping of the Mississippi River Arch and depositional linking of the Forest City and Illinois Basins. The Forest City and Illinois Basins collectively contain an Early-Middle Pennsylvanian sedimentary record in the backbulge depozone of the Alleghenian foreland basin system that reflects overtopping of the forebulge located along the Cincinnati Arch and the effects of eustatic sea-level rise. These results lend credence to the previously proposed transcontinental fluvial systems during late Paleozoic time and help to better constrain their courses.

AB  - The article is very topical and of high scientific value as it covers the problems of regional exclusion emphasized in the EU strategic documents. Regions suffer from social and economic exclusion, which, in turn, induces high unemployment and crime rates, and leads to the flourishing of smuggling. The aim of this article is to estimate the level of the shadow economy in the regions of Lithuania over the period 2012 to 2016. The topic is very relevant to such transition economies as Lithuania with huge separation between regions and large cities. Deep social problems in regions, lack of job places and absence of investment along with high emigration rate and intensive population's movement to the largest cities lead to the growth of crime rate and high scope of the shadow economy. Calculations performed under the MIMIC model have shown that the share of indirect taxes, average income, the cases of cigarette smuggling, population of women per 1000 men, the number of criminal offences, children in social risk families and the number of tourists are the main causes for the emergence and growth/decline of the shadow economy level. The novelty of the article lies in the calculations that reveal a significantly higher level of the shadow economy in the regions than at the country level. Therefore, it is recommended to make calculations at the regional level in order to select measures to more effectively fight with the "shadow". Identified reasons allow formulating the following recommendations for responsible authorities: increase efficiency in tax system, since current excise tax policy has a positive impact on the level of poverty, especially at regional level, deepening of social problems, which as a result contribute to the growth of shadow economy; encourage women occupancy and emancipation and attract funding from national and international projects, to promote equal rights in researched regions; increase the level of attractiveness and security level in cities, promote FDI to cities, and effectively use money from the EU Structural Funds.

AB  - The spread of many invasive plants could be facilitated by their presence in urban areas that may act as dispersal centres and by climate warming. Cortaderia selloana, pampas grass, is native to South America and raises considerable concern worldwide as an introduction. We used Maxent niche modelling, based on occurrence records and on a set of simulated occurrence points with high probability of presence in urbanised areas in France, where the species was introduced and is still planted. We calibrated the model with current climate data coupled with several habitat variables and used it to predict range shifts of C. selloana under four climate change scenarios (RCP) for 2060. The results were consistent with the known ecology of the species and showed that the most important variables that explain the current distribution in the introduced area were mean annual minimum temperatures, sandy habitats, disturbed habitats and urbanised areas. While the species already occupies large areas along the western and Mediterranean coasts, the models predicted an expansion northward and inland to the east under future climates. The area of suitable habitats could increase by up to 69% under the RCP 8.5 climate scenario in 2060 and by 116% with the extra occurrences in urban/suburban areas. This latter scenario suggests that areas like public and private gardens or urban parks, where the species is currently cultivated, could contribute to increase the invasion risk under climate warming. The results provide predictions of potential environments for the species, which can be helpful for anticipating its spread.

AB  - Airports are located at the core of the production process, but can they also be where the revolutionary subject is hidden? We know what airports stand for nowadays, but have we pushed for what they could possibly stand for? Can airports, as a form of urban technology, be reimagined beyond their current roles of a space technology nexus driving capital movement? Can we imagine, idealize, and locate them somewhere else in a period dominated by the economy of time, where speed and accessibility matter the most? In this framework, this provocative essay aims to frame airports as a protest and public expression venue. Drawing inspiration from recent examples, such as the Stansted Airport protests in the UK, the Occupy Airports protests that occurred all around the United States, and touching upon the divergent example of Turkey's 15th of July night protests in 2016, I provide a glimpse of an alternative prospect for this key urban infrastructure.

AB  - Aims: Structural and compositional changes along post-fire succession modify plant community proneness to burn (flammability). The dominant regeneration strategies and life forms, and their interactions along post-fire succession, modulate these changes by affecting density, amount and connectivity of fuels. Depending on how flammability evolves during post-fire succession it may feed back negatively, neutrally or positively into fire probability and behaviour. Negative fire-vegetation feedbacks arise when communities increase flammability as stands age, while positive feedbacks occur where early stages have higher flammability than later stages. We characterized changes in vegetation structure and fuel characteristics with time since fire in sites where either resprouters maintained dominance (shrublands), or where colonizer trees reached the sites and dominate later post-fire stages (forests).
   Location: Northwestern Patagonia, Argentina.
   Methods: We measured vegetation structure and characterized fine fuels with the intercept pole method in stands of different post-fire age in 18 shrublands (range 1-115 years) and 18 forests (range 7-216 years).
   Results: In shrublands fuel amount quickly recovered after fire to a relatively constant value and fine fuel density remained high. Conversely, in forests, fuel amount rapidly increased during early post-fire stages (when resprouting shrubs dominate the community), peaked at c. 30-50 years (related to the co-existence of resprouters and young trees) and decreased to a relatively constant value (when tall trees dominate the community and suppress resprouters). Moreover, forest fuel density decreased with time. These changes in fuel characteristics were largely linked to changes in vegetation structure, which in turn were modulated by the dominant regeneration strategies and life forms.
   Conclusions: Our results provide evidence of a positive fire-vegetation feedback for the community dominated by colonizer trees, while the community dominated by resprouter shrubs showed a neutral feedback. Given the co-existence of flammable shrublands bordering fire-sensitive forests and their low tree regeneration rates, we argue that forest communities are especially sensitive to changes in fire frequency and severity driven by global change. Anthropogenic or climate-driven changes in ignitions are threatening these landscapes, which may undergo potentially rapid transformations, as seen in other temperate ecosystems.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the largest outbreak of dengue in Argentina in the municipality of Tigre during 2016, through detailed spatial analyses of the occurrence of cases in relation to demographic factors and vector control actions. Methods: Detailed and georreferenced data on dengue cases with laboratory results (NS1 or IgM) were analyzed. The occurrences of imported and autochthonous cases by census tract were modeled using demographic variables (population by age class, proportion of foreigners, proportion with university grade, proportion of males), dwelling variables (number of homes, proportion of dwellings with latrine, number of dwellings, proportion of houses, proportion of flats, proportion of slums) and census tract area as explanatory variables. The probability of occurrence of autochthonous and imported cases was modeled separately. The spatio-temporal occurrence of cases was studied in relation to focal and perifocal control actions (involving education campaigns, removal of Aedes aegypti breeding sites and exhaustive insecticide spraying) to assess the efficiency in stopping autochthonous cases spreading. Results: All autochthonous cases occurred in the urban environment with no sylvan cases. The majority of the imported cases registered came from Paraguay and Northeastern Argentina. The age structure of imported and autochthonous cases did not differ from the age structure of the municipality, while that of the negative cases did. When studied spatially, the occurrence of imported cases by census tract was mildly associated with a higher proportion of foreign population and more people at active age, while occurrence of autochthonous cases was not significantly associated with any of the studied variables. For census tracts with laboratory confirmed results, the models showed higher probability of autochthonous cases related to higher population density and population age structure. The clustering of autochthonous cases was generally mild, with prevailing isolated cases and a weak spread inside the municipality. The biggest outbreak focus was associated with a delay in the focal vector control. Conclusions: Results confirmed the virus pressure coming from neighboring countries and related to population movement by workers. All autochthonous cases occurred in the urban environment with no sylvan cases. The susceptibility of residents to dengue may be similar among age classes and the laboratory tests were performed more frequently in the younger. Autochthonous cases incidence was low and spatio-temporal clustering of cases weak, suggesting that control measures were effective when no delay occurred in their application.

AB  - Emerging with the wider 'movements of the squares' of 2011, Occupy London was defined by occupation, and by participants' negotiation of what occupation meant. Its forms and meanings changed as London's Occupiers moved between occupied sites, through uprootings by eviction, and into post-eviction attempts to extend Occupy's territorial politics without the camps. This paper builds on three years of ethnography to consider occupation as an unfolding process, using Deleuze and Guattari's concept of the 'refrain'. This describes territory in three 'moments': the marking of a fragile centre; the stabilization of a bounded 'home'; and the breaching of boundaries, extending in progressive directions. This rubric is used to analyze London's occupations, and their defining tension, between an expansive desire to 'Occupy Everywhere' - connecting to the wider '99 percent' - and the tendency to become embedded in the protest camp 'home'. The features of 'home' are analyzed using Foucault's concept of 'heterotopia', highlighting an alterity with ambivalent consequences for Occupy's project. The paper argues that despite a desire to 'deterritorialize' occupation, Occupy London stalled in the moment of 'home', a consequence of the camp's status as the 'common ground' of an often disparate movement, and the reduction of productive capacities characterizing Occupy's terminal downswing.

T2  - HASTINGS CENTER REPORT
LA  - English
AB  - Discourse on communities and aging traditionally has focused on the availability, accessibility, and quality of local services to support older adults in need of assistance. More recently, however, a growing worldwide "age-friendly" movement has pushed the conceptualization of community supports for an aging society beyond service provision. The term "age friendly" is used in considering how various aspects of a community facilitate or impede the health and well-being of individuals as they experience long lives.
   Frameworks on age friendliness include attention to health and community services for older adults but also encompass other aspects of communities, such as the physical design of outdoor spaces and buildings, the diversity of mobility options for drivers and nondrivers alike, and the availability of safe, affordable, and various types of housing. Age-friendly frameworks also highlight how the very social fabric of a community can influence older residents' quality of life.
   Over the past decade, a growing number of cities and communities have launched age-friendly initiatives as organized and comprehensive efforts to make localities better for residents as they age. This essay begins to explore how AFIs can address social inequalities in health and aging. It concludes by describing how embedding a spatial justice lens within age-friendly efforts could help AFIs realize more fully the changes that they seek to create at the local, national, and global levels.

AB  - Based on data from ground-based air quality stations, space-time variations of six principal atmospheric pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and gas pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, and O-3), obtained from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017 in the city of Lanzhou, have been studied. Average total concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 53.2 +/- 26.91 and 124.54 +/- 82.33 mu g/m(3), respectively; however, the results showed that in 75.53% and 84.85% days, concentrations of these pollutants exceeded Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard and in 100% days exceeded World Health Organization guidelines standards. Daily mean values of aerosol optical depth and Angstrom exponent based on data, received by satellite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, show a broad range of values for aerosol optical depth (from 0.018 to 1.954) and Angstrom exponent (from 0.003 to 1.8). Results of principal components analysis revealed three factor loadings. Thus, Factor 1 has the relevant loadings for PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, and NO2 (36%) and closely associated with transport emissions and industrial sources, which contribute to air pollution in Lanzhou. Factor 2 was heavily loaded with temperature and visibility (16.94%). Factor 3 consisted of relative humidity (14.11%). Cluster analysis revealed four subgroups: cluster 1 (PM2.5, NO2, SO2), cluster 2 (CO), cluster 3 (PM10) and cluster 4 (relative humidity, visibility, temperature, O-3, wind speed), which were compliant with results, obtained from principal components analysis. Positive correlation was found among all pollutants, other than O-3. According to processed backward trajectories obtained by Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, it was found that movement of air masses occur from north, northwest, and west directions-the location of principal natural sources of aerosols.

AB  - Prediction of traffic congestions caused by excessive rush-hour traffic, accidents or road works, is an important issue of intelligent traffic management systems. The article will present a generative model of movement in a network of streets and intersections that enables to predict traffic congestions of an accidental or deterministic character. The model has a modular, hierarchical character. At the lowest level the model is microscopic and depicts the movement of vehicles, public transport and pedestrians at intersections and between them. It allows comparing real measurements with simulated data and attach data obtained from the learned neural network. At its higher level, the model reflects the traffic in a selected sub-area of the network of intersections. On this level the model is macroscopic, taking into account the parameters of vehicle streams. On both levels, the model is based on a generative deep neural network. A multi-layered neural network was chosen from many available deep architectures. In order to train this network the following methods were used: algorithms prepared for Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Deep Believe Network, as well as neighbourhood network. These architectures and methods adapt to the real dependencies of traffic much better and more accurately than traditional structures and methods of learning. Thanks to the mentioned solutions it is possible to eliminate damaged or incorrect data from data processing. One of the aims of the proposed model is to predict changes in the intensity traffic and traffic congestions in short-term forecasts, also in cases that have not yet occurred.

AB  - Based on results obtained during 2000-2018 by field research, polls of colleagues, and OSINT analysis, features of distribution of the greater mole rat Spalax microphthalmus in the eastern forest steppe of Ukraine were considered. The studied part of the species' range is unique and represents the northern range edge of the entire Spalacidae family and of European steppe faunal assemblages in general. hi total, data on 146 record localities were amassed, including 13 localities in the fragmented and 133 in the continuous part of the range. The offshoots of the Central Russian Upland in the valley of the Psel river (east of Sumy Oblast) are the sites with the highest density of settlements, while the species' type biotopes are steppe balka slopes. The abundance of the greater mole rat decreased from the east to the west, and its colonies are the most fragmented along the Dnipro River. The species occurs in steppe and meadow habitats of an area of at least 20-50 ha. Analysis of the current and former distribution of the greater mole rat revealed that the species range contracts from the west; earlier it was a common species in different regions of the Middle Dnipro Area (including Kyiv city), but the current range edge mns along the line connecting Buryn - Nedryhailiv - Lokhvytsia - Myrhorod - Hadiach - Zinkiv - Zaliznychne. Isolated settlements exist in adjacent territories, particularly in Ichnia Raion of Chemihiv Oblast, and Lubny, Khorol, and Kobeliaky Raions of Poltava Oblast. The study showed that the species' range contracted by two times to 35,000 km(2) for the last 100 years, which includes only 430,000 ha of suitable habitats (15% of the range), allowing the existence here of 86,000-215,000 individuals. hi fact, the species remained only in habitats that have been minimally affected by amble farming and other forms of active agricultural use. Besides, the species shows a clear confinement to habitats located near human settlements such as untilled lands, pastures with moderate grazing, waste and neglected lands, which constitute a separate group of transformed and semi-natural habitats. Formally, this allows the greater mole rat to be considered as a synanthropic species, because its inhabited biotopes, beside the zone of offshoots of the Central Russian Upland, have remained only near villages and along roads. The species also has an important biocoenotic role due to its burrowing activity and as prey of predatory birds (e.g., of the long-legged buzzard and Eurasian eagle owl) and mammals. The feeding period of the offspring of these predators generally coincides with the aboveground activity of mole rats, which lasts during May-July with a peak in June. Aboveground activity is mainly related to the resettlement of mole rats to new sites and dispersal of the young, due to which they became victims of predators.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Indonesia has one of the highest male smoking rates in the world (67%) and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure occurs in over 70% of households. To date, little research has investigated community recognition of the harms of secondhand smoke and support for a smoke-free homes (SFH) policy. This work discusses the development and implementation of a community-based SFH intervention attempting to establish SFH as a new social norm.
   METHODS Research was conducted in Yogyakarta, Java. A proof-of-concept study ascertained the feasibility of mounting a community-based SFH initiative in urban neighborhoods. Educational materials on SHS were developed and pretested. An intervention was piloted and evaluated in the homes of 296 smokers residing in 4 communities. Health educators and community health volunteers were trained to implement SFH.
   RESULTS Prior to the intervention, 11% of smokers did not smoke inside their home; post-intervention 54% of smokers did not smoke inside their home. The Yogyakarta District Health Office has supported large scale implementation of smoke-free homes. To date, 135 urban communities have declared themselves as having SFH.
   CONCLUSIONS This is the first community-based SFH initiative to be carried out in South-East Asia. The SFH movement redefines smoking cessation as a health issue of women and children, ties family welfare to core cultural values, and offers women a leadership role in tobacco control. The sustainability of SFH in Yogyakarta has been achieved by working closely with multiple levels of government and has contributed to shifts in tobacco control policy in Indonesia.

AB  - The Corinth Rift is one of the narrowest and fastest extending continental regions worldwide and has one of the highest seismicity rates in the Euro-Mediterranean region. At its western termination, several active faults are located beneath the city of Patras and the surrounding area, a region of major socioeconomic importance for Greece. Displacement rates for the period 2002-2010 obtained from ascending and descending ASAR/ENVISAT multitemporal interferometry are combined with Global Positioning System measurements from permanent and campaign stations to produce a map of vertical and east-west ground velocities. Cross sections are produced in order to quantify the deformation rates with higher precision. In the vertical, the motion combines tectonic deformation, urban subsidence, and subsidence due to deltaic sediments compaction. In the city of Patras and through the gulf of Patras, the northern continuation of the 2008 Movri earthquake fault is connected to the oblique transform zone of Rio. Further east, our observations suggest the existence of postseismic deformation at Aigion in the 15years following the M-w=6.2, 15 June 1995 Aigion earthquake. The inferred deforming zone, assuming a simple slow slipping model, is located at the western end of the 1995 fault, with radius 3.5km, centroid depth 4km, and cumulated postseismic moment representing 28% of the coseismic. Alluvial fan deltas subside due to their compaction with a gradient that increases toward the shore. Several of those deltas are located in the hanging-wall of active faults.
   Plain Language Summary The Gulf of Corinth, Greece, is a seismic area. Apart from moderate earthquakes striking often, additional geological phenomena, such as slow and continuous ground displacements, are occurring. Both are being induced by the movement of the tectonic plates. In many cases slow displacements are part of the seismic cycle occurring before an earthquake. The coast of Central Greece is moving away from the coast of northern Peloponnesus with a maximum velocity of about 1.5cm per year. This study assesses the land displacements occurring due to tectonic activity of the area. This information is important to evaluate the seismic hazard and its impact on the socioeconomical activity of the region. Continuous ground displacements not associated to large earthquakes in the analyzed period are localized in the city of Patras, Rio, Aigion, and also in the surrounding areas. In the Mornos, near Patras and several other deltas, subsidence of no tectonic origin is detected. The maintenance and the expansion of the ground network are crucial for the uninterrupted monitoring of the geological phenomena. Our study can contribute to the awareness of the civilians, local authorities, and the state.

AB  - In 2015, South African higher education witnessed student-driven activism in the form of various #movements, beginning with the #RhodesMustFall campaign at the University of Cape Town, which morphed into the national #FeesMustFall movement. A corollary to these #movements was a language-specific #movement namely #AfrikaansMustFall. Very little literature exists on this latter movement in contrast to the sizeable literature corpus on the other two #movements. While highlighting this hiatus in the research literature, through a combination of extensive literature review and polemical analytic auto-ethnographic analysis, the article argues that the language contestations in south African higher education after #RhodesMustFall transcend the provincialism that hitherto defined language politics in the sector. To advance this thesis, the article argues that south African higher education language politics post #RhodesMustFall are an invitation to the terrain of advanced language politics. Advanced language politics transcends the traditional (and somewhat normalised) realm of the analogous relationship between language, the nation(-state) and reductionist ethnocentrism, and ventures onto the realm of language as a marker and means to (re)affirm, celebrate and advance value in the furtherance of human dignity, (social) justice, diversity of peoples and knowledges, fluid and multiple identities, fraternity, equality, globalism and egalitarianism - including egalitarian knowledge access.

AB  - New finds of bones of the Egyptian Mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon), one from Portugal and one from Spain, were directly C-14 dated to the first century AD. While the Portuguese specimen was found without connection to the Chalcolithic occupation of the Pedra Furada cave where it was recovered, the Spanish find, collected in the city of Merida, comes from a ritual pit that also contained three human and 40 dog burials. The finds reported here show that the Egyptian mongoose, contrary to the traditional and predominant view, did not first arrive in the Iberian Peninsula during the Muslim occupation of Iberia. Instead, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the species was first introduced by the Romans, or at least sometime during the Roman occupation of Hispania. Therefore, radiocarbon dating of new archaeological finds of bones of the Egyptian Mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) in the Iberian Peninsula push back the confirmed presence of the species in the region by approximately eight centuries, as the previously oldest dated record is from the ninth century. With these new dates, there are now a total of four C-14 dated specimens of Egyptian mongooses from the Iberian Peninsula, and all of these dates fall within the last 2000 years. This offers support for the hypothesis that the presence of the species in Iberia is due to historical introductions and is at odds with a scenario of natural sweepstake dispersal across the Straits of Gibraltar in the Late Pleistocene (126,000-11,700 years ago), recently proposed based on genetic data.

AB  - The present article describes the development of an energy supply project as part of the partnership established between the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and the Occupation Solano Trindade, in Duque de Caxias, coordinated by the National Movement of Struggle for Housing. The partnership with the UFRJ has worked to structure the actions on the territory and to strengthen the foundations of another practice extensionist. The project proposes the installation of a photovoltaic system at the Training Centre Polytechnic of the occupation, as an alternative to its sustainability, since that you can cover the main cost of running the building. We present the choices to the financial and structural aspects involved in the construction of the project, in addition to pointing to its contribution to the pedagogical proposal of training at work, through the implementation of activities that link the theoretical training of formal practical training, from the assembly, installation and maintenance of the necessary equipment to use the system.

AB  - The oasis of Tayma', north-west Arabia, was an important nodal point along the ancient trading network of the Arabian Peninsula, known since the first millennium BC as the 'Incense Road'. Its location and function suggest a variety of influences from diverse cultural contacts visible in the archaeological record. To investigate closer the impact of such influences on the daily life of the oasis, four buildings of a Roman (second-to-fourth-century AD) residential quarter of the oasis have been analysed by the application of a 'space syntax' technique.
   Taking into account various elements of access, movement, and distribution of space on different levels of analysis, a fuller understanding has been obtained with regard to change or continuity of the occupation of the residential quarter through time. The test run presented in this paper focuses on the common characteristics of the above-mentioned buildings, which are those of a courtyard house with a large room for the distribution of movement.

TI  - THE PHENOMENON OF "RAZBOY" IN RUSSIA IN THE EARLY 17th CENTURY: ON THE TYPOLOGY OF REBEL MOVEMENTS

AB  - This article considers the robbers' (Rus. razboy) movement, a social phenomenon of the early seventeenth century that has not been studied thoroughly. The author conducts a critical review of the existing historiography, providing a comprehensive analysis of the facts concerning the government's reaction to the rebel movement, the dynamics of enslavement in the lands of Novgorod, and the spread of famine in Russia between 1601 and 1603. The author puts forward a hypothesis explaining the reasons why military servitors left the suites of boyars and nobles. The heirs of a deceased master did not hire their predecessor's military servitors, nor did they agree to provide them with serfs corresponding to their status (amounting to 15 roubles). The article provides facts testifying to the low prices for bread in the patrimonies of the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, proving that the famine was by no means nationwide. The author proposes a new explanation for why expeditions were dispatched to fight brigands in the late autumn of 1602 or in the winter of 1602-1603. In late autumn, the robbers left the forest by road, as they could no longer count on the abundance of vegetation that protected them from being noticed in summer: they stayed in their accomplices' houses, waiting for the frost to end and haggling over their trophies. The author concludes that the robbers formed a network, which meant the inclusion of peasants and townspeople into the insurgent bands. Additionally, the author compares the robbers' movement and the activity of peasant militias in 1609, emphasising the fundamental difference between the two phenomena. Relying on renegade peasants and landless labourers (perhaps the poorest) from villages and suburbs, the robbers' movement of 1602-1603 opposed communities of feudal tenants owing obligations in labour and in kind. The actions of peasant militias in 1609 were based on a key social institution of the pre-industrial era, i.e. the community, and were driven by the ideology of royal pretendership.

AB  - Recognizing common reporting patterns of aquatic invasive Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha, ZM) and Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum, EWM) helps to better understand invasions. We hypothesize that confirmed invasions may be confounded by human population density, leading to overrepresentation of invasions in highly populated areas and underrepresentation in less populated areas. Here we recognize dispersal patterns of confirmed ZM and EWM invasions in Minnesota, USA, using spatial clustering and directionality tests, while adjusting for human density. By 2015, 125 (0.68%) and 304 (1.65%) of 18,411 Minnesota waterbodies were reported to have ZM and EWM, respectively. A multivariate multinomial model of the scan test was used to identify clustering of invasions. The resulting 23 clusters included 13 with either or both ZM and EWM, and most clusters (11/13) occurred in areas with >10 people per square kilometer. Whereas, among the 10 clusters without invasion, nine were from less populated areas. The standard deviation ellipse and the spatiotemporal directionality tests indicated a northwestern trend of invasions, which is in the same direction as the 1-94 interstate highway connecting urban centers. Results suggested that confirmed ZM and EWM invasions are potentially confounded by human densities, which is explained by varying human impact on either or both dispersal and reporting of invasions. Considering this impact of human density, we suggest that a combination of passive and targeted surveillance, where the magnitude of efforts are stratified by the human densities, may provide insight into the true invasion status and its progression in the Great Lakes region.

AB  - This study considers the Yesanpo tourism destination as a case, using network and spatial analysis methods to reveal its structure characteristics from the perspective of node centrality, connection hierarchy and space cluster. The results are as follows. (1) Core scenic spots/central towns have higher centrality than surrounding rural communities and characteristic parks, and occupy core positions. (2) Network connections show obvious hierarchical characteristics and spatial heterogeneity; each hierarchy is based on the core scenic spots and the central town, existing spatial difference between the south and north and spatial dependence on the river and main road. (3) Spatial elements tend to cluster to form several tourism cluster units, which centre on core scenic spots, composed of central towns, rural communities and characteristic parks, and show the dual features of 'adjacent connection' and 'preferential connection'. The study also suggests each tourism node should be equipped with appropriate facilities and services based on their structural characteristics and functions to promote sustainable development of tourism destinations.

AB  - The label of "hip-hop" refers to an extensive variety of cultural agents, expressions and cultural products; it is one of the most popular urban identities around the world. One way to approach this diversity is to distinguish two dimensions: the cultural movement and the music industry. Based on the idea that they are not necessarily excluding terms, I will reflect on two situations that show the current importance of hip-hop as a tool of political organization. I refer, on the one hand, to the declaration of hip-hop as Intangible Cultural Heritage of the state of Rio de Janeiro in 2017 and, on the other hand, to the recent formation of Guarani rap groups in Brazil. In the first case, I will rely on a series of legal documents, such as public hearings, press releases and what is stipulated by the law in question. For the second, I will retrieve some records about the media practices of a Guarani rap group from southern Brazil, as well as the contents that other groups publish through digital media. Finally, I will use the concept of "articulation" in Stuart Hall and popular music studies to establish connections between the two movements.

KW  - NETWORKS
AB  - Background: Nosocomial, or healthcare-associated infections (HAI), exact a high medical and financial toll on patients, healthcare workers, caretakers, and the health system. Interpersonal contact patterns play a large role in infectious disease spread, but little is known about the relationship between health care workers' (HCW) movements and contact patterns within a heath care facility and HAI. Quantitatively capturing these patterns will aid in understanding the dynamics of HAI and may lead to more targeted and effective control strategies in the hospital setting.
   Methods: Staff at 3 urban university-based tertiary care hospitals in Canada completed a detailed questionnaire on demographics, interpersonal contacts, in-hospital movement, and infection prevention and control practices. Staff were divided into categories of administrative/support, nurses, physicians, and "Other HCWs" - a fourth distinct category, which excludes physicians and nurses. Using quantitative network modeling tools, we constructed the resulting HCW "co-location network" to illustrate contacts among different occupations and with locations in hospital settings.
   Results: Among 3048 respondents (response rate 38%) an average of 3.79, 3.69 and 3.88 floors were visited by each HCW each week in the 3 hospitals, with a standard deviation of 2.63, 1.74 and 2.08, respectively. Physicians reported the highest rate of direct patient contacts (> 20 patients/day) but the lowest rate of contacts with other HCWs; nurses had the most extended (> 20 min) periods of direct patient contact. "Other HCWs" had the most direct daily contact with all other HCWs. Physicians also reported significantly more locations visited per week than nurses, other HCW, or administrators; nurses visited the fewest. Public spaces such as the cafeteria had the most staff visits per week, but the least mean hours spent per visit. Inpatient settings had significantly more HCW interactions per week than outpatient settings.
   Conclusions: HCW contact patterns and spatial movement demonstrate significant heterogeneity by occupation. Control strategies that address this diversity among health care workers may be more effective than "one-strategy-fitsall" HAI prevention and control programs.

AB  - Denpasar city is the capital of Bali Province and has been developed into a metropolitan city. There has been an agglomeration of four regencies, namely Denpasar, Badung, Gianyar and Tabanan forming a Metropolitan Sarbagita area with a population close to 2 million inhabitants. With heightened population and activity, travel patterns are increasing and scattered. The development of land use in the Sarbagita Metropolitan area occurred rapidly and was not properly anticipated by the provision of adequate infrastructure. This study aims to examine the patterns of movement that occurs and projections for future conditions as a basis to develop a more sustainable transportation infrastructure. The data used are the origin-destination of people and goods, and statistical population data. The prediction method uses four-stages modeling with the help of Visum software and was validated based on the average daily traffic (ADT) data. The results of the study indicate that traffic accumulation occurs on most arterial and collector roads especially around Denpasar with a degree of saturation exceeding 1. To anticipate future population and increased activities, developing a mass public transport system, multi-mode system, ICT system, and limiting the ownership and use of private motor vehicles is necessary.

AB  - South Korea has become globally famous for various tetrapod footprints from Upper Cretaceous strata. Here we report the first Early Cretaceous "large" tracksite from the Sanbukdong Formation of an unnamed small basin in the west of Gunsan City, North Jeolla Province. The tracksite (720 m(2)) produced 425 tracks. Among them, eleven ornithopod and three theropod trackways (189 tracks) were measured and mapped in detail. Most of ornithopod tracks are large (32 cm-51 cm in length) and very similar to pes imprints of Caririchnium lotus from China in that the general track dimensions and large heel pad impressions are typically longer than wide. They are attributable to basal hadrosauroids based on their stratigraphic and palaeogeographic occurrence as well as skeletal evidence in Korea. Eleven ornithopod trackways show gregarious behaviour and two main directions of movements along a lake margin. One movement is that of a group that went back and forth along the lacustrine margin and the other movement showing dinosaurs that came to the lakeshore probably to drink water or any other purposes. One trackway consists of 39 consecutive tracks with the distance of 39 m, representing the longest Early Cretaceous ornithopod trackway ever found in Korea. Sanbukdong ornithopod tracks suggest that basal hadorsauroids had the same growth pattern as derived hadrosaurids such as a brief period where it was very rapid. They also support independently that the majority of Early Cretaceous basal hadrosauroids were smaller than Late Cretaceous hadrosaurids in body size. Two theropod trackways consist of large tracks (more than 40 cm in length) and closely resemble Irenesauripus glenrosensis from the Lower Cretaceous of Texas which was inferred to be of Acrocanthosaurus origin. It is reasonable that they are attributable to carcharodontosaurids because their skeletal materials were already reported from the Lower Cretaceous strata in China and Korea. This new tracksite indicates that large ornithopod and theropod dinosaurs lived in the Early Cretaceous in Korea and strengthens previous hypotheses of their existence based on only isolated teeth.

AB  - Characteristics of traffic flow needs to be revealed to describe the traffic flow that occurred at the research location. One of the patterns of traffic flow movement of Merauke Regency that is important enough to be observed is the movement pattern that occurs at Kuda Mati Non-traffic lights Intersection. This intersection is one of the access for economic support of Merauke Regency. The intersection connects the city center to the production centers and is used by the community to perform activities in meeting their needs such as working and meeting the needs of clothing, food and shelter. This fulfillment activity is usually differentiated according to work time and holiday time. The method used is survey method to describe the characteristics of traffic flow at the intersection. Data analysis applied MKJI 1997. The results show that peak hour traffic flow occurs at 17.00 - 18.00 on holiday 803 smp / hour, while for working time the traffic flow is evenly distributed with maximum vehicle volume occur at 12:00 to 13:00 which amounted to 471 smp / hour.

AB  - In view of intensified disasters and fatalities caused by natural phenomena, there is a pressing need for an efficient environment logging that provides structural information to administrators for a better management and urban planning. This paper proposes a novel utility model for structural health monitoring that would enable early detection of risk factors and mitigation of loss. The proposed utility computing model takes the input data in terms of 'number of occupants' in a building (i.e. MAC, International Mobile Equipment Identifier addresses and biometric attendance system installed) and SHM system data (i.e. sensors readings). It give visual representation of all the data for utility managers and experts to decide better location of SHM and number of SHM needed per zone depending on high disturbances created due to higher occupancy and number of structures per zone. Denser area with higher structures and higher population will require more precise and accurate SHM systems compared to rural areas. It also analyzes the data from SHM system and using simple machine learning algorithm give experts' suggestions for type of SHM needed at an area. It make it possible for the data of each and every device of SHM systems over several zones to be accessible by specific authorities that can be used to predict as well as forecast any natural disaster. The Structural Health Monitoring utility model is unique in terms of its heterogeneity of resource management in realizing the utility processes. Finally, a case study of Qatar University is looked at where nodes are distributed in zones along with occupant measuring is used over each building. The data was taken over simulated occupation models and mathematical models from literature for occupation and zone calculation using ideal SHM system data. It can be inferred from the data that real-time analysis data will act similar to simulated and proposed Utility Computing System will give visual data and analyze the zones as can be seen in the results. Therefore, SHM Utility Computing model is efficient and most effective system that save cost as well as prepare authorities for maintenance of a structure or crisis management due to external surroundings.

AB  - Dengue fever is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in the world, and modeling its transmission dynamics allows for determining the key influence factors and helps to perform interventions. The heterogeneity of mosquito bites of humans during the spread of dengue virus is an important factor that should be considered when modeling the dynamics. However, traditional models generally assumed homogeneous mixing between humans and vectors, which is inconsistent with reality. In this study, we proposed a compartmental model with negative binomial distribution transmission terms to model this heterogeneity at the population level. By including the aquatic stage of mosquitoes and incorporating the impacts of the environment and climate factors, an extended model was used to simulate the 2014 dengue outbreak in Guangzhou, China, and to simulate the spread of dengue in different scenarios. The results showed that a high level of heterogeneity can result in a small peak size in an outbreak. As the level of heterogeneity decreases, the transmission dynamics approximate the dynamics predicted by the corresponding homogeneous mixing model. The simulation results from different scenarios showed that performing interventions early and decreasing the carrying capacity for mosquitoes are necessary for preventing and controlling dengue epidemics. This study contributes to a better understanding of the impact of heterogeneity during the spread of dengue virus.

AB  - In the study, observational data analyses and the WRF-CHEM model simulations are used to investigate the role of sea-land and mountain-valley breeze circulations in a severe air pollution event occurred in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) during August 9-10, 2013. Both the wind observations and the model simulations have clearly indicated the evolution of the sea-land and mountain-valley breeze circulations during the event. The WRF-CHEM model generally reproduces the local meteorological circulations and also performs well in simulating temporal variations and spatial distributions of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) concentrations compared to observations in BTH. The model results have shown that the offshore land breeze transports the pollutants formed in Shandong province to the Bohai Gulf in the morning, causing the formation of high O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations over the gulf. The onshore sea breeze not only causes the formation of a convergence zone to induce upward movement, mitigating the surface pollution to some degree, also recirculates the pollutants over the gulf to deteriorate the air quality in the coastal area. The upward valley breeze brings the pollutants in the urban area of Beijing to the mountain area in the afternoon, and the downward mountain breeze transports the pollutants back during nighttime. The intensity of the mountain-valley breeze circulation is weak compared to the land-sea breeze circulation in BTH. It is worth noting that the local circulations play an important role when the large-scale meteorological conditions are relatively weak. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The factors that determine the pattern and rate of spread of influenza virus at a continental-scale are uncertain. Although recent work suggests that influenza epidemics in the United States exhibit a strong geographical correlation, the spatiotemporal dynamics of influenza in Australia, a country and continent of approximately similar size and climate complexity but with a far smaller population, are not known. Using a unique combination of large-scale laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance comprising >450,000 entries and genomic sequence data we determined the local-level spatial diffusion of this important human pathogen nationwide in Australia. We used laboratory-confirmed influenza data to characterize the spread of influenza virus across Australia during 2007-2016. The onset of established epidemics varied across seasons, with highly synchronized epidemics coinciding with the emergence of antigenically distinct viruses, particularly during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The onset of epidemics was largely synchronized between the most populous cities, even those separated by distances of >3000 km and those that experience vastly diverse climates. In addition, by analyzing global phylogeographic patterns we show that the synchronized dissemination of influenza across Australian cities involved multiple introductions from the global influenza population, coupled with strong domestic connectivity, rather than through the distinct radial patterns of geographic dispersal that are driven by work-flow transmission as observed in the United States. In addition, by comparing the spatial structure of influenza A and B, we found that these viruses tended to occupy different geographic regions, and peak in different seasons, perhaps indicative of moderate cross-protective immunity or viral interference effects. The highly synchronized outbreaks of influenza virus at a continental-scale revealed here highlight the importance of coordinated public health responses in the event of the emergence of a novel, human-to-human transmissible, virus.

AB  - Every human settlement, from its occupation by a pioneer population continues to undergo a process of dynamism which is the result of socio economic and dynamic factors operating at the local, national and global levels. The urban metabolism model shows clearly that human settlements are the quality outputs of the transformation of inputs by an urban area through a metabolic process. This study seeks to bring to focus the drivers of human settlement dynamics in Bamenda 3, the manifestation of the dynamics and the functional evolution. The study made used of secondary data and information from published and unpublished sources. Landsat images of 1989, 1999 and 2015 were used to analyze dynamics in human settlement. Field survey was carried out. The results show multiple drivers of human settlement dynamism associated with population growth. Human settlement dynamics from 1989, 1999 and 2015 show an evolution in surface area with that of other uses like agriculture reducing. Multiple functions and network infrastructure evolve with human settlement. In the Bamenda 3 municipality, the dynamics of human settlements was slow but constant up to the year 2007. In 2007, the Bamenda III municipality was created. It serves as a gateway to the administrative divisions of Boyo, Ngoketunjia, Bui and Donga Mantung and an important transit for passengers and goods to and from the North West Region. It is crossed by a major road and has several education establishments. It attracts every population age group and of various professions such as students and other stakeholders. Farmland is gradually reducing since 1989, transformed continuously into human settlements. This expansion is more of the informal due to a weak implementation of legislation and a weak control mechanism. There is need for a strict control mechanism to reduce informal settlements.

AB  - Seismic waves result from fault movement during earthquakes. Depending on the features of the physical environment through which they pass, there are variations in the velocity and amplitude of body waves, which occur underground, and surface waves, which occur on the Earth's surface. The ratio of shear wave velocity (V (s)) to near-surface velocity is a parameter used widely in land use planning to predict the potential for amplified seismic shaking, especially in urban areas. The main objective of this study was to estimate V (s) by using cone resistance (q (c)) and lateral friction (f (s)) for a study area at Eskisehir Graben, to help mitigate geotechnical earthquake engineering problems in civil engineering and land use planning. In geotechnical shallow soil research, certain geophysical methods are used for measuring V (s) -a major form of seismic energy propagation-at the near surface. In this study, cone penetrometer data collected from seismic cone penetration tests (SCPT) includes q (c), f (s), and downhole V (s). S-type seismic energy waveforms, which are produced on the surface, were measured at different depths using an S-type geophone in the city center of Eskisehir via SCPT. With SCPT, q (c), friction ratios (R (f)), and V (s) values were measured at 42 different test points. R (f) properties are associated with soil thickness, and these were compared with dynamic soil properties (V (s)) using a standard statistical method; we calculated correlations amongst V (s), q (c), and R (f) measured from cone penetration tests.

AB  - Reclamation is one of the fastest-growing land use type developed in coastal areas and has caused degradation and loss of coastal wetlands as well as serious environmental problems. This paper was aimed at monitoring the spatiotemporal patterns of coastal wetlands and reclamation in the Yangtze Estuary during the 1960s and 2015. Satellite images obtained from 1980 to 2015 and topography maps of the 1960s were employed to extract changes of reclamation and coastal wetlands. Area-weight centroids were calculated to identify the movement trend of reclamation and coastal wetlands. The results show that from the 1960s to 2015, the net area of natural wetlands declined by 574.3 km(2), while man-made wetlands and reclamation increased by 553.6 and 543.9 km(2), respectively. During the five study phases, the fastest areal change rate natural wetlands was-13.3 km(2)/yr in the period of 1990-2000, and that of man-made areas was 24.7 km(2)/yr in the same period, and the areal change rate of reclamation was 27.6 km(2)/yr in the period of 2000-2010. Conversion of coastal wetlands mainly occurred in the Chongming Island, Changshu City and the east coast of Shanghai Municipality. Reclamation was common across coastal areas, and was mainly attributed to settlement and man-made wetlands in the Chongming Island, Lianyungang City and the east coast of Shanghai Municipality. Natural wetlands turned into farmlands and settlement, and man-made wetlands gained from reclamation of farmlands. The centroid of natural wetlands generally moved towards the sea, man-made wetlands expanded equally in all directions and inland, and the centroid of reclamation migrated toward Shanghai Municipality. Sea level rise, erosion-deposition changes, and reclamation activities together determine the dynamics of the Yangtze Estuary wetlands. However, reclamation activities for construction of ports, industries and aquaculture are the key causes for the dynamics. The results from this study on the dynamics of coastal wetlands and reclamation are valuable for local government to put forward sustainable land use and land development plans.

AB  - Long-term monitoring is an important element of species conservation. This study describes changes in the size of a squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) population over a 10-year period. The population occupied a 45-ha forest remnant within the urban area of Brisbane. Gliders were tagged from 25 nights of trapping during 2006-08 and from 16 nights of trapping in 2015. Population modelling was used to estimate adult population size. This suggested the adult population comprised 30-40 individuals at the beginning and end of the 10-year period. It reached a peak of 70 individuals in mid-2007. These data suggest that the study area contains a small population that is prone to interannual variation but there was no evidence of it being in decline. Survival estimates during 2006-08 were equivalent to those estimated for a larger population in Victoria. Population monitoring should be continued to determine how resilient this population is to population decline and to investigate factors that may cause decline. This study provides an example of an approach that could be used to monitor threatened populations of the squirrel glider.

AB  - Ruga Lumina investigates body-space relationships by leveraging digital fabrication and interactive technologies. Ruga Lumina is a spatial construct in the form of a smart luminous skin made of thin sheets of folded material that respond to the movement of live bodies within and surrounding its interior space. Spatial occupancy is registered through the use of smart technology; sensor information activates illumination and lighting effects, which, in turn, prompts perceptual and expressive aesthetic qualities as affects. This visual essay gives an account of the construction of Ruga Lumina at two exhibition sites: Detroit Center for Design and Technology (DCDT) in Detroit, Michigan, and 3Labs in Culver City, California. This account describes how bodies can be read and registered upon a spatial surface that points to a potential to re-envision fundamental notions of surface interiority.

AB  - From Facebook-coordinated high-school walkouts to compelling Internet-based protest art that has accompanied recent teacher strikes, grassroots education activism in the USA has gone digital. Despite the proliferation of research on the mediatisation of education policy, few studies have explored the ways in which activists for public education engage with Web 2.0 technologies. This paper makes a contribution to this under-researched area by exploring selected activist accounts including Parents Across America, United Opt Out National, and the PS 2013 campaign in New York City. I draw on critical, feminist, and cultural studies theories of education and social movement media to analyse activist media practices in a policy and political milieu dominated by corporate media and neoliberal governance structures. The analysis reveals that progressive education activists strategically deploy digital media to amplify voice, build collective identity, and disseminate alternative knowledge to enable direct action. A situated analysis also reveals significant differences in activist media practice which are shaped by particular political histories and geographies. The paper concludes with a discussion about future lines of inquiry into the role of digital media in collective struggles for public education.

AB  - To understand the longitudinal variation in the structure and functioning of large river ecosystems, six Ecopath models were constructed to exhibit the energy flows of aquatic food webs along the subtropical East River in China. Input parameters were primarily obtained from field data collected in 2012-2016; model outputs were estimated by network analysis. Longitudinally, ecosystem characteristics of the East River had high spatial heterogeneity. The biomass, production, and consumption, of which > 75.8% of each was distributed at trophic level (TI.) II, were determined by aquatic insects upstream, molluscs midstream, and zooplankton downstream. Carnivorous fish occupied the maximal TL of 2.95-3.50. Due to the different trophic interactions of regional food webs, the keystone groups shifted from odonate larvae in headwaters to piscivorous fish upstream/midstream, to zooplankton downstream, and to phytoplankton near the estuary. Aquatic insects, insectivorous fish, epiphytes, and hydrophytes, all of which had ecotrophic efficiencies > 0.99, were critical groups that influenced mass balance through short prey supply. The mean transfer efficiencies (TEs) through TLs II-IV had the lowest values of 1.8-4.1% upstream and increased to the highest levels of 8.0-8.4% midstream before they decreased to 6.4-7.0% downstream. The low TEs along the river were limited mainly by the lack of carnivorous fish upstream and the low predation on mollus and plankton midstream/downstream. A series of theory and information indices showed that the pristine upstream system was mature but underdeveloped in organisation; in contrast, the downstream systems in the urban and industrial reaches were immature and stressed in terms of excessive phytoplankton production and short cycling.

AB  - We use seismic and geodetic measurements to optimize the fault geometry as well as coseismic slip distribution from the 2018 M-w 6.4 Hualien earthquake. We find that at least three faults were involved in the earthquake. The earthquake initiated from a south-dipping fault in offshore Hualien, and slip transferred into the main west-dipping oblique fault. The slip finally triggered movement of the east-dipping Milun fault at shallower depth and caused surface rupture. Although there is no offshore data constraints, our inverted slip distribution shows that the majority of slip occurred between 5- and 10-km depth on the main west-dipping fault, and 1- to 3-m slip on the shallower part of the Milun fault. Additionally, we process 5 months of postseismic deformation time series and find more than 5-cm postseismic displacement occurred along the Milun fault but is insignificant near the Coastal Range located south of the Hualien City.
   Plain Language Summary Taiwan is one of the most tectonically active regions in the world. In eastern Taiwan, the Longitudinal Valley is located between the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, and the rapid plate collision has cause high surface deformation as well as earthquake hazard in Hualien, the biggest city in northern Longitudinal Valley. In this study, we use measurements during the earthquake to study the fault geometry and fault slip due to the M-w 6.4 Hualien earthquake occurred in February 2018. Our inversion results show that at least three faults are involved in the event, including a south-dipping fault, a main west-dipping fault, and the east-dipping Milun fault located in the Hualien City. Our inverted fault slip at shallower depth is in agreement with field investigation after the earthquake. We also process 5 months of data to observe postearthquake surface deformation and find that there is more than 5 cm of displacement along the Milun fault, but insignificant displacement south of the Hualien City.

TI  - Mapping the Pasupata Landscape: Narrative, Tradition, and the Geographic Imaginary
T2  - JOURNAL OF HINDU STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - SAIVISM
AB  - The early Skandapurana maps the origins of the Pasupata tradition. Framed by a series of narrative episodes that eulogise the Saiva terra sancta writ large, the text's authors designate a small region of northwest India as the 'Pasupata landscape', a salvific region celebrated as the birthplace of the Pasupata movement. It was here that Siva assumed a human form and disseminated the Pasupata doctrine via four students, each of whom presided over a prestigious locale- the storied cities of Ujjain, Mathura, Jambumarga, and Kanauj. The text's claim to colonise a region that occupied the sociopolitical heart of northwest India presents an imagined geography-not a fanciful representation; rather, a spatial rhetoric intended to localise, order, and authenticate a particular vision of community. This process of localisation served three discrete, yet intertwined aims: (i) it presents a cosmological vision of a sanctified world or Saiva hierotopy, (ii) provides a normative model for community, and (iii) stakes a geopolitical claim.

TI  - "Before Xpert I only had my expertise": A qualitative study on the utilization and effects of Xpert technology among pediatricians in 4 Indian cities
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Background
   Diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) in children presents considerable challenges. Upfront testing on Xpert (R) MTB/RIF ('Xpert')-a rapid molecular assay with high sensitivity and specificity- for pediatric presumptive TB patients, as recommended by India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP), can pave the way for early TB diagnosis. As part of an ongoing project implemented by Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) dedicated to providing upfront free-of-cost (FOC) Xpert testing to children seeking care in the public and private sectors, a qualitative assessment was designed to understand how national guidelines on TB diagnosis and Xpert technology have been integrated into the pediatric TB care practices of different health providers.
   Methods
   We conducted semi-structured interviews with a sample of health providers from public and private sectors engaged in the ongoing pediatric project in 4 major cities of India. Providers were sampled from intervention data based on sector of practice, number of Xpert referrals, and TB detection rates amongst referrals. A total of 55 providers were interviewed with different levels of FOC Xpert testing uptake. Data were transcribed and analyzed inductively by a medical anthropologist using thematic content analysis and narrative analysis.
   Results
   It was observed that despite guidance from RNTCP on the use of Xpert and significant efforts by FIND and state authorities to disseminate these guidelines, there was notable diversity in their implementation by different health care providers. Xpert, apart from being utilized as intended, i.e. as a first diagnostic test for children, was utilized variably-as an initial screening test (to rule out TB), confirmatory test (once TB diagnosis is established based on antibiotic trial or clinically) and/or only for drug susceptibility testing after TB diagnosis was confirmed. Most providers who used Xpert frequently reported that Xpert was an important tool for managing pediatric TB cases, by reducing the proportion of cases diagnosed only on clinical suspicion and by providing upfront information on drug resistance, which is seldom suspected in children. Despite non-standard use, these results showed that Xpert access helped raise awareness, aided in antibiotic stewardship, and reduced dependence on clinical diagnosis among those who diagnose and treat TB in children.
   Conclusion
   Access to free and rapid Xpert testing for all presumptive pediatric TB patients has had multiple positive effects on pediatricians' diagnosis and treatment of TB. It has important effects on speed of diagnosis, empirical treatment, and awareness of drug resistance among TB treatment naive children. In addition, our study shows that access to public sector Xpert machines may be an important way to encourage Public-Private integration and facilitate the movement of patients from the private to public sector for anti-TB treatment. Despite availability of rapid and free Xpert testing, our study showed an alarming diversity of Xpert utilization strategies across different providers who may be moving toward suggested practice over time. The degree of diversity in TB diagnostic approaches in children reported here highlights the urgent need for concerted efforts to place Xpert early in diagnostic algorithms to positively impact the pediatric TB care pathway. A positive change in diagnostic algorithms may be possible with continued advocacy, time, and increased access.

AB  - Historically in the Colonial period, the Corridor of Jalan Ir. H. Juanda or better known as Jalan Dago was designed as a residential area. As the high development of commercial activity along of Bandung City, almost all of buildings in this area are turned its' function to supported commercial activity. The change is shown in many aspects from the shape of the building and even occur in changing the old building into a new one due to a high intensity of this commercial activity. This paper investigates the use of Building Coverage Ratio regulation related to functional change in the Corridor of Jalan Ir. H. Juanda Bandung. The aim is to what extent the regulations related to Building Coverage area are implemented. This study used a descriptive qualitative method by conducting observation to identify buildings on the Corridor by dividing it into three segments. The results show quantitatively there is a lot of irrelevancies to Building Coverage Ratio regulation which is shown in the second and third segment. Most of the building in the first segment has in compliance with the regulation. However, to build a harmony in characters of City corridor is not only created by Building Coverage Ratio but also others parameters such as the land use, the shape of buildings, facade, and design concept. Thus, it is highly recommended to create a detail regulation regarding those parameters.

AB  - The objective of this study is to establish a framework for analyzing infrastructure dynamics affecting the long-term steady state, and hence resilience in civil infrastructure systems. To this end, a multi-agent simulation model was created to capture important phenomena affecting the dynamics of coupled human-infrastructure systems and model the long-term performance regimes of infrastructure. The proposed framework captures the following three factors that shape the dynamics of coupled human-infrastructure systems: (i) engineered physical infrastructure; (ii) human actors; and (iii) chronic and acute stressors. A complex system approach was adopted to examine the long-term resilience of infrastructure based on the understanding of performance regimes, as well as tipping points at which shifts in the performance regime of infrastructure occur under the impact of external stressors and/or change in internal dynamics. The application of the proposed framework is demonstrated in a case of urban water distribution infrastructure using the data from a numerical case study network. The developed multi-agent simulation model was then used in examining the system resilience over a 100-year horizon under stressors such as population change and funding constraints. The results identified the effects of internal dynamics and external stressors on the resilience landscape of infrastructure systems. Furthermore, the results also showed the capability of the framework in capturing and simulating the underlying mechanisms affecting human-infrastructure dynamics, as well as long-term regime shifts and tipping point behaviors. Therefore, the integrated framework proposed in this paper enables building complex system-based theories for a more advanced understanding of civil infrastructure resilience.

AB  - The planning for and design of streets around the world have been undergoing a radical change via a move from a network efficiency model to a movement and place-based one. This is a fundamental change, and it is important to understand both the benefits and drawbacks that result. This research represents an attempt to capture and understand these impacts and to address the question, what is the 'value', in the widest sense of the word, of place-based improvements in street design. The key features of the approach adopted here were, the use of pairwise comparisons of five improved and five unimproved streets across London, a holistic analytical framework to represent the complexity of urban streets, and the use of diverse qualitative and quantitative data to understand the diverse forms of value that might accrue from interventions. As well as important methodological innovations and insights, the research revealed that in relation to street improvements in the sorts of mixed local high street locations investigated, investments in the quality of the street environment return substantial value to the everyday users of streets, and to the occupiers of space (to business) and investors in surrounding property in multiple ways.

T2  - FOSSIL RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - Algorachelus peregrinus is the oldest representative of the crown group Pleurodira known in Laurasia. The type locality of this bothremydid is Algora, situated in central Spain, at levels deposited during the uppermost middle-lowermost upper Cenomanian. A new excavation was recently carried out in this town. As a result, abundant material of Algorachelus peregrinus has been found. Several complete shells, as well as numerous partial carapaces and plastra, are presented here. The abundance of remains allows the analysis of the general patterns by which some of the shells of this littoral form were partially or totally disarticulated. The analysis of these remains not only shows several pathologies but also improves the knowledge about the anatomy and intraspecific variability of Algorachelus peregrinus. This new information allows the revision of other Cenomanian forms of Bothremydidae, both from the Middle East and from North America. Thus, Algorachelus is identified in these regions, being represented in the early or middle Cenomanian of Palestine by the new combination Algorachelus parvus, and in the uppermost Cenomanian of Utah by the new combination Algorachelus tibert. Therefore, a relatively fast and widely distributed geographic dispersion event is recognized, corresponding to the oldest dispersal event so far identified for a lineage of Pleurodira from Gond-wana to Laurasia.

AB  - Italy could be considered a social laboratory in relation to radical theories, practices, struggles and radical political conditions. It is worth exploring what kind of laboratory Italy is and investigating some of the features of current struggles that challenge neoliberalism and the revival of fascism. One way to grasp the specificity of the Italian context is by considering an inherent set of social conflicts that take the form of multidimensional challenges, embracing social, cultural, economic and decision-making dimensions. Put succinctly, a prefigurative politics is the lens suggested to interpret the experience of squatting and commoning, which are the fundamental attributes of many related struggles over housing and Social Centers and environmental protection.

AB  - Diversity and equality at a Scottish volunteer-run arts festival are explored in this paper, through a survey-based social network analysis and follow-up interviews. Together they provide an overview of the festival's network structure, and rich evidence of the experiences of individuals in different parts of the network. UCINET software is used to analyse relationships between volunteers, and attribute data based on their demographics, engagement with the festival and responses to Likert-type statements on the study's main themes. Interviewees were sampled as a function of their network centrality, aggregated across a range of measures. A core-periphery network structure was revealed, focused on seven central individuals with established commitments to the organisation. This configuration outweighed alternative arrangements, including the functional departments that interviewees cited as being important to their relationships to the festival. Homophily, the propensity to associate with others with whom we are similar, is explored against status' definitions (such as age and gender) and value' (including beliefs and attitudes). Peripheral interviewees were shown to have less detailed knowledge of the festival's relationships with its neighbourhood, but a clearer sense of how the festival had benefited them personally. Members of the core group were representative of the broader network on a number of attributes apart from the country of birth, with evidence that better communication from core to periphery could benefit the overall organisation in its mission to represent a diverse mix of influences. RESUMENEn este trabajo se exploran la diversidad y la igualdad en un festival de arte voluntario escoces a traves de un estudio basado en el analisis de la red social y entrevistas de seguimiento. Juntos proporcionan una vision de conjunto de la estructura de red del festival, una rica evidencia de las experiencias de los individuos en diferentes partes de la red. Se utiliza el software UCINET para analizar las relaciones entre los voluntarios y atribuir datos basados en sus demograficos, compromiso con el festival y respuestas a afirmaciones tipo Likert sobre los puntos principales del estudio. Los entrevistados fueron muestreados como una funcion de su centralidad en la red, agregado a traves de un conjunto de medidas. Se revelo una estructura de red centro-periferica centrada en siete individuos con compromisos establecidos con la organizacion. Esta configuracion eclipsaba disposciones alternativas incluyendo los departamentos funcionales que los entrevistados citaban como importantes en su relacion con el festival. Se explora la homofilia, la propension a asociarse con otros similares a nosotros, frente a definiciones de estatus' (tales como edad y genero) y valor' (incluyendo creencias y actitudes). Los entrevistados perifericos mostraban tener un conocimiento menos detallado de las relaciones del festival con su vecindario pero un claro sentido de como el festival los beneficiaba a ellos personalmente. Los miembros del grupo principal eran representativos de la red mas amplia en un conjunto de atributos mas alla del pais de nacimiento, con evidencia de que una mejor comunicacion desde el nucleo a la periferia podria beneficiar a la organizacion general en su mision de representar una diversa mezcla de influencias.

Les deux aspects offrent une vue d'ensemble de la structure du reseau du festival et des temoignages pertinents d'experiences recueillis aupres des individus dans differentes composantes du reseau. Pour analyser les relations entre les volontaires et attribuer des donnees en fonction de leurs caracteristiques demographiques, de leur engagement dans le festival et des reponses aux enonces de type Likert sur les themes principaux de l'etude, nous avons utilise le logiciel UCINET. L'echantillon des personnes interrogees a ete determine en fonction de la centralite du reseau et a ete soumis a une serie de mesures. On a remarque une structure de reseau noyau-peripherie, centree sur sept participants principaux ayant des engagements concrets envers l'organisation. Cette configuration l'a emporte sur les arrangements alternatifs, y compris les departements fonctionnels que les interviewes ont cites comme etant importants pour leurs connections avec le festival. L'homophilie et l'inclination a s'associer a ceux avec qui on est semblable ont ete explorees par rapport aux concepts de statut' (tels que l'age et le sexe) et de valeur' (y compris les croyances et les attitudes). Cette etude a souligne que meme si les participants secondaires avaient une connaissance moins detaillee des relations du festival avec son environnement, ils avaient neanmoins une idee plus claire sur la facon dont ils avaient tire profit du festival sur le plan individuel. Le groupe restreint des participants constituait un echantillon representatif du reseau plus large en fonction d'un certain nombre d'attributs en dehors du pays de naissance, avec des faits justifiant que l'organisation pourrait beneficier d'une meilleure communication du noyau vers la peripherie dans sa mission de refleter une diversite d'influences.MOTS-CLESFestival; l'homophilie; analyse de reseaux sociaux; SNA; la diversite; egalite; UCINET

AB  - The migratory flows of the population and their control is not an unknown theme to Roman law where we find a endless sources which approach us in a reliable form, the mobility of people in the Mediterranean basin, especially since the consolidation of the hegemony of the Empire, which led to the freedom of movement with a control over those territories and problem areas. Therefore, in our study we analyze the causes by which the mobility of the population or its relocation takes place, such as: economic crises, political instability, wars with the analysis of numerous literary sources that reflect these aspects, e. g. Seneca, ad Hel. matrem, from consolatione 6.2, Livio ad urbe 39.3.6, 41.8.9, 25.1.8; Suetonius in Aug. 42.3. Moreover, we examine in our study the migratory policies and the refugee crisis that Roman diplomacy had to leaded and that, in its evolution, forced the establishment of border controls in the Lower Empire, particularly in the city of Constantinople, which becomes, before a vertiginous demographic development, in zone of religious, economic and political reference as of 4 th Century; thus we will study many vicissitudes such as the scarcity of housing in which the locals give their homes to the foreign population as Procopio tells us, arc. 23.24 and other aspects that are inferred from sources such as: Temistio, Or. 3.48, Or. 18. 221a-223b, Zosimo 2.35 and Novels of Emperor Justinian Nov. 80, which also reflects a Christian stamp and a theocratic conception of the State to protect its legislation. These and other vicissitudes have a parallel that is reflected in the migratory crises that have occurred later and in our century.

AB  - In debates over post-capitalist politics, growing attention has been paid to the solidarity economy (SE), a framework that draws together diverse practices ranging from co-ops to community gardens. Despite proponents' commitment to inclusion, racial and class divides suffuse the SE movement. Using qualitative fieldwork and an original SE dataset, this article examines the geospatial composition of the SE within the segregated geography of Philadelphia. We find that though the SE as a whole is widely distributed across the city, it is, with the exception of community gardens, largely absent from poor neighborhoods of color. We also identify SE clusters in racially and economically diverse border areas rather than in predominantly affluent White neighborhoods. Such findings complicate claims about the SE's emancipatory potential and underscore the need for its realignment towards people of color and the poor. We conclude with examples of how the SE might more fully address racial injustice.
   Resumen En los debates sobre la politica post-capitalista se ha prestado cada vez mas atencion a la economia solidaria (ES), marco teorico que reune diversas practicas que abarcan desde cooperativas hasta huertos comunitarios. A pesar del compromiso de los proponentes con la inclusion, las divisiones raciales y de clase permean el movimiento de la ES. Utilizando trabajo cualitativo de campo y un levantamiento de datos original, este articulo examina la composicion geo-espacial de la ES en el contexto de la segregacion espacial de Filadelfia. Observamos que aunque la ES como un todo esta ampliamente distribuida por toda la ciudad, esta ausente en los barrios pobres de color, con la excepcion de los huertos comunitarios. Tambien identificamos grupos de ES en zonas fronterizas, racial y economicamente diversas, mas que en barrios predominantemente ricos y blancos. Estos hallazgos complican las afirmaciones acerca del potencial emancipatorio de la ES y subrayan la necesidad de su realineacion hacia las personas de color y los pobres. Concluimos con ejemplos de como la SE podria abordar mas plenamente la injusticia racial.

AB  - A popular phenomenon in the street-hailing taxi system is the imbalanced mobility services between city central and outside downtown areas, which leads to unmet demand outside downtown areas and competitions in city central areas. Understanding taxi drivers' customer-searching behaviors is crucial to addressing the phenomenon and redistributing the taxi supply. However, the current literature ignores or simply models the taxi drivers' behaviors, in particular, lacks the in-depth discussions on individuals' heterogeneity. This study introduces the latent class model to identify the internal and external factors influencing the taxi drivers' destination choice after the last drop-offs. Beyond the influencing factors, the modeling structure captures the heterogeneity in vacant taxicab drivers through introducing latent classes. The proposed model outperforms other discrete choice models, for instance, multinomial logit, nested logit, and mixed logit, based on the two study cases developed from the New York City yellow taxicab system. The empirical results first statistically indicate the existence of latent classes, which further empirically prove the heterogeneity in the choices by vacant taxicab drivers while searching customers. Moreover, we obtain a set of internal and external factors influencing the customer searching behaviors. For example, the taxicab drivers are sensitive to the demand at the search destination areas and the distance from the last drop-off location to the search destination areas and behave identically in particular under the conditions of high demand and short search distance. On the other hand, the external variables have different impacts on customer searching behaviors across the different groups of drivers in the both study cases, including peak hours, weekday, holiday, earned fare from last occupied trip, raining hours, and flight arrivals at airports. In final, the proposed modeling structure and findings are useful as a sub-model of taxi system modeling while developing strategies, as well as as a regional planning tool for taxi supply estimations.

AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize the development regions in Romania and to measure spatial imbalances, starting from the national and the European Union aspiration to promote more economic and social policies adapted to the different regional particularities. For this purpose, we conducted a multifactorial analysis of the sustainability of the development regions in Romania at NUTS II level by constructing a synthetic index of socio-economic development for the regions that appreciate sustainability and have accepted structural and cohesion funds. The multi-criteria synthetic index was obtained by aggregating several sub-indices (economy, health, education, public utilities, and living standards). We used cluster analysis to identify patterns of regional development in Romania over time. For 1998 and 2006, the same cluster structure was obtained. However, due to economic and social changes that occurred after 2006 (negative impact of the global financial crisis as well as the positive impact of EU funds), in 2016, we recorded another structure of clusters, except in the Bucharest-Ilfov region which continues to present a number of unique features. In addition, we show that the polarized regional development model is increasingly strengthening and the network of urban agglomerations needs to be territorially balanced to boost their ability to "export" wealth.

AB  - A total of 252 aerial spore samples from the provinces of Quebec and Ontario were obtained during an extensive research programme focusing on aerobiology of fungal spores. Samples were collected on 95 sticky rods from rotary arm spore collectors and 157 filters from passive rain collectors. DNA from samples was PCR-amplified for fungal ribosomal ITS and sequenced using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) methods. After bioinformatics analysis of DNA sequences, the presence of Diplodia corticola, an emerging tree pathogen in North America, was observed. In total, 313 DNA sequence reads from aerial spores of D. corticola were found in the Illumina data set, and 199 DNA sequence reads were obtained from the Ion Torrent data set. DNA of D. corticola was found in 16 of the 32 sampled sites, always less than 10 reads per site, with the exception of three sites - Quebec City, Aylmer and Ottawa - where 287, 125 and 73 DNA reads, respectively, were detected. This is not a first report of the presence of D. corticola causing a tree disease in Canada as symptomatic trees have not been identified. Typically, like many other species of the Botryosphaeriaceae, this fungal pathogen is believed to be an opportunistic plant endophyte capable of living asymptomatically for several years before showing up as a pathogen when conducive conditions arise. Its presence as singletons in nearly half the sampled sites in Quebec and Ontario may be the result of long-distance spore dispersal originating from known infected sites in Massachusetts, Maine and other unknown sites in the north-eastern USA. However, its much higher read counts in three sites may indicate the possibility of a few trees being asymptomatically infected and spreading conidia locally.

AB  - RationaleMethodsStrontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) in human fingernail keratin tissues have been underexplored for region of origin and travel history reconstruction studies. Here we investigated Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in fingernail keratin to establish baseline measurements in a resident group and to examine how Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios changed with relocation.
   Fingernail clippings were collected from resident (n=10) and non-resident/traveler groups (n=4 and n=4) that were part of a larger study in Salt Lake City (UT, USA) from 2015 to 2016. Strontium abundance and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios were determined via multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Sr-87/Sr-86 and oxygen (O-18) isotope ratios from the traveler participants were compared to examine temporal patterns.
   ResultsConclusionsStrontium abundance and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in fingernails from the resident group established a baseline against which we could evaluate potential differences in non-resident/traveler groups. Resident Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios remained constant over the study period and were consistent with previously measured tap waters for the area. Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio changes in non-resident/traveler groups were rapid and reflected the current location of the individual within 4-5weeks of arrival. Lastly, O-18 and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the same fingernail clippings did not exhibit similar temporal patterns, since fingernail O-18 ratios required more time to attain values characteristic of the new environment.
   Our findings suggest that strontium is incorporated into fingernail tissues differently from hair and this could be advantageous to forensic investigations. We found that Sr-87/Sr-86 and O-18 ratios of the same fingernail clippings revealed two different time points reflecting an individual's residence over short- (4-5weeks, Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios) and long-term (3-5months, O-18 values) time scales. It is likely that the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of fingernail clippings reflect exogenous signals that are incorporated through bathing waters and that these signals change rapidly with movement to a new location. Our results may aid future forensic studies in the determination of region of origin in unidentified remains.

AB  - Landslides are amongst the major disasters that have occurred in Karabuk, Turkey. Due to the rapid increase in population movement to new habitats in urban areas, the need for engineering structures will increase. This condition has led to the construction of arts, cultural facilities and housing in insecure regions these days. The excavations to prepare the construction site, the external loads due to heavy structures and the changes in coverage of the earth surface are among the reasons for landslides in such areas. In this study, the landslides that occurred due to unsupported excavation for the construction of Karabuk university stadium were analyzed using the three softwares like Plaxis, Geoslope and Slide. The study area is critical in terms of slope problems. Mass movement in the stadium occurred in high plasticity clay units containing sand and silt. For this reason, it is necessary to carry out detailed studies before the construction of engineering structures. The landslide considered in the study were analyzed using finite element (FE) analysis and slice method. These approaches are used for evaluating the stability of natural slope by considering a failure mechanism, which is known as the plastic limit condition. Regarding safety factors calculated using the different numerical solutions confirm that the results obtained are similar. In addition, the landslide area is close to the predicted simulation results.

AB  - Immediately after the Detroit violence of July 1967, President Johnson appointed the Kerner Commission and ordered it to determine what had happened, why, and what could be done to prevent urban riots. This analysis focuses on racial change in metropolitan Detroit. Progress has been made in racially integrating the suburban ring closed to African Americans at the time of the violence. Evidence indicates social integration in that interracial marriage is more common and blacks are more represented in prestigious occupations. However, on key economic measures, African Americans are now further behind whites than they were in 1967. This can be attributed to fundamental changes in employment and the failure of the educational system to provide the training needed for jobs in the new economy.

AB  - This paper proposes a framework for modeling the instantaneous power consumption of individual elevators and elevator groups based on passenger traffic. Though elevators have a key role in the modern urban society, they have remained as rather neglected appliances in the energy efficiency research. To accelerate the energy efficiency studies of elevators, this paper has two major contributions. First, we propose means to model the instantaneous power consumption of individual elevators and elevator groups and analyze the reliability of these means versus the complexity of the modeling. Second, we present an elevator group control scheme to organize the elevator dispatching according to the simulated passenger traffic. When combined, these methods yield enhanced predictions about the energy and power consumption of elevators in a specific type of building with measured or simulated movement of occupants.

KW  - Clifford Warren Ashley
KW  - whaling industry
KW  - New Bedford
KW  - knots

AB  - This essay considers how New Bedford native Clifford Warren Ashley (1881-1947) shaped a lasting image of America's vanishing whaling industry as a preindustrial craft practice, informed by the Arts and Crafts movement and by the social and environmental toll of industrialization in the city's burgeoning textile mills circa 1900, when New Bedford became one of the nation's leading producers of cotton goods. Focusing on Ashley's influential work as a maritime artist, writer, and designer of period rooms at the Jonathan Bourne Whaling Museum (now the New Bedford Whaling Museum), it explores the range of strategies he adopted to promote whaling's fading traditions of handiwork, including knotting, sailmaking, coopering, shipsmithing, and carving scrimshaw. While Ashley's representations of the great days of the whaling ships mounted a critique of the city's machine-based production, it also obscured whaling's unsavory, proto-industrial character. The whaleship was a crucible of capitalist abuse, alienated labor, and the unstable social relations that came to characterize New Bedford's factory life in the early twentieth century. Whaling also literally fueled the growth of the factory system by furnishing the whale and sperm oils used to lubricate heavy and high-speed machinery. Although Ashley's craftsmen seemed to occupy a simpler, preindustrial past, whaling actually presaged and produced sweeping changes in the nation's modes of production and systems of labor.

AB  - The island of Sardinia is a meeting point for three continents, receiving a constant migration since prehistoric times. The migration from the Iberian Peninsula was permanent and consistent between the 12th and 15th, as stated in Italian and Spanish sources. In this framework, our approach analyse the internal and external mobility of the population and the intense movement of people, ideas and goods that have profoundly marked the different territorial and urban features of the island. The paper shows the different sizes and types of Iberian migrations in Sardinia and emphasizes the distinction between the first migration (those who migrated to Sardinia taking part in the military conquest of the island by the Infante Alfonso) and the second one (those who participated in the subsequent occupation and domination of the island).(1)

AB  - Music helps to create, maintain and to subvert the social order. This is one of several reasons why music is so important to humans. The political scene in Catalonia since the autumn of 2017 offers numerous examples that illustrate this reality perfectly. The social movement relative to the demands of self-government in a State showing a democracy involution, has generated its own soundtrack made up of the soundscape of caceroladas, the chorused slogans and chants in the streets or the musical events of political kind, which are organized in the main towns of the country. Focusing on the period between the autumn of 2017 and beginning of 2019, I will offer a glimpse of the diversity and creativity of sound and musical practices, which with its own acoustic reality, characterize those moments of great social effervescence.

AB  - As we are faced with the imminent spread of the raccoon (Procyon lotor L.), a successful and highly adaptable invader in Europe, it is necessary to identify the drivers of its distribution and focal areas of its future management. Being an omnivorous species, raccoons can exert considerable influence on prey species of various taxa. Species distribution models for this invasive species can be useful tools for its management. Using a presence-only model (MaxEnt) based on environmental variables selected by raccoon experts, the presence of raccoons in Austria was predicted. Core areas of raccoon colonization are mainly located in and around cities and river valleys. Identified ecological drivers of raccoon distribution comprise climate and land-cover variables, with temperature parameters (e.g. the number of hot days, mean January temperature), the proportion of coniferous forests, settlements and elevation mainly influencing the model output. The importance of habitat parameters changes with the stage of invasion. In Austria's established regions, the probability of raccoon presence was best predicted by variables chosen by an expert of the raccoon's native range, while the predictors chosen by an expert in its introduced range better reflected the situation in recently invaded regions. The significance of climate and land cover in understanding the probability of raccoon presence was shown.

AB  - Due to worldwide increased human mobility, air-transportation data and mathematical models have been widely used to measure risks of global dispersal of pathogens. However, the seasonal and interannual risks of pathogens importation and onward transmission from endemic countries have rarely been quantified and validated. We constructed a modelling framework, integrating air travel, epidemiological, demographical, entomological and meteorological data, to measure the seasonal probability of dengue introduction from endemic countries. This framework has been applied retrospectively to elucidate spatiotemporal patterns and increasing seasonal risk of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China via air travel in multiple populations, Chinese travelers and local residents, over a decade of 2005-15. We found that the volume of airline travelers from South-East Asia into China has quadrupled from 2005 to 2015 with Chinese travelers increased rapidly. Following the growth of air traffic, the probability of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China has increased dramatically from 2005 to 2015. This study also revealed seasonal asymmetries of transmission routes: Sri Lanka and Maldives have emerged as origins; neglected cities at central and coastal China have been increasingly vulnerable to dengue importation and onward transmission. Compared to the monthly occurrence of dengue reported in China, our model performed robustly for importation and onward transmission risk estimates. The approach and evidence could facilitate to understand and mitigate the changing seasonal threat of arbovirus from endemic regions.

AB  - Modern society has the following integral lines: promptly growing flows of information, stubborn problems and an unclear future. It creates expanding problems for its successors. A low level of physical development and functional condition of the organism of the child, hypodynamia, difficulties in socialization of the child causing behavioral disturbances, problems in the emotional-volitional sphere, problems of adaptation to kindergarten, school, difficulties in relationships with peers in a class, uneasiness and aggression are only a small list of the problems connected with preschool and school age. The original gymnastics arising in the Tibetan national tradition can overcome or, at least, facilitate many of them. The children's yantra-yoga is called "kumar-kumari". Exercises are based on synchronization of breathing and movement by means of pronouncing special sounds during inhalation and exhalation. The best age for practicing kumar-kumari is from 5-6 to 12-13 years old. But, it is possible to begin at the age of 4 years old, if the child shows corresponding abilities. It is known that increase in physical activity shows a positive influence on the health of a person, and children's, in particular. However, in the modern world, decrease in a physical activity of people, especially in big cities, is observed. Unfortunately, not all children love physical education classes. Unlike exercises at school, children always practice kumar-kumari with pleasure. Their self-assessment raises, and the relations with surrounding people improve, they become to be more pacified and study better at school. A joint occupation of children and parents strengthen their relationship. (c) 2018 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

AB  - Understanding how ecological distribution conflicts (EDCs) have changed through the transition from socialism to capitalism in the European semi-periphery can provide valuable lessons for global efforts towards sustainability. This article traces the social, political and economic origins of EDCs, and evaluates the outcomes of the 74 most illustrative cases of such conflicts from five ex-Yugoslav countries reported in the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJatlas): Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. It analyses how the occurrence and characteristics of the conflicts changed through three distinct phases in the region's history, i.e., the periods of Socialism (1945-1990), Transition (1991-2003), and EU-accession (2004-present), each characterised by different socio-metabolic, political and institutional profiles. The article also evaluates the level of environmental justice (EJ) in the region. The greatest diversity of conflicts were identified in the last phase, a period characterised by an increase in material and energy flows through a number of controversial projects, many of which arose as a result of 'modernisation'. Fortunately, the resulting 'unsustainabilities' were immediately politicised by EJ movements, whose composition, demands and success differed in line with changing dominant political and institutional conditions. Currently, the EJ movements in ex-Yugoslavia are led by national NGOs, while urban movements embrace the broadest spectrum of socio-environmental issues. Timely mobilisation and support from local authorities have been crucial for the successful resolution of conflicts. However, EJ movements have proved impotent to resist projects deemed to be of national economic interest in contexts characterised by high levels of corruption and low political accountability.

AB  - This study examined socioeconomic and cultural factors relating to animal husbandry, antimicrobial usage and household hygiene in 320 animal-keeping households of 16 rural and peri-urban communities of Ogun State, Nigeria. The occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in 457 samples from animal and environmental sources within the households was investigated. Chickens (41.6%), goats (35.3%), dogs (33.8%) and sheep (14.4%) were the most common household animals. Animals were reared mainly for income generation (73.9%) and for household consumption (18.3%). They were reared predominantly (60.2%-100%) under the extensive system with unrestricted access to human space, cooking utensils and foods. Households were assessed as having good (59.4%), fair (22.2%) and poor (18.4%) hygiene. The rate of household non-prescriptional antimicrobial usage was 69.4% in humans and 60.6% in animals. Overall, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 53 (11.6%) of 457 samples. The ESBL-producing isolates were identified as Escherichia coli (n = 49) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4). They harboured the ESBL gene variants bla(CTX)(-M-15) (n = 49), bla(CTX)(-M-14) (n = 2), bla(CTX)(-M-27) (n = 1) or bla(CTX)(-M-55)(n = 1). Forty-eight ESBL-producing E. coli were assigned into phylogenetic groups A (n = 17), B1 (n = 14), D (n = 13) and F (n = 4). All ESBL-producing isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance to antimicrobial agents belonging to at least three different classes of antimicrobials. Poor regulation of antimicrobial marketing and inadequate access to veterinary care contributed to non-prescriptional use of antimicrobials in humans and animals. Free-range household animals harboured ESBL-producing bacteria and may facilitate the dispersal of the organisms within the community.

AB  - The forest remnant that composes 'Parque Estadual Dois Irmaos' (PEDI) is regarded as one of the largest urban forest fragments in Brazil. There are reports of frequent occurrence of healthy fall trees in the park, in natural conditions, which may compromise its natural balance and its function as an urban forest fragment. Probably, this phenomenon is associated to the chemical and physical properties of the soils comprising PEDI. So, this research aimed to evaluate PEDI soils chemical and physically, identifying, mapping and analyzing the soils in the occurrence of falling tree areas at the research locus. Twelve points of sampling in a representative area of PEDI were mapped, where deformed samples were collected at depths 0-0.10; 0.10-0.30 and 0.30-0.60 m, and not deformed samples at depths 0-0.05 and 0.10-0.15 m. The chemical attributes and part of the physical attributes were determined in the deformed samples. And other physical attributes were determined in the undisturbed samples. The soils of PEDI were low in natural fertility. They have acid reaction and high concentrations of Al3+ to 0.60 m, and this can create chemical barriers that damage the growth of the plant roots and may be the cause of the frequent tree falling in the park. The soils were classified as clayed to very clayed, very permeable to vertical and lateral water movement. They had high variability in hydraulic conductivity and sharp decrease of water volumetric content in applying small stresses in surface layers as well as higher water retention by soil in Oxisol subsurface. In order to extend the information and create a database for future studies, it is suggested the monitoring of the most vulnerable species to fall, and analyzing other chemical and physical properties of PEDI soils, also opening profiles to understand tap root dynamics.

TI  - Building typology classification and earthquake vulnerability scale of Central and South Asian building stock
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - The typology classification of any building is essential to understand its structural and architectural configuration, to empirically evaluate its vulnerability, or to provide the basis for creating a structural model and to analytically study its dynamic performance. A typology classification may help structural engineers, architects and urban planners to understand a building's behavior and response to any type of natural or man-made hazard as well as further assists in defining improvement techniques and long-term sustainable regional planning. The division of a building stock into distinct classes of building typologies and hence the definition of a thorough building classification scheme is a major prerequisite for any vulnerability or loss assessment study.
   A building's typology largely depends upon the local geology and geography, climatic conditions, socioeconomic status of the occupants or owners, and to a large extent the locally available construction skills as well as natural resources (with respect to construction materials). The type of natural hazards a region has experienced in the past may also influence its prevalent construction typologies, at least if these hazards frequently occur in a certain period of time. The introduction of new construction technologies, design codes and/or building byelaws have further implications on the question of which building typologies are prevalent in a certain region, given that these legal provisions are implemented in daily construction practice. Focusing on Central and South Asian conditions, large variations exist in above stated factors. The region the Disaster Risk Management Initiative programme (DRMI), led by the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), is focused on here comprises of the Central Asian countries Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan as well as the South Asian countries Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. As strong variations in the characteristics of a certain building typology may exist between different regions or even countries, the definition of building typology classes at a regional scale is a daunting task. The present article attempts to categorize the Central and South Asian building stock into a manageable number of regional building typologies based on extensive field studies in the different regions. It further includes a thorough review of the relevant building classification schemes, discusses empirical data collection, and defines the criteria for building classification. By reviewing the buildings' dynamic performances, a final building classification for the region and a customized visual screening-based vulnerability scale is presented.

AB  - In 1930, more than half of the Barcelona population (56%) had been born outside the city. Although internal migration of that period has been studied, there is no specific research on its most important origin: the Valencian born migrants. The aim of this work is to improve our knowledge about the living conditions and the level of integration of this group in Barcelona in 1930. For this purpose, we analyze: (i) The distribution of Valencia born migrants in Barcelona. (ii) The main sociodemographic characteristics and the the level of socio-labour integration of this group living in La Barceloneta neighbourhood. This is done by focusing on the timing and the reasons behind their movement to Barcelona. Results point out a relatively good social integration -compared with other migratory groups- that did not depend on the period of arrival. We suggest, however, it is linked to the maintenance of strong ties of peasantry.

AB  - In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Epidemic, Spray and Wait, and their versions with congestion control and Epidemic with TCP in two different set of simulations. In the first set of simulations, we evaluate the effect of network node density for map-based mobility model considering Tirana city map. In the second set of simulations, we compare the effect of mobility model on the network performance by comparing the results of map-based model with RWP mobility model. The performance evaluation metrics are: delivery ratio, hop count, average delay, average buffer occupancy. Simulations are conducted using NS3 simulator. The simulation results show that increase of node density increase also the delivery ratio. The performance using RWP is higher compared with the realistic scenarios because in the realistic scenario the nodes movement is more complex and opportunistic contacts are more rare. The usage of epidemic with TCP leads to high average delay in all scenarios because the need of sending ack packets to the source nodes.

AB  - Primary Health Care has strengthened in Brazil in recent decades. The Family Support Health Centers have caused an increase in the range of occupations that transit through Primary Health Care. It is recommended that this inclusion and transit be guided by the "Matrix Support" logic. This article analyzes the appropriation of "Matrix Support" by Physical Education professionals. This is a qualitative study that used a focus group and participant observation with 11 Physical Education professionals from the city of Sobral, state of Ceara. The results suggest its understanding as a technical-pedagogical movement of exchange; the supporter as co-responsible, in a dimension of Co-Management of Care; as well as support as a technology that is not frozen, but rather a professional stance. Research subjects were found to comprise "Matrix Support" as a co-responsibility arrangement between experts and reference teams, which allows enhancing patient-centered care.

AB  - As a product of collapse, the boulder had caused a certain degree of threat. According to the survey of urban disasters in the northern part of Wumeng Mountain, in June-August 2017, the boulder rock led the slop of the slope to block three rural roads, damage a house and many fields. According to figures there is about 50 million yuan lose because of the loss and slip of the boulder. Instability of the boulder can be showed through independent slipping, boulder land sliding and dumping. The first two forms of movement are collected the recorded in data after the occurrence, and the last form is collected by the typical potential dangerous simple. Based on Coulomb's theory of soil pressure and predecessors' research on retaining wall, this paper studies the interaction between soil and stone by formula method, and establishes the model to calculate the stability, and analyzes the influence of dynamic changing soil properties.

AB  - The present article is about population growth in the province of Cienfuegos, Cuba from the beginning occupation of territory to the present; that weaving the constant link with the movement population and socio-spatial processes, builds a profile of geographic and temporal changes as part of the conformation of this territory. From the methodological plurality, qualitative and quantitative methods and techniques are used to characterize the geographical distribution of the population and its changes, determined by geographical factors such as the presence of the bay, plantations and industrial sugar production. The distribution of the population initially was expansive. Then it changes to a trend where the population decides to live in concentrated and urban forms during the 20th century. This trend has been reinforced during the 21st century and that are dominant at present. This article provides key elements for the subsequent mapping of territorial policies. These territorial policies will provide a harmonious spatial organization according to the geographical distribution of the population and the use of territorial resources.

LA  - English
CP  - 7th Annual Symposium on Earthquake and Related Geohazard Research for Disaster Risk Reduction
AB  - Surabaya's geological condition that dominated by alluvium unconsolidated, as well as increasing growth of buildings-especially skyscrapers- are triggered the surface deformation on the area. This research aims to monitor and analyze the surface deformation, especially the subsidence that occurred in Surabaya urban area over the last two years. We use Remote Sensing Technology that has been widely developed, not only aims to observe and analyze objects on the earth, but also very useful to monitor land surface changes. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is the first known technique to get surface deformation measurement effectively on large areas (thousands of km(2)) up to sub-centimeters. However, the technique also has limitations. In order to overcome the limitations of InSAR, multi-temporal InSAR techniques have been recently developed and one of them is Small Baseline Subset (SBAS). This time-series technique tries to overcome the temporal decorrelation due to atmosphere effect and measure transient movement on the Earth surface by using multi-look interferograms combination and small baseline temporal selection. Using SBAS technique we processed 24 Sentinel-1A images from Mei 2015 to Mei 2017 and 28 Sentinel-1A images from May 2015 to September 2017 to extract information of vertical displacement in Surabaya and compare both of them. The result shows that during the observation period, the rate of deformation in the form of Line of Sight Displacement (LOS) is varies from -60mm/year to +20mm/year. The majority of subsidence occured in coastal area (Northern and Eastern part) whereas the majority of uplift occured in the Surabaya downtown area (Southern and Western part).

AB  - Monitoring human vital signs is fundamental to assess a person's general health and detect events such as respiratory distress or heart attacks. As vehicle driving occupies a considerable part of daily lives, monitoring vital signs of a driver is necessary for early detecting potential health issues during driving. However, it is also important to ensure that the driver is neither distracted nor uncomfortable while monitoring. It is thus a challenge to develop contactless and ubiquitous vital sign monitoring. This paper presents contactless breathing rate monitoring for drivers using an impulse ultra-wide band (UWB) radar. We demonstrate that UWB frequency reflects signals from human body and validate a UWB radar for detecting the minute chest movement. Two signal processing methods are designed and evaluated for on-line and off-line analysis. We investigate 16 different radar positions in a vehicle for robust breathing rate monitoring under the circumstance of body motions during driving. We also perform on-road experiments at a local city and achieve a mean of 1.06 breathing rate estimation error per minute.

AB  - We present the use of a novel spatio-temporal model checker to detect problems in the data and operation of a collective adaptive system. Data correctness is important to ensure operational correctness in systems which adapt in response to data. We illustrate the theory with several concrete examples, addressing both the detection of errors in vehicle location data for buses in the city of Edinburgh and the undesirable phenomenon of "clumping" which occurs when there is not enough separation between subsequent buses serving the same route. Vehicle location data are visualised symbolically on a street map, and categories of problems identified by the spatial part of the model checker are rendered by highlighting the symbols for vehicles or other objects that satisfy a property of interest. Behavioural correctness makes use of both the spatial and temporal aspects of the model checker to determine from a series of observations of vehicle locations whether the system is failing to meet the expected quality of service demanded by system regulators.

AB  - A phylogenetic taxonomic analysis indicates that a newly discovered population of Cyrtodactylus from the vicinity of Ywangan Town in the Shan Hills, Shan State, Myanmar is a new species (C. ywanganensis sp. nov.) and the earliest diverging member of the linnwayensis group within the previously defined Indochinese Glade. The DIVALIKE+J model of a BioGeoBEARS biogeographic analysis indicates that the Indochinese Glade evolved in the Shan Hills and Salween Basin of eastern Myanmar and dispersed into Indochina on at least three separate occasions from 18.6-13.4 mya. Once there, uplift of the Tenasserim Mountains and Thai Highlands created the intermedius group, the oldhami group, and C. tigroides of western and southern Thailand which form sister lineages to the linnwayensis group, yathepyanensis group, and the sinyineensis group, respectively, of eastern Myanmar. Diverging lineages within the Indochinese Glade highlight the importance of the Thai Highlands and Tenasserim Mountains in that group's evolution and speciation. The discovery of C. ywanganensis sp. nov. in karstic habitats in the Shan Hills continues to underscore the unrealized karst-associated herpetological diversity of this vast, relatively unexplored, upland region and the need for additional field studies.

AB  - In order to investigate the effect of strong environmental wind on a tunnel fire under natural ventilation, a series of numerical simulations were conducted using large eddy simulation method in this study. A tunnel model was established by a numerical simulation software, Fire Dynamics Simulator, to investigate the smoke movement under the stack effect induced inside a shaft. Four environmental wind speeds (39 m/s) and three heat release rates (3-20 MW) were considered. The smoke spread velocity inside the tunnel, downdraught phenomenon at the early stage of fire, smoke exhaust characteristics at the steady period of fire, temperature distribution in the tunnel and shaft, and occurrence of plug-holing were studied in detail, based on some typical characteristic parameters, such as mass flow rate, temperature and velocity vector. The results can be considered as a reference for the fire protection design of a tunnel with natural ventilation.

AB  - The main objective of this essay is to consider Polish perception of the 21st-century European movement of migration and analyse the literary and artistic representations of this experience through the examples of Jaroslaw Mikolajewski's A Great Surge, Krzysztof Wodiczko's Guests, Anna Konik's In the Same City, Under the Same Sky and Margot Sputo's Who Where ?. I relate these works to the latest international art, including projects by Ai Weiwei, E. B. Itso, Giacomo Sferlazzo, and look for common denominators. I claim that the common feature of many artistic projects is the creation of a substitute for contact between the viewer and refugees, appealing to other senses than sight, especially to the sense of touch. These works do not attempt to represent the experience of migrants as individuals, but point to the experience of migration in its elemental aspect-matter and physical contact, exposure to destruction, dependence, intimacy, confrontation with others. What's more, art based on migrant movement-referring to the imagined experience of direct contact with migrants or their belongings-bypasses the process of identification and empathy. Instead, it relies on affective transmission. I propose a category of affective diffusion as a process that can occur not only between sentient individuals but also as a result of the material aspect of art and the contact with the viewer. The inspiration to create the concept of affective diffusion is the relationship between migrants and inhabitants described by Jaroslaw Mikolajewski in his essay Wielki Przyplyw [A Great Surge] which shows aspects of migration through Lampedusa Island. Many inhabitants who are asked about migrants show intensive emotions like anger, fear and xenophobia. But the testimonies of people who see the living and the dead day after day suggest that these emotions get weaker under the influence of physical contact. It seems that the moment of two bodies getting in touch undermines the frozen system of ideas and emotions, stimulates feelings, opens up a new, ambiguous potential for understanding. This is because expressive emotions lose their importance with the activation of affective transmission. This physical contact gives rise to changes in the economy of feeling, thinking and judging.

AB  - The article shows the procedure for reconstructing biography of a foreign specialist who worked in the Russian Empire in the first quarter of the 19th century. The author analyzes materials in 'Mesyatseslov with a list of functionaries or the General staff of the Russian Empire...' for 1813-1825. It allows to follow the foreigner's gradual movement up the career ladder, accompanied by reception of class ranks. Records of service (formularnye listy) within the studied time period contain further biographical details. These important documents on the service of the provincial official are preserved in the fond of the gubernia board in a regional archive (in this case, the State Archives of the Smolensk Region). Since records of service mention that the foreigner was of Lutheran confession, the parish registers of the corresponding church have been studied. The discovery of the record of death of the subject allows to date his life. Thus, the career of a Berlin native V. F. Blankengorn, who served as uezd and later gubernia land surveyor in the Smolensk gubernia, has been reconstructed. In 1812 Blankengorn was made to stay in occupied Smolensk; later, when the city was liberated, he was acquitted, as he did not render assistance to the enemy army. In 1823-1831 the Smolensk gubernia, alongside with the Vitebsk, Mogilev, and Kaluga gubernias formed a part of the General-governorship (with its center in Vitebsk). Thus, documents retated to Blankengorn being awarded his first Russian order in 1824 proceeded from the Chancellery of the Governor-General. In the studied period being awarded any order of the Russian Empire (regardless of its degree) opened a prospect of obtaining noble dignity. The article based on the study of the biography of V. F. Blankengorn, adjusts the dating of the 'Atlas of the Smolensk Province.' This 25-sheet manuscript executed by Blankengorn is now stored in the department of cartographic publications of the Russian State Library. In its digitized form, the Atlas is available on the official website of the Library. It includes maps of all cities and uezds of the Smolensk gubernia and also its general map. Precision and artistry of the manuscript suggest that it was created for Emperor Alexander I's tour of the Smolensk gubernia in 1824.

AB  - Practices and techniques of listening were at the core of recent social movements that explicitly espoused horizontal direct democracy: 15M, Occupy Wall Street, and Nuit Debout. These movements sought to imagine nonhierarchical structures through which large groups of strangers could speak and listen to each other, considering seriously the coconstruction of communicative form and political values. Drawing on participant observation; 23 long-form interviews with social movement actors in Paris, Madrid, and New York City; and texts such as video documentation and "best practices" literature, this article performs a comparative analysis of internal assembly communications-particularly bodily mediated methods of transmitting and perceiving spoken language- and their relationships to deliberation and decision making. All of these movements struggled to reconcile the mandate to listen with the material and infrastructural challenges of autonomous public space. Nuit Debout's strong commitment to accommodating those who could not comfortably participate in an occupation (day laborers, sans-papiers, disabled, etc.) caused its internal communication practices to differ in its attempts to conserve time and to prioritize translation.

AB  - The "just in time" neoliberal global consumer economy has given rise to logistics or "goods movement" hubs, reshaping regional labor markets near port cities, and increasing the demand for temporary blue-collar workers. This article provides a case study of earnings inequality among nonsupervisory warehouse workers in Inland Southern California, most of whom are Latina/o. Combining insights from labor market segmentation and intersectional feminist theories, we argue that employer discrimination against temps has become a significant axis of workplace inequality that interacts with other social inequalities to segment workers into lower and higher paying positions within a complex "matrix of exploitation." Our statistical analysis uses data from an original survey of workers as well as the American Community Survey to analyze wages, income, and occupational segregation among Inland Southern California's blue-collar warehouse workforce. We find that, controlling for other factors, temporary employment status negatively affects hourly wages and annual earnings. Consistent with the expectations of intersectional feminist theory, the hourly wages of immigrant Latinas, and the annual incomes of immigrant Latinas who are naturalized citizens, were significantly lower than those of all other warehouse workers, controlling for the effects of other factors. Immigrant women were also disproportionately employed as temps and in the lowest paid occupation.

AB  - The West Asian region is a tectonically active area due to crustal deformation; the associated earthquakes occur on a large scale and have been recorded from the historical period to the present. Investigating the most suitable solution for this crustal movement will contribute to this region's earthquake and tsunami disaster mitigation. The most reliable parameters were defined by researchers and applied with a non-uniform distribution in the fault plane based on Papadimitriou et al [1]. The calculated AD 365 earthquake waveform provides an indication of maximum acceleration using the stochastic Green's function method with the selected parameters. Using this estimation, damage to masonry structures can be calculated. The ancient Crete cities of Aptra and Chania were both hit by the AD 365 earthquake. Aptera, built on out-cropping rock, would have been 80% destroyed. In comparison, Chania, in northwest Crete, would have been completely destroyed because it was built on thick sedimentary layers. The subsurface composition at Chania would have made it a high seismic intensity area. This earthquake was followed by a tsunami that devastated the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean. Based on these results, risk mitigation from seismic and tsunami events should focus on high densely populated areas with thick sedimentary layers in the Mediterranean.

AB  - This article investigates the impact of land tenure insecurity on the migration decisions of China's rural residents from 1995 to 2003. The article appeals to a simple model to frame the relationship between migration and the probability that a reallocation of land in the village will occur in the following year. Empirically, the article first demonstrates that a village leader's support for an administrative land reallocation carries with it the risk of losing a future election. Exploiting election timing and village heterogeneity in lineage group composition, the article identifies the effect of reallocation risk on migration decisions. In response to an expected land reallocation in the following year, the probability that a rural resident migrates out of the county declines by 2.4 percentage points, which accounts for 15% of the annual share of village residents, aged 16 to 50, who worked as migrants during the period. This finding underscores the potential importance of secure property rights for facilitating labor market integration and the movement of labor out of agriculture.

AB  - New particle formation (NPF) and subsequent particle growth occur frequently in various atmospheric environments. Significant influence of transport on aerosol size distributions is commonly observed, especially for non-regional NPF events. With certain assumptions and approximations, a population balance method is proposed to examine the influence of transport on the temporal evolution of aerosol size distributions during NPF events. The method is derived from the aerosol general dynamic equation in the continuous form. Meteorological information (e.g., wind speed, wind direction, and water vapor mixing ratio) was used to complement the analysis. The NPF events observed in Southeast Tibet, Fukue Island, and urban Beijing were analyzed using the proposed method. Significant contribution of transport to the observed aerosol size distributions is found during the NPF events in both Southeast Tibet and Fukue Island. The changes in the contribution of transport have a good correlation with the changes in wind speed and direction. This correlation indicates that local mountain and valley breezes govern the observed new particles at the Southeast Tibet site. Most NPF events observed at Fukue Island are closely related to the long-range transport of aerosols and gaseous precursors due to the movement of air masses. Regional NPF events are typically observed in urban Beijing and the contribution of transport to the observed aerosol size distributions is negligible when compared to other processes such as condensational growth and coagulation scavenging. In a relatively clean atmospheric environment, the proposed method can be used to characterize the contribution of transport to particles in the size range from similar to 10 to similar to 50 nm. During intense NPF events in a relatively polluted atmospheric environment, however, the estimated contribution of transport is sensitive to the uncertainties in condensational growth and coagulation scavenging due to the dominance of their corresponding terms in the population balance equation.

AB  - Public spaces in a planned housing is a place of social interaction for every visitor of public space. The research on public space image uses four public spaces that meet the criteria of public space such as pedestrian sidewalks, public park, water front and worship place. Research on the perception of public space is interesting to investigate because housing development is part of the forming of a society that should design with proper architectural considerations. The purpose of this research is to know the image of public space on the planned housing in Medan City based on the mapping of environmental and behavior cognition and to know the difference between the image that happened to four group respondent. The research method of architecture used in this research is a descriptive qualitative method with case study approach (most similar case). Analysis of data used using mental maps and questionnaires. Then the image of public space is formed based on the elements of public space, wayfinding, route choice, and movement. The image difference that occurs to the housing residents and architecture students, design and planning are outstanding, visitors to the public housing space is good, people who have never visited the public space is inadequate.

AB  - Energy use on heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) accounts for about 50% of building energy use. To have a sustainable built environment, energy efficient ventilation systems that deliver good indoor environmental quality are needed. This study evaluates the cooling energy saving potential of a newly proposed ventilation system called Intermittent Air Jet Strategy (IAJS) and compares its performance against a mixing ventilation (MV) system in a classroom located in three cities with different climates, Singapore with 'hot and humid', Ahvaz with 'hot and dry' and Lisbon with "moderate" climate. The results show a significant reduction of cooling energy need and flexibility in control strategies with IAJS as a primary system in hot and humid climates like Singapore. Hot and dry climate with short cool periods like Ahvaz show possible application and considerable energy savings with IAJS as a primary system under optimized variable setpoints, but moderate climates have an increased risk of occupant discomfort likely due to increased draft especially during the cool season. Thus, IAJS as a secondary system that operates only during cooling season may be conducive for moderate climates like Lisbon. Additionally, the results show that supply fan energy savings can also be realised if well implemented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soils are playing a central role in the transfer and accumulation of anthropogenic pollutants in urbanized regions. Hence, this study aimed at examining the contamination levels of selected soils collected within and around the Paris conurbation (France). This also evaluated factors controlling contamination. Twenty-three trace and major elements as well as 82 organic micropollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates (PAEs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), alkylphenols (APs), and perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) were analyzed. Results reinforced the concern raised by the occurrence and levels of metals such as Zn, Pb, Cu, and Hg, identified as metallic markers of anthropogenic activities, but also pointed out the ubiquitous contamination of soils by organic micropollutants in the 0.2-55,000-mu g/kg dw range. For well-documented compounds like PAHs, PCBs, and to a lesser extent PBDEs, contents were in the range of background levels worldwide. The pollutant stock in tested soil was compared to the annual atmospheric input. For PAHs; Pb; and to a lesser extent Zn, Cu, Cd, Hg, Sb, PAEs, and APs, a significant stock was observed, far more important than the recent annual atmospheric fluxes. This resulted from both (i) the persistence of a fraction of pollutants in surface soils and (ii) the cumulative atmospheric inputs over several decades. Regarding PBDEs and PFASs, stronger atmospheric input contributions were observed, thereby highlighting their recent dispersal into the environment.

AB  - Granular materials ranging from concrete to sand (graded soil) have substantially influenced our choices for construction materials. Such materials are desired to satisfy aspects such as permeability and strength as per requirement. Increased urban activity, frequent occurrence of floods owing to limited drainage area compelled researchers to look for alternate ways of absorbing surface runoff. Permeable concrete pavement being projected as a possible solution is practiced with limited success because increased permeability harms mechanical properties restricting its use. Permeable concrete with desired mechanical properties can be developed if its geometry and behaviour at granular level can be exploited. Computational modelling of concrete provides us with the window through which tapping into concrete at granular level can be achieved. Present study is an attempt towards development of numerical model aimed at analysing strength and permeability of permeable concrete which is achieved over two stages. In first stage, concrete is modelled as a granular material and further Sequential Packing Algorithm is used to accomplish requisite particle packing efficiency, followed by application of Cellular Particle Rejection System (CPRS) to identify voids and then its interconnection is analysed. In second stage, random discretization of homogenized space is achieved through Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation. Granular model developed in first stage is superposed on the discretized model to incorporate heterogeneity into the system. The triangulation elements form a skeletal structure resembling concrete mix is then analysed under loading pattern to simulate mesoscopic response of the system. The response is analysed in terms of structural capacity, failure pattern and the dependence on the relative variation in the properties of mesoscopic phases. The resemblance between computational and actual concrete is acquired by maintaining composition entropy examined at mesoscale by using gradation curve based on Fuller maximum density. The developed model permits large scale testing of virtual concrete with varying composition to analyse influence on strength, permeability, pore network and failure pattern at granular level.

AB  - The Polish diaspora in Siberia is the subject of scientific interests of both Polish and Russian scientists. Their research, sometimes conducted jointly, has so far focused on the study of the historical past of the "Siberian Poles". This article addresses the less studied problems associated with the development of the cultural identity of Siberian Polish diaspora - polonia in modern conditions.
   The strength and quality of national identity among the ancestors of the current "Siberian Poles" that appeared on this land in the second half of the XIX and early XX centuries were very different; they were still in the process of dynamic formation not only in Siberia, but even on the territory of Poland itself. Most Poles already had a strong national identity; their Polish identity was associated with active and conscious participation in the development of a common national culture and in realizing the goals formulated and set before the people by the national leaders. However, part of Polish society, mainly the peasant mass, had a more conservative identity, based on the repetition of traditional patterns and patterns, which local authorities cared about. Migrants to Siberia, both voluntary and involuntary, that is, brought here in exile by force, also differed widely by region of origin, by language, education, belonging to different social strata.
   The Russian authorities did not allow the formation of large clusters of Poles in Siberia - their compact residence in one place. It was one of the factors that contributed to the Russification of the "Siberian Poles".
   Quicker than others the Polish peasants who have turn out to be in in Siberia lost national identity due to the very nature of (cultural design) of this identity. In addition, the former local authorities who found themselves in Siberia in the new natural, socio-cultural and political conditions, they were unable to successfully act as leaders. The liquidation of most of the 60 Polish villages in Siberia (as supposedly "unpromising") during the Soviet period, as well as the increased mobility of the population in the USSR and modern Russia have led to the movement of a significant part of the "Siberian poles" from village to city, especially in such large cities as Omsk, Tomsk, Novosibirsk, where the majority of them lives today.
   Here were the descendants of exiled and voluntary settlers, descendants of nobles (shlyaxta), peasants, military personnel, officials and those who came to the USSR against their will as a result of political perturbations. Living side by side and cooperating with each other, first of all in the Polish social organizations formed in Siberia under the conditions of "Perestroika" Polish public organizations, the number of which is now measured by two tens, they contribute to the convergence and connection with each other completely different models of "Polishness" (ideas about their own identity), the carriers of which they are.
   Thus, a special, qualitatively new culture is formed, uniting people who call themselves: "Poles", "Poles-Russians", "Siberian Poles", "Siberians", "Russians with Polish roots".
   This diversity makes it possible for Siberian polonia to perform the functions of a bridge between cultures, connecting Poland with Russia today.

AB  - Cycling gains importance in urban transport. Not only in terms of environmental protection, but also in lived lifestyle. A possible way to involve children of young ages into this kind of movement is to transport them in so-called baby carriers mounted to regular bicycles. For the cyclist, the promotion of cycling as a safe and healthy form of transport is limited due to the high probability of accidents, especially in cases of impacts with motor vehicles. The safety situation of transported children is thereby poorly researched, neither in terms of kinematics nor in injury outcome. To fill this void of knowledge, the authors created a generic model of a rear-mounted bicycle baby carrier as well a sports car by 3D scanning these objects. By combining these models with adjusted MADYMO dummies and the consequently coupling of LS-DYNA with MADYMO, this paper is about to state in a first attempt the general safety situation and kinematics of a transported child on a bicycle. This includes occurring accelerations and the related injury biomechanics and criteria, as kinematics of a transported child are differing significantly from these of an adult rider.

AB  - Emergency evacuation is the process of movement of people away from the threat or actual occurrence of hazards such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, fires and bombs. In this paper, we focus on evacuation from a building, but the ideas can be applied to city and region evacuation. We define the problem and show how it can be modeled using graphs. The resulting optimization problem can be formulated as an Integer Linear Program. Though this can be solved exactly, this approach does not scale well for graphs with thousands of nodes and several hundred thousands of edges. This is impractical for large graphs. First, we study a special case of this problem, where there is only a single source and a single sink. For this case, we give an improved algorithm Single Source Single Sink Evacuation Route Planner, whose evacuation time is always at most that of a famous algorithm Capacity Constrained Route Planner (CCRP), and whose running time is strictly less than that of CCRP. We prove this mathematically and give supporting results by extensive experiments. We also study randomized behavior model of people and prove some interesting results. We design the Multiple Sources Multiple Sinks Evacuation Route Planner (MSEP) algorithm to extend this for multiple sources and multiple sinks. We propose a randomized behavior model for MSEP and give a probabilistic analysis using ChernoffBounds.

AB  - Extant literature on crime and place recognizes crime does not occur randomly across space and is influenced by physical place features within the environment, such as alcohol outlets, restaurants, and public transportation stops, that generates and attracts crime. However, many analyses of these features' influence on crime are conducted across entire jurisdictions which could potentially misrepresent the particular relationships within more localized areas. With a movement in police agencies towards proactive data-driven analyses of crime, the ability to better understand the environmental context of crime events continues to grow in prominence. Building from environmental criminology perspectives and concepts, the current study presents a framework police agencies can implement to more precisely identify the underlying place features influencing where crime occurs in different areas of their broader jurisdiction. Using risk terrain modeling, the current study examined variation in the risk factors for aggravated assault between a citywide model and three police division-specific models. Each police division was considered a unique environmental context that differentially affects crime, which necessitated site-specific analysis within the city to inform tailored police response. Findings are discussed in a policing framework with attention on practitioner implications and future directions of research.

AB  - Thick marine shales occur in the Wufeng Formation and Longmaxi Formation of Sanquan Town of the Nanchuan District, Chongqing Municipality, which is located on the southeast margin of the Sichuan Basin. However, few details of the characteristics of the Wufeng-Longmaxi shales in this area have been reported. In this study, a well approximately 100 m (similar to 328 ft) deep was drilled. A high-quality shale (total organic carbon [TOC] >2.0 wt. %, clay <40%) interval that was approximately 24 m (similar to 79 ft) thick with an average TOC value of 3.0 wt. % mainly occurs in the Ordovician Wufeng Formation (Katian and Hirnantian) and base of the Silurian Longmaxi Formation (Rhuddanian). Shales with higher TOC values commonly have a higher porosity and specific surface area. Tectonic movements may also have been very important factors that influenced the petrophysical properties of the shales. For example, a detachment layer that resulted from complex tectonic movements is extensive in the Wufeng Formation. The cracks and microcracks in the detachment layer can result in good pore connectivity. Consequently, the detachment layer can be an effective migration pathway. The Longmaxi-Wufeng shales of Sanquan Town are also compared with those of the famous Jiaoye 1 well in the Jiaoshiba shale gas field in the eastern Sichuan Basin. Although the shales in Sanquan Town have considerable shale gas generation potential, the shale gas resource potential in Sanquan Town is probably poor because the escape of shale gas may be accelerated by the detachment layer in destroyed anticlines and synclines.

AB  - Recent trends in the environmental education field have recognized the value of using the environment as a pathway for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) learning, or E -> STEM. Research has highlighted that nature-focused outdoor lessons can support students' science knowledge development, yet little is known about the mechanisms through which learning occurs. Moreover, a focus on content knowledge limits understanding of students' development as science learners who can apply lessons more meaningfully in their lives. In our mixed-method study, we examined the pathways through which a nature-based curriculum teaching about the natural world, conservation science, and systems-based perspectives helped students' science learning, encompassing its socioemotional components. In 14 schools across three US cities, we conducted interviews with K-12 teachers who used the curriculum, focus groups with students, and we deployed a quantitative student impact survey. The sample of students were primarily ninth graders. Results indicated a holistic science learning experience, whereby they gained new understandings of complex natural phenomenon, developed systems thinking, and expressed excitement about science in the present and for future pursuits. The learning overlapped with interest in actions to protect and advocate for the environment. Access to nearby nature, hands-on interactions with flora and fauna, and collaborative explorations facilitated learning. The research underscores the value of studying the processes through which E -> STEM efforts build knowledgeable, engaged science learners motivated to protect the environment in the present and future.

AB  - Isolated legume fruits from the early-middle Miocene Shimo Formation of the Uchiura Group in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture, central Japan, are described in this paper. They are unique in yielding 1-coiled or curved and terete-moniliform shapes with both simple sutures constricting uniformly. A new fossil-species, Leguminocarpum oguruiensis, is designated here. These legume specimens occur together with a number of molluscan fossils that indicate tropical-subtropical shallow marine conditions at the warmest time period during the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. The species was probably dispersed by the oceanic currents from southerly areas and inhabited areas with coastal vegetation where warm-temperate forest elements dominated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The role of human activity as a vector in the movement of soil microorganisms is uncertain and disputed. It is increasingly clear that some larger microorganisms have restricted distributions and plausible to imagine that many human activities could lead to exotic species introductions, but concrete examples are lacking. We investigated an unusual case study: the former mining settlement of Pyramiden on the island of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago. In around 1983 large quantities of chernozem soils were imported from the southern USSR as part of an urban greening initiative, bringing large numbers of soil organisms to a very different physical environment. Focusing on a readily-identifiable group of protists with documented regional endemism (testate amoebae), we assessed morphospecies assemblages after thirty years. We analysed communities from Pyramiden imported soils and conducted comparisons to: i) nearby locations with non-imported near-natural soils; ii) previously-established datasets from near-natural Svalbard soils and chernozem soils in southern Russia, and iii) regional species inventories from both regions. Our aims were to assess how the community has adapted to the change in physical conditions and identify any evidence for the import of exotic taxa. Our results show significant differences between the assemblages of imported soils and those of nearby reference sites but strict comparisons are complicated by the different treatment of soils in different locations. No taxa were identified which can be unambiguously identified as atypical for the region. Assemblages of imported soils were more similar to those of other sites on Svalbard than to assemblages from southern Russia. Our data are equivocal but suggest that the testate amoeba assemblages of soils transported more than 3000 km northwards have substantially acclimated to the new conditions, contrasting with micro-invertebrates in the same site. 'Accidental experiments' like the soils of Pyramiden provide unique opportunities for long-term, large-scale, soil biological research.

AB  - Over the past decade, the plays of Anders Lustgarten have taken a prominent place in the English theatre repertoire. Performed by companies including Red Ladder, Cardboard Citizens, and the Royal Shakespeare Company, Lustgarten's dramatic writing places social and political issues centrestage, ranging from the housing crisis and the electoral ascendancy of far-right parties to the alienation of the urban working class and the racist scapegoating of immigrants. This article focuses on Lustgarten's landmark play inspired by the Occupy movement, If You Don't Let Us Dream, We Won't Let You Sleep (Royal Court Theatre, 2013). I explore how the play engages with, and reflects on, economic austerity, forms of contemporary mass protest, and, indirectly, evolving conceptions of English nationhood. I also examine Lustgarten's notion of "Radical Optimism" - a term he identifies with the global anti-austerity protests following the 2007-8 financial crisis - and consider its importance to what he calls "antiprop" political theatre. The first part of the article probes the relationship between If You Don't Let Us Dream and the established "tradition" of state-of-the-nation playwriting; the second part identifies the play's challenge to this "tradition," which is informed by its proximity to the Occupy protests.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of a machine learning approach to the description of residential mobility patterns of households in the Seoul metropolitan region (SMR). The spatial range and temporal scope of the empirical study were set to 2015 to review the most recent residential mobility patterns in the SMR. The analysis data used in this study included the Internal Migration Statistics microdata provided by the Microdata Integrated Service of Statistics Korea. We analysed the residential relocation distance of households in the SMR using machine learning techniques, such as ordinary least squares regression and decision tree regression. The results of this study showed that a decision tree model can be more advantageous than ordinary least squares regression in terms of explanatory power and estimation of moving distance. A large number of residential movements are mainly related to the accessibility to employment markets and some household characteristics. The shortest movements occur when households with two or more members move into densely populated districts. In contrast, job-based residential movements are relatively farther. Furthermore, we derived knowledge on residential relocation distance, which can provide significant information for the urban management of metropolitan residential districts and the construction of reasonable housing policies.

AB  - Over half of the 80 freshwater mussel species that historically occupied Illinois are now extinct, extirpated, endangered, or threatened. Two species of conservation concern that warrant further investigation are Ellipse (Venustaconcha ellipsybrmis) and Spike (Eurynia dilatata). Ellipse have experienced a 30% range contraction in Illinois and are a focal species for a regional conservation initiative in the state. Spike have experienced a range contraction of 55% in Illinois, despite remaining relatively common in bordering states. Several stressors have been proposed as causes of declines in both species, such as habitat fragmentation, hydrologic alteration, pollutants, and availability of fish hosts to aid mussel dispersal. Ultimately, developing effective conservation and management actions for these species requires identifying the environmental conditions that most strongly influence their persistence. Our objective was to identify the habitat features and environmental conditions that best explain patterns in Ellipse and Spike presence in northeastern Illinois. We found that number of pollution dischargers in a watershed was a strong predictor of presence in both species. However, host fish richness, total number of upstream dams, and duration of extreme low flows were also strong predictors of Ellipse presence, whereas distance to the nearest mainstem downstream dam and variation in the number of high flow pulses predicted Spike presence. Our analysis also revealed that different mussel species may respond to the same stressors in an opposite manner, suggesting that conservation actions should either be devised on a species-specific basis or balance the needs of multiple species simultaneously. The specific predictors of mussel distribution we found represent a starting point for developing restoration strategies for these species in northeastern Illinois.

AB  - In the literature on public opposition against spatial projects, social acceptance is considered a key variable in predicting protest. However, the process by which low levels of social acceptance are translated into real protest actions has received less attention in academia. Social movement theories predict that protest participation is strongly affected by social interaction. This article aims to connect theories on locational conflict with the growing literature on the neighborhood effect in social mobilization by conducting an empirical study of rare and unobtrusive data of protest participation, on the neighborhood level in particular.
   Our case study focuses on opposition against a highway project in the city of Antwerp, Belgium. Based on a large, geocoded database with addresses of protesters and activists, we build a model to analyze activism and mobilization in neighborhoods. We control for the distance between the neighborhood and the project, as well as the socio-demographic profile of the neighborhood.
   As expected, we fmd that distance has a significant impact on the occurrence of protest. Contrary to expectations, the aggregated socio-demographic profile of a neighborhood is not significantly related to levels of opposition. However, the presence of social capital and the presence of active protesters are good predictors of protest participation in the neighborhood. These findings support theories on the collective efficacy of neighborhoods.

AB  - The Haicheng earthquake (Ms 7.3) occurred in Liaoning Province (39 degrees N-43 degrees N, 120 degrees E-126 degrees E ), China on February 4, 1975. The mortality rate was only 0.02% owing to the first timely and accurate prediction, although the area affected by the earthquake was 9200 km(2) and covered cities with a population density of 1000 p/km(2). In this study, the double-difference (DD) tomography method was used to obtain high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) P- and S-wave velocity (Vp and Vs) structures and Vp/Vs as well as the earthquake locations. Tomography results suggest that velocity structure at shallow depth coincides well with topography and sediment thickness. The earthquake locations form a northwest-striking zone associated with the Jinzhou(JZ) Fault and a northeast-striking zone associated with the Haichenghe-Dayanghe (HD) Fault, and suggest that the JZ Fault consists of three faults and the Ms 7.3 Haicheng earthquake originated at the intersection of the JZ and the Faults. Low-velocity zones (LVZs) with low Vp/Vs are observed at 15-20 km depth beneath the Haicheng (HC) region. We interpret the LVZs in the middle crust as regions of fluids, suggesting rock dehydration at high temperatures. The LVZs and low Vp/Vs in the upper crust are attributed to groundwater-filled cracks and pores. We believe that large crustal earthquakes in this area are caused by the combination of faulting and fluid movement in the middle crust.

AB  - In the article, archival documents and evidence from contemporaries reveal features of German economic policy in occupied the Stalingrad Region are presented. All economic resources in the occupied areas were used to supply the Wehrmacht and German military industry. Therefore, reconstruction work in the city was carried out only on a scale required for the German army. Local inhabitants were killed in concentration camps or were subjected to looting and terror. A significant number of able-bodied citizens in these occupied areas were forcibly removed to Germany. The article presents archival data on damage inflicted on civilians and on objects of industrial and socio-cultural significance. Material and everyday difficulties of the local population during the occupation are also illustrated. Among them, the food problem was considerably aggravated and led to massive deaths, disease, and swelling from malnutrition. German repression contributed to the development in the field of movement for the disruption of economic, political, and military activities of the fascist invaders. The population shied away from compulsory registration, avoided compulsory labor, and harbored partisans and Red Army soldiers in their homes, who committed sabotage. The struggle against the forcible hijacking of the civilian population to fascist Germany acquired a mass scope. These and other forms of resistance to the brutal occupation regime became one of the most important prerequisites for the victory of Soviet troops at Stalingrad.

AB  - Introduction: Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) present accented motor difficulties and possibly present the Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) as co-occurring. Objective: Identify the motor profile of students with interdisciplinary diagnosis of ADHD, compare with students with good academic performance, and to verify the incidence of DCD in this population. Method: 46 students of both genders participated in the study, in the age range of 7 to 10 years and 11 months, attending from the 1st to the 5th year of elementary school at public schools in cities of Sao Paulo state. The students were divided into two groups: Group I (GI) included 23 students with ADHD; Group II (GII) included 23 students with good academic performance. The students were paired according to gender and age. The groups experienced motor assessment (Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition /MABC-2). MABC Test consisted of eight items grouped into three sections (manual dexterity, aiming and catching, and balance), parents/caregivers responded questions about the Economic Classification questionnaire. Results: The results were statistically analyzed in order to characterize and compare the motor profile of the students, intra, and intergroup. The results showed that 43.38% in GI presented indicative of DCD, whereas, in GII, none of the students presented indicative of DCD. However, it is possible to highlight an incidence of DCD in the population with ADHD in about 43%. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the importance of actions to assist and early diagnose this population by teachers, health professionals, and family, improving the life quality of these children.

AB  - Stalked crinoids have long been considered sessile. In the 1980s, however, observations both in the field and of laboratory experiments proved that some of them (isocrinids) can actively relocate by crawling with their arms on the substrate, and dragging the stalk behind them. Although it has been argued that this activity may leave traces on the sediment surface, no photographs or images of the traces produced by crawling crinoids have been available. Herein, we present results of neoichnological experiments using the shallowest species of living stalked crinoid, Metacrinus rotundus, dredged from Suruga Bay (near the town of Numazu, Shizuoka Prefecture,similar to 140m depth). Our results demonstrate that isocrinids produce characteristic locomotion traces, which have some preservation potential. They are composed of rather deep and wide, sometimes weakly sinuous, central drag marks left by the stalk and cirri, and short, shallow scratch marks made by the arms. Based on the functional morphology and taphonomy, it has been argued that the ability to autotomize the stalk and relocate had already evolved in the oldest stem-group isocrinids (holocrinids), likely in response to increased benthic predation pressure during the so-called Mesozoic marine revolution. Our data show that this hypothesis may be corroborated in the future by ichnological findings, which may provide more direct proof of active locomotion in Triassic holocrinids.

AB  - In this work, we map surficial ground deformations that occurred during the years 2004-2010 in the Crati Valley (Southern Italy). The valley is in one of the most seismically active regions of the Italian peninsula, and presents slope instability and widespread landslide phenomena. We measured ground deformations by applying the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique, a multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) methodology that is used to process datasets of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Ground displacements are only partially visible with the InSAR technique. Visibility depends on the geometry of the acquisition layout, such as the radar acquisition angle view, and the land use. These two factors determine the backscattering of the reflected signal. Most of the ground deformation detected by InSAR can be attributed to the gravitational mass movements of the hillslopes (i.e., landslides), and the subsidence of the quaternary deposits filling the valley. The movements observed along the valley slopes were compared with the available landslide catalog. We also identified another cause of movement in this area, i.e., ground subsidence due to the compaction of the quaternary deposits filling the valley. This compaction can be ascribed to various sources, such as urban population growth and sprawl, industrial water withdrawal, and tectonic activity.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships between expenditure inequality and expenditure polarization in Indonesia during the post-reformation era in 2002-2012. It also explores the various dimensions of regional groups; and finds out in which dimension did the expenditure inequality and polarization occur in Indonesia during the period.
   Design/methodology/approach Gini index was employed to measure expenditure inequality and a number of developed polarization measurement was applied to investigate the linkage between inequality and polarization at national levels. It also applied a polarization index based on inequality decomposition to investigate how the polarization occurs in the regional dimension. It covered several groups of regional dimensions; those are rural and urban areas; eastern and western regions, as well as natural resource-rich provinces and non-natural resource-rich provinces.
   Findings This study found that expenditure inequality and polarization in Indonesia have moved in line, showing an increasing trend during the observation period. In the regional context, the greatest rise was in the region with low initial levels of expenditure inequality and polarization. The trends in each of the regional dimension showed a convergent pattern. It also showed that a significant portion of total polarization was attributed to expenditure differences between urban and rural areas rather than the other groups of regions.
   Research limitations/implications The similar upward movement of expenditure inequality and polarization indicates that not only the differences between groups of expenditure are getting larger, but also the identification of the within groups expenditure are getting stronger. Since the high degree of inequality and polarization are closely related to conflict among groups of communities, this finding is a strong message to the policymaker that the development process in Indonesia during 2002-2012 tended to encourage the creation of social instability.
   Practical implications This study provides an evaluation for further development of social economy in Indonesia.
   Originality/value This paper attempts to give an overview of the relationship between expenditure inequality and polarization in Indonesia during 2002-2012. It also tries to reveal in which regional dimension, expenditure inequality and polarization occurred in Indonesia during the mentioned period. The issues have not been examined in previous empirical studies in Indonesia.

AB  - The experiences systematized and interpreted in this article occur in the Xukuru Indigenous Land, located in the Northeast region of Brazil. Nowadays, approximately eleven thousand people self-declare themselves Xukuru, living in the rural area of the territory, but also in nearby urban areas. Like other ethnic groups in the country, the Xukuru are dealing with severe food restrictions, at the same time acquiring and suffering with health problems linked to a poor modern diet. In this context, Xukuru sociopolitical entities strive to influence empowerment and intervention in matters related, among other things, to the local food culture and the valuing of native food. The results of this case study, a diverse process resulting from the research and extension work carried out between 2011 and 2016; demonstrate the need to think about the food heritage as a strategy for food and nutrition security from a holistic perspective of internal strengthening of the communities. The endogenous actions put in place by the Xukuru do Ororuba people show high potential, becoming a reference for other research experiences and social intervention in the subject. In this sense, it is vital to highlight the importance of the pedagogical approach in this type of strategies and the need to include a view linked to one's own cultural path and identity, reinforcing the scope of cultural autonomy.

AB  - Background
   Meconium ileus (MI) is one type intestinal obstruction due to inspissated meconium at the level of the terminal ileum. The purpose of this study is to present the non-ionizing ultrasound-guided approach for the treatment of meconium ileus.
   Materials and Methods
   This study was performed, prospectively, at Dr. Sheikh and Akbar children's Hospitals, Mashhad University of Medical Science (Mashhad city, Iran) from March 2017 to March 2018. The 21 newborn patients with suspicious meconium ileus were referred to Radiology department for contrast enema and ultrasound examination. The hydro colonic ultrasound-guided treatment was considered for four cases with simple form of meconium ileus. Ultimately, plain abdominal radiography was taken to documentation of entrance of solution to dilated proximal loop and evaluation of probable complications.
   Results
   In ultrasound exam, air bubbles are floating in fluids on proximal dilated loops, and no air is seen in bowel loops contain inspissated meconium. Ultrasound showed a collapsed microcolon in addition to inspissated meconium as a hypoechoic beaded intraluminal material in comparison to adjacent bowel mucosa. During ultrasound-guided enema, overt distention of unused colon and ileum was seen with coating and detachment of meconium plaques from bowel wall and floating and movement of the plaques toward the dilated proximal loops. The successful treatment in our study was occurred in two-third of cases.
   Conclusion
   Ultrasound-guided hydrostatic (hydro colonic) treatment can be a non-ionizing nonsurgical procedure for successful treatment of newborns with uncomplicated meconium ileus.

AB  - Occupancy-based control Occupancy information enables robust and flexible control of heating, ventilation, and airconditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings. In large spaces, multiple HVAC terminals are typically installed to provide cooperative services for different thermal zones, and the occupancy information determines the cooperation among terminals. However, a person count at room-level does not adequately optimize HVAC system operation due to the movement of occupants within the room that creates uneven load distribution. Without accurate knowledge of the occupants' spatial distribution, the uneven distribution of occupants often results in under-cooling/heating or over-cooling/heating in some thermal zones. Therefore, the lack of high-resolution occupancy distribution is often perceived as a bottleneck for future improvements to HVAC operation efficiency. To fill this gap, this study proposes a multi-feature k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) classification algorithm to extract occupancy distribution through reliable, low-cost Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks. An on-site experiment was conducted in a typical office of an institutional building to demonstrate the proposed methods, and the experiment outcomes of three case studies were examined to validate detection accuracy. One method based on City Block Distance (CBD) was used to measure the distance between detected occupancy distribution and ground truth and assess the results of occupancy distribution. The results show the accuracy when CBD = 1 is over 71.4% and the accuracy when CBD = 2 can reach up to 92.9%.

AB  - Sediments from a waste pit in Houston Ship Channel (HSC) were characterized using a number of molecular markers of natural organic matter fractions (e.g., pyrogenic carbon residues, PAHs, lignins), in addition to dioxins, in order to test the hypothesis that the dispersal and mobility of dioxins from the waste pit in the San Jacinto River is minimal. Station SG-6, sampled at the site of the submerged waste pit, had the highest dioxin/furan concentrations reported for the Houston Ship Channel/Galveston Bay (HSC/GB) system (10,000-46,000 pg/g), which translated into some of the highest reported World Health Organization Toxic Equivalents (TEQs: 2000-11,000 pg/g) in HSC sediments. Using a multi-tracer approach, this study confirmed our hypothesis that sludges from chlorinated pulps are a very likely source of dioxins/furans to this pit. However, this material also contained large quantities of additional hydrophobic organic contaminants (PAHs) and pyrogenic markers (soot-BC, levoglucosan), pointing to the co-occurrence of petroleum hydrocarbons and combustion byproducts. Comparison of dioxin/furan signatures in the waste pit with those from sediments of the HSC and a control site suggests that the remobilization of contaminated particles did not occur beyond the close vicinity of the pit itself. The dioxins/furans in sediments outside the waste pit within the HSC are rather from other diffuse inputs, entering the sedimentary environment through the air and water, and which are comprised of a mixture of industrial and municipal sources. Fingerprinting of waste pit dioxins indicates that their composition is typical of pulp and paper sources. Measured pore water concentrations were 1 order of magnitude lower than estimated values, calculated from a multiphase sorption model, indicating low mobility of dioxins within the waste pit. This is likely accomplished by co-occurring and strong sorbing pyrogenic and petrogenic residues in the waste pit, which tend to keep dioxins strongly sorbed to particles. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - This article explores how, and why, the capacity for civic responsibility and civility of conduct became a central discursive and practical battleground in the colonial world. Nowhere was this more pronounced than in colonial and apartheid South Africa, where the putative benefits of self-government along separate racial lines became a crucial component of apartheid. Starting from a brief conceptual history of civility and colonialism, I argue that the principle of self-government was a central pivot of apartheid. I explore how the celebrated Civics movement that eventually brought apartheid down fostered civic ties and "ethno-civility'' in a formerly Indian township in Durban from the 1970s to the 1990s. This legacy of ethno-civility has, however, turned out to be a major obstacle to the forging of relationships across racial boundaries in post-apartheid society. Deploying two ethnographic vignettes from this township, I argue that the ideals of global religious community today have taken the place as a promise of universality of mediation between groups and racial communities that the Civics movement used to occupy during the apartheid era. Yet, religious identities are unable to overcome deeper formations of racial and social difference.

AB  - India with estimated more than 2000 tigers (across 18 states) accounts for more than half of the remaining tigers across its range countries. Long-term conservation requires measures to protect the large carnivores and its prey base beyond the Protect Areas. The Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) and adjoining forest divisions with high density of tigers play a crucial role in conservation of tiger in Uttarakhand state as well as the Terai-Arc Landscape. However, CTR is surrounded with multiple-use forest (forest divisions), agriculture land, human habitation, townships and developmental projects. The movement of large carnivores and other wildlife through such habitats adds to the chances of human-wildlife conflict. The aim of the current study was to understand the patterns of livestock depredation by tigers and leopards in and around CTR. We examined a total of 8365 incidents of livestock depredation between 2006 and 2015 with tigers killing more livestock in a year (573.3 +/- 41.2) than leopards (263.2 +/- 9.9). Geographically, in north zone of CTR leopards were the major livestock predator (166.6 +/- 1 1), whereas tigers (547.7 +/- 40.1) in south zone. Examination of livestock kills indicated cows (75%) as the main victim, followed by buffaloes and other species. Analysis revealed that the livestock depredation by tigers varied significantly among seasons in south zone but not in north zone. However, such an explicit seasonal variation was not observed for leopards in north and south zone of CTR. Hotspots of livestock predation were identified around CTR. Addressing a conflict situation in a time-bound manner, timely disbursement of ex-gratia payment, involving locals at various tourism related activities and consistent rapport building initiatives are required to mitigate the human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - The old mining district of Linares (Southern Spain) was subject to intense Pb mining, minerallurgical and metallurgical activities for centuries, causing significant contamination of nearby soils. In this area the present study analysed the surroundings of the former lead smelter of La Cruz, where, in previous studies, soils with high metal(loid) contents were detected. To determine the intensity, spatial distribution and dispersion mechanisms of different trace elements, a geochemical prospecting campaign was designed in which 44 samples were collected from a 2.2 km(2) surface area around the smeller. Of the 33 elements analysed, nine metal(loid)s (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, As, Sb, Bi, Cd and Tl) were found to have a high enrichment factor (EF). These elements show mean concentrations of 672, 6491, 464, 2.8, 75, 20, 2, 13 and 2.9 mg kg(-1), respectively, values which largely exceed the levels of the environmental quality standards for soils established by both regional and European regulations. Multivariate analysis and geostatistical distribution maps enabled the most intensely contaminated areas to be characterised.
   The results obtained indicate that the main contamination zone is related to the smelter itself, with two different dispersal mechanisms: the first is linked to the gases and dust emissions generated by the metallurgical processes, and transported by the prevailing winds, in Southwest-Northeast direction; the second is associated with the leachate produced in the smelter residues. Additionally, two other secondary foci are formed by tailings ponds and mining residues. The contamination areas are known to affect a residential zone near the old smelter installations and land located Northeast of these areas, where there is an olive grove. The results of this study should therefore serve as a basis for the adoption of corrective measures to minimize the adverse effects on the soil from the old mining-metallurgical activities.

AB  - Railway trespassing is a very risky but common behaviour, resulting in about 200 casualties annually in the Czech Republic. This study describes the formation of 27 selected risk localities with frequent occurrence of trespassing in the regions of southern, central and northern Moravia. To be able to describe the process, an evaluation of the development of land use was conducted within a wide spatial context of each spot. The evaluation was focused on functional use of built-up areas (collective and individual housing, industrial areas, shopping and services, recreational areas, etc.). In the sample of investigated localities were places of two kinds: (1) localities where the railway intersected existing settlement structures, and relationships and links within the area were radically disturbed and severed. A lack of legal possibilities for crossing restricts the movement of inhabitants at these localities; (2) localities where the railway originally passed through open landscape and was later surrounded by built-up areas with various land-use functions. Here, trespassing is the consequence of gaps in the urban-planning process, wherein the needs of pedestrians and cyclists were not sufficiently considered. The analysis of the development of land use since 1836 showed how the motivations of trespassing were gradually intensified with more and more complex structures of functional division of areas. The percentage of built-up areas increased in all monitored localities overall from 6.28% during 1836-1852 to 52.15% during 2014-2015.

AB  - Retaining structures with bored piles and temporary inclined steel struts are suitable for the reinforcement of underground projects located in urban areas of high-density development as they are convenient for use in earth excavations and their use leads to considerable savings in time and cost. However, few data are available on foundation pits supported by bored piles and inclined steel struts. This paper presents a case study to investigate the behavior of a large-scale foundation pit supported by bored piles and inclined steel struts, in which the movement of the foundation pit and the displacement of the retaining structure are reported. The measured results along the length of the foundation pit were found to be smaller than those along the width (with a difference of approximately 13.5-30.0%), including the vertical and lateral displacement of the foundation pit, as well as the lateral displacement of the bored piles. The lateral displacement at the top of the bored piles, delta(h), was 0.2-0.5% of the excavation depth, H-e. The lateral displacement of the bored piles decreased with the decreasing distance from the corner (with a difference of approximately 50%), which demonstrated the corner effect on the movement of the bored piles. Based on the measured results of this field case, it was found that the maximum settlement and the lateral displacement were located at the cross section through the center of the west side of the foundation pit. In order to predict the distribution of settlement at the surface and the basal heave at this section, plane-strain finite element analyses were conducted to estimate the location where the maximum settlement occurred at the surface of the foundation pit. The difference between the numerical results and the measurements was found to be in the range of 2.6-33.0%, which validates the numerical model with some reasonable accuracy. The numerical results show that the maximum surface settlement occurred at a distance of 0.6 H-e away from the top of the foundation, whereas the settlement at the bottom of the foundation was almost uniform at the final construction stage (e.g., 25 mm).

AB  - Study region: This study was carried out along the Blanco River in south-central Texas which drains approximately 1100 km(2).
   Study focus: Unprecedented rainfall across the state of Texas in May 2015 produced flooding that claimed at least 24 lives across the state. The most devastating single event over this period occurred on 23-24 May along the Blanco River, where a fast moving floodwave resulted in eleven fatalities in the town of Wimberley. The storm event resulted in the flood of record at the USGS gauge in Wimberley which has collected data since the 1920s.
   New hydrological insights: Meteorological observations, high-resolution rainfall estimates, and physics-based distributed hydrological modeling provide the opportunity to examine the hydrometeorological mechanisms accompanying the extreme storm and subsequent flood. Additionally, transpositions of the radar rain fields forced through the hydrologic model allow for analysis of the effect of position of the centroid of the storm relative to the catchment on floodwave propagation. Two major controls on the flood response are identified and analyzed: the position of heavy storm cells over the headwaters with subsequent slow movement downstream and the extremely moist antecedent conditions prior to the onset of the event.

AB  - The livelihoods of people inhabiting inland Eurasia have long been jeopardized by repeated natural hazards associated with a harsh environment and a cold, arid climate. Dzud is a Mongolian word indicating harsh winter conditions. In the present study, we considered dzud damage (e.g., livestock loss) to result from a combination of climate hazard (e.g., cold surges) and herders' socioeconomic vulnerability. For this study, we integrated crucial socioeconomic factors accounting for major spatiotemporal variations in Mongolia by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to a comprehensive province-level, multiyear dataset. We subsequently characterized the regionality of herders' vulnerability to the dzud event that occurred during the 2009/2010 winter by conducting a cluster analysis of the provincial principal component (PC) scores for the pre-dzud year (2009). Our results revealed a distinct geographical pattern of vulnerability. Herding households in the northern and northeastern (relatively wet and plain) areas were found to be well prepared for harsh winters, with shelters against wind and availability of forage, including hay, as well as easy access to major urban markets. By contrast, herding households in the southern and southwestern (arid and mountainous) areas were poorly prepared, with inadequate circumstances that facilitate pursuing of otor (movement of nomadic herders in search of better pastures) and lack of access to markets and dzud relief support because of their remote locations. The time coefficients of PC 2, related to winter preparedness, indicated that vulnerability increased between 2003 and 2009 (the pre-dzud year). This was partly responsible for the record-level mortality observed in 2010 across the southern and southwestern rural region, in conjunction with harsh winter weathers.

AB  - In this article, Mike Pearson challenges what Guy Debord suggests is the primary urban character' of the derive. Following a memorable encounter with a pair of European Nighjars, he reflects upon how birds might occasion, guide, lead and dramaturgically orchestrate drifting and upon choreographies of bird watching. How, in their quest, birds engender expectation and urgency, necessitating preparation - going equipped with specialist optical tools, clothing, footwear - and precipitating heightened senses of attention and concentration. How their appearance and encounter sets and punctuates the tempo and rhythm of the excursion. How this leads to adjustments: of timings - halting, lingering, waiting, rushing to follow; of ways of seeing - negotiating looking up and out simultaneously, getting one's eye in, accustoming it to colour and movement in this terrain, oscillating between near and far, scanning, rapid shifting; of listening - cocking an ear, focusing direction. Above all, of posture, gait and locomotion: moving in slow motion, walking sideways, holding the body at odd angles, crouching, crawling, twitching. Conjuring improvised responses of concealment and revelation in relation to a landscape: of becoming attuned and absorbed - another feature of this place. How it prompts memories of similar occurrences here, of this place at different times, of these birds in other places...Field Guides' points of reference are J.A. Baker's The Peregrine (1967) in which the author trails the raptor across the flat Essex marshes; Mark Cocker's Crow Country (2012), the memoire of a rook-following man'; John Berger's essay Field' (1971) in which Finches chasing each other from bush to bush' might constitute a first event' - that fixes ones attention and that then leads you to apprehend further events within a field; and the hypotactic conflations of optic and haptic in John Clare's poetry - With every smell and sound and sight beguiled' (The Village Boy').

AB  - Introduction: Traditional indices for measuring dengue fever risk in a given area are based on the immature forms of the vector (larvae and pupae surveys). However, this is inefficient because only adult female mosquitoes actually transmit the virus. Based on these assumptions, our objective was to evaluate the association between an entomological index obtained from adult mosquito traps and the occurrence of dengue in a hyperendemic area. Additionally, we compared its cost to that of the Breteau Index (BI).
   Material and methods: We performed this study in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil, between the epidemiological weeks of 36/2012 and 19/2013. BG-Sentinel and BG-Mosquitito traps were installed to capture adult mosquitoes. Positive and negative cases of dengue fever were computed and geocoded. We generated biweekly thematic maps of the entomological index, generated by calculating the number of adult Aedes aegypti females (NAF) per 100 households during a week by kriging, and based on the number of mosquitoes captured. The relation between the occurrence of dengue fever and the NAF was tested using a spatial case-control design and a generalized additive model and was controlled by the coordinates of the positive and negative cases of dengue fever.
   Results: Our analyses showed that increases in dengue fever cases occurred in parallel with increases in the number of Ae. aegypti females. The entomological index produced in our study correlates positively with the incidence of dengue, particularly during intervals when vector control measures were applied less intensively. The operational costs of our index were lower than those of the BI: NAF used 71.5% less human resources necessary to measure the Bl.
   Conclusions: Spatial analysis techniques and the number of adult Ae. aegypti females were used to produce an indicator of dengue risk. The index can be applied at various levels of spatial aggregation for an entire study area, as well as for sub-areas, such as city blocks. Even though the index is adequate to predict dengue risk, it should be tested and validated in various scenarios before routine use.

AB  - Simplifying life by combining minimum effort with the maximum feeling of well-being, establishing minimum distances and adapting this circulation path to the partition walls between rooms, the boundaries of which are often floating between plan and elevation. This is how architect Barba Corsini describes his intervention, between 1954 and 1955, inside a well-known Gaudi building, located in Barcelona: Casa Mila, also known as La Pedrera. After the real estate agency Provence buys the entire building in 1946, its manager commissions Barba Corsini the remodeling of the attic floor to build several 70 square meter apartments for rent. Remodeling the attic floor of Casa Mila building 13 apartments, has a much wider scope than overcoming the inevitable Gaudinian pressure. Pressure-responsibility- which in its turn, is twofold: First, as the building architect Josep M. Sostres was in charge of updating since the second half of the 1950s. He integrated the building into the architectural imaginary, well away from that first rational impression inevitably created from its structural perspective. Second, as a building whose presence, structure, form and urban approach eclipses any attempt at resemblance, without risking to fall inexorably into the Gaudi universe.
   Barba Corsini draws attention to the "organic milieu" he is working in. He combines elementary materials, and accepts a precarious building industry, domestic habits, difficult standardization, chromatism, and furniture. He takes into consideration architectural honesty both with regard to structure and materials, the very words he uses in his report on the project. A well-documented monograph by Joaquim Ruiz Millet, as well as several articles, provide an initial approach to the work of Barba Corsini in La Pedrera. Taking up once again the issue of the regrettably disappeared apartments of Barba Corsini in Gaudi's Casa Mila is to delve into the work of an architect who is not much interested in theory and who greatly appreciates Frank Lloyd Wrights architectural attitude, as seen in the film The Fountainhead (King Vidor, 1949).
   Interpreting the architectural work of 13 apartments in Casa Mila at the same time means understanding the connection established between Gaudi, Barba Corsini and the modernity of a generation of architects (Josep Antoni Coderch, Antoni Bonet, Francesc Mitjans). They learned more from the Modern Movement through putting it into practice than through its theories. This allowed them to establish a more local and heterodox relationship with t he Modern Movement. The present text is based on the primary sources of the construction, which are preserved at the Historical Archive of Catalonias Association of Architects (AHCOAC), and on secondary sources which consist of interviews, documents and works on the architect.

AB  - The increasing movement of people and products caused by modern economic dynamics has burdened transportation systems. Both industrialized and developing countries have faced transportation problems in urbanized regions and in their major intercity corridors. Regional and highway congestion have become a chronic problem, causing longer travel times, economic inefficiencies, deterioration of the environment and quality of life. Congestion problems are also occurring at airports and air corridors, with similar negative effects. In the medium distance travel market (from 160 up to 800 km), too far to drive and too short to fly, High Speed Rail (HSR) technology has emerged as a modern transportation system, as it is the most efficient means for transporting large passenger volumes with high speed, reliability, safety, passenger comfort and environmental performance. HSR system's feasibility will depend on its capacity to generate social benefits (i.e. increased mobility rates, reduced congestion, capacity increase and reduced environmental costs), to be balanced with the high construction, maintenance and operational costs. So, it is essential to select HSR corridors with strong passenger demands to maximize these benefits. The first HSR line was Japan's Shinkansen service, a dedicated HSR system, between Tokyo and Osaka, launched in 1964, which is currently the most heavily loaded HSR corridor in the world. France took the next step, launching the Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV), in 1981, with a dedicated line with shared-use segments in urban areas, running between Paris and Lyon. Germany joined the venture in the early 1990 with the Inter City Express - ICE, with a coordinated program of improvements in existent rail infrastructure and Spain, in 1992, with the Alta Velocidad Espanola - AVE, with dedicated greenfield lines. Since then, these systems have continuously expanded their network. Currently, many countries are evaluating the construction of new HSR lines, with European Commission deeming the expansion of the Trans European Network as a priority. United Kingdom, for example, has just awarded construction contracts for building the so called HS2, an HSRexpanded line linking London to the northern territory. China, with its dynamic economic development, has launched its HSR network in 2007 and has sped up working on its expansion, and currently holds the highest HSR network. United States, which currently operates high speed trainsets into an operationally restricted corridor (the so called Northeast Corridor (NEC), linking Washington, New York and Boston), has also embarked into the high speed rail world with the launch of Californian HSR Project, currently under construction, aimed to link Los Angeles to San Francisco mega regions, the ongoing studies for Texas HSR project, to connect Dallas to Houston, into a wholly privately funding model, as well as studies for a medium to long term NEC upgrade for HSR. Australia and Brazil are also seeking to design and launch their first HSR service, into a time consuming process, in which a deep discussion about social feasibility and affordability is under way. This work is supposed to present an overview of HSR technology worldwide, with an assessment of the main technical, operational and economical features of Asian and European HSR systems, followed by a snapshot of the general guidelines applied to some planned HSR projects, highlighting their demand attraction potential, estimated costs, as well as their projected economic and environmental benefits.

TI  - ON THE IMPOTRANCE OF BIRDS: EXAMPLES OF THE EXISTENTIAL VALUE AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BIRDS IN SERBIA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF FAUNA OF SERBIA

AB  - Unsuffiscent awarness on the importance of the existence of birds is among the major reasons why the results of scientific ornirhological research so poorely end in its implementation in ecomomic development, in environmental conservation, in education, culture and other social activities. Consequently, in Serbia, there are the irregularity of financial support to bird studies, the shortage in professional ornithologists, and the lack of regular academic curricula on the Class Aves.
   The perception of the importance of birds evolved conceptually during time. In 19th and 20th centuries in Serbia dominated a concept of the practical, so-called economic importance of birds. It was based on divergently evaluating each bird species either as beneficial or as a pest. In modern agronomy and forestry, evidence on activities of the birds, allied to humans, increased. Positivelly have been valuated especially perching bird species when controll the insects as pests, and some raptors and owls - predators of rodents. And oppositelly, lot of birds have been labelled negativelly and considered nuissible in agroculture and forestry. Problem appears when the same species, such as some raptors, are mutually beneficial (controlling rodents) and nuissible (taking poultry). In cities, negative attitude is recorded toward gregarious species that pollute public and private surfaces. The conflicts between fisheries and piscivorous birds are notoriuous. Gregarious birds attracted by huge airport landing areas and runways cause a serious security risk to the air transport.
   In the first half of 20th century the more sound question of assessing the importance of birds excallates, pollarising the experts into conservationists and representatives of development interests. As a result of first attempting to compromisingly regulate this matter, the international Convention for the Protection of Birds Useful to Agriculture was signed in Paris 1902. Serbian national lows followed this approach and forbided destruction of beneficial species, allowing (and even ordering) killing of bird pests. By the end of the first half of 20th century the scientists renowned in Serbia start to publicly emphasise the deficiencies of such an black/white concept. Step by step, in novelling hunt regulations the number of pest species officially decreased to few.
   As a result of environmental studies and under recommendations of Biodiversity Convention, the evaluation of birds in Serbia of 21th century conversed to the concept of the protection of natural values and conservation of biological diversity. Instead of most beneficial to economy, most valuable species become those most threatened, in need of most protection, to be safeguarded from extinction. Simultaneously, birds were evaluated in the scope of famous ecosystem services. Among cultural services, birds provide physical and intellectual, as well as spiritual, symbolic and other interactions with humans. True, in all cultures and religions birds play important roles. From the earliest childhood, man admires birds. Some authors recognise this as fascination of birds.
   The reflection or perception of the birds in traditional and contemporary creativity is multifold. The semantics of birds in general, and of individual species is complex in the cultural, linguistic, literary, artistic, historiographic, scientific, mythological, religious, political, and any other aspects. In fact, the reflection on birds in us, tells much more on us than on birds, as proved as yet in childish drawings. Birds are mentioned already in the starting sentence of Iliad, in the very beginning step of European literature. A bird is the first word of the first verse of the earliest record of a Serbian epic poem from 15th century. An unexpected avian allegoric antithesis in the beginning of one among the oldest Serbian epic poems, the one on the Fall of Serbian Empire, uses two different bird species as personifications of saints. Birds have specific position in Serbian, as well as in most other languages, that could be considered as the oldest and most persistent treasure of memorised experiences. Significance of lexic richness becommes obvious in the fact that average people knows many more traditional species names of birds than the number of species they can describe or identify on the plates or in the field. Even the designers of national courts of arms used to be unfamiliar with proper appearences of the birds they depicted. The harizmas and symbolic significances of some species do not correspond necessarily with natural characteristics of given birds. This divergence originates back to the ancient times and was communicated to modern days by medieval Physiologuses, didactic religious textes, translated to Serbian. The early inhabitants of todays Serbia gave an enormous importance to the birds. Archaeological findings from the Iron and Bronze Ages allong the middle course of Daube, and wider in central parts of Balcan Peninsula, contain a dominating number of votive and ritual ornithomorphic objects and pottery carrying avian depictions. In the same ages presentation of any other animal are very few.
   The abbility of birds to play the roles of excellent bioindicators is one of the classical service values in cathegory of regulating and sustaining ecosystems. Birds may indicate the status of ecosystem, the quality of habitat, the effects of climatic changes, the pollution, the spread of diseases, as well as many other changes, processes and phenomena. However, there is no instiutional service, project nor network for monitoring birds as indicators of ecological changes. Instead of that, there are some well organised and efficient programmes of civil research.
   Civil ornithological organisations in Serbia attract increasing number of amateur bird-watchers, bird photogaphers and naturalists. In that way, those organisations become a value themself because they create a new value - enhance the quality of life for their members. Consequently, a new interest group appears, with the conservation of existential values of birds as a principal goal. This social group calls publicly for its civil right to utilise the natural values and opposes to other such groups (hunters, fishermen) aiming to exploit nature's welth exclusively.

AB  - Objective: To describe how people who use wheelchairs participate and move at home and in the community over an entire yearlong period, including during times of inclement weather conditions.
   Design: Longitudinal mixed-methods research study.
   Setting: Urban community in Canada.
   Participants: People who use a wheelchair for home and community mobility (N=11).
   Intervention: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Use of a global positioning system (GPS) tracker for movement in community (number of trips per day), use of accelerometer for bouts of wheeling mobility (number of bouts per day, speed, distance, and duration), prompted recall interviews to identify supports and barriers to mobility and participation.
   Results: More trips per day were taken during the summer (P=.03) and on days with no snow and temperatures above 0 degrees C. Participants reliant on public transportation demonstrated more weather-specific changes in their trip patterns. The number of daily bouts of mobility remained similar across seasons; total daily distance wheeled, duration, and speed were higher on summer days, days with no snow, and days with temperatures above 0 degrees C. A higher proportion of outdoor wheeling bouts occurred in summer (P=.02) and with temperatures above 0 degrees C (P=.03). Inaccessible public environments were the primary barrier to community mobility and participation; access to social supports and private transportation were the primary supports.
   Conclusions: Objective support is provided for the influence of various seasonal weather conditions on community mobility and participation for people who use a wheelchair. Longitudinal data collection provided a detailed understanding of the patterns of, and influences on, wheelchair mobility and participation within wheelchair users' own homes and communities.

AB  - Vultures comprise the most endangered avian foraging guild (obligate scavengers) and their loss from ecosystems can trigger trophic cascades, mesopredator release, and human rabies epidemics, indicating their keystone species status. Vultures' extremely large home ranges, which often cross international borders of countries that have differing laws and capacity for wildlife conservation, makes conserving them challenging. However, satellite-tracking data can be used to identify habitat preferences and critical sites to target conservation actions. We tracked 16 Egyptian Vultures, Neophron percnopterus, in the Middle East and East Africa. We used dynamic Brownian bridge movement models to calculate home ranges and core-use areas, and we analyzed habitat use in a resource selection framework. Combined summer and winter ranges (99% utilization distributions) of all birds covered 209,800 and 274,300 km(2), respectively. However, the core-use areas (50% utilization distributions) in the summer and winter ranges, accounted for only 0.4-1.1% of this area (900 and 3100 km(2), respectively). These core-use areas are where the home ranges of multiple individuals overlapped and/or where individuals spent a lot of time, such as feeding and roosting sites, and are places where conservation actions could focus. Resource selection models predicted Egyptian Vulture occurrence throughout little-studied parts of the species' range in the Middle East and East Africa, and revealed strong selection for proximity to highways, power distribution lines, and towns. While providing roosts (e.g. power pylons) and food (e.g. garbage dumps), anthropogenic features may also function as ecological traps by increasing exposure to electrocution and dietary toxins.

AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions; increasing groundwater salinity is one of the significant signs of groundwater quality degradation. This is a particularly serious environmental problem in coastal cities where the groundwater resources are being contaminated by sea water intrusion in coastal aquifers. In the coastal aquifer of the Tripoli region, the sea water intrusion continues to expand and the salinity of many wells has increased drastically in the last decades. The volume of groundwater being abstracted from this aquifer has exceeded the safe yield of the aquifer, causing a very significant drop in the water table, thus drying some of the wells. This issue of increased salinity in many parts of the aquifer has become a major cause of the deterioration of the aquifer structure. To address this issue, numerical modelling has been used to effectively manage groundwater resources to predict future responses, particularly in complex aquifer systems and heterogeneous formations. The ModelMuse model has been used as an indicator tool of this serious problem in the Tripoli aquifer. In this paper, three suggested pumping scenarios with varying abstraction rates for the next 80 years (from 2020 to 2100) were suggested. The impact of each scenario on groundwater level were investigated by using MODFLOW 2005 under ModelMuse software. The pumping scenarios; include: firstly, maintaining the fixed pumping rate of 70x10(6) m(3)/yr for the study period, then increasing pumping rates due to population growth and in the third scenario, maintaining the pumping rate by using the sustainable abstraction of 19x10(6)m(3)/yr for the period from 2020 to 2100. Results indicate that the first and second scenarios have a negative effect on the groundwater level, where these scenarios will lead to a significant decrease in the groundwater level. It is predicted that most of the wells will be dry by the year 2100 and sea water intrusion will extend to the boundary of the Tripoli aquifer in the South. However, when a sustainable quantity will be pumped from the aquifer (third scenario), a clear recovery of the aquifer will occur (increase in groundwater levels with reverse movement of the sea water from the aquifer towards the sea).

AB  - Despite the fact that it represents only a small part of the total amount of water on the planet (1.2%), land-based water is very significant for man. The demographic explosion that marked the 20th century on the one hand caused constant growth of the need for pure water and on the other hand increased the extent of water pollution due to development of industry, intensification of agriculture and expansion of urban regions. Human action leads to greater or lesser changes of ecological factors in aquatic ecosystems (amount of dissolved oxygen, pH, heavy metal concentration, etc.), regulation of watercourses, disruption of communication between biocoenoses and disturbance of the natural water regime (through the creation of reservoirs). All of this brings about changes in biocoenoses that can be very pronounced, going even so far as to the virtual destruction of life in an aquatic ecosystem or in less severe cases to replacement of an existing biocoenosis by a new one that due to greater homogeneity of ecological factors is characterized by lower diversity.
   In order to conserve the water resources of the Republic of Serbia, it is necessary to monitor them closely. Biomonitoring is an obligatory part of this task because it is a simple, fast and economical way to follow the state of ecosystems of land-based water. Of all groups of aquatic organisms used in biomonitoring: bacteria, protozoans, zooplankton, phytobenthos, macrophytes and fish, macroinvertebrates are the most widely employed, especially in streams, where they are absolutely the most significant community of bioindicatory organisms.
   Modern biomonitoring of streams both in the world at large and in Serbia is based to the greatest extent on the use of macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of water quality owing to their many advantages over other aquatic organisms. Macroinvertebrates are widely disseminated organisms that inhabit various types of aquatic ecosystems, from little temporary (ephemeral) stagnant pools, small springs and creeks to large lakes and rivers. The great diversity of macrozoobenthic organisms and extremely complex structure of their communities on the one hand make them very sensitive to anthropogenic action causing changes of ecological factors, and on the other hand enable them potentially to respond with changes in the composition of their biocoenoses that are proportional to intensity of the anthropogenic action in question. Such organisms are characterized by the ability to persist in conditions of fast flowing water because they live attached to the bottom, possess long life cycles and have limited mobility. Their low mobility and sedentary way of life enable the investigator to establish the state of ecological factors on a given area. The relatively long life cycles (lasting 2-3 years) of these organisms make it possible to investigate changes occurring over the course of time. Apart from biological considerations, there are also numerous practical reasons why these organisms are considered good indicators of water quality: samples are taken with relatively inexpensive equipment; the taxonomy of most groups has been thoroughly elaborated; keys for their identification are available; methods that employ macrozoobenthic organisms have been used for many years and are highly reliable; and the responses of certain organisms to different types and levels of pollution have been precisely defined.
   Macrozoobenthic organisms can be used to test the influence of anthropogenic stress on aquatic. biotopes at all levels of biological organization, from molecular to ecosystematic. The effects of pollution on these organisms under natural conditions are most often analysed on the level of their populations or communities, using structural attributes (measured by indexes of diversity and similarity, biotic indexes, etc.) or functional characteristics, including, for example, primary production, respiratory processes, biomass (secondary production) and circulation of elements, but also aspects of the organisms' life history such as functional guilds in the feeding of a taxon.
   Investigation of macrozoobenthic communities has been and will be a central part of the ecology of land-based water, partly due to the fact that streams for them represent a crucial link between resources in the form of organic matter (for example, fallen leaves, algae, detritus, etc.) and fish in food webs, and partly due to the diversity and wide dissemination of the organisms involved. In view of these facts, it is unsurprising that systematic research on the fauna of macroinvertebrates in land-based water of Serbia was initiated almost a century ago and has been carried out in continuity with varying intensity up to the present day. More intensive use of macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring of the ecosystems of land-based water in Serbia, as in the world at large, began around the middle of the last century, at which time they started to be included in monitoring of water quality by the Hydrometeorological Institute of Serbia.
   As can be seen from the above, Serbian science actively followed world trends in biomonitoring of land-based water from the very start, although the intensity of these investigations was highly variable. Intensification of research on macroinvertebrates and their use in biomonitoring of land-based water occurred during the 1990s, with the formation in Novi Sad, Belgrade and Kragujevac of several independent teams of investigators that laid a solid foundation for further progress, as is evident in a series of studies introducing new and modern methods of biomonitoring, methods such as employment of biomarkers, recording of morphological asymmetries and deformities and use of artificial neuron networks. To be specific, the work of these teams has greatly advanced available knowledge about biology of the macroinvertebrates of land-based water in Serbia and continued to keep pace with world trends in their use for biomonitoring. A good example is the development of BNBI and incorporation of a number of EU standard methods into norms for regulation of biomonitoring in Serbia. Despite this positive trend, it must be stated that the use of macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of the quality of land-based water in Serbia is relatively limited because in the majority of cases it is done within the framework of saprobiological analyses, whereas biotic indexes are for the most part unjustifiably ignored, while multimetric indexes and the multivariant approach have not even begun to be employed.
   For these reasons, the state of biomomitoring in Serbia still cannot be considered satisfactory. To be specific, if the extent of land-based water biomonitoring in Great Britain where it is continuously conducted at more than 6000 localities is compared with the state of affairs in Serbia where about 90 localities out of a planned 500 are continuously monitored it can be seen that the level of biomonitoring in our country is disproportionally lower. Moreover, a comparison of stream quality in Great Britain, despite that country's significantly more advanced industrial development and greater population density, with the situation in Serbia shows that the quality of streams in our country is conspicuously far worse. It is clearly necessary to expand the volume and content of biomonitoring because only in that way will it be possible to make correct decisions in the management of water resources and thereby improve their quality. Meanwhile, at the existing level of macroinvertebrate studies in Serbia, that is not simply a question of political willingness, but also a task limited by the quality and quantity of fundamental research. As has been stated before, successful use of macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring demands an exceptionally good knowledge of the base reference state. That at the present time calls for additional faunistic, taxonomic, biogeographic and toxicological research, as well as studies on the typization of watercourses. It will be possible to define groups of reference localities in Serbia, as has been done in Great Britain, only if the inventory of species in our country is known in detail, if taxonomic problems are resolved, if keys for the identification of species are available, if their range has been clarified and if the types of watercourses and their ecological status (condition) are known. This in turn will make it possible to apply some highly organized system of biomonitoring like RIVPACS or to develop a multimetric index like the ones elaborated in the EU's AQEM program.
   That the path to this goal is long is clearly indicated by the fact although acknowledged experts today exist for the taxonomy of macroinvertebrate groups such as Chironomidae, Oligochaeta, Heteroptera, Trichoptera, Amphipoda and Gastropoda, research on a number of very important groups such as Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera has only just begun, a situation that has a significant effect on the quality and reliability of determination of these groups, knowledge about their distribution and awareness of their ecological preferences, as well as on the typization of land-based water habitats in Serbia vis-a-vis other countries in the world. Progress in this area largely depends on politics of the state, that is on the measure in which it is ready to support studies, finance the necessary increase in the number of researchers and through selection of programs and projects guide investigative efforts in an appropriate direction. It is also necessary to widen the network of localities at which sampling is prescribed by law, since only by sampling in an organized and planned manner will it be possible to collect an adequate number of data in a procedurally uniform way permitting the drawing of comparisons, development of new biomononitoring methods in Serbia and improvement of ones already in existence. That is the only way to form a standardized database of information about the ecosystems of Serbian streams. Such a database will be the foundation needed for the standardization of reference localities, which represents a key step toward the implementation of both multivariant and multimetric methods in biomonitoring.

AB  - It is thought that future climate change is likely to foster biological invasions, but effects of climate warming on invasions in recent decades are little explored. In this paper, we analyse the history of the spread of Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) in central Europe in order to determine the effects of climate warming. In addition, we infer the likely history of this species' spread and current distribution from incomplete documentation. The area studied in central Europe includes Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany. Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland. These countries were represented by a lattice of grid cells of size 5' x 3' (similar to 6 x 6 km(2)), and we modelled this species' increase in range in this grid from 1900 to 2010 at an annual resolution. The spread was modelled to be driven by the spatio-temporal variation in environmental suitability of grid cells as determined by climatic conditions and land use. propagule production and dispersal from invaded cells, and 'background' introductions from unknown sources. A hierarchical Bayesian modelling approach accounted for lagged and incomplete records of occurrence and spatio-temporal variation in sampling intensity. We fitted models with different representations of climate variation over time, and further contrasted the hierarchical model to a simplified model, which assumed that records accurately reflected the species' actual spread. Climatic conditions were the most important determinants of environmental suitability for invasion, and suitability also increased with increase in the proportion of urban area and length of railways in grid cells. Temperature was, on average, 2.7 degrees C higher in the environmentally more suitable cells than in the less suitable cells. The pattern in the spread was determined by local range expansion from multiple, spatially scattered points of introduction. Assuming a linear trend in climate warming over the modelling period provided a better model fit than using annual weather conditions or the long-term average of the climate. The model estimated that by 2010 only about 60% of the actually invaded grid cells were recorded, and records lagged behind actual eolonizations by years up to decades. Inferences of the hierarchical and simplified models differed quantitatively. We conclude that by using our modelling framework it is possible to separate spatial effects of climate on the spread of non-native species from temporal effects, and that climate warming has already promoted the spread of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in central Europe. The recorded distribution reflects only a part of this species' actual distribution. Properly accounting for incomplete records hence improves inferences about the dynamics of spread.

TI  - "Universal Means of Governance": the State of National Emergency in the Republic of Estonia in 1938-1940
T2  - TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
LA  - Estonian
AB  - As we know, a nationwide or partial state of emergency was continuously in effect in Estonia since 1918, when it was vigorously applied solely against communists. In the summer of 1933, the government headed by Jaan Tonisson imposed a temporary state of emergency in the city and county of Tartu in reference to the danger posed by the Estonian War of Independence veterans' movement. This state of emergency was later extended to cover the entire country but it was implemented with moderation. The nationwide state of emergency was lifted in October of 1933 after the constitutional amendments initiated by the War of Independence veterans' movement were approved by referendum and the Tonisson government resigned.
   Estonia's Premier Konstantin Pats imposed a nationwide state of emergency once again after leading the coup d'etat that began on 12 March 1934. This state of emergency remained in effect until the occupation and annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union in 1940. In 1934, the extensive means of repression that proceeded from state of emergency legislation were implemented against all parties represented in parliament and members of the War of Independence veterans' movement: this means that all political organisations were shut down and political meetings were prohibited, many members of the War of Independence veterans' movement were arrested, and the press was subjected to governmental control.
   On 11 April 1938, or just before the new 6th composition of the Riigikogu convened, Pats enacted a new State of Emergency Act as a decree in which the grounds for imposing a state of emergency were broadened compared to the legislation that had been in effect since 1930. According to the 1st section of the new legislation: "The aim of the state of emergency is to expedite the implementation of national defence and the defence of the country's domestic security and public order." All references to war or any other existential danger threatening Estonia's system of government were removed from the legislation. Thus the imposition of a state of emergency was to a great extent made dependent upon the discretion of the president. In fact, the Ministry of Internal Affairs viewed the state of emergency primarily as a means for preserving domestic security and not for safeguarding national defence.
   In 1938, the country's leadership also described the state of emergency as a universal means of governance, which was not meant only for emergency situations. Yet at the end of 1938 and over the first half of 1939, abandoning the state of emergency was hinted at if the possibilities for safeguarding national security without the state of emergency could be updated. The defeat of the Political Association Bill and the State Security and Public Order Bill in the Riigivolikogu (lower chamber of the Estonian Parliament), however, sent a clear signal that governance by way of the state of emergency would continue. President Pats extended the state of emergency again for another year in September of 1939.
   The country's leadership presented two political arguments against terminating the state of emergency: one connected to domestic policy and the other to foreign policy. It was repeatedly noted as the argument regarding domestic policy that the implementation of the constitution that had taken effect on 1 January 1938 was still in progress. The people had not been "cured" yet, and the struggle in domestic politics that had preceded the coup of 1934 could conceivably resume. Regarding foreign policy, the tense international situation was referred to in 1938, and the outbreak of the Second World War was pointed to in 1939. Due to these factors, the leadership claimed that the government needed all possible means for safeguarding national security. It is questionable whether the implementation of the state of emergency as it was carried out in Estonia at the end of the 1930s actually helped to safeguard Estonia's security.
   The authoritarian regime established by the coup d'etat in 1934, which depended on the state of emergency to remain in power, was relatively mild in the European context because neither the opposition nor the masses put up any particularly active resistance. Both the so-called democratic opposition and the "red" opposition (consisting of socialists) demanded the abolition of the state of emergency and the restoration of democratic freedom. Yet at least the democratic opposition in the Riigivolikogu did not deny the need to impose a nationwide state of emergency in 1934 in order to exclude the members of the War of Independence veterans' movement from the political arena. Now their goal was limited to the restoration of the situation preceding the coup d'etat. Yet in October of 1939, after the government cabinet headed by J. Uluots took office and relinquished the portfolio of Minister of Foreign Affairs to A. Piip, one of the leaders of the democratic opposition, the democratic opposition also stopped actively demanding an end to the state of emergency, and the government did not issue a single promise concerning lifting the state of emergency.
   Immediately upon taking power, the subsequent government headed by Johannes Vares, which was appointed to office under pressure from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1940, also started using the opportunities provided by the state of emergency that was already in force - now, in turn, to fortify its own power and to repress its political opponents, including both the prominent representatives of the former regime and the democratic opposition.
   Not one piece of direct evidence has been found that would indicate that an end to the state of emergency and the restoration of democracy were being planned in Estonia prior to 1940. This is because the state of emergency was not the last life buoy for the regime headed by Konstantin Pats to save it from the existential dangers that threatened Estonian statehood, but rather a "universal means of governance" to safeguard the power of that group.

AB  - In Colombia, the theoretical and doctrinal origin for the definition and conceptualization of what is understood by solidary economy is not very clear, for this reason we consider the realization of a research project that will lead us to this. The first result is presented in this article. The objective is to present the theoretical reflection that will allow us to have an analysis guide to define the solidarity economy in Colombia.
   Through a qualitative methodology based on the method of documentary analysis and using different information collection techniques, we analyze two demographic trends that have had an impact on the definition of solidarity economy in Colombia. The first is the Latin American current and the second is the current social and solidarity economy. Finally, we review the regulatory framework to propose some theoretical elements that are the basis of the investigation. This article is the realization of the first specific objective of the project in mention.
   As results, we find that in Latin America we can mention two currents. The first refers to the ethical-moral current that has as main authors Luis Razeto and Pablo Guerra. The second is the economic current of the solidarity economy with important authors such as Jose Luis Coraggio, Max Neef and Singer. In Europe, we find a vision called social economy, its main exponents are Jose Luis Monzon and Rafael Chavez in Spain and Jean Luis Laville in France. These definitions allowed us to discuss the denomination used in Colombia and confirm that the term solidarity economy represents in Colombia an important sector that encompasses countless organizations in different parts of the national territory. These organizations are based on collective and community work seeking the solution to specific problems. Solidarity economy is another way of looking at the relationship between economy, human and his context, where he bases his actions on loyalty practices with culture, humanity, territory, in search of a balance between being, having and living. In Colombia, through Law 454 of 1998 two types of organizations are distinguished, those of solidarity economy and solidarity developed, there are organizations of a solidary nature such as cooperatives, employee funds, mutual associations but also We recognize associations, corporations, foundations, volunteer groups, community action boards, among many others that respond to the conceptual and empirical characteristics of the solidarity economy mentioned below.
   The main conclusions refer to the characteristics of the solidarity economy in Colombia. From the social point of view, the solidarity economy is the means to achieve the social development sought by the territories. From the economic point of view, it is a new rationality of movement, use, accumulation and relationship between the economic factor and being. From the political point of view, self-management seeks the independence of the State in relation to its decisions. However, it is a movement that projects changes within public policy focused on equity between the social, economic, cultural and environmental. From the territorial aspect, it seeks to protect the development of the territory, coexisting with its geographic and cultural context, exploring new rationalities of territory from its socio-economic and cultural practices. From the cultural point of view, it seeks to recognize its origin in solidarity, cooperative and mutualist practices, striving to rescue them again, invigorate them and encourage them from and for the territories with new forms of organization. From the environmental aspect, it seeks the generation of territorial development balanced with the environment and its social context. From the organizational point of view, it is based on the participative, valued activity towards the human being and his capacities, the self-management, the associativity, the solidarity and cooperation are transversal in the organizational structures. From the individual, considers that the person is the end and not a means, take it to their freedoms is one of the purposes so that once free contribute to the overall development of society. Finally, it seeks the participation of the human being as the end of social, political, economic and cultural relations and realities, as a leading actor that seeks continuous but dynamic and changing development, guaranteeing solidarity, cooperative and respectful coexistence with others and their environment.
   Unlike Latin American countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, in Colombia the solidarity economy hardly emerges as an incipient social movement, because it does not have enough identity to give it meaning given the existing heterogeneity and diversity of practices that could be categorized as solidarity economies. The social actors that are participating in the construction of the solidarity economy are varied and diverse; unions, universities, entities of the solidarity economy system, the State, the private sector, the church, international cooperation, organized civil society, popular rural and urban movements, which are called to the strength of the social movement seeking public policies that recognizes the importance of the solidary sector in Colombia.
   Some Colombian universities have developed since the mid-twentieth century, research programs made up of research groups that have different lines of work related to solidarity economy, as well as formal undergraduate and postgraduate and non-formal teaching programs such as continuing education programs. extension programs that mean work with the community and dissemination actions represented by journals, books, texts and academic events to present research results as well as national university networks (the Unicossol Network Corporation and Ciriec Colombia) related to international networks since decades ago, which have advanced significantly in the construction not only of the concept, but of a culture, movement and social force of the solidarity economy.
   These networks and research processes allow the solidarity economy to be recognized as a growing sector in the country, with important challenges in terms of the territorial reorganization that Colombia is currently experiencing, as a result of the negotiation processes with the armed groups. The solidarity organizations have emerged and continue to appear as a result of the absence of the State and the urgency of solutions to social problems that have arisen because of the war in Colombia. This particularity in Colombia makes the study of the solidarity economy urgent and necessary in a country where research has been difficult to develop, public investment in rural development processes, access to different territories, among others. Finally, the contribution of this article is based on the effort made by the Unicossol Network in recognizing the solidarity economy as the main source of development in Colombia. The union of researchers from different universities at national level, with different points of view and with experiences in the territory has facilitated the discussion and the approach to the definition of a term little studied in Colombia.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an intracranial injury caused by impacts or angular accelerations of the head such as a violent blow, a bump, a projectile, or even a blast. TBI is a major problem that accounts for over 1.4 million emergency room visits in US. Thus, it is important to understand and predict the occurrence of TBI. Previous studies have shown that the interaction between the subarachnoid space (SAS) trabeculae and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays an important role in damping the effect of impacts and reducing the brain injuries. However, the influence of sulci parameters and sulci trabeculae in impact induced TBI is still unexplored. A few studies have shown that inclusion of sulci in brain models alters the brain injuries conclusions, even though those models do not take into account the trabecular tissue present in the sulci.
   In this study, to obtain a perspective of the morphology and architecture of the sulci trabeculae at the frontal lobe of the brain, Human cadaver brain of an 87 year old male was used. For the first experiment, several sulci from the frontal lobe were sectioned and measured to find the average sulci depth, using the image processing software called 'ImageJ'. This experiment was followed by the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) study on the samples prepared from the frontal lobe. Indeed, numerous images were taken at various magnifications to find different trabecular morphology and architecture in the sulci.
   The results from the experimental studies were used in our numerical analyses. To do so, the validated global 3D FE model of the human head and neck, created at The City College of New York, were impacted by a rigid barrier on the forehead. The pressure time history, beneath the skull, was calculated during and after the impact. Moreover, a local 3D FE model has been created, having the meninges and the brain with sulci, including the trabeculae and the CSF. The depth of the sulci and the architecture of the trabeculae have been inspired by the imaging and SEM studies. Indeed, the top surface of the local model was subjected to the pressure loading condition obtained from the global model. The results of the finite element simulations reveal that the interaction between the trabeculae and the CSF inside the sulci, would affect and reduce the movement and displacement of gyri and sulci's walls when the forehead of the head is impacted by an elastic barrier.

AB  - This paper presents a study of the hunting activities on Xerente Indigenous Land (XIL) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We used data from a Hunting Monitoring Program from eight villages to evaluate the effects of village age, distance from village to town and season (wet and dry) on the composition of hunted species, animals and biomass killed and availability of preferred game-species. We also assessed for any indication of fauna depletion around the villages. Distance from village to town and season were the only variables which affected composition. Preferred species occured more often in villages closer to the town. However, these villages present strong indications of local game-species depletion. The hunters' great capacity for spatial movement can eliminate this effect. Animals and biomass killed was high in the dry season. Game-species composition between seasons can avoid the overexploitation of some sensitive species, such as low-land tapir. These results are important in the design of local management and conservation plans. Our results also contribute to further understanding the impacts of hunting in open Neotropical environments.

AB  - The Indo-Burmese Ranges (IBR) marks as the boundary between the rigid Burmese Plate and the north-easterly moving, obliquely converging Indian plate. This results in upliftment of Mizoram fold belt alongside of IBR, in the eastern most part of the Indian subcontinent. NS trending fault generated fold belt appears around the region due to the NE stress component from Indian plate movement. There are many linear tectonic features formed due to this process. On the eastern margin of the fold belt in the greater elevated part of IBR, E-W and NW-SE lineament patterns intersect the NS lineaments, and deformed the ridges obliquely to create complex geotectonic settings. In this study, a pristine attempt has been made to understand the geodynamic evolutionary mechanisms for the area to reveal the cause for such surficial convolutions. The arcuate subduction zone along the IBR causes the slab to flex and bend at depth. This relates to differential dipping of the slab and the greater dip surface occurred beneath the study area. The easterly dipping slab can accommodate great amount of sediments and therefore the region having maximum dip upholds the highest Tertiary sediment thickness, above the basement. Champhai district of Mizoram, India had been considered for this study as it has in the zone of convergence with highest slab dip underneath. The surface exposures have sufficient neotectonic evidences which inferred the signs from Early Pleistocene neotectonic to present active tectonic deformational history. Sequential offset of the antecedent rivers carries the signatures of the varying stress component within them. The geodynamic processes produce some tectonic features through the mode of earthquake generation. Epicentral plots and focal mechanism solutions for the area indicate seismic activity associated with the thrust and oblique strike-slip movement along with their correlation for the lineament distribution. The evolutionary model indicates syn-tectonic upliftment of the study area along with evolving IBR during Late Oligocene thrusting events. A Paleo-lake adjacent to the Champhai town is believed to be the source of some northerly flowing rivers that was located on the ridge. Late Pleistocene seismic events produce some contractional strike-slip faults that later transformed to oblique slip component that shaped the area. This study is also important for understanding the earthquake events and related deformation pattern in IBR. This also might be used to locate potential geohazard sites for safer construction as well as to understand the petroleum migration pathways. Copyright (C) 2018, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry.

AB  - The article reveals circumstances and manifestations of "Mariupol revival" which took place under Nazi Occupation. The author identified grounds for Ukrainian national and cultural revival in the Russian-speaking town, highlighted the role of local nationally-oriented intellectuals and members of UN combat groups, characterized leaders' involvement in revival of Ukrainian movement. The "Prosvita" society played an important role in a public cultural life. The attitude of Nazi authorities to this institution is described by different stages of occupation. Practicing the art of drama became important direction of activity for local intelligentsia within a national and cultural revival context. Theatres renewed the work in years of occupation, there were numerous theatrical troops, choirs, ensembles, orchestras, opera, music studios etc. An example of cultural and national life of Mariupol in 1941-1943 served a model for the occupied Donbas. The reasons of short existence and insignificant results of the "Mariupol revival" are discussed. The author emphasizes that military administration was not interested in Ukrainian national and cultural revival. Rather, it was interested in the "cultural" leisure for Wehrmacht office clerks and "serenity" on the occupied territories. It explains, why the German officials treated the local intelligentsia at the beginning of occupation relatively mildly.

AB  - Some natural weaknesses of the worldwide situating frameworks (GPS, for example, constrained exactness and accessibility, confine the situating execution of a vehicular area framework in urban unforgiving conditions. This rouses the progression of supportive arranging (CP) systems in perspective of rising vehicleto-anything (V2X) correspondences. In this paper, we demonstrate a structure of vehicular arranging redesign in perspective of committed short range exchanges (DSRC). An instinctive different model (IMM) is at first used to track the flowed direct of both the vehicle accelerating assortments and the trading of the covariances of DSRC physical estimations, for instance, the Doppler repeat move (DFS) and the got signal quality marker (RSSI), with which a novel CP change procedure is shown to improve the coursed estimation execution by sharing the development states and the physical estimations among adjacent vehicles through vehicular DSRC. We have too shown an examination on the arranging execution, and a close surrounded lower bound, named the changed square position botch bound (mSPEB), is deduced for bouncing the arranging estimation execution of CP systems. Proliferation occurs have been supplemented to differentiate our proposed system and the stay singular GPS execution to the extent the root-meansquare botch (RMSE), demonstrating that the got situating improvement can enhance far reaching situating execution by the rate shifting between around 35% and around 72% under various movement powers and the associated vehicle (CV) entrances. Kalman sifting was extremely well known in the examination field of route and avionics as a result of its radiant exact estimation trademark. From that point forward, electrical designers control its focal points to helpful reason in target following frameworks. Situating and following a vehicle turns out to be increasingly vital to empower inescapable and setting mindful administration. The wide research has been performed in physical constrainment and honest to goodness limitation for satellite, GSM and Wi-Fi correspondence frameworks where settled reference centers are thickly passed on, the arranging and following strategies in a thick framework have not been all around tended to. That GPS, IMU, and LIDAR information can beused to produce a high-determination infrared settlement ground delineate can be along these lines utilized for confinement This venture builds up a technique for vehicular situating. The fundamental kinematics factors refreshed in each progression are the introduction and relative position of the vehicle. A discrete stretched out Kalman channel is used to predict and revive the states of the vehicle and their insecurities.

AB  - Background: Making use of good, evidence based routines, for management of normal childbirth is essential to ensure quality of care and prevent, identify and manage complications if they occur. Two essential routine care interventions as defined by the World Health Organization are the use of the Partograph and Active Management of the Third Stage of Labour. Both interventions have been evaluated for their ability to assist health providers to detect and deal with complications. There is however little research about the quality of such interventions for routine care. Qualitative studies can help to understand how such complex interventions are implemented. This paper reports on findings from an observation study on maternity wards in Tanzania.
   Methods: The study took place in the Lake Zone in Tanzania. Between 2014 and 2016 the first author observed and participated in the care for women on maternity wards in four rural and semi-urban health facilities. The data is a result of approximately 1300 hours of observations, systematically recorded primarily in observation notes and notes of informal conversations with health providers, women and their families. Detailed description of care processes were analysed using an ethnographic analysis approach focused on the sequential relationship of the 'stages of labour'. Themes were identified through identification of recurrent patterns.
   Results: Three themes were identified: 1) Women's movement between rooms during birth, 2) health providers' assumptions and hope for a 'normal' birth, 3) fear of poor outcomes that stimulates intervention during birth. Women move between different rooms during childbirth which influences the care they receive. Few women were monitored during their first stage of labour. Routine birth monitoring appeared absent due to health providers 'assumptions and hope for good outcomes. This was rooted in a general belief that most women eventually give birth without problems and the partograph did not correspond with health providers' experience of the birth process. Contextual circumstances also limited health worker ability to act in case of complications. At the same time, fear for being held personally responsible for outcomes triggered active intervention in second stage of labour, even if there was no indication to intervene.
   Conclusions: Insufficient monitoring leads to poor preparedness of health providers both for normal birth and in case of complications. As a result both underuse and overuse of interventions contribute to poor quality of care. Risk and complication management have for many years been prioritized at the expense of routine care for all women. Complex evaluations are needed to understand the current implementation gaps and find ways for improving quality of care for all women.

AB  - Management of invasive vertebrates is a crucial component of conservation. Management strategies should increase the chance of removal of every individual, by exploiting behavioural characteristics, and by increasing the period over which removal occurs. For example, traps can operate automatically over long periods, and often include attractants to increase captures. Management strategies for the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) in Australia include hand capture and trapping adult individuals (toads are attracted to an acoustic lure, and to insects attracted to a light, also on the lure). We used capture-mark-recapture analysis to compare the efficacy of trapping and hand capturing cane toads over 10 weeks, in Townsville, Australia. We trapped 7.1%-22.4% of the estimated population per week, and hand captured 1.7%-6% of the estimated population per week. Trapping was more efficient than hand capture in our regime; overall, more toads were caught per trapping man-hour than per hand-capture hour. Traps attract toads and maximise the period over which removal occurs; thus, the probability of removal for each toad was higher than by hand capture. Because hand capture and trapping seemed to remove different toads, a combination of these methods may work well.

AB  - The objective of this work is to generate a methodological procedure for the analytical problematization of the implications of the knowledge of the relationship between childhood and racism in the field of childhood studies in Latin America, many of which reveal processes of discrimination originating Due to the migratory conditions of indigenous families, however, there is an absence of similar studies in childhood in African-American families. Based on the foregoing, the repercussions on the ground of decolonial thinking and the explicit incorporation of the definitions of race, racism, discrimination and racialization in research are analyzed here, recognizing the contributions of the current Afro-Colombian and Afro-Ecuadorian pedagogical movement; an approach to these concepts, including the perspective on intersectionality. Their own categories are constructed and recreated in order to approximate and problematize two related cases in two distant geographies. The first refers to an Afro-Mexican community in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, where it is characterized by the "tool box" and the argumentative threads constructed throughout the text, a form of discrimination defined as: "latent racism" ", Whose processes of racialization produce invisibility in some moments, while in others there is colonial silencing and denial, by not recognizing historicity and naturalizing differences, as expressed in the phrase:"... it is a town of dark ones ". The second case occurs in the Afro-Brazilian context, particularly in a quilombola community, in the Mata Mineira area, belonging to the municipality of Bias Fortes-Minas Gerais, Brazil. The study of this town allows us to understand more open forms of discrimination, exclusion and racism, where paradoxically the otherness is visible to create a process of invisibility, that is, a "recognition" without recognition of racist discrimination. To conclude, through the methodological procedure of the problematization, new questions are elaborated and new challenges are posed in the field of research of this political, historical, cultural and social intersection of the relationships between childhoods and their ethnic conditions ("marks of racism"), Gender and class.

AB  - The glasnost announced by Mikhail Gorbachev made it possible to revise the official version of history that had hitherto prevailed, to reassess the interpretation of the past, and to dispose of Soviet lies. In the first instance, this affected the Stalinist terror and mass repressions in the Soviet Union as a whole as well as in the occupied Baltic States. People started talking openly about these more in 1987-1988 in Estonia. The first mass deportation took place in June of 1941, when the "socially dangerous element", consisting of the political, military and economic elite numbering over 10,000 people (arrested and deported), was forcibly resettled in cattle cars from Estonia to Russia. Together with Lithuania and Latvia, over 40,000 people were deported at that time, mostly women, children and the elderly. Most of the arrested heads of families died in the GULAG.
   This article discusses in greater detail the research that has been conducted in Estonia of the mass deportation that was carried out in March of 1949. This research gathered steam in 1988. The Soviet regime had concealed and justified the extent and nature of this crime against humanity for decades. The number of deportees had admittedly already been disclosed earlier in some academic manuscripts and publications, but the broader readership did not have access to such studies. "Enemies of the people, illegals, kulaks, nationalists and bandits, and their helpers," all of them together with their families, were subject to deportation in 1949. USSR Council of Ministers directives set the overall numbers of deportees. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of State Security and the military carried out the operation under the overall direction of the Communist Party. The plan was to deport 22,500 people (7,500 families) from Estonia, but the authorities did not succeed in rounding up that many people.
   More detailed research, which was facilitated by the granting of access to hitherto classified Communist Party archival documents, determined that over 20,000 people (2% of the population), the youngest of which is known to have been a 3-day-old girl and the oldest of which was a 95-year-old woman, were deported on 25-29 March in 19 echelons (about 1,000 cattle cars) from the Estonian SSR to Siberia. About 90,000 people in total were deported during those days from their homes in all of the former Baltic States together to Siberia. Some historians who investigated these repressions believed that the state security organs had deliberately reduced the official numbers and that Soviet statistics could not be trusted. About 35,000 (Prof. Herbert Ligi), 40,000-60,000 (Prof. Rein Taagepera), and even more have been estimated as the number of deportees from Estonia in March of 1949. After Stalin's death in 1953, the surviving arrested persons and those who had been banished into exile started returning to Estonia. The largest waves of persons released from the GULAG and from exile began in 1956 and continued in the 1960s.
   The occupying Soviet regime had many reasons for mass repressions. One reason was the "building of socialism", or sovietisation, in the Baltic countries, which stipulated the collectivisation of agriculture "according to the model of the older Soviet republics". Farmers were opposed to such forcible collectivisation since it meant the destruction of farm households and the expropriation of the property of farmers without any compensation. By the outset of 1949, only 5.8% of farms had joined collective farms in Estonia. The Soviet regime had to use more resolute means of coercion and direct violence in order to establish the collective farm system. On 17 January 1949, First Secretary of the Estonian Communist (Bolshevist) Party Nikolai Karotamm wrote to Moscow that the "liquidation of the kulaks as a class" was necessary in order to implement collectivisation. This liquidation was to be carried out by the expulsion of the kulaks from the borders of the Estonian SSR. Another reason that comes into consideration is that the re-occupation of Estonia by the Red Army in the autumn of 1944 resulted in the emergence of an armed resistance movement (forest brothers) against the Soviet regime. It is not known how many active fighters there were in the woods. The motives of the people who hid in the woods differed and their number also varied. Researchers have estimated widely varying numbers ranging from 10,000 (Herbert Ligi) to 30,000 (Evald Laasi, Mart Laar).
   Deportations directly affected a very large quantity of families of victims. For this reason, the number of articles, and radio and television broadcasts on this topic was very large. The Estonian Telegraph Agency's official material entitled Klassivoitlus Eestis 1940-1950-ndail aastail [Class Struggle in Estonia in the 1940s and 1950s] that appeared in newspapers on 20 March 1988 seemed to mock the victims. It justified the deportations as having been necessary due to the acute class struggle that had developed in Estonian villages, the actions of counterrevolutionary forces, banditry, and the terror inflicted by kulaks (more prosperous farmers), all of which hindered the collectivisation of agriculture and the liquidation of kulaks as a class. This article that used Stalinist phraseology to express the position of the Estonian Communist Party Central Committee unleashed a widespread wave of protests. The reaction of intellectuals from the University of Tartu was especially acute. The editorial offices of newspapers received many letters from angry citizens. Articles appeared as a backlash in which the repressions carried out by the Soviet regime were termed crimes against humanity that have no justification. The unconditional nullification of the convictions of all victims was demanded, along with compensation of damages caused to them. The idea emerged at that time to compile the White Book of the losses of the Estonian people through the occupations of the country by the Soviets and Nazi Germany. The volumes of this book on these two occupations were published in 1991 and 2005.
   The Estonian Group for the Public Disclosure of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact organised a demonstration in Estonia in Tallinn's city centre on 25 March 1988 to commemorate the day of remembrance for the victims of the deportation of March, 1949. The ruling Communist Party was sharply criticised at a meeting in question and answer format held by the ruling authorities at the Communist Party Political Education Building, which was attended by a large number of people. The participants demanded that the local leaders Karl Vaino and Bruno Saul be removed from their positions and that they be brought before the people and prosecuted. Compensation of damages inflicted on repressed persons was also demanded, and the question was raised of Estonia seceding from the Soviet Union. The 39th anniversary of the March deportation in 1988 was the last attempt by the conservative leaders of the ESSR to obstruct the reassessment of history in Estonia using various means, including the arrest of dissidents.
   The end of 1988 was altogether different from its beginning. The organ of the occupying regime, the ESSR Supreme Soviet, declared extrajudicial mass repressions "crimes against humanity" in December of 1988. That same Supreme Soviet had adopted the unprecedented declaration of the sovereignty of the Estonian SSR on 16 November of that same year. It passed a language act at the start of the following year that established Estonian as the country's official language. The anniversaries of Independence Day of the Republic of Estonia on 24 February 1988 and 1989 differed like night and day when viewed from the official vantage point of the authorities. It was difficult to imagine one year earlier that the 71st anniversary of Estonia's independence would be legalised and commemorated at the republic-wide Communist Party level with a festive assembly and the hoisting of the blue, black and white national flag at the top of Pikk Hermann Tower in Toompea, the seat of power in the republic. The situation had changed so much in the course of only one year. The freedom movement known as the Singing Revolution had brought tangible results. Estonia proceeded on course to restore the national independence that was lost in 1940, which came to fruition on 20 August 1991.

AB  - But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a person. Arthur Miller Work in the fields of bioethics and public health ethics over several decades has been theoretically diverse, but particular styles of theorizing, let alone individual theories, do have distinctive philosophical assumptions and discursive characteristics. For example, in the domain of clinical bioethics a strong emphasis has been given to respect for autonomous will-formation by individuals in medical decisions and behavioral choices directly affecting them. In the domain of public health ethics and policy bioethics, where debates over issues such as health access and financing and over mandatory vaccination policies are ongoing, there is a clash between an individualistic understanding of rights, liberty, and privacy, on the one hand, and a communitarian understanding of the common good and the health and well-being of society as a whole, on the other. Cutting across this spectrum of individualism and holism, there is another discernable array of approaches to theorizing and concept formation in bioethics. Two in particular are pertinent to this article. One may be called an 'applied' mode of bioethics, which is focused on applying moral principles and rules to specific situations of action and choice. A contrasting 'relational' mode of bioethics seeks to present normative interpretations of historically embedded patterns of agency, interdependency, and institutional structures of power. To be sure, many specific works of bioethics utilize both an applied and a relational approach, but I believe that this distinction is heuristically useful. It can alert us to the fact that seemingly univocal concepts, such as autonomy, justice, equality, dignity, and personhood, carry a different meaning when they are theorized as principles to be applied from when they are theorized as practices to be interpreted. In this article my aim is to advance the discussion of relational approaches within bioethics by an interpretive analysis of the concept of solidarity and the concept of care when seen as modes of moral and political practice. I single out solidarity for this discussion because the range of moral questions traditionally associated with the concept are normatively integral to many key issues with which health policy and public health must deal-such as just access to healthcare, civic and financial support for social insurance and social welfare policies, and the intergenerational justice issues that bedevil the transition to an aging society and the mitigation of global climate change. In bioethics and public health ethics today, solidarity should be taken seriously and not dismissed as an obsolete idea from a bygone political era, and a recent surge of interest in the concept attests to this. On the other hand, care is an extremely influential normative concept in bioethics and has been for several decades. But the praxis and institutional support for care, no less than those of solidarity, are vulnerable in the current ideological climate and need to be supported discursively and politically. The practices of care are also essential to the core problems with which health policy and public health must grapple.
   I believe that solidarity and care offer instructive constitutive contexts within which the moral identity of persons is grounded and articulated in recognition, affirming the moral standing of those oppressed as equal members of a moral community, and in attention, attesting to the moral presence and considerability of those vulnerable and in need. Solidarity constitutes just affirmation of the other as subject, not merely object; care constitutes just attention to the other in a cognate way as subject, not object. This recognition of, and attention paid to, persons as moral subjects, in turn, can politically motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. As Carol Gould observes concerning solidarity on this score: 'the proliferation of solidarity relations that establish commonalities across differences, along with the linkages that develop among individuals and groups within solidarity movements, help to construct more universalistic conceptions of our obligations to each other.' Though much has been written on the protean concepts of solidarity and care, much still remains to be seen and said, for their ethical meaning and political significance change as they develop and manifest themselves in action over time. My discussion explores how persons and groups are recognized within the practices of solidarity and care; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The guiding thread is right recognition of the full ethical standing of other human beings as subjects rather than as objects. Just recognition of moral standing and moral attention in solidarity and care is my explicit focus, finding the moral imagination and political will to sustain them, my background theme. Relational bioethics is a conceptually dynamic and rather eclectic field today, frequently drawing on paradigm-shifting work in moral and political philosophy and on conceptual innovations ongoing in the humanities and the social sciences, including feminist theories, critical theories of various kinds, and orientations informed by philosophical pragmatism and hermeneutics, among others. Inspired by several cognate modes of critical discourse, relational theorizing has turned away from both methodological and ethical individualism. Often, it is more concerned with diachronic (streaming over time) social practices than with synchronic (snapshot in time) individual acts. It favors what Margaret Urban Walker has called the 'expressive-collaborative' model of morality over the 'theoretical-juridical' model. It strives to place the agency of individuals within a constitutive context of meaning and interdependence. This context includes both dyadic and small group transactions among persons in direct contact and social, structural interdependencies growing out of institutionalized forms of power. Relational theorizing is a space of historical and cultural embeddedness and embodied living in the natural, material world.
   Moreover, due to this contextual perspective, relational theorizing and its discourse are reflexive in questioning their own philosophical grounding and epistemic legitimacy, and they are willing to move away from once solid convictions concerning objectivity, impartiality, and rational authority. All theory and praxis, on this view-including bioethics-inevitably reflects some positional perspective, especially when it most strenuously claims not to, and the best that can be done is to sustain a continuing engagement with different values and viewpoints over time. Closure of conflicting interpretations in the public space of question and answer is apt to be provisional and contingent. While chastening, this need not be an epistemological loss. Within such a critical reflexivity, possibilities open up for new ways of thinking about the basic object of study of ethics and for an emphasis on substantive aspects of ethical agency and value that have been relatively neglected heretofore. The object of study in bioethics (or in ethics generally) or in social science is not intuitively given or logically or methodologically determined. Settling on what should be taken as the unit of ethics analysis is the result of an on-going, contested process of interpretation, partly derived from available theoretical concepts, partly from the exercise of experience-based practical judgment. As social theorist Craig Calhoun argues, concerning this contest, we should 'see the process as basic and never ending, and [subject] it to our continuing attention, rather than [imagine] that it is settled once and for all'. When bioethics focuses on relational practices, its designated object of study becomes those patterns and structures of interrelated activity, choice, and the exercise of power in time. These patterns are understood dynamically, as well as diachronically, with emergent properties and functions taking shape contingently rather than deterministically. Dynamic patterns in social life and human action may at times be spontaneous or random. However, when these patterns endure they comprise 'practices', which may be defined as rule-based, value-laden forms of agency and activity in which diverse human capabilities or potentialities are actualized in the social and material worlds. Let us consider the elements of this definition more fully. First, social practices are structured sociologically by roles and relationships involving authority, power, distribution, and exchange. Governments, corporations, and hospitals are examples of institutionalized structures where social practices of various kinds take place. Social practices are also structured normatively by various conceptions of rightness, goodness, and value. Finally, social practices are experienced within lifeworlds of social-cultural meanings, where action-guiding reasons and motivations are formed, culturally mediated self- and group-identities are shaped, and ongoing reinterpretation of roles and relationships takes place. How are social practices so conceived possible and sustainable? Here the theoretical mediation between individualistic and communitarian orientations takes place. Diachronic social practices are made possible by moral agents who possess the ability to interpretively apprehend what other human beings are thinking in and through their agency, and to read the meaning such expressive agency conveys among agents as they interact together.
   A moral philosophy that took human beings to be radically solipsistic and opaque to one another would be unable to account for, let alone justify, its own discourse. A theory of practices presupposes the possibility of social communication and cultural hermeneutics. A practice is a form of activity that is valued in a society and governed by ethical norms. By engaging in these orderly, yet living, flexible activities, individuals pursue the attainment of excellence and seek to actualize potential capabilities. In this way, cultures and societies provide pathways for the development of flourishing lives well lived. It is through practices that virtues of character are developed, rights are respected and duties fulfilled, and beneficial collective consequences are pursued and obtained. To be sure, practices are conceptually constructed or 'theorized', as are notions like autonomous reason, but they are grounded in ongoing cultural traditions and experimental or innovative new modes of social cooperation. Practices are both embodied and enacted. In the embodiment of practices, they are informed by tacit knowing or habitus-Pierre Bourdieu stresses their phenomenological and pre-reflective aspects. In the enactment of practices, evaluative deliberations take place and reflective judgments are arrived at that shape future activity and the structure of subsequent lives-Alasdair MacIntyre stresses their aspects that mirror Aristotle's notion of phronesis or practical judgment. Drawing explicitly on the work of Simone Weil and implicitly on Emmanuel Levinas, David Wiggins suggestively and rather effusively locates solidarity at 'the root of the ethical'. His essay can be read as a strong reinterpretation of the object of ethical analysis or the moral point of view. He is not interested in offering a stipulative definition of solidarity or a classification of its various types. Solidarity names a fundamental awareness, arbitrary and uncalculating, and an ability to respond to a call to ethical action in the presence of another in peril-another who is a moral subject, a being with a visage, a gaze, an ontological claim to stake, a political inheritance to claim, a place of membership rightfully to occupy. In tune with considerations of this sort, I posit right recognition and attention at the center of my analysis of solidarity and care as moral practices. My approach is a modification of what has been called 'interpretive phenomenology' and has been well developed in the literature of nursing and nursing ethics. While it is clearly well designed for the study of care, I believe it can also throw important light on solidarity. Like philosophical phenomenology more broadly, interpretive phenomenology seeks to offer a deeper understanding of intentional activity and its aim than agents themselves may explicitly possess; an understanding that may be more perspicacious than their own sense of what they are doing or bringing about. The following characterization of the general approach by Patricia Benner informs my discussion of solidarity and care: The understanding sought in interpretive phenomenology considers historical change, transformations, gains, losses, temporality, and context horizontal ellipsis The ethos embedded in [interpretive] phenomenology is respect for the social and cultural nature of being human. Human practices, skills, habits, meanings, and, in particular, recognition practices allow for the other to be encountered and made visible.
   When unarticulated, taken-for-granted practices and meanings fade from our social ecology and the social fabric of our lives, and we lose what they enable us to see, create, and represent. As I seek to develop it, this interpretive approach involves seeing human beings and doings in and through relationships of recognition, mutuality, respect and concern, need and vulnerability. In this relational dynamic, the watchword is the variety, not uniformity, of transactional agency and interdependent positions and projects. The context for the importance of right recognition and attention in solidarity and care is pluralism, reflexive perspectivalism, and a restructuring of economic and social institutions that would open society to new forms of inclusive, discursive engagement. Solidarity promotes these conditions and values as a future demand and promise; care honors them as a precondition for the possibility of the healing and meaning it facilitates. Perhaps I can clear the way for my account of solidarity offered below by briefly mentioning some contrasting and complementary approaches. In recent studies of solidarity, two overlapping concerns have been salient. One is to counter interpretations of solidarity that make it unduly insular and defined by exclusive, closed bonds of shared experience or loyalty. The other is to counter interpretations of solidarity that render it unduly political in the sense of being instrumental and strategic rather than viewing it as a form of life that can give expression to a normative moral or political ideal. The first problem of overly thick solidarity in which certain beliefs and values are so deeply shared that they are beyond debate, is addressed by Jodi Dean. She presents a critique of what she calls 'conventional solidarity', and defines a counter-notion of 'reflective solidarity'-a space of mutuality in which in which genuine difference, discursive conflict, and pluralism would be at home and neither uncritical consensus nor the predominance of only one group of voices would prevail. Focusing on the second problem, Carol Gould and Craig Calhoun both seek ways of introjecting a cosmopolitan orientation into the practice of solidarity. Gould does so by aligning it with justice and human rights in the formation of global networks of political activity. And Calhoun, whose emphasis is more on discursive agency, does so by exploring how a more universal kind of solidarity can emerge from the ongoing discourse within the public sphere. In contrast to these concerns that the bonds of solidarity will be overly tight and narrowly nationalistic, ethnic or localized, Avery Kolers is concerned that bonds of solidarity will not be thick enough to override the primacy of individual judgment and conscience. Then the practice of solidarity will be too weak and will ultimately break down into something irresolute and individualistically self-serving, whether in the authentic form of Quaker witness inspired by inner light or the inauthentic moral narcissism of radical chic. 'Conscience just isn't enough to enable us to comprehend the nature of grave evils or our role in them,' he writes. 'Ultimately we must overcome conscience in favor of solidarity horizontal ellipsis Conscience is directed at ensuring one's own moral integrity rather than at fostering the political movement that could secure moral results that challenge one's standing.
   ' Solidarity on Kolers's view is about taking sides and deferring to the views of others concerning why and how their rights and interests should prevail. It is a political practice that attempts to achieve moral outcomes, rather than one that is constitutive of moral norms. It gives voice primarily to those for whom solidarity is enacted, rather than containing within its own practice the standard of parity of voice and agency toward which it aims as an achieved political condition for all. Thus Kolers defines solidarity as 'reason-driven political action on other's terms'. This appeal to deference sets him apart from the more dialogic and egalitarian interaction envisioned by Dean, Gould, and Calhoun in their various ways. He is taken by the danger that both reflective or dialogic communication and the self-correcting function of networks of solidarity will subtly reinforce forms of domination and power instead of overcoming them. By integrating the notion of right recognition of the moral standing of others, I am trying to understand thick relationships of community and more abstract and principled commitments to justice and respect for persons as orientations that can mutually inform and refine one another. My strategy is to conceptualize the practice of solidarity in developmental and transformational ways so that the practice of solidarity contains within itself a shaping of moral psychology and moral learning, from relatively thin commitments at first, to increasingly strong commitments over time, as a deeper understanding of the other fuels a kind of political and ethical maturity in oneself. Important groundwork for the perspective on solidarity that I offer here has been laid by Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx, whose work provides an institutional and structural analysis of solidarity, distinguishing among various levels of social organization within which it can be practiced. I agree that in understanding solidarity as a practice one cannot ignore the interaction between agency and the institutional structures within which agency takes place. Nor should one take solidarity as an abstract regulative idea rather than a concept whose philosophical and motivational force develops in and through active social practices. Nonetheless, my own approach tends to be more moral psychological, stressing the cognitive and motivational bases for a growth of understanding and cooperation among self and other in the practice of solidarity. Among those actively working on the concept, my thinking about solidarity is perhaps closest to that of Andrew Mason, who is primarily interested in the concept and practices of community, but who crucially brings community and solidarity into close theoretical proximity. He offers a study of what might be called 'comparative relationalities', and I am attempting to follow along these lines here with a comparative discussion of solidarity and care. For his part, Mason deploys solidarity and community together not so much by characterizing solidarity as more intense and intimate than it is often taken to be, nor by making community less so, but by circumventing a dichotomous view (the legacy, one might say, of Aristotle and Kant alike) altogether. He builds solidarity into a normative conception of community, and his formulation is worth considering at length: A community is not just a group of people who share a range of values and a way of life, identify with the group and its practices, and recognize each other as fellow members.
   In order for a group to constitute a community in the moralized sense, two further conditions need to be met. First, there must be solidarity between its members. 'Solidarity' is a multiply ambiguous notion, but in the sense I intend it consists in mutual concern: minimally this means that members must give each other's interests some non-instrumental weight in their practical reasoning. horizontal ellipsis Second, there must be no systematic exploitation or (on some versions) no systematic injustice. My own specific concern is to accentuate the normative aspects of this type of interpretation of the practices of solidarity and care: how persons and groups are recognized within these practices; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The practice of solidarity begins with the latent possibilities of a given place at a given time. It builds on senses of historical memory and tradition, and it feeds on the gratitude felt when one remembers the service and contributions that others have made to one's way of life in the past, or when one has the moral imagination to foresee the contributions that newcomers can make in the future. Solidarity begins with the recognition of reciprocal and symbiotic interdependence among members of a moral community and then intervenes in-interrupts-an ongoing community when it is unjustly exclusionary and refuses to recognize the moral standing of some within it. Solidarity inherently leads us to view our own lives and agency as bound together with the rights, well-being, health, and dignity of others here and now. I take the fundamental gesture and stance of solidarity to be standing up beside another, thereby signaling publicly one's recognition of that person's (or group's) moral standing. In addition, there are three distinct postures agents assume toward others whose moral standing is in need of defense. These may be called standing up for, standing up with, and standing up as.Standing up for. This mode of solidarity assumes the stance of advocacy. It involves assisting, defending, and pleading the cause of the other. It stands up against exclusion and oppression. In general discussions of solidarity, the other is often taken to be a stranger, but that is not necessary; it makes perfect sense to talk about being in solidarity with friends and acquaintances. Moreover, the other need not be a human individual: one can stand up for other species, an ecosystem, or a cultural way of life. What is crucial is that there is some kind of power or knowledge differential between self and other in a relationship of solidarity and some kind of injustice or danger impinging upon the life of the other. This kind of solidarity can advocate for improved treatment or benefits for an oppressed or vulnerable group, but does not necessarily challenge the underlying basis for their subordinate social status. Yet, if it does not undermine structural inequalities, standing up for solidarity can perpetuate subordination rather than achieve equality.Standing up with. Solidarity as standing up with takes another step in the recognition of moral standing. Moving from the standpoint for to the standpoint with requires deeper engagement with the experience and lifeworld of the other.
   The difference created by the specificity of lifeworlds nonetheless resides within an overarching interpretive commonality, namely, the ability to understand lifeworlds other than one's own. Without such understanding, others cannot truly be treated with respect, they can only be tolerated, benignly neglected, not interfered with. This closer understanding can tend to humanize and personalize the relationship further, and the potential benefit becomes more reciprocal. Those who stand with others may find their own initial prejudgments concerning others transformed by the encounter. Those who practice solidarity must open themselves to the opportunity-and risk-it poses. Relating to other people or groups in the specificity of their values and vocabularies of self-interpretation can simultaneously develop respect for the specific standpoints of others. It can also enable a greater capacity for intercultural and transpersonal interpretive understanding broadly within a democratic political culture and way of life.Standing up as. The third standpoint is solidarity as standing up as. Obviously this suggests a yet stronger degree of identification between the providers of solidaristic support and the recipients of such support. The solidarity of standing up as involves finding a kind of covering connection that does not negate diversity among individuals at all, but rather establishes the grounds of its respect, protection, and perpetuation. To move through the trajectory of solidarity is to move in the direction of greater imaginative creativity and range in the moral life. Standing up for depends upon a kind of abstract moral commitment to support the application of general norms to the life situation of the other as a being with a certain inherent moral status. It thereby embraces shared moral norms (equal protection of the law, universal human rights), but without necessarily embracing the lived reality and distinct perspectives of the other. Standing up with involves adopting a perspective that is more internal to the lifeworld and the contextually meaningful agency of the other. Standing up as returns to generality, in the sense of a recognition of common humanity, a global or planetary membership, but also moves one imaginatively more deeply into a comprehension of difference and the distinctive individuality of the other. As the moral recognition of the other is altered by this interpretive journey, so is the moral imagination of the self. Arguably a growth in one's capacity to project oneself imaginatively into the perspective and viewpoint of the other person, and a growth in moral awareness or the ability to see connections previously unseen are plausible outcomes of the interpretive transformation effected by the trajectory of solidarity. The practices of solidarity mainly arise in the face of morally aberrant and unjust situations that are stifling human potential and where those being oppressed or suppressed need mobilized support and recognition. What the recipients of solidarity need, and the agents of solidarity provide, is affirmation and tangible support. In contrast, what the recipients of care need, and the agents of care provide, is attention. Though closely related and mutually reinforcing in many ways, solidarity and care are not the same, as affirmation and attention are different stances with different moral significance and developmental potentials. The practices of care are premised on situations that are neither aberrant nor unjust per se but are an inherent part of human species-being.
   Like solidarity, care also deepens the moral imagination of both those who care for others and those who are cared for by others. If focusing on solidarity shifts away from individualism and independence toward mutuality and interdependence, focusing on care shifts away from the individualism of self-reliance to an individuality validated by reliance on others. The practices of care are called forth where a common background condition of potential fragility, vulnerability, insufficiency, and mortality take center stage in the lives of persons in need or trouble and in the lives of those around them. Care offers a universalism that is concrete and thick. It is quite possible to imagine (and to find close empirical approximations of) societies where solidarity is absent. Not so with care. Even the subjugated and impoverished society of the Ik so strikingly (and controversially) described by Colin Turnbull, retained ways of caring for their very young, if not for their very old. They almost, but not quite, lost their cultural concept of care. Care theorists, such as Eva Feder Kittay, point out that universalism is biologically grounded on the necessity of maternal care. Every living human being has in common the fact that once they were cared for by someone (female or male) who took on a mothering role and relationship with them. This commonality extends backward in time. All persons who cared as a mother for a child were able to do so only because mothering had been extended to them by a previous generation. Human society fundamentally depends on the production and reproduction of this structure of care-giving roles and relationships. Equality, Kittay argues, is not based on properties that an individual possesses by virtue of who that individual is, but instead on properties that one possesses by virtue of properties that another person has or once had. In keeping with this, care theorist Joan Tronto also views care as a concrete universal, or a 'species activity' and has proposed that caring: includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our 'world' so that we can live in it as well as possible. That world includes our bodies, our selves, and our environment, all of which we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web. This provides yet another reason to distinguish between solidarity and care. Solidarity is based on who the other is as an individual human being and on 'properties' they possess, if by properties we mean something like their moral standing and considerability, their entitlement to dignity and to respect for their human rights. When it comes to care, however, we are dealing not so much with recognition due to persons as with the ongoing, intergenerational, evolutionary web of living that all practices of care at any given moment are a part of. Solidarity is a response that unjustly denied recognition and moral standing calls for. Caring is a response that need calls forth, drawing on cognitive commitments and emotional capabilities that previous practices of caring have made possible. Care, like all the practices that relational bioethics examines and evaluates, should not be defined as good or just in all circumstances and in all its forms. The important work of ethical specification and judgment is skipped over when we equate care with virtues such as agape (selfless love of the other) and caritas (charity), or with social emotions such as other-regarding altruism or sympathy.
   Thus it is important to ask what substantive values should inform caring as a moral practice and its effects. How best to describe the stance and intentionality of caring, its transformative moral psychological effects on agents of care and recipients, and its role in governing structural and institutional power so as to mitigate the tension between social order and social diversity? With these questions in mind, I turn again to construct a developmental moral phenomenology of the practice of care. Before presenting my own account, I should note that Tronto has already offered something akin to what I have in mind. She distinguishes among caring about, taking care of, care giving, and care receiving. Caring about denotes the initial recognition of another's need for care. Taking care of involves assuming responsibility for the determined need of the other and undertaking steps to meet that need. Care giving involves assuming a more direct, physical, and intimate role in the practices of care. Need can be recognized and attended to in many distanced and indirect ways, but giving care is hands-on, physical work. It signifies a new level of commitment and engagement than the other forms the activity of care can take. Finally, care receiving as a distinct component of the practice of care recognizes that the recipient will often be a responsive agent in the care relationship. These distinctions are helpful, particularly in the context of Tronto's concern with the ethically and democratically appropriate institutionalization of the practices of care in a society as a whole. I seek, on the other hand, to explore a structured growth of moral awareness that may be illuminating to ascribe to the praxis of care, as I have tried to do with solidarity. The fundamental stance of the practice of care is to pay attention to. Just as right recognition of personhood and moral standing is fundamental to the solidaristic posture of standing up beside, so too the directed gaze of attention is fundamental to the posture of care. When someone, a student or a distracted friend during a conversation, is called upon to pay attention, their focus shifts and even their bodily orientation may change: they open their eyes, they listen actively, they lean in. Right recognition here comes from becoming visible to another as a sign of acknowledgment and respect. In some cultures and settings, paying attention to someone takes the form of making eye contact as a sign of such respect; in others, deliberately not making eye contact has the same significance. Both are gestures and postures of care. In this sense, the propensity to attend, to care, is not primarily biological or reflexive; it is a mode of culturally meaningful agency, it is a wink rather than a blink. Standing up beside the oppressed-and up against the oppressor-is a gesture that extracts 'payment' in the form of public witness, which can incur negative sanctions or give one an aura of virtue by association. Paying attention to is also not cost-free in terms of its effects on plans in one's life or on other persons, whom the practice of care displaces from one's attention. Solidarity sets priorities, care balances and reshuffles them. Finally, on this account of the moral phenomenology of care, the presence of physical or psychological limitation or impairment is not primarily what calls forth the duty to care, although it is often the trigger for an intensified focus of attention and the commencement of new caring relationships and services.
   The moral raison d'etre of paying attention to is the evil of invisibility, disregard, and abandonment. Willie Loman's wife, Linda, understood this in Death of a Salesman, when she called upon her son to care for his father. 'Attention must be paid.' She was not asking him to help Willie with his medications. The need for care is indeed universal, both biologically and culturally, because it responds to vulnerability, suffering, and mortality. However, being erased and deserted, reduced to bare self-reliance, having to fend for oneself alone-these conditions are neither universal nor inevitable. They are potentials in the human condition that the practice of care was morally and culturally invented to prevent, just as the practice of solidarity was invented to prevent the evil of misprision. And failure to prevent these evils not only diminishes the humanity of those who did not receive attention and recognition, but also diminishes those who failed to give them. There are three distinct postures that agents of care assume toward others in need. No doubt there are many more, but I want to single these out here. I shall call them attentive rehabilitation, attentive companionship, and attentive commitment. These moments in the practices of care are relational interactions between individuals or groups, with each side having voice (to the extent possible) and engaging in a give and take of initiative and response. However, as with my analysis of solidarity, this is presented primarily from the perspective of the agent of care rather than the other receiving care.Attentive rehabilitation of the other. To care is to take steps to rehabilitate or return the other in need to a situation of enhanced living or, as Tronto aptly puts it, repairing the other's world. If return to the status quo ante is impossible, rehabilitative attention becomes a project of helping to construct a new mode of life that will be meaningful and sustainable for the other, who will then go on to live with-and in spite of-social or physical limitations. This is the aspect of care that is perhaps closest to care giving and care provision in a professional sense. It is certainly based on respectful recognition of the moral standing of the patient, but its main hallmark is efficacy in the restoration of function. It is also the aspect of care that is closest in intention to solidarity, for the attention paid here is largely affirming, and the line I have tried to draw between affirmation and attention is blurred. But to probe more deeply into the dimensions of care that have to do with suffering and loss of self and meaning, we need to move beyond restoration and repair.Attentive companionship with and for the other. Companionship is an aspect of care that includes, but is not limited to, physically spending time together and direct communication, as humanly important as they are. Companionship, in the sense I am trying to get at, lays the groundwork for a developing sense of promise, presence, and assurance in the minds and hearts of both the agent of care and the other. Companionship recognizes the evil of abandonment and is one of the most powerful answering responses to this evil on behalf of the human good. It is difficult to say what concept best conveys the aspect of care that can provide this reassurance and abiding sense of connection between and among individuals and groups. Promise connotes perhaps too formal and legalistic a sense. Loyalty connotes something perhaps overly psychological.
   Friendship is tempting but again may suggest an affection or emotional bond that is stronger than I want to convey for this aspect of care.In any case, the reassurance of a promise of non-abandonment is what is built into this mode of attentiveness. Note that this reassurance applies, albeit differently, to both the agent and the recipient of care. My notion is that the suffering experienced by those with unmet needs for care takes place against an ever-present prospect of being left alone. Those young and well often ask to be left alone, not realizing truly what they are inviting, when what they actually want is more privacy and a less intrusive care presence. Caring as attentive companionship makes the grim prospect of abandonment recede in the other's imagination and hence palliates the suffering-often in the form of dread, anxiety, and loss of self-confidence and self-esteem-they experience.To move into a mode of attentive companionship in the care process is clearly a step beyond rehabilitation. What prompts such a step, or better, what is germinated by it? My answer is a new sense of gratitude in the moral imagination of the agent of care. It may be the gratitude felt for the newly arrived life of an infant, and the realization of how vital the assurance of non-abandonment will be to the developmental flourishing of the child. It may be intergenerational gratitude that is reciprocal, as when adult children alter their own lives and priorities to assure companionship to an ailing or lonely parent. It may be a sense of obligation or debt based on remembering the constructive activities of the other, which indirectly has been of significant social and individual benefit to the attentive companion. This is the case, for example, in care-providing institutions that serve military veterans, and this moral sensibility could indeed be extended to all, military and non-military alike, who have sacrificed for the sake of public service. Or it may be itself a form of solidarity at the heart of the practice of care, because it is based on recognition of the human value of rescuing a person from fear and despair to give them a better chance of flourishing in the future.Attentive commitment to the other. This represents a stronger and deeper sense of caring connection, in which the caring agent has internalized a stronger sense of duty and embraced a longer-term, and maybe more arduous, promise to the care recipient. However, the notion of care as attentive commitment to, precisely because it takes in a longer time horizon, can bring out the structural and public policy dimensions of the practice of care, as well. The fact is that individuals and private groups (like families) cannot actually sustain this modality of care without significant social, economic, and institutional support. Part of their commitment would be to work toward building systems of public provision for care services in their role as democratic citizens. Indeed, the politics of social insurance and long-term care policy in the United States would be altered if millions of unpaid family care givers could find the information, time, and energy to mobilize in favor of new financing and service delivery systems.
   To the extent that we want to develop an ecology of care-the creation of a cultural ethos and an institutional framework that promotes and supports practices of care not only in the household and family but also in the public sphere and the civil society-then we must link practices of care to forms of democratic political reform to make society more just, equitable, and conducive to health and well-being. Within the broader political economy and social welfare policy of a nation, paying attention in private life and in public policy-civic care-can reinforce one another. The practice of care can sometimes be imperious and domineering. And all too often caring becomes merely custodial. Yet, when it realizes its full moral promise, care offers nurture, protection, provision, and support for the other. It does not so much domineer as give the person receiving it a new insight about his or her own life. Since the need for care often follows injury, illness, and loss of various kinds, care offers hope through a new way of seeing the positive possibilities present in a given situation. It sustains purpose in the face of diminution. Care among humans is a transaction among individuals who are the authors of their own acts and lives, despite their need, impairment, or limitations. But they are symbiotic, not solipsistic, authors. Like solidarity, care is grounded in the gratitude felt when one recognizes the service and contributions that others have made to one's way of life. And like the practice of solidarity, the practice of care interrupts an ongoing form of life in order to be present with another in the face of their need, vulnerability, and suffering, finally winning through to a life well lived. Solidarity and care can arise developmentally out of an engagement with the vocation of repairing a needful, vulnerable, responsive world. The author declares no conflict of interest. Miller, A.

The terminology related to care is more complex and varied, in English, than that related to solidarity. I have chosen to use the term 'care' rather than resort to terms such as caring, care giving, care providing, and the like. When conjoined with the concept of a practice, care should be understood always to connote a dynamic pattern of agency, intention, and action over time. For my purposes in this article, this pattern and its consequences are more important than specific acts performed within practices of care, such as direct physical assistance with activities of everyday living, psychological assistance, ensuring comfort and safety, and the like. Care is touching, but as John Dewey pointed out, it is also minding. See Boydston, J. A. (Ed.). (2008). Art as experience. In The Later Works of John Dewey, 1925-1953 (Vol. 10, p. 68).

   SOLIDARITY AND CARE SOLIDARITY THE MORAL TRAJECTORY OF SOLIDARITY CARE THE MORAL TRAJECTORY OF CARE CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Many working in bioethics today are engaging in forms of normative interpretation concerning the meaningful contexts of relational agency and institutional structures of power. Using the framework of relational bioethics, this article focuses on two significant social practices that are significant for health policy and public health: the practices of solidarity and the practices of care. The main argument is that the affirming recognition of, and caring attention paid to, persons as moral subjects can politically motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. Solidarity is discussed as a morally developmental stance that moves from standing up for another, standing up with another, and standing up as another. Care is discussed as a morally developmental stance that moves from the attentive rehabilitation of another, attentive companionship with and for another, and attentive commitment to another.
