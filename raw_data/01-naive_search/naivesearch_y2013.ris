AB  - Landscape connectivity, defined as the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches, has been considered to be a key issue for biodiversity conservation. However, the use of landscape connectivity measurements has been strongly criticised due to uncertainties in the methods used and the lack of validation. Moreover, measurements are typically restricted to the population level, whereas management is generally carried out at the community level. Here, we used satellite imagery and network metrics to predict the landscape connectivity at community level for semi-natural herbaceous patches in an urban area near Paris (France). We tested different measurement methods, both taking into account and ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of matrix resistance estimated by the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), and quantifying the link strength between patches with the shortest path and flow metrics. We assessed the fit of these connectivity predictions with empirical data on plant communities embedded in an urban matrix. Our results indicate that the best fit with the empirical data is obtained when the connectivity is estimated with the flow metric and takes into account the matrix heterogeneity. Overall, our study helps to estimate the landscape connectivity of urban areas and makes recommendations for ways in which we might optimise landscape planning with respect to conservation of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Cities are expanding rapidly worldwide. Modern cities are expected to carry heavy extinction debts owing to their recent and drastic fragmentation histories. Therefore, detecting extinction debt and identifying species threatened by it in recently created cities are necessary to prevent future biodiversity losses. Here, we studied the relationship between the life-history traits of butterfly species and the extent of their extinction debts using two different methodological approaches in Tokyo, central Japan. First, we compared the effects of current and past landscape parameters on current species richness using generalized linear models. Second, we predicted species richness in unstable (i.e. high loss) habitats using a model developed for stable (i.e. low loss) habitats. The difference between predicted and observed species richness was used to estimate the extinction debt (the number of species expected to go extinct). We classified butterfly species as seasonal specialists or generalists and as habitat specialists or generalists based on their life-history traits. With both methods, we found significant extinction debts only for specialist species. Mapping the potential extinction debts within our study area indicated that currently large patches had relatively low extinction debts, whereas small patches often had high extinction debts. These results suggested that improving patch area, connectivity and especially quality, would have more significant impacts in small patches than in large ones. Extinction debt is an important concept for setting conservation priorities in highly fragmented landscapes, especially in urban areas.

AB  - The desire to improve urban sustainability is motivating many city planners to adopt growth strategies that increase residential density, leading to substantial changes to urban landscapes. What effect this change will have on biodiversity remains unclear, but it is expected that the role of public greenspace in providing wildlife habitat will become critical. We explored the role of urban "pocket parks" as habitat for birds, and how this role changed with increasing residential density in the surrounding neighbourhood. We found that parks in neighbourhoods with high levels of public greenspace (corresponding to less residential land) supported more bird species and individuals overall, and more woodland-dependent species, insectivores and hollow-nesters. Total greenspace area was more important (included in the best ranked models for all bird responses) than the configuration (number, average size and connectivity) of greenspace patches. The majority of species were common suburban birds, indicating that species we assume are tolerant to urban areas will be negatively affected by increasing residential density. Parks form part of an interconnected network of urban open space. For parks to continue to support a diverse native bird community, the network must be viewed, managed, and maintained in its entirety. We suggest three key management actions to improve the bird diversity values of urban greenspaces in compact cities: (1) Increase urban greenspace cover in residential neighbourhoods. (2) Increase vegetation structure in greenspace. (3) Encourage homeowners to plant trees and shrubs.

AB  - Within urbanized areas, the importance of greenspaces for wildlife has been widely investigated for some animal groups, but reptiles have generally been neglected. To assess the importance of the amount, spatial distribution, and configuration of greenspaces (comprised of terrestrial and aquatic areas), we examined semi-aquatic turtle species richness in urbanized areas. In this study, we sampled turtles from 2010 to 2011 at 20 ponds, including farm (rural) ponds, ponds in urbanized environments, and golf course ponds. We used a hierarchical Bayesian species-richness model to estimate species richness and species-specific occupancy responses to three pond types (rural, golf, or urban) and four landscape measurements of greenspace (i.e., Euclidean nearest neighbor, interspersion juxtaposition, percent of landscape, and connectance), generated in FRAGSTATS. We found that probability of occupancy of four species, Kinosternon subrubrum, Trachemys scripta, Chelydra serpentina, and Pseudemys concinna increased substantially with an increase in connectance of greenspace within 500 m of each pond. When the model examining the configuration of greenspaces was analyzed, estimated species richness was greater at golf ponds as compared to either rural or urban ponds, and richness increased with increasing connectivity of greenspaces. Our results indicate that in golf course ponds can potentially support a greater diversity of semi-aquatic turtle species than rural or urban ponds and thus may be considered superior habitat in suburban environments. In addition, we suggest that maintaining connectivity of greenspaces in suburban areas is important for semi-aquatic turtles and should be considered in urban planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding how habitat fragmentation affects population processes (e.g. dispersal) at different spatial scales is of critical importance to conservation. We assessed the effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal and regional and fine-scale population structure in a currently widespread and common cooperatively breeding bird species found across south-eastern Australia, the superb fairy-wren Malurus cyaneus. Despite its relative abundance and classification as an urban tolerant species, the superb fairy-wren has declined disproportionately from low tree-cover agricultural landscapes across the Box-Ironbark region of north-central Victoria, Australia. Loss of genetic connectivity and disruption to its complex social system may be associated with the decline of this species from apparently suitable habitat in landscapes with low levels of tree cover. To assess whether reduced structural connectivity has had negative consequences for genetic connectivity in the superb fairy-wren, we used a landscape-scale approach to compare patterns of genetic diversity and gene flow at large (landscape/regional) and fine (site-level) spatial scales. In addition, using genetic distances, for each sex, we tested landscape models of decreased dispersal through treeless areas (isolation-by-resistance) while controlling for the effect of isolation-by-distance. Landscape models indicated that larger-scale gene flow across the Box-Ironbark region was constrained by distance rather than by lack of structural connectivity. Nonetheless, a pattern of isolation-by-resistance for males (the less-dispersive sex) and lower genetic diversity and higher genetic similarity within sites in low-cover fragmented landscapes indicated disruption to fine-scale gene flow mechanisms and/or mating systems. Although loss of structural connectivity did not appear to impede gene flow at larger spatial scales, fragmentation appeared to affect fine-scale population processes (e.g. local gene flow mechanisms and/or mating systems) adversely and may contribute to the decline of superb fairy-wrens in fragmented landscapes in the Box-Ironbark region.

AB  - Biodiversity patterns in cladoceran communities were investigated in urban waterbodies in relation with residential land use, pond management, and waterbody environments. We evaluated species richness in the pelagic and littoral zones of eighteen waterbodies of a large Canadian city. Gamma diversity (26 species) observed at a small scale in the urban survey was important comparatively to large-scale surveys of lakes. Beta diversity ranged from 1 to 8 species among waterbodies. We tested if littoral species greatly contributed to regional diversity in urban waterbodies. Littoral species (Chydoridae, Ilyocryptidae, Macrothricidae, Polyphemidae) accounted for 58% of the total species pool. We distinguished five cladoceran assemblages associated to different waterbodies (temporary ponds, permanent lakes, and wetlands). Cladoceran communities were more diverse and variable in permanent lakes than in temporary ponds. Changes in cladoceran species assemblages among waterbodies were driven by variations in waterbody size and phosphorus enrichment, macrophyte and algal biomass, urban density, pond management practices, and the presence of potential predators as fish and macroinvertebrates. Our study indicates that both artificial ponds and lakes and natural wetlands are valuable habitats for the conservation of cladoceran biodiversity and rare endemic species in urban regions. Further research on pond management strategies promoting urban aquatic biodiversity should be undertaken.

AB  - Urbanisation is an important driver of biodiversity loss, also contributing to habitat loss and fragmentation of grasslands at the urban-rural interface. While urban green spaces are known to include many grassland habitats, it is uncertain to what extent urban land use types harbour grasslands of special conservation interest and whether patch characteristics and connectivity of these differ from grasslands on agricultural land. By relating the city-wide biotope mapping to the land use mapping of Berlin, Germany, we assessed (1) to which specific urban land use types the major grassland biotope types belong, (2) differences in patch characteristics and connectivity, and (3) the conservation value of grassland patches at a typological level by means of their legal protection status. Grasslands cover 5% of Berlin's surface, and 43% of that area is assigned to legally protected grassland types. The majority of legally protected grassland (71%) lies on urban land opposed to 29% on agricultural land. Airports and historic parks, which only cover 2% of land in Berlin, contain one-third of all protected dry grasslands. Wet grassland is more confined to agricultural land. In airports and agricultural areas, grassland patches are larger but of a more complex shape than those in historic parks. In airports, grassland patches show greater connectivity as they are situated in grassland-dominated surroundings. Grassland in historic parks appears to be more vulnerable due to smaller patch sizes and higher fragmentation. The example of Berlin demonstrates that the urban green infrastructure can clearly contribute to grassland conservation and may thus partially compensate for the decline of traditional grasslands in cultural landscapes. It will be important to involve residents and landowners in urban grassland conservation and management because most grassland of special conservation interest (57%) was found outside of conservation areas.

AB  - This paper examines the integration of landscape connectivity and ecosystem services. It is based on the assumption that if a habitat within a landscape has a more significant role in connecting with other habitats, it would have a higher ecosystem services value for biodiversity conservation. The Shenzhen River watershed, a cross-border region shared by the city of Shenzhen and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in China, was used as a case study. An area-based functional connectivity index, known as the possibility of connectivity (PC), was implemented to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of the value of ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation over the period from 1988 to 2008. To evaluate the effectiveness of the PC index, a comparison was made between the conventional assessment method for ecosystem services and the proposed method. Results suggest that our proposed method can identify significant reduction of ecosystem services that was not only due to the decrease of habitat size, but also caused by the damage of connectivity among habitat patches. Also, it can identify sites which should have a high priority in restoring the ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation. In conclusion, this study provides a way to consider landscape connectivity in the evaluation of ecosystem services which is essential for landscape planning and nature conservation.

AB  - Urban greening contributes notably to quality of life and ecosystem services in cities. Compact cities in developing and developed countries are commonly beset by greenspace deficit. Based on literature review supplemented by field studies in different cities, a sustainable urban greening strategy is proposed. Urban renewal and new developments without a greening vision could miss the opportunities to bring relief. The public and private sectors can join hands to insert plantable spaces into the urban fabric. Urban greenspaces (UGS) with good connectivity forming a green network to permeate the city constitute the hallmarks of a naturalistic design. Preservation and creation of natural areas with rich biodiversity offer a new dimension to UGS design. Greening benefits could be expressed in economic terms to complement conventional ecological-environmental emphasis. Outstanding trees could receive high-order conservation efforts, and trees in construction sites warrant enhanced protection. Tree transplanting demands an overhaul in concepts and skills. Improving roadside tree planting and maintenance offers a cost-effective way to upgrade the townscape. Ameliorating widespread soil limitations could remove a major hindrance to tree growth. Innovative ideas of development right transfer, street pedestrianization, river and canal revitalization, green roofs and green walls could mobilize hitherto underused plantable resources. Lacking appropriate institutional setup and scientific capability pose intractable bottlenecks. Innovative public policies and greening technologies are needed for sustained improvements. Amalgamating natural and social sciences in a multidisciplinary approach and reinforcing the link between science and public policies could overhaul greening.

AB  - Because of its role in many ecological processes, movement of animals in response to landscape features is an important subject in ecology and conservation biology. In this paper, we develop models of animal movement in relation to objects or fields in a landscape. We took a finite mixture modeling approach in which the component densities are conceptually related to different choices for movement in response to a landscape feature, and the mixing proportions are related to the probability of selecting each response as a function of one or more covariates. We combined particle swarm optimization and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters. We used this approach to analyze data for movement of three bobcats in relation to urban areas in southern California, USA. A behavioral interpretation of the models revealed similarities and differences in bobcat movement response to urbanization. All three bobcats avoided urbanization by moving either parallel to urban boundaries or toward less urban areas as the proportion of urban land cover in the surrounding area increased. However, one bobcat, a male with a dispersal-like large-scale movement pattern, avoided urbanization at lower densities and responded strictly by moving parallel to the urban edge. The other two bobcats, which were both residents and occupied similar geographic areas, avoided urban areas using a combination of movements parallel to the urban edge and movement toward areas of less urbanization. However, the resident female appeared to exhibit greater repulsion at lower levels of urbanization than the resident male, consistent with empirical observations of bobcats in southern California. Using the parameterized finite mixture models, we mapped behavioral states to geographic space, creating a representation of a behavioral landscape. This approach can provide guidance for conservation planning based on analysis of animal movement data using statistical models, thereby linking connectivity evaluations to empirical data.

AB  - We reviewed literature describing the potential for freshwater anthropogenic waterbodies to act as refuges from disturbance. We identified research related to the refuge potential of a wide range of waterbodies, using waterbody names as keywords along with 'artificial' and 'freshwater'. Potential freshwater anthropogenic refuges were more often standing than running waters. Agricultural ponds, rural and urban drainage ditches and transport canals were the most diverse for all aquatic taxa, whereas irrigation infrastructure was least diverse. Comparatively little is known about the refuge role of fire dams, urban artificial ponds, golf course lakes, disused industrial ponds and retaining walls. Local-scale attributes associated with high biodiversity were: presence of macrophytes (for animals), absence of fish (for amphibians, invertebrates), natural bed materials and hydroperiod (all biota). Landscape variables associated with high biodiversity were proximity to and connectivity with other waterbodies and to natural terrestrial vegetation. Moderate levels of management intervention were also associated with higher biodiversity. Many knowledge gaps about the function of anthropogenic refuges within landscapes exist and require further research. One of the most important limitations to the provision of refuges for freshwater biodiversity by anthropogenic waterbodies is the lack of recognition of their actual or potential biodiversity value. Anthropogenic waterbodies need to be recognised for their potential to support biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation for freshwater species, while being managed to prevent the spread of invasive species.

AB  - The twenty-first century global population will be increasingly urban-focusing the sustainability challenge on cities and raising new challenges to address urban resilience capacity. Landscape ecologists are poised to contribute to this challenge in a transdisciplinary mode in which science and research are integrated with planning policies and design applications. Five strategies to build resilience capacity and transdisciplinary collaboration are proposed: biodiversity; urban ecological networks and connectivity; multifunctionality; redundancy and modularization, adaptive design. Key research questions for landscape ecologists, planners and designers are posed to advance the development of knowledge in an adaptive mode.

AB  - Several studies reveal that the richness of fauna declines with urbanization- being able to live into urban areas, such as birds, mammals, and herpetofauna. This research aims to be the first one in estimating indirectly the potential urban fauna richness in Santiago. In order to achieve this, a multicriteria analysis was conducted based on five factors (human disturbance, energy present in the system, heterogeneity of land uses, complexity of land uses, and natural areas), which contribute to the fauna richness along with their respective relative weights. Thus, a potential fauna richness index (PFRI) was generated, whose mapping allowed the identification of favorable areas for the fauna richness (FAFR). In addition, the effect of a gradient of urbanization on FAFR was evaluated, the connectivity between FAFR was generated, and also the PFRI over the green areas, which belong to the urban area, was analyzed. As a result, in the urban area, the highest PFRI was displayed in the municipalities of Lampa, Lo Barnechea, Vitacura, and Penalolen, followed by San Bernardo, Puente Alto, Pudahuel, Las Condes y Quilicura. Connectivity between FAFR was located north-east of Santiago city and near the Andes. Public green areas showed a surface and a PFRI with low value, in contrast to private green areas, located north-east with the higher values. Additionally, there is no perceivable effecton the PFRI due to the gradient of urbanization. Perhaps it is because, near to the limit of the urban area, there are highly densified natural patches. Consequently, the urban areas in Santiago would not help increasing the fauna richness, being the most affected species those that inhabit in the ground. Finally, at the moment of evaluation of the fauna richness, not only a landscape study should be conducted, but also the local habitat characteristics should be incorporated, among which highlights the surface of the green areas. Also it is necessary to carry out an urban landscape planning, which leads to the connectivity between natural patches and green areas. This planning would allow the entry of fauna that circulates around urban areas, and thus would contribute to the improvement of biodiversity.

AB  - In this study, we propose a new method for planning ecological networks in Gangdong-gu, Seoul, Korea. The basic idea of this method is that, in urban areas where the price of land is high, it is most cost-effective to protect linear green areas that act as ecological corridors for potential movement paths (PMPs) of wild animals. PMPs were identified by a path-finding algorithm (PFA) that selected the optimum routes with minimum travel costs between pairs of locations where individuals of the indicator species-great tits (Parus major)-were found during field surveys. The PFA created an imaginary line segment network that connects nodes separated by 30 m across the entire study area, and estimated the total travel cost of a route from one P. major location to another by summing the travel costs associated with all of the segments comprising that route. We assumed that the travel cost of each segment is the average of the inverses of the bird densities at the two end nodes. For each node, the bird density was estimated from the linear relationship between percentage vegetation cover and bird density, as observed during field surveys. The predicted PMPs showed a pattern that was highly concentrated on patches with relatively high vegetation cover. The preference of P. major for a few specific routes allowed us to easily identify ecological corridors in the study area. An ecological network plan that protects and/or restores areas along ecological corridors would greatly improve the ecological connectivity of fragmented habitats in highly urbanized areas.

AB  - AimUnderstanding the relationships between species turnover, environmental features and the geographic distance between sites can provide important insights into the processes driving species diversity. This is particularly relevant where the effective distance between sites may be a function of the habitat or topographic features of the landscape and the means of dispersal of the organism. River networks, in particular in human-modified landscapes, are a striking example of such a situation. Here, we use data for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms across an urban river network to examine patterns of species turnover and to determine whether these patterns differ between different taxonomic groups.
   LocationSheffield area, UK.
   MethodsAquatic (macroinvertebrates, diatoms) and terrestrial (birds, plants, butterflies) organisms were surveyed at 41 sites across an urban river network. We assessed the relationship between turnover and three alternative geographic distance measures (Euclidean, network and flow distance), whilst also taking into account the environmental distance between sites, using Mantel and partial Mantel tests.
   ResultsTurnover of all taxonomic groups apart from butterflies was significantly correlated with at least one measure of geographic distance. The aquatic taxonomic groups showed the strongest correlations with the geographic distance measures, and in particular with network distance. Terrestrial taxa were more closely associated with environmental than any of the geographic distance measures, although network distance remained significant for birds and some plant groups after removing the effect of environmental distance. Water-dispersed and neophyte plant groups were significantly related to network and flow distance.
   Main conclusionsThe results suggest that aquatic communities are strongly influenced by spatial processes occurring within the river network. Terrestrial taxa have a more complex relationship with distance, with different components of these communities displaying different responses. Nevertheless, it is clear that connectivity along the river corridor is important for both aquatic and terrestrial communities.

AB  - . 1. Habitat fragmentation is thought to threaten biodiversity, but the response of pollinators to fragmentation is still poorly understood, and research seldom includes pollinator nesting requirements. 2. We investigated pollinator community composition in a highly fragmented oak-savannah ecosystem in south-western British Columbia, Canada. We sampled pollinators in 19 fragments ranging from 0.3 to 31 ha and surrounded by a variety of land-use types, including forest, low-density suburban, and urban neighbourhoods. Pan-trapping and netting surveys captured 4464 bees, flies, and wasps in 138 species and 48 genera. 3. Contrary to expectations, overall species richness did not increase with fragment size. However, ground-nester abundance (not diversity) and cavity-nester diversity (not abundance) were higher in larger fragments, as expected. Floral richness and abundance did not foster pollinator diversity for either guild. Brood parasite responses were complex: host availability (ground-nesting bees) was generally important, richness and abundance increased in fragments with high surrounding road density, and abundance also increased in fragments with other habitat fragments nearby. 4. Responses of different nesting guilds to fragmentation may be related to their use of the landscape surrounding habitat fragments. Some common cavity nesters can nest in fences and gardens, but urban land use may be less hospitable for ground nesters. Brood parasites apparently respond both to host availability and landscape characteristics associated with movement among fragments. 5. Consideration of nesting requirements of pollinators provided some insight into their response to habitat loss in our analysis and should be considered in future studies of fragmentation impacts on pollinator biodiversity.

AB  - While studies of how habitat patch dynamics structures avian communities in urban environments has received some attention, there is considerably less known of how the built environment and human population size may influence the structuring of urban bird communities. We investigated bird populations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) through replicated point count surveys of breeding birds in 50 parks and cemeteries of varying sizes. We counted 4,435 individual birds in 441 counts. Of the 61 species detected, 27 were rare (detected at < 8 points). Migratory species accounted for 46.1 % of all individuals, while 23.2 % of all individuals were of introduced species. Species richness increased significantly with green area size, as did the number of rare species. Species diversity decreased significantly with an increase in the proportion of individuals of introduced species; in particular, cavity nesters were less abundant when introduced species were present. Elements of the built urban environment including commercial development and transportation corridors were associated with significant reductions in park-wide species richness, mean number of species per point, and mean number of individual birds recorded per point. Human population size was positively related to increased numbers of individuals of introduced species, but a lower mean number of species per point. Ours is among the first to identify specific relationships between avian population characteristics and human population size, as few other studies have specifically incorporated human population size into a local, fine grain study design. Our data suggest that human population size is an important parameter that can be measured independently of characteristics of the built environment and the physical characteristics of the park itself as a correlate of avian diversity and abundance. Our study points to a variety of trade-offs needed to manage habitat for birds in urban settings.

AB  - Nowadays, the processes of deforestation and loss of habitats represent a major threat to many species of mammals. These processes cause changes in natural landscapes by decreasing area, connectivity, and fragment size, and increasing edge effects and number of fragments. Understanding which and how many species persist in disturbed fragments may indicate the species' minimum requirements and might contribute to their conservation. Here we show how the mammalian fauna of medium and large size (higher than 1 kg) are structured in a semideciduous seasonal forest fragment of 36.5 ha in the urban area of Jatai, Goias. We performed the sampling with 30 sand track plots (1 x 1 m). We analyzed the relative record frequency and built a collector's curve to demonstrate the sampling effort. With a total effort of 600 track plots x days, we recorded twelve species of mammals with our tracks sampling method, from which only the wild mammals were included in the analyzes (11 species). The estimated species richness reached 13 species (SD (Standard Deviation) = +/- 1, CI (Confidence Interval) = +/- 2 (11 - 15 species). The species with the highest relative record frequency was Didelphis albiventris and the species with the lowest was Tamandua tetradactyla. The fragment size must be a limiting factor to the richness and to the occurrence of species, as it may not be sufficient to allow the persistence of a population or an individual. Disturbances that originated from houses, like domestic animals and movement of people, also contributed to the removal and extinction of species. To conserve the species in the fragment, we suggest the prevention of entrance of people and of domestic animals. We also recommend increased connectivity of the fragment with the landscape external to the urban area in order to allow the movement of the currently present species.

AB  - Bogota, the capital of the Republic of Colombia, is a tropical highland city located 2,650 m above sea level. It is the 25th largest city in the world and, among large cities, is also one of the highest. In common with other cities in Latin America, a large part of its urban growth during recent centuries has been unplanned and informal. The introduction of green spaces into urban planning in Bogota began in the mid-20th century, but was first included in official legislation during the 1990s through the concept of Ecological Main Structure (EMS). Initially developed by Dutch scholars, EMS was brought to Colombia via biological conservation practitioners as a means of enhancing biological connectivity in rural and natural landscapes, extended in this case to urban landscapes as a top-level planning instrument. EMS originally included a variety of components, from protected areas and biological conservation tools to environmental urban elements - the emphasis being on biodiversity conservation, without sufficient recognition of specific urban structures and functions. This process led to conceptual disciplinary-based divergence and conflicting political interpretations. The current emergence of EMS as a planning tool for urban regions represents an opportunity for integration, although the risk of divergent interpretations remains, as no integrative conceptual framework has yet been developed. In this paper we review the concepts underlying EMS that have been incorporated within urban and regional planning, especially those of ecological networks and green infrastructure, and also diagnose conceptual and institutional barriers to its current integration, challenges and opportunities which are set in the context of an emerging urban region. We propose a trans-disciplinary framework for multi-level integration of EMS, along a gradient from wild environments to built structures that incorporates emerging concepts such as urban biodiversity, ecosystem services and design in the urban landscape, with the aim of contributing to the creation of an urban landscape that is resilient to environmental change and suitable for human well-being and adaptation.

AB  - The fragmentation of landscapes, induced by the growing urbanisation, is a major cause of biodiversity loss. Ecological corridors are landscape elements that make up for the negative effects of habitat fragmentation in agricultural or natural landscapes. However, their effectiveness have been rarely assess in an urban context. To do so, we analysed shrews in woodlots, corridors and domestic gardens that are connected or disconnected from a corridor. Indeed, these mammals are very sensitive to fragmentation and could play an important ecological role even in small and isolated areas such as domestic gardens. Ninety-seven shrews, from three species were trapped. In our study, Sorex coronatus, Sorex minutus and Crocidura russula were not widely distributed and mainly occurred in woodlots, corridors and connected gardens. In gardens, shrew occurrences were mainly determined by landscape configuration with negative effects of the distance to the corridor and the distance to the woodlot, stronger for C.russula than Sorex species. At the local scale, garden management and vegetation showed a positive effect mainly for Sorex species. The quality of gardens seems good enough to permit the co-occurrence of several species of shrews and thus competition was not identified as a major process for determining the occurrence. We showed that, as in other ecosystems, ecological corridors in urban context can play an effective role for the distribution of organisms with low dispersal capabilities and should be develop in planning strategies.

AB  - Cities are characterized by dynamic interactions between socio-economic and biophysical forces. Currently more than half of the global population reside in cities which influence the global biogeochemical cycles and climate change, substantially exacerbating pressures on urban pollution, water quality and food security, as well as operating costs for infrastructure development. Goods and services such as aesthetic values, water purification, nutrient recycling, and biological diversity, that urban ecosystems generate for the society, are critical to sustain. Urban planners are increasingly facing the considerable challenges of management issues for urban ecosystems. Poor understanding of the complementary roles of urban ecology in urban infrastructure, and the functioning of ecosystems and ecological resilience of a complex human-dominated landscape has impeded effective urban planning over time, resulting in social disharmony. Here a complementary framework for urban ecology is proposed, in which ecosystems interact with land use, architecture and urban design - "E-LAUD"-affecting ecosystem and human health, and building on the concept that land uses in urban green areas, road-strips, wetlands, 'habitat islands' and urban architecture could synergistically benefit when clustered together in different combinations of urban landscapes. It is proposed that incorporation of the E-LAUD framework in urban planning forms the context of a new interdisciplinary research programme on ecological resilience for urban ecosystems and helps promote ecosystem services.

AB  - Research was carried out in the city of Turin (Northern Italy) in order to assess the suitability of the urban environment for fireflies.The study started in 2007 with an artistic and scientific project promoted by Parco Arte Vivente (PAV-Park of living art). Citizens joining the project recorded 18 areas where they could observe fireflies, which were identified as Luciola italica L. (Coleoptera Lampyridae). All of the 18 areas recorded by citizens were then visited during the summer of 2009 and the abundance of L. italica was estimated using transects. In 12 sites the presence of the firefly was confirmed. The habitat structures of L. italica were woods interspersed with clearings in the urban districts in the hills, and parks along rivers in the lower and more populated part of the city. In sites where fireflies were observed, the level of illuminance measured was significantly lower than in areas where L. italica was absent. The analysis of the landscape around the study areas showed a negative correlation between the extent of urbanization and fireflies abundance. Survival of L. italica populations in the urban area of Turin is influenced by the extent of green areas and the level of artificial illumination. Parks lying among rivers preserve a level of darkness suitable for fireflies and are connected by woody strips growing along the banks of rivers, that probably function as ecological corridors.

AB  - The abundance of woodland birds in fragmented forest landscapes may depend on the properties of patch networks. Understanding the consequences of deforestation on woodland birds, therefore, necessarily requires determining which changes in landscape structure make a major contribution to the degradation and subdivision of patch networks. In this study, we addressed how accelerated deforestation in central Chile has modified the landscape structure and function for thorn-tailed rayaditos-a woodland specialist bird. Using a graphical approach based on the habitat use and movement patterns of rayaditos, we quantified the reduction of the internal connectivity of components (i.e., connected patch networks) in the last two decades and determined the main mechanisms responsible for this connectivity loss. Forest cover decreased 61.7 % between 1989 and 2009. The component size, the fraction of components with a parts per thousand yen1 occupied patches and the number of patches per component experienced a large decline during the study period. Over time, most forest cover (ca. 80 %) was contained in only two components. The connectivity of components decreased steeply by 90 %. Only the loss of large patches made a highly significant contribution to explaining changes in connectivity, while the removal of stepping stones was marginally significant. The conversion of forest both to shrubland and to peri-urban areas were the only land-use variables explaining connectivity change with effects that changed over time. Conservation measures to ensure persistence of rayaditos populations in central Chile should be focused on the retention of key elements for connectivity.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most disruptive forms of land use, and its effects on ecological communities are likely to increase as the human population continues to shift from rural to urban living. Whether the myriad changes encompassed by urbanization (e.g., habitat fragmentation, the urban heat island effect, disturbance) affect biological communities in predictable ways remains unresolved. In this study, we employed meta-analysis to quantify the overall effects of urbanization on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), an ecologically diverse and important group that has been relatively well-studied in cities. We calculated effect sizes for carabid species richness, the total abundance of beetles at a site (assemblage abundance), and the abundances of individual species at urban compared to rural forested sites. We found that the number of carabid species in cities was only 77.6% that of corresponding rural sites, whereas assemblage abundance was relatively consistent between rural and urban sites. Such assemblage-level patterns resulted from the loss of certain species from urban sites and the increase in abundance of others. We hypothesized that differences among species would be largely attributable to their ecological traits (body size, habitat affinity, dispersal ability, trophic position). Through model selection based on information theoretic measures, we found support for the importance of the simple and interactive effects of beetle size, habitat affinity, and trophic position, with the most negative effect sizes for large, forest-specialist beetles that were predatory or omnivorous. Although species traits were key to understanding variation in species abundance effect sizes, several remaining sources of variation in carabid beetle responses to urbanization remain. Specifically, although many species exhibited consistent responses across the studies in which they were sampled and might therefore be considered urban avoiders or urban exploiters, many others were either relatively insensitive to the urbanization gradients or exhibited widely disparate responses across studies. Furthermore, we were unable to attribute variation in species richness and assemblage abundance effect sizes to available measures such as city size and study duration. Instead, additional mechanistic studies across the urbanization gradient will be necessary to understand such variation among studies and for species exhibiting variable responses.

AB  - The characteristics of communities are determined by dispersal processes that are driven by landscape structure and species characteristics (traits). Understanding these processes requires a better assessment of the spatial scales that matter to species, based on their traits. This can be particularly addressed in an urban context where habitats are highly fragmented. We assessed the effects of urbanisation intensity on Orthoptera at different spatial scales and focused on two species traits: dispersal ability and habitat specialisation. We recorded Tettiigonidae sounds from running trains along 209km of five railway lines. As an urbanisation measure, the percentage of impervious surfaces around the railway edges was calculated at 11 spatial scales around the railways. We then tested the effect of urbanisation on species richness, abundance, and traits and determined at which spatial scale the relationship was strongest. Urbanisation had a negative effect on total species richness, abundance and community specialisation. This pattern was stronger at larger spatial scales, and the results differed according to the species' functional traits: mobile species were more sensitive to urbanisation at larger scales than sedentary species, and no scale effect on specialisation was detected. We conclude that insects may respond to landscapes over a broad set of spatial scales and that considering their specific traits is essential in spatial scales studies. Finally, we argue that railway edges can play a role in insect conservation in urban landscapes.

AB  - One consequence of the spatial expansion of cities is the multiplication of highly fragmented and diverse green spaces immediately surrounded by urban areas. Whereas the global expansion of urban areas is a growing concern for the viability of woodland arthropods, the suitability of green spaces as refuges to arthropods needs to be clarified. In order to assess and compare the survival rates of the woodland carabid Abax parallelepipedus in four types of green urban sites (remnant forest patch, urban park, woody corridor and set of gardens), we conducted a Capture-Mark-Recapture experiment based on 483 individuals collected in a forest located in a natural landscape (considered as the control site) and released into the various green spaces. Results indicated strong heterogeneity in survival probability between green spaces. Survival rates were slightly higher in the control site than in the remnant forest patch, the urban park and the corridor, which appear suitable for the survival of the species. However, it was substantially lower in the gardens. The analysis further revealed that these differences in survival are largely explained by the differences of within -site habitat fragmentation. By indicating that urban green spaces may contribute unequally to woodland carabids survival, our study highlights that the modification of local environmental conditions alone (increase of temperature, increase of soil pollution and change in food availability) could not explain the negative effect of urbanization.

AB  - The cumulative effect of land-use changes is one of the most important factors contributing to the continuous deterioration of river ecosystems. We used ecological exergy to evaluate the impacts of land-use changes on functional guilds of benthic macroinvertebrates. We classified 353 sampling sites into 3 groups based on land-use types: forested, agricultural, and urban rivers. For each sampling site, we calculated ecological exergy based on 5 trophic groups of macroinvertebrates. Differences in exergy, specific exergy, and structural metrics (i.e. species richness and Shannon index) suggested that land-use type was an important determinant of the composition of macroinvertebrate communities. Exergy values of the functional feeding groups and trophic groups were used as input data to train self-organizing maps unsupervised artificial neural networks. The results showed that functional guilds responded differently to different land-use types: scrapers and carnivores dominated the forested rivers, whilst predators and omnivores, and gatherer-collectors and detritivores dominated agricultural and urban rivers, respectively. These results suggest that ecological exergy can be used as a functional bioassessment indicator to evaluate river condition. A generalized additive model and random forest also highlighted that a combination of both conventional structural indicators (e.g. species richness and Shannon index) and novel functional indicators (e.g. exergy and specific exergy) can be used to assess biotic integrity.

AB  - Bees of the tribe Euglossini are known as orchid-bees. In general, areas with more vegetation cover have greater abundance and diversity of these bees. This study investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on assemblages of the euglossine bees in the region of Rio Branco municipality, State of Acre, and surrounding areas. Ten forest fragments with varying sizes were selected for the study and were classified as urban or rural. The bees were sampled between December 2005 and August 2006. A total of 3,675 bees in 36 species and 4 genera were collected. In general abundance and richness of bees did not differ statistically between urban and rural fragments. The index of edge in fragments was a predictor of richness and diversity of bees. The connectivity estimated was also an adequate predictor for richness. Fragments with greater similarity in relation to their landscape structure were also more similar in relation to faunal composition.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation in urban areas has left many species isolated and vulnerable to loss of genetic variation. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), however, thrive in urban areas. We compared genetic diversity and structure among deer in 2 urban metroparks with deer in a fenced reserve and with deer from an open, continuously distributed population to inform urban deer management. If urban deer maintain species' typical matrilineal genetic structure, removal of female groups may effectively reduce local abundance. However, if gene flow in urban areas is high, dispersal may impede efforts to reduce abundance. Although genetic diversity was high and mean relatedness was near zero in all locations, distributions of pairwise relatedness in urban metroparks and the fenced reserve contained greater proportions of closely and distantly related deer than the open locations, likely attributable to matrilineal structure. In addition, deer from the metroparks (approx. 65km apart) were moderately differentiated (Fst=0.092) indicating gene flow in urban areas may be less than in other landscapes. Our results indicate that removal of matrilineal groups may reduce local urban deer abundance without inducing immigration from surrounding areas. (c) The Wildlife Society, 2012

AB  - Urbanization is a growing threat to ecological communities and has become a leading cause of population extirpations in a wide range of taxa. Because the effects of urbanization are often multifaceted, identifying the pathways through which changes in communities occur has remained a persistent challenge. We draw upon metacommunity theory to evaluate competing explanations for the effects of urbanization, focusing on the relative importance of processes at local (e.g. abiotic and biotic characteristics) and regional (e.g. habitat connectivity and dispersal) scales. Over 4years, we sampled 201 wetlands in the Front Range region of Colorado, which is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the USA. Wetlands embedded within urban areas exhibited significantly lower taxonomic richness and diversity compared to those in agricultural or grassland areas. Relative to grassland wetlands, urban wetlands supported a 60% lower richness of amphibians and aquatic reptiles and a 33% lower richness of aquatic insects, molluscs and crayfish. These patterns were associated with changes in biotic factors (introduced fishes and bullfrogs), abiotic factors (nutrients, conductivity and vegetation) and landscape characteristics (road density and surrounding wetland area). The use of an information-theoretic approach and structural equation modelling suggested that the effects of urbanization on richness were mainly driven by changes in road density. Analyses of community composition indicated that discrete communities formed along the urban systems gradient, such that actively dispersing predators associated more negatively with urban system relative to herbivores with passive dispersal. Synthesis and applications. These results highlight the importance of considering both local and regional factors in addressing conservation-related challenges and underscore the benefits of linking conceptual work on metacommunity theory with applied efforts to mitigate the effects of urbanization.

AB  - We studied population size, genetic diversity and differentiation of common frog (Rana temporaria) populations at urban golf courses and reference natural ponds in the greater Helsinki region, southern Finland. A total of 248 tadpoles from 12 locations (six golf courses, six reference sites) were genotyped with 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The most urban populations, situated in northern Helsinki, were the largest breeding sites having > 120 (golf courses) and > 200 (reference sites) spawn clumps at the time of sampling. On average, there was no difference in the number of spawns between the anthropogenic ponds at golf courses and the natural water bodies. Genetic variation within populations was substantial (H (O) = 0.68) while genetic differentiation between populations was low (F (ST) = 0.016; average distance = 17.6 km). The golf course populations did not differ from natural populations in terms of genetic variability or differentiation. Hence, our results suggest that golf courses contribute positively to urban amphibian populations by providing suitable water bodies for reproduction and green corridors for dispersal, thus preventing isolation and loss of genetic variability within populations.

AB  - We used dung beetles to evaluate the impact of urbanization on insect biodiversity in three Atlantic Forest fragments in Londrina, Parana, Brazil. This study provides the first empirical evidence of the impact of urbanization on richness, abundance, composition and guild structure of dung beetle communities from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We evaluated the community aspects (abundance, richness, composition and food guilds) of dung beetles in fragments with different degrees of immersion in the urban matrix using pitfall traps with four alternative baits (rotten meat, rotten fish, pig dung and decaying banana). A total of 1719 individuals were collected, belonging to 29 species from 11 genera and six Scarabaeinae tribes. The most urban-immersed fragment showed a higher species dominance and the beetle community captured on dung presented the greatest evenness. The beetle communities were distinct with respect to the fragments and feeding habits. Except for the dung beetle assemblage in the most urbanized forest fragment, all others exhibited contrasting differences in species composition attracted to each bait type. Our results clearly show that the degree of urbanization affects Atlantic Forest dung beetle communities and that the preservation of forest fragments inside the cities, even small ones, can provide refuges for Scarabaeinae.

AB  - The role of human-independent dispersal vectors in the structuring of urban flora is hardly known. Our goal was to evaluate the role and scale of endozoochorous seed dispersal mediated by the rook into habitats located in 11 cities of eastern Poland. This bird is a frequent user of anthropogenic food sources: agricultural fields (outside the cities) and garbage cans and refuse dumps (inside the cities). We wanted to: (i) assess the seed pool dispersed by the rook during wintering, when the bird forms huge winter roosts in the centre of cities, and (ii) evaluate if the rook-mediated dispersal may cause homogenization of vegetation at the sites where seeds were deposited. We found 2257 seeds belonging to 60 taxa in 1008 regurgitation pellets; the proportion of archaeophytes in pellets was significantly higher than in vegetation under roosts and it was negatively correlated with city size. On the basis of the Jaccard index we can conclude that the dispersed seed pool is more homogenous than stabilized vegetation in sites where pellets were deposited, but because of the high participation of weeds and ruderal species in pellets, the bird can facilitate the transfer of these groups of species into the cities. Plant and animal dispersers interactions should be further studied and taken into consideration during the planning and management of urban green space, which is claimed to be the most important habitat type for conservation of biodiversity within modern cities. It is especially important in the case of abundant animals forming huge concentrations in the urban landscape because of their high potential impact on vegetation composition at the local scale.

AB  - Aim Urbanization as a major global trend profoundly changes biodiversity patterns, and homogenization of urban biota due to expanding exotic species and declining native species is of increasing concern. Previous studies on this topic have mostly taken place at large scales that include high habitat heterogeneity. Here, we aimed at disentangling the effects of urbanization and plant invasion on species composition through the analysis of similarity patterns of urban plant assemblages at the community scale where species interact. Location Berlin, Germany. Methods We analysed how different levels of urbanization, specific components of the urban matrix and the dominance of a native (Betula pendula) versus an exotic tree species (Robinia pseudoacacia) affect alpha and beta diversity of urban woodland understorey vegetation in sixty-eight 100-m2 plots. Results Exotic dominance reduced alpha diversity, but not beta diversity of the total species pool. Comparing beta diversity among different species groups revealed significant but divergent effects of exotic dominance, habitat connectivity and levels of urbanization in native and non-native species assemblages. In particular, urbanity proved to homogenize the native species pool, whereas the beta diversity of the non-native species pool showed a more pronounced response to exotic dominance. Main conclusions Our data provide evidence that both the urban context and the dominance of exotic species can modify homogenization processes at the community level. These novel insights into the mechanisms of biotic homogenization of urban floras may contribute to mitigating the effects of urbanization on biodiversity.

AB  - The conversion of rural land to residential use is occurring rapidly as the global trend of city expansion continues. The impact of this land use change on riparian biodiversity was investigated by examining ant communities from 12 remnant riparian corridors in northwest Sydney, Australia. Ants were sampled from rural and urban catchments using pitfall traps. Data on vegetation floristics, habitat structure and stream water quality were also collected. No significant differences in ant diversity metrics or assemblage structure were found between urban and rural sites. Similarly, very few environmental variables revealed significant differences between land use types. One exception, however, was the percentage cover of exotic plants, which was related to ant assemblage structure. Small-leaved and broad-leaved privet (Ligustrum spp.) were highly correlated with total weed cover. The results suggest that ants respond mostly to small-scale habitat characteristics, especially those related to the dominance of exotic plants. As all sites had experienced some level of human impact, it is possible that all the sites have already transgressed an ecological threshold due to the earlier catchment land use change from natural to agricultural use. This apparent sensitivity may explain the failure to observe any significant differences between the urban and rural catchments examined in this study. It is recommended that managers looking to protect the integrity of riparian invertebrate communities should focus on addressing local habitat pressures in human-modified catchments.

AB  - The decrease in biodiversity due to increasing urbanization has been well documented, but the processes of colonization and maintenance of wildlife populations in urban areas remain poorly understood. We address this issue using 462 individuals from 10 urban populations of the ant Formica japonica in Kobe City, Japan. We sampled workers regardless of colony identity, genotyped them using 6 microsatellite loci, and estimated allele frequencies and genotypes of reproductive individuals, together with other population genetic parameters, by estimating kinship structure using a likelihood method. Estimated genetic diversity and effective size of populations were not associated with environmental parameters, suggesting that populations are unaffected by urbanization. However, effective population sizes were small, and frequent population bottlenecks were detected. These results suggest that urban F. japonica populations are unstable, and the possibility of frequent extinctions and recolonizations in urban habitats. Populations were moderately differentiated without isolation by distance, suggesting a strong dispersal ability that enables colonization of urban habitats. Dispersal was male biased. Collectively, F. japonica was regarded as an urban adapter, which can colonize urban habitats by virtue of its preference for open ground and high dispersal ability but can persist in urban populations for only a short time, showing a tendency as a temporary urban inhabitant.

AB  - In urban areas, there are spaces for the buildings, movement of people and the free areas (parks, gardens and backyards). The last two, have a potential capacity for the development of tree and shrub species, with benefits in improving the quality of life of the urban environment, as gifted stress of day-to-day. This study aimed to survey the biodiversity of urban forestry Guaxupe city, south of Minas Gerais. Were identified and classified tree and shrub species on sidewalks, roundabouts, avenues (median), squares and public gardens. There were a total of 60 families, 158 genera and 227 species divided as growth habit in: 158 trees, 41 shrubs, 12 conifers and 16 palm trees, and 3 that were not identified. Regarding the origin, 55.05% of the individuals analyzed are exotic species while 44.95% are native Brazilian trees. It is concluded that biodiversity Guaxupe is quite rich compared to other cities, but the city's urban forestry apparently was not planning object (with rare exceptions in certain public roads), the government should take steps to encourage the planting of native species and encourage environmental education programs, aimed at harnessing the potential of biodiversity of flora in the city.

AB  - Green roofs are of increasing interest to ecologists, engineers and architects, as cities grow and aim to become more sustainable. They could be exploited to improve urban biodiversity and ecosystem services, yet almost nothing is known about them from a soil community ecology perspective, despite how critical soil food webs are to ecosystem functioning. This paper provides the first comprehensive study incorporating the annual cycle of green roof soil microarthropods.
   Microarthropod communities were monitored over 14 months on two extensive green roofs. Abiotic factors, including substrate moisture, were recorded, as were biotic factors such as plant and mycorrhizal colonisation. Microarthropod interactions with these variables were then examined.
   Microarthropod diversity was low overall, with a few dominant species peaking seasonally. On occasion, total abundance was comparable to other early successional soils. The majority of species present were drought tolerant collembola and xerophillic mites, suggesting that moisture levels on green roofs are a major limiting factor for soil microarthropods.
   Our results suggest that the microarthropod community present in extensive green roof soils is impoverished, limiting the success of above-ground flora and fauna and ultimately the success of the roof as an urban habitat. We conclude that green roof building guidelines should incorporate soil communities in their design and should aim to be heterogeneous at the roof and landscape level, for the purpose of supporting soil biodiversity and creating sustainable habitats.

AB  - The urban functional zone (UFZ) is the basic unit of urban planning, which is defined as an area of similar social and economic functions. Despite the importance of UFZs, the stability of their annual temperature between winter and summer has seldom been investigated. With an understanding of the thermal impacts that planning decisions can have, it is essential to know how UFZs can be designed to regulate temperatures in the urban environment. 690 UFZs were identified using ALOS images in 2009 in Beijing. Land surface temperature (LST) was extracted from daytime Landsat TM (2002) and ASTER (2009) images. The regional LST variation of 31 district-sized sub-regions was correlated to the types of UFZs in the region and structural features of the region such as area, size, diversity, complexity and connectivity. Results showed that: (1) UFZ types, in order from highest to lowest LST variation, were commercial, campus, high density residential, water, recreational, low density residential, road, preservation, and agricultural zones; (2) the regional LST variation was positively correlated with the area of campus, commercial, high density residential, water, and road zones, but negatively correlated with the area of agricultural and low density residential zones; (3) increased connectivity and complexity decreased regional LST variations. The results indicated that the stability of annual temperatures was determined not only by the UFZ type and size but also by the connectivity and complexity. These results are clearly useful and essential pieces of information that can be applied in urban planning to improve climate adaptability. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent anti-systemic social movements have illustrated the central role of cities in social movement mobilization. We not only highlight the characteristics of urban social relations that make cities fertile ground for mobilization, but also point to the disjunctures between the geographies and spatialities of social relations in the city, and the geographies and spatialities of many systemic processes. Struggles for a more just society must consider the broad geographies and spatialities of oppression, which we illustrate with a brief analysis of the Occupy movement. Finally, we introduce the next five articles in this special issue, all illustrating the importance of the geographies and spatialities of urban social struggle.

AB  - The increasing rate of biological invasions resulting from human transport or human-mediated changes to the environment has had devastating ecological and public health consequences. The kissing bug, Triatoma infestans, has dispersed through the Peruvian city of Arequipa. The biological invasion of this insect has resulted in a public health crisis, putting thousands of residents of this city at risk of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi and subsequent development of Chagas disease. Here, we show that populations of Tria.infestans in geographically distinct districts within and around this urban centre share a common recent evolutionary history although current gene flow is restricted even between proximal sites. The population structure among the Tria.infestans in different districts is not correlated with the geographical distance between districts. These data suggest that migration among the districts is mediated by factors beyond the short-range migratory capabilities of Tria.infestans and that human movement has played a significant role in the structuring of the Tria.infestans population in the region. Rapid urbanization across southern South America will continue to create suitable environments for Tria.infestans, and knowledge of its urban dispersal patterns may play a fundamental role in mitigating human disease risk.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Discussions on social movements in Asian cities are inseparable from the abundance of public rallies in the region. In this article, I look at the case of Thamrin-Sudirman, the main thoroughfare in Jakarta, Indonesia, to uncover how physical urban spaces constituting part of the city as living systems broaden the reach of social movements' agendas. The study involved continuous observation at rallies, interviews with social movement leaders and participants, and a look at simultaneous public rallies in various cities. This article analyzes the sites of public rallies as 'megaphones', based on the patterns of issues featured in the rallies, the groups participating, and the nodes and paths that they constructed. Two key dimensions of the megaphone are: (1) the symbolic and historical significance of the sites of rallies; (2) the relationship between the space and the media. Particular sites in cities become places where information is gathered, distributed and transferred through the media, facilitating a network among cities. This article concludes that cities are agents of political actions that amplify ideas and spread them across the globe. The urban centers' megaphonic function results from the synergy between the public space in the built environment and the public sphere, and is reflective of the recentering of the city.

AB  - Throughout the developing world, urban centres with sprawling slum settlements are rapidly expanding and invading previously forested ecosystems. Slum communities are characterized by untended refuse, open sewers and overgrown vegetation, which promote rodent infestation. Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are reservoirs for epidemic transmission of many zoonotic pathogens of public health importance. Understanding the population ecology of R.norvegicus is essential to formulate effective rodent control strategies, as this knowledge aids estimation of the temporal stability and spatial connectivity of populations. We screened for genetic variation, characterized the population genetic structure and evaluated the extent and patterns of gene flow in the urban landscape using 17 microsatellite loci in 146 rats from nine sites in the city of Salvador, Brazil. These sites were divided between three neighbourhoods within the city spaced an average of 2.7km apart. Surprisingly, we detected very little relatedness among animals trapped at the same site and found high levels of genetic diversity, as well as structuring across small geographical distances. Most F-ST comparisons among sites were statistically significant, including sites <400m apart. Bayesian analyses grouped the samples in three genetic clusters, each associated with distinct sampling sites from different neighbourhoods or valleys within neighbourhoods. These data indicate the existence of complex genetic structure in R.norvegicus in Salvador, linked to the heterogeneous urban landscape. Future rodent control measures need to take into account the spatial and temporal linkage of rat populations in Salvador, as revealed by genetic data, to develop informed eradication strategies.

AB  - The upper Parana River basin drains areas of intensive industry and agriculture, suffering negative impacts. The Corrego Rico flows through sugar cane fields and receives urban wastewater. The aim of this work is to describe and to compare the fish assemblage structure in Corrego Rico. Six standardized bimonthly samples were collected between August 2008 and June 2009 in seven different stretches of Corrego Rico. Fishes were collected with an experimental seine and sieves, euthanized, fixed in formalin and preserved in ethanol for counting and identification. Data were recorded for water parameters, instream habitat and riparian features within each stretch. Non-metric multidimensional scaling, species richness and diversity analysis were performed to examine spatial and seasonal variation in assemblage structure. Fish assemblage structure was correlated with instream habitat and water parameters. The fish assemblage was divided in three groups: upper, middle and lower reaches. High values of richness and diversity were observed in the upper and lower stretches due to connectivity with a small lake and Mogi Guacu River, respectively. Middle stretches showed low values of richness and diversity suggesting that a small dam in the middle stretch negatively impacts the fish assemblage. Seasonal differences in fish assemblage structure were observed only in the lower stretches.

AB  - Results of a new large-scale study question the role of creative talents in fostering economic prospects. It is shown that in Europe, with its cultural diversity and long urban history, Florida's concepts have to be used with caution. The new study suggests that in Europe, along with so-called hard' and soft' factors, there is a third crucial group of factors, related to personal networks, which impacts on economic perspectives. These networks include personal links, professional and social relations and other types of local social connections related to people's life courses. This appeared to be strong and consistent outcomes of a survey among employees and interviews with employers, managers and trans-national migrants, conducted simultaneously in 13 European cities. It was also made clear that so-called hard conditions, especially job availability, were the second most important factor. Incidentally soft conditions were relevant, but never of prime importance. Soft' factors such as diversity, openness, amenities, and tolerance were hardly mentioned as relevant deciding factors for settling in a specific city. It also became clear that contemporary conditions that make some European cities more attractive than others for these industries offer only a partial explanation. The current fashionable focus on fostering creative talents' to improve economic prospects is not an option for all European cities. An alternative view on urban policies, associated with concepts that seem to be crucial for Europe, has been suggested.

AB  - Plant species and their pollinators are linked by their mutualistic interactions, which form the basis of pollination networks. The use of a network approach allows one to take into account all interactions between a group of plants and its animal pollinators, and to reveal the structure of these connections. We analysed pollination interactions for urban habitat fragments located within the Warsaw city environment. We compared two similar, ruderal communities (phytosociological order Onopordetalia acanthii) located in distant parts of the city of Warsaw (Poland) that differed with the surrounding ecosystems. The aim of this study was to define the structures and properties of flower-visitor (visitation) and pollen transport networks (based on analysis of pollen loads carried by insects) and to assess the differences between the studied sites. Although the sites differed in insect relative abundance (Diptera dominated one study site, whereas Hymenoptera dominated the other), network size and structure were similar for both communities. In both cases, networks contained moderately specialized species (based on H (2)' index); however, networks were dominated by apparently ecologically generalized insect taxa as well as those represented by a single specimen. Networks based on pollen transport indicated greater generality of insect species (more links) than those based on our samples of visitation. The most highly linked plant species represented were either the most abundant (Fabaceae) or phenotypically generalized taxa (Daucus carota). We conclude that plant-pollinator interactions in such highly disturbed and isolated habitats are composed mostly of ecologically generalised species. Moreover, we stress the usefulness of pollen load analysis in the development and verification of visitation data.

AB  - As people taking risks to refashion their lives in new locations, and as super-creative persons who innovate in the cultural realm, immigrant cultural workers would seem ideal recruits for cities eager to pursue the creative city agenda for growth. Cultural workers immigrate because of personal connections, individual choices and serendipitous circumstances. Their ability to continue to work in the cultural sector in smaller urban regions depends on factors such as the market response to their artistic medium, the permeability of local social networks and family circumstances. Even as public policy celebrates innovation and diversity, immigrant cultural workers experience precarious creativity.

AB  - Recent scholarship recognizes the city's role as civitasa space of active democratic citizenship and full human realization based on open and free encounter and exchange with difference. The current research emerges from and fills a need within this perspective by examining how local urban contexts undergird and bolster social movement organizations (SMOs). Our theory elaborates and linear regressions assess the relationships between four urban form variables and SMOs. In addition, our theory also examines how urban walking mediates the relationships between these local contextual traits and SMOs. Drawing primarily from the ZIP Code Business Patterns and U.S. Census, we generate a data set of approximately 30,000 cases, permitting regression analyses that distinguish strong direct effects of density, connectivity, housing age diversity, and walking on the incidence of SMOs. Sobel tests indicate that for density and connectivity, walking mediates the relationships with SMOs in a way consistent with the mechanisms of the hypotheses.

AB  - This paper presents the preferences of residents towards green areas and, in particular, for agricultural environments in Vantaa City, southern Finland. The study area includes three growing suburbs and farming land immediately adjacent to the city centre. During the study period, new residential areas in the fringe area, combined with a simultaneous build-up of the road network, resulted in fragmentation and increased land use diversity. We found that the farming land at the fringe of the city had a greater recreational role than its basic function linked to either food or fodder production. Visual mapping of pleasant places proved the importance of public traditional farms and that preserved nature areas were preferred more than constructed parks for residents living in the urban fringe. This suggests that an emphasis in careful urban land use policy might be placed more upon the maintenance of natural areas that remain unchanged.

AB  - In order to build competence for sustainability analysis and assessment of urban systems, it is seen as essential to build on models representing urban form, landuse and transportation, urban metabolism, as well as ecological processes. This type of analysis of interacting sub-systems requires an advanced model integration platform, yet open for learning and for further development. Moreover, since the aim is to increase urban experience with ecosystem management in the wide sense, the platform needs to be open and easily available, with high visualisation capacity. For this purpose, the LEAM model was applied to the Stockholm Region and two potential future scenarios were developed, resulting from alternative policies. The scenarios differed widely and the dense urban development of Scenario Compact could be visualised, destroying much of the Greenstructure of Stockholm, while Scenario Urban Nature steered the development more to outer suburbs and some sprawl. For demonstration of the need for further development of biodiversity assessment models, a network model tied to a prioritised ecological profile was applied and altered by the scenarios. It could be shown that the Greenstructure did not support this profile very well. Thus, there is a need for dynamic models for negotiations, finding alternative solutions and interacting with other models. The LEAM Stockholm case study is planned to be further developed, to interact with more advanced transport and land use models, as well as analysing energy systems and urban water issues. This will enable integrated sustainability analysis and assessment of complex urban systems, for integration in the planning process in Stockholm as well as for comparative sustainability studies between different cities, with the goal to build more sustainable urban systems and to increase urban experiences in ecosystem management.

AB  - As an important component of restorations of polluted and/or degraded rivers, vegetation recovery has become a research highlight in the last two decades. Seed bank have been used as the best tool to allow natural recolonization of indigenous plants probably occurring before the degradation of the water bodies. To illustrate the relationship between water pollution and distribution of seed bank and evaluate the potential application of seed bank in vegetation restoration of polluted rivers, an urban river, Nanfeihe River was selected as the investigation target. A total of 27 species from 17 families with dominant families of Poaceae (5 species) and Polygonaceae (4 species) were identified in 38 channel bed samples. The observed species included 4 aquatic, 7 wetland and 16 terrestrial species, which occupied 15%, 26% and 59% of the total species, respectively. The species richness at the 10 sampling sites varied from 7 to 19, and the seed densities varied from 804 to 1.48 x 104 seedlings m(-2). Species richness and seed density in the river margin were significantly higher than those in the mid-channel (P < 0.05), and those in upper sediment layers were also higher than those in sub-layers. The species richness and Shannon Index of seed bank were significantly related to total nitrogen (TN) concentration in the sediment by Gauss regression (R2 = 0.94, P < 0.001 and R2 = 0.91, P < 0.001). Increasing TN concentrations in sediment eventually led to the decline of species richness and diversity. CCA ordination suggested that water depth and NH4 +-N concentration in water column played an important role in shaping the pattern of seed bank in the river. Perhaps water pollution not only caused degradation or even disappearance of standing vegetations, but also influenced the storage and distribution of seed bank. In addition, nitrogen-loading gradient along the river was probably capable of determining the pattern of seed bank at certain extend. The quantitative relations between the pattern of seed bank and water pollution give us insight to evaluate the potential application of seed bank in vegetation recovery in polluted urban rivers, and it would also contribute to urban riverine management, diversity conservation and ecological assessment.

AB  - Context. Urbanisation is one of the most damaging landscape-scale disturbance processes leading to significant and potentially irreversible changes in biodiversity. How apex predators respond to urbanisation is poorly understood, largely because of their low density and low detectability. Given the important functional roles of apex predators in ecosystems, it is critical that research investigates how they respond to urbanisation, and how urban systems can be designed to better support apex predators.
   Aims. The present research aims to examine how an avian apex predator, the powerful owl, responds to a complete urban-forest gradient in southern Victoria, Australia. Specifically, the research aims to understand the environmental attributes that drive habitat suitability for powerful owls across the urban-forest gradient.
   Methods. Using a total of 683 independent field-and atlas-derived records of powerful owls across the study site, the research takes a presence-only modelling approach. The presence points were modelled against a series of geospatial variables that were determined a priori on the basis of the known ecology of powerful owls.
   Key results. Potential powerful owl habitat declined in a dramatic fashion in response to increasing levels of urbanisation, ranging from 76% of the forest landscape to 21% of the urban landscape. Powerful owl habitat availability across the urban-forest gradient is positively influenced by tree cover, productivity (normalised difference vegetation index) and proximity to river systems and riparian vegetation.
   Conclusions. Presence-only modelling has provided a useful way for investigating the response of an apex predator to a gradient of urbanisation. Although powerful owl habitat availability is negatively reduced by urbanisation, there is significant scope to manage urban landscapes to either maintain or improve the availability of habitat across the gradient.
   Implications. High resource-requiring species, such as apex predators, have the capacity to be detrimentally affected by urbanisation processes. Presence-only modelling, however, provides a useful tool for investigating how these difficult-to-detect species are affected by urbanisation, and ultimately inform how landscapes can be managed to maximise habitat availability for apex predators.

AB  - Urbanization transforms landscape structure and profoundly affects biodiversity and ecological processes. To understand and solve these ecological problems, at least three aspects of spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization need to be quantified: the speed, urban growth modes, and resultant changes in landscape pattern. In this study, we quantified these spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization in the central Yangtze River Delta region, China from 1979 to 2008, based on a hierarchical patch dynamics framework that guided the research design and the analysis with landscape metrics. Our results show that the urbanized area in the study region increased exponentially during the 30 years at the county, prefectural, and regional levels, with increasing speed down the urban hierarchy. Three growth modes-infilling, edge-expanding, and leapfrogging-operated concurrently and their relative dominance shifted over time. As urbanization progressed, patch density and edge density generally increased, and the connectivity of urban patches in terms of the average nearest neighbor distance also increased. While landscape-level structural complexity also tended to increase, the shape of individual patches became increasingly regular. Our results suggest that whether urban landscapes are becoming more homogenous or heterogeneous may be dependent on scale in time and space as well as landscape metrics used. The speed, growth modes, and landscape pattern are related to each other in complicated fashions. This complex relationship can be better understood by conceptualizing urbanization not simply as a dichotomous diffusion-coalescence switching process, but as a spiraling process of shifting dominance among multiple growth modes: the wax and wane of infilling, edge-expansion, and leapfrog across the landscape.

AB  - With its high level of species endemism, Mexico's Central Valley region is a priority zone for biodiversity conservation. The region comprises several protected natural areas, and Mexico's federal authorities are considering the creation of a "biological corridor" extending from the Mariposa Monarca Park to the Popocatepetl Park. However, the Central Valley landscape is severely affected by human pressures, particularly from mining, agricultural expansion and urban sprawl around large conurbations. These pressures are causing forest fragmentation and breaking up connectivity between natural ecosystems. This study analyses the reality of the biological corridor linking the protected natural areas of the Central Valley. First, forest fragmentation in this area was quantified using morphological indices derived from "landscape ecology" theory. A model of percolation was then applied to estimate connectivity between these natural ecosystems and to propose objectively defined boundaries for the biological corridor. Of particular interest in this study was the integration of different landscape indicators to show the actual condition of the "biological corridor" in Mexico's Central Valley. The study was thus able to identify several "hot-spots" crucial to the long-term sustainability of the corridor, which will demand proactive and well-targeted public policies.

AB  - Calcareous grasslands are among the most species-rich plant communities in Europe with a particularly high nature conservation value. During the past centuries their distribution has markedly decreased, at least partly due to urbanization. Thus we investigated the effects of urbanization on species diversity along a spatio-temporal urbanization gradient from traditionally managed grassland to areas affected by urban developments, which was situated in the plains northwest of Munich, Germany. Both a RLQ analysis linking species and environmental traits, and a redundancy analysis of the plant community features showed that soil disturbance, soil sealing and mean temperature explained most of the environmental variation along the gradient. The species in urban habitats showed increased insect pollination, earlier flowering and prolonged seed longevity. While urbanization favored short-lived species with dysochorous dispersal, the reference grasslands harbored more wind-pollinated perennials with effective vegetative spread and relatively large, short-lived seeds. Compared to the urban sites, traditionally used grasslands had a higher species diversity, more threatened species and a lower proportion of non-natives. We conclude that even under conservation management, urban habitats are not capable of maintaining the original biodiversity. However, we also found threatened species occurring exclusively in urban sites. Hence, urbanization decreased the area and diversity of traditional calcareous grasslands, but it also established niches for endangered species which are not adapted to the living conditions in calcareous grasslands.

T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
LA  - English
AB  - The primary concerns in this study were to quantify the connectivity and green space pattern using landscape metrics (PLAND, NP, AREA_MN and CONNECT) in the central districts of the city of Izmir. The primary research materials included thirteen 1:25,000 scale standard topographical maps and IKONOS satellite image with 1 m resolution. The PLAND scores revealed that while the urban fabric occupied almost 26 % of the study area, the urban green spaces covered only 1.45 %. This was also the lowest score in proportion to the areas of other land-use/cover classes. Furthermore, the results of NP and MPS indicated that the configuration of urban green spaces was very patchy and highly fragmented. Likewise, using CONNECT, the overall connectivity score of urban green spaces was 0.12, which was the lowest score of all areas measured the metrics. The Guzelbah double dagger e district seemed to hold the most promise for connectivity, with a CONNECT score of 3.75. On the other hand, the Bornova district presented the least promising case in terms of connectivity, with a score of 0.59. In the study area, the correlations between the size of the districts/built-up areas and the CONNECT scores of the urban green spaces were found to be "non-significant" (P < 0.01). The ultimate goals were to increase the amount of systematically planned urban green spaces and set up a green infrastructure in Izmir. In the case of Izmir, a master planning approach, which uses a systematic and comprehensive method to guide urban green spaces, is necessary to develop planning and design strategies for fully functional and multi-purpose urban green space systems.

AB  - Despite a marked increase in the focus toward biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes, studies that confirm species breeding success are scarce and limited. In this paper, we asked whether local (area of forest patches) and landscape (amount of suitable habitat surrounding of focal patches) factors affect the breeding success of raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in Tokyo, Central Japan. The breeding success of raccoon dogs is easy to judge as adults travel with pups during the breeding season. We selected 21 forest patches (3.3-797.8 ha) as study sites. In each forest patch, we used infrared-triggered cameras for a total of 60 camera days per site. We inspected each photo to determine whether it was of an adult or a pup. Although we found adult raccoon dogs in all 21 forest patches, pups were found only in 13 patches. To estimate probability of occurrence and detection for raccoon in 21 forest fragments, we used single season site occupancy models in PRESENCE program. Model selection based on AIC and model averaging showed that the occupancy probability of pups was positively affected by patch area. This result suggests that large forests improve breeding success of raccoon dogs. A major reason for the low habitat value of small, isolated patches may be the low availability of food sources and the high risk of being killed on the roads in such areas. Understanding the effects of local and landscape parameters on species breeding success may help us to devise and implement effective long-term conservation and management plans.

AB  - Land-use change around protected areas can reduce their effective size and limit their ability to conserve biodiversity because land-use change alters ecological processes and the ability of organisms to move freely among protected areas. The goal of our analysis was to inform conservation planning efforts for a nationwide network of protected lands by predicting future land use change. We evaluated the relative effect of three economic policy scenarios on land use surrounding the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wildlife Refuges. We predicted changes for three land-use classes (forest/range, crop/pasture, and urban) by 2051. Our results showed an increase in forest/range lands (by 1.9% to 4.7% depending on the scenario), a decrease in crop/pasture between 15.2% and 23.1%, and a substantial increase in urban land use between 28.5% and 57.0%. The magnitude of land-use change differed strongly among different USFWS administrative regions, with the most change in the Upper Midwestern US (approximately 30%), and the Southeastern and Northeastern US (25%), and the rest of the U.S. between 15 and 20%. Among our scenarios, changes in land use were similar, with the exception of our "restricted-urban-growth'' scenario, which resulted in noticeably different rates of change. This demonstrates that it will likely be difficult to influence land-use change patterns with national policies and that understanding regional land-use dynamics is critical for effective management and planning of protected lands throughout the U.S.

AB  - Analyzing population dynamics in changing habitats is a prerequisite for population dynamics forecasting. The recent development of metapopulation modeling allows the estimation of dispersal kernels based on the colonization pattern but the accuracy of these estimates compared with direct estimates of the seed dispersal kernel has rarely been assessed. In this study, we used recent genetic methods based on parentage analysis (spatially explicit mating models) to estimate seed and pollen dispersal kernels as well as seed and pollen immigration in fragmented urban populations of the plant species Crepis sancta with contrasting patch dynamics. Using two independent networks, we documented substantial seed immigration and a highly restricted dispersal kernel. Moreover, immigration heterogeneity among networks was consistent with previously reported metapopulation dynamics, showing that colonization was mainly due to external colonization in the first network (propagule rain) and local colonization in the second network. We concluded that the differences in urban patch dynamics are mainly due to seed immigration heterogeneity, highlighting the importance of external population source in the spatio-temporal dynamics of plants in a fragmented landscape. The results show that indirect and direct methods were qualitatively consistent, providing a proper interpretation of indirect estimates. This study provides attempts to link genetic and demographic methods and show that patch occupancy models may provide simple methods for analyzing population dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes in the context of global change.

AB  - Road network robustness is the ability of a road network to operate correctly under a wide range of attacks. A structural robustness analysis can describe the survivability of a city road network that is under attack and can help improve functions such as urban planning and emergency response. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to quantitatively evaluate road network robustness based on the community structure derived from a city road network, in which communities refer to those densely connected subsets of nodes that are sparsely linked to the remaining network. First, a road network is reconstructed into a set of connected communities. Then, successive simulated attacks are conducted on the reconstructed road networks to test the performance of the networks under attack. The performance of the networks is represented by efficiency and the occurrence of fragmentation. Three attack strategies, including a random attack and two intentional attacks, are performed to evaluate the survivability of the road network under different situations. Contrary to the traditional road segment-based approach, the community-based robustness analysis on a city road network shows distinct structural diversity between communities, providing greater insight into network vulnerability under intentional attacks. Six typical city road networks on three different continents are used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The evaluation results reveal an important feature of the structure of city road networks from a community-based perspective, i.e., that the structure is robust under random failure but fragile under intentional attack. This result is highly consistent in different city road network forms. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article addresses the emergence of road networks and forest fragmentation in Central Amazonia, which has been impacted by both spontaneous and planned settlement. The first objective of the article is to broaden the discussion of fragmentation by addressing social processes that generate it through the construction of roads. Roads impact land cover change worldwide, and their role in Amazonian deforestation is known. The article also seeks to extend the literature on roads to address the social processes and individual behaviors that create the road network architecture. The second objective is to open a discussion about the biodiversity implications of different patterns of forest fragmentation. Our specific focus is the geometry of settlement associated with urban nodes, referred to here as radial fragmentation. The article pursues its objectives by implementing a conceptual framework that extends the pattern-to-process paradigm of landscape ecology by adding a (social) process-to-pattern component. This is accomplished through a mixed-method approach including (1) field-based narratives of the social processes that gave rise to radial fragmentation in the hinterland of the town of Itaituba, an important settlement in the middle Tapajos valley; (2) remote sensing of the evolution of road networks, which we then link to deforestation in a temporal analysis of emergent fragmentation patterns; and (3) computational applications to compare the biodiversity implications of radial and fishbone landscape fragmentation.

AB  - We investigated the effects of major environmental drivers associated with urbanization on species diversity and plant functional traits (PFTs) in the remnant subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests in Metropolitan Guangzhou (Guangdong, China). Twenty environmental factors including topography, light, and soil properties were used to quantify the effects of urbanization. Vegetation data and soil properties were collected from 30 400-m(2) plots at 6 study sites in urban and rural areas. The difference of plant species diversity and PFTs of remnant forests between urban and rural areas were analyzed. To discern the complex relationships, multivariate statistical analyses (e.g., canonical correspondence analysis and regression analysis) were employed. Pioneer species and stress-tolerant species can survive and vigorously establish their population dominance in the urban environment. The native herb diversity was lower in urban forests than in rural forests. Urban forests tend to prefer the species with Mesophanerophyte life form. In contrast, species in rural forests possessed Chamaephyte and Nanophanerophyte life forms and gravity/clonal growth dispersal mode. Soil pH and soil nutrients (K, Na, and TN) were positively related to herb diversity, while soil heavy metal concentrations (Cu) were negatively correlated with herb diversity. The herb plant species diversity declines and the species in the remnant forests usually have stress-tolerant functional traits in response to urbanization. The factors related to urbanization such as soil acidification, nutrient leaching, and heavy metal pollution were important in controlling the plant diversity in the forests along the urban-rural gradients. Urbanization affects the structure and functional traits of remnant subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests.

AB  - Socioecological theory, developed through the study of urban environments, has recently led to a proliferation of research focusing on comparative analyses of cities. This research emphasis has been concentrated in the more developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere (often referred to as the "Global North"), yet urbanization is now occurring mostly in the developing world, with the fastest rates of growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Countries like South Africa are experiencing a variety of land-cover changes that may challenge current assumptions about the differences between urban and rural environments and about the connectivity of these dynamic socioecological systems. Furthermore, questions concerning ecosystem services, landscape preferences, and conservation - when analyzed through rural livelihood frameworks - may provide insights into the social and ecological resilience of human settlements. Increasing research on urban development processes occurring in Africa, and on patterns of kinship and migration in the less developed countries of the "Global South", will advance a more comprehensive worldview of how future urbanization will influence the progress of sustainable societies.

AB  - The expansion of roads, and the subsequent changes to the surrounding landscape not only lead to landscape fragmentation but also have been shown to be a key driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Local declines of species abundance as well as changes in animal behaviour have drawn attention to wider ecosystem effects including altered species composition and a degradation of ecosystem functioning. However, methods for measuring and quantifying the distribution and environmental impacts of roads are not yet fully developed. We present a new technique for assessing the potential impacts of roads on biodiversity using a spatial road disturbance index (SPROADI). The index is calculated from three sub-indices: traffic intensity as a measure of traffic volume per time and space; vicinity impact, which is the assessment of edge effect of roads on adjacent habitats (the road-effect zone); and fragmentation grade, which provides an indication of the degree to which the landscape is intersected by roads. SPROADI was then tested using data from the Federal State of Brandenburg in north-eastern Germany. A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the results to assess the robustness of the index. The findings revealed expected patterns of high road disturbance in urban and peri-urban landscapes surrounding Berlin. Less obvious were the high levels of road density and impacts in forest plantations across the southern region of Brandenburg, and low levels of road disturbance in agricultural crop lands of the north-western region. Results were variable for areas under some form of protection. The only national park displayed substantially lower SPROADI values in contrast to the surrounding non-protected areas whilst other protected area categories, which were landscape conservation areas and nature parks, revealed SPROADI values that were equally high as those for non-protected areas. The results of this study demonstrate the strengths and potential applications of SPROADI as a quantitative means for identifying low-traffic areas in the context of conservation and sustainable transport planning.

AB  - In this study, we tested whether the spatial distribution of waterbirds is influenced by shoreline urbanization or other habitat characteristics. We conducted monthly censuses along shoreline sections of a continental lake (Lake Balaton, Hungary) to assess the abundance of 11 common species that use this lake as a feeding and staging area during migration and winter. We estimated the degree of urbanization of the same shoreline sections and also measured other habitat characteristics (water depth, extent of reed cover, biomass of zebra mussels, distances to waste dumps and to other wetlands). We applied linear models and model averaging to identify habitat variables with high relative importance for predicting bird distributions. Bird abundance and urbanization were strongly related only in one species. Other habitat variables exhibited stronger relationships with bird distribution: (1) diving ducks and coots preferred shoreline sections with high zebra mussel biomass, (2) gulls preferred sites close to waste dumps, and (3) the abundances of several species were higher on shoreline sections close to other wetlands. Our findings suggest that the distribution of waterbirds on Lake Balaton is largely independent of shoreline urbanization and influenced by food availability and connectivity between wetlands.

AB  - The question investigated in this paper is how to understand urban networks, taking both place-bound activities and (quality of) transport networks into account. The description should help formulate planning questions about the development of urban networks. This paper proposes three different views: node-, density- and accessibility-based.
   Urban networks can morphologically be described as major nodes or concentrations of activities and physical and/or functional connections between nodes in a geographical area. Beyond this morphological description, places within an area can also be characterised by the amount and diversity of activities to be accessed by means of a transport network. This paper will compare these different views of the urban network for the northern part of the Randstad Holland conurbation (the greater Amsterdam area) by means of different spatial representations. The comparisons between the patterns of these representations can help explore the changing urban network, giving rise to planning questions, which can help formulate a planning research agenda for urban networks.

AB  - Landscape genetics is now ten years old. It has stimulated research into the effect of landscapes on evolutionary processes. This review describes the main topics that have contributed most significantly to the progress of landscape genetics, such as conceptual and methodological developments in spatial and temporal patterns of gene flow, seascape genetics, and landscape genomics. We then suggest perspectives for the future, investigating what the field will contribute to the assessment of global change and conservation in general and to the management of tropical and urban areas in particular. To address these urgent topics, future work in landscape genetics should focus on a better integration of neutral and adaptive genetic variation and their interplay with species distribution and the environment.

AB  - The last decades have seen a major shift in the planning and development of ecosystem and landscape management in Europe. First of all, in line with international developments, the life-support services of ecosystems have come to the fore through the application of the concept of "ecosystem services". Secondly, drawing on the principles of landscape ecology linkages between ecosystems are being stressed through the concept of "ecological networks". Thirdly, there is increasing recognition of the beneficial relationship between access to green space and improved public "health and well-being". These services and relationships are being linked together in both academic literature and policy practice in what is termed the Green Infrastructure (GI) approach. It is argued that GI networks are discernible at different scales, and across urban, peri-urban and rural landscapes. Furthermore, GI is considered as supportive of ecological processes whilst simultaneously contributing to better human health and well-being. Moreover, especially in urban regions, GI is being placed at the same level as other essential urban infrastructure. Recognising these developments the authors have devised an updated conceptual framework for the development, management, and analysis of GI networks by focusing on contemporary drivers nested together at the territorial level and with a prominent role for temporal considerations. The latter has hitherto been only weakly presented in the GI discourse. Development of the conceptual model has been informed by reference to examples drawn from across Europe. Finally, directions are provided for future research, and for developing and delivering GI in the emerging context of ecosystem services and human well-being.

AB  - Conservation of biodiversity is an important global challenge to ensuring future sustainability. University campuses can provide valuable resources for biodiversity; however, this is not yet fully recognized and sufficiently researched. The present study was carried out to show the biodiversity value of different green spaces at the Chiba University Nishi-Chiba Campus. Butterflies were chosen as indicators at ten sites: one intensive green roof, four meadows, two roads, two open spaces and one kitchen garden. From June 2010 to November 2010, butterfly surveys were carried out by transect counts from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm every two weeks, ten times in total. We identified 705 individuals of 25 species from 5 families. The species were mainly those common to urban areas near Tokyo. The results showed that the highest number of butterfly species and the highest total number of butterflies were observed in the kitchen garden, where various medicinal herbs provided a continuous source of nectar. On the contrary, the lowest total number of butterflies was found on the intensive green roof, although the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') value was high. The meadows provided a valuable habitat for the butterflies, and the roads connecting the campus green spaces were an important passageway for the butterflies. In the open spaces, areas planted with flowerbeds attracted a high number of butterflies. In conclusion, the university campus provided favorable habitats for butterflies; however, careful planting design and management is required to maintain nectar sources and host plants to maximize the biodiversity benefits of each green space.

AB  - Few studies directly address the consequences of habitat fragmentation for pollinating insect communities, particularly for the neotropical key pollinator group of stingless bees. Most studies on bees have defined habitat fragments as remnant patches of floral hosts or forests, overlooking the nesting needs of bees. Their conclusion is that habitat fragmentation is broadly deleterious; however, there are contrasting results in the literature. Insightful studies on habitat fragmentation and bees should consider fragmentation, alteration and loss of nesting habitats-not just patches of forage plants -, as well as the permeability of the surrounding matrix to interpatch movement. Here we investigated the effects of fragmentation caused by urbanization on stingless bee species' composition and richness, as well as the permeability of the surrounding matrix. We collected bees from flowering plants and recorded phytosociological variables of five forest remnants (ranging from 64 ha to 900 ha) in southeastern Brazil. Large fragments did not contain more species per unit area than smaller ones; in fact, we found more species in small fragments, most of which were generalist bees. The presence of more habitat generalist stingless bee species was also correlated to the structure of vegetation in these fragments. In conclusion, the quality of the habitat within a fragment (structure of vegetation) as well as the quality of the matrix has a direct relation to the bee species composition. This can be seen in the direct relationship between structural diversity of the environment and age of the fragments. The matrix that holds the most recent fragments, probably due to the sprawl of the city, is more heterogeneous than the one with the oldest fragments. The most heterogeneous matrices have a certain balance between the trees, buildings and bare soil or herbaceous vegetation coverage, making the array less impermeable to bees.

AB  - The quantification of the freight movements disaggregated by supply chain occurring in each traffic zone for the urban delivery of goods and that of the corresponding Origin- Destination trip tables is essential to evaluate the effects of any city logistic policy in terms of vehicle congestion and polluting emissions through the assignment of truck flows on the road network.
   In this paper we propose two innovative demand models: the first one for movement generation, the second one for trip distribution. The movement generation is addressed through an extension of the category index model, which takes into account the hierarchy in the classification system of the economic activities, thus avoiding aggregating the many existing classification codes into pre- specified groups.
   The trip distribution is addressed through an adaptation of the gravity model, which takes into account that deliveries are organized in tours. This approach has been successfully applied to the case of Emilia- Romagna Region in Italy, where an extensive campaign of surveys has permitted to calibrate both models for several towns and cities with various dimensions and vocations.

AB  - While diverse, native riparian vegetation provides important functions, it remains unclear to what extent these assemblages can persist in urban areas, and under what conditions. We characterized forested riparian vegetation communities across an urbanizing metropolitan area and examined their relationships with surrounding land cover. We hypothesized that native and hydrophilic species assemblages would correlate with forest cover in the landscape. For each of 30 sites in the Portland-Vancouver metro area, we recorded vegetation at 1-cm intervals along 3 transects using the line-intercept method. Land cover was characterized at 2 scales: within 500 m of each site and across the entire watershed. Multivariate analyses were used to evaluate relationships between species composition and land cover patterns. A classification tree was created to determine landscape predictors of riparian community type. Results indicated a strong relationship between watershed land cover and vegetation diversity and structural complexity. Our hypothesis of native species association with landscape forest cover in urban riparian areas was supported, but we found no clear relationship between land cover and wetland indicator status. Our results suggest that high watershed forest cover (at least 15%) may enable the persistence of functionally diverse, native riparian vegetation communities in urban landscapes.

AB  - Urbanization creates human disturbance that plays an important role in ecosystem dynamics. Most of the time, there is a time lag between disturbance and colonization. Opportunistic species with high dispersal power colonize first, while habitat specialist species with a lower power of dispersal colonize later; the communities change with time after disturbance. We hypothesize that, following the establishment of a new neighbourhood, arthropod communities will change from habitat generalists to specialists, and will be more similar to those of the adjacent countryside. We selected two groups of invertebrates often used as bioindicators, spiders and carabid beetles. The following parameters were estimated: assemblage composition, species richness, activity-density total and per life history trait (broad habitat preference). The field data were collected in 2010 within 3 towns located in France. Neighbourhoods of 10 and 30 years old were pair-matched in these towns and sampled using pitfall traps set randomly in hedgerows (120 traps in total). 2101 adult spiders belonging to 89 species were collected, whereas the 643 captured carabid beetles belonged to 24 species. We found no evidence of any significant change in carabid beetle and spider communities according to neighbourhood age. The assemblages were mainly composed of habitat generalist species. These results suggest that urban areas can be seen to be in continual state of disruption, and colonization of these areas is assumed to be relatively rapid (i.e., less than 10 years in our case study), although incomplete.

AB  - The persistence of wildlife in fragmented landscapes is predicted to rely on the presence of critical habitat elements. In urban landscapes, the persistence of hollow-dependent bats arguably depends upon the protection of roosting habitat, yet knowledge of bat roosting requirements within these landscapes is limited. We used radiotelemetry to locate day roosts of a species considered sensitive to urbanization, Gould's long-eared bat (Nyctophilus gouldi), in suburban bushland in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. We compared roost selection data collected for 9 individuals during the mating season (March-April 2009) and 10 individuals during the maternity season (November-December 2009). We found 41 roosts of N. gouldi under decorticating bark and in tree hollows, which were all located in 1 suburban bushland reserve (similar to 40 ha), with roosts rarely located elsewhere, despite the abundance of available trees in smaller patches outside of the reserve. N. gouldi displayed a clear preference for trees with a greater amount of understory and canopy cover, and only roosted where the extent of forest cover in the local landscape was greatest. Maternity roosts also were predominately located in gullies, and closer to creek lines than expected. Roost switching differed significantly between seasons, with lactating females switching roosts significantly more often than nonlactating females, where roost switching occurred after 1 day on 71% of occasions. Because competition with other fauna for hollows has been suggested as a potential threat, systematic observations of hollow-using bird species, including rainbow lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematodus), were conducted. We observed birds occupying bat roosts on days following bat occupancy, and bats roosted in trees where there were fewer hollow-using birds than randomly available trees. We recommend that further examination of hollow competition be undertaken because abundant, urban-adapted, hollow-nesting birds may render hollows a limiting resource to hollow-users such as bats in urban landscapes. Protection of a network of potential roost trees in suburban bushland remnants, particularly along creek lines, will assist in maintaining this critical resource for bats.

AB  - In largely urban Singapore, 69% of the 45 recorded native fig species (Ficus, Moraceae) are either critically endangered (24 species) or nationally extinct (7 species). Small populations of dioecious fig species are expected to be particularly vulnerable, because of evidence that their species-specific pollinators may be less mobile than those of monoecious figs. We therefore studied the dispersal of pollinating fig wasps (Chalcidoidea: Agaonidae) at an urban site by capturing them with sticky traps set at 25 m, 10 m, and 2 m above the ground. All but one of the pollinator genera expected for Singapore were captured, as well as one genus with no local hosts (Kradibia) and one whose only local host is apparently extinct (Dolichoris). Pollinators of monoecious host taxa dominated the catch (440 wasps; 90%) and were mostly caught in the 25 m traps. Dioecious pollinators were rare (28 wasps; 6%), despite the abundance and frequent reproduction of their hosts in the vicinity, and were mostly caught in the 2 m traps. These patterns are similar to those reported from previous studies in rural areas and suggests that wasp dispersal in Singapore displays similar trends. This study provides baseline data on fig wasp diversity found in Singapore through dispersal.

AB  - The presented case study deals with the hydromorphological alterations over a period of nearly 400 years and their ecological effects as shown by macrophytes in the urban floodplain Lobau along the Danube River within the city limits of Vienna for a period of about 160 years. Socio-economic pressures, such as flood protection (especially the Vienna Danube Regulation between 1869 and 1875), navigation and hydropower production, have modified the natural channel network in this anabranching river section into a shallow lake system in which habitat aging and sediment accumulation proceed. The aquatic and semiaquatic habitats and their rich biodiversity would become reduced severely without any restoration measures promoting enhanced surface water exchange. The effects of restoration measures approaching pre-regulation conditions were evaluated for the macrophyte vegetation, a key ecosystem component. To collect monitoring data of the pre-regulation conditions, detailed literature data and mappings since 1846 up to recent surveys including the long-term development of aquatic vegetation patterns and aquatic habitat composition in the floodplain Lobau were analyzed. The potential effects were evaluated by analyzing how hydraulic parameters (water velocity and suitable habitat area for macrophytes) have controlled macrophyte composition and development. The study aimed at assessing the differences between the current and the historic situation caused by human impacts at different spatial scales and changes overtime. By evaluating these differences we discussed intended as well as unintended effects of potential restoration measures.
   Primarily due to the loss of aquatic habitats the species diversity of aquatic vegetation is currently endangered and would decline without any restoration measures. However, a complete upstream reconnection of the remaining floodplain area Lobau to the Danube main channel (maximum achievable restoration goal) could also have unintended negative effects such as facilitation of the dispersal of non-native invasive species, decline of palaeopotamal species, and exposure of the floodplain to the present, altered water regime. Considering these alterations, the design of restoration projects would need to be adapted accordingly. In the presented case study Lobau, a partial reconnection instead of a complete reconnection might be the option optimizing the given management goals best. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Divided cities are defined by a violent conflict of ethnonationalism and characterized by semi-permanent ethnic cleavages, high levels of endogamy and social segregation. Yet the perception that divided cities are wholly framed by the politics of ethnic homogeneity is challenged by a number of its citizens who refuse to be interminably circumscribed by ethnic politics. These 'actors' mobilize in social movements that promote non-sectarian politics and identities. They also include the protests of environmentalists, trade unionists and the celebrations of gay groupings. This article critically explores how such urban social movements may help ameliorate or contest the politics of ethnic antagonism in divided cities. It explores this issue in the context of debates regarding peacebuilding projects in divided cities, especially those that promote accommodative solutions to ethnic conflict, and shows how social movement mobilization may augment political power sharing. Focusing on non-sectarian social movement mobilization in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the article critically analyses movements in three ways: creating intercommunal networks; fostering a public sphere of debate; and challenging the programmed uses of segregated space.

AB  - The aims of this study were (i) to determine the genetic variability of the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius Pallas, 1771) population in the area of the Warsaw conurbation and the genetic differentiation among local populations of this species within the city, and (ii) to examine the influence of the degree of isolation on the appearance of such genetic structure. Comparison of the genetic structure of the urban population. with that of populations inhabiting rural areas was intended to shed light on the depth of genetic changes in this species caused by life in an urban environment. Eight microsatellite loci were used for genotyping and these molecular analyses were successfully performed for 269 individuals. Genetic differentiation (F-ST) was much higher in the case of the urban population. STRUCTURE analysis indicated that this population was subdivided into several local populations, whereas for the rural locations, the highest likelihood was for a single genetic group (one genetically unstructured population). Moreover, in contrast to the rural population, we found no isolation by distance in the urban population. Despite clear subdivision of the urban population, the level of genetic variability was very similar in both analyzed groups. Our findings indicate the occurrence of an advanced process of differentiation of the urban population by microevolution, whereas populations from rural locations displayed very small and mainly insignificant genetic differentiation. Urban local populations, situated near the city borders or close to the natural ecological corridor (banks of the Vistula River), showed higher genetic variability and were less differentiated from populations inhabiting rural sites than from local populations in the city centre. These results provide support for the importance of ecological corridors in preserving the genetic variability of the urban striped field mouse population.

AB  - In industrial societies, dominant mechanic rhythmicalities were treated by critical thinkers and artists as forces of dehumanization and alienation. Organic rhythmicalities (bodily or cosmic ones) were alternatively explored in an effort to create a possible harmonious synthesis of nature and machine civilization. Rehumanizing the city-machine has, however, ceased to be a meaningful venture in post-industrial societies. Contemporary post-industrial cities are characterized by site-specific rhythms which create a multifaceted urban normality. Each urban enclave has its specific rules and rhythms of use, and is controlled through a localized state of exception' in which certain general laws and rights are suspended. Contesting contemporary rhythmicalities might thus mean contesting the rhythmicalities of exception which establish spatiotemporal separations and discriminations. Profiting from an ongoing discussion about the inventive tactics of the weak and the dispossessed, this paper focuses on the squares movement' in order to discover exemplary acts of such a possible polyrhythmical' resistance. In the occupied squares people have devised ways to escape the imposed normality of urban enclavism' in search of polyrhythmical spaces and practices of commoning.

AB  - Studies on nesting ecology have proven to be extremely important for stingless bees conservation. This kind of study is scarce in urban landscapes. Our study aimed to analyze the abundance, density, diversity, spatial distribution and nesting habits of species belonging to the Meliponina subtribe in an urban area of the Uberlandia municipality, Minas Gerais state. We checked potential nesting sites by searching for nests from October 2009 until April 2010. We collected six worker bees from each detected nest to identify species, and estimated diversity and analyzed the spatial distribution pattern of the nests using the Shannon-Wiener and Nearest Neighbor index, respectively. We found fifty nests belonging to seven species, with Nannotrigona testaceicornis being the most abundant species (44%). The density of nests was 2.17 nests/ha, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index was H'=1.58 and the clumped distribution was the detected dispersal pattern. The height of the nests in relation to the ground varied from 0 to 12 m: Trigona spinipes had the highest nests and the highest variation for this parameter. Hollow trees were the preferred substrate occupied by the observed bees species (70%): Caesalpinia peltophoroides was the preferred plant species for nesting. Our results suggested that urban landscapes can sustain a high diversity of stingless bees, and maintaining trees species and urban forestry projects are important tools for the conservation of this group of animals. This type of study provides relevant information to the development of management and conservation plans for Meliponina species.

AB  - Our research seeks to understand how the contemporary community garden movement in the United States differs from its predecessors and whether its new foundation increases the political and financial sustainability of today's gardens. To this end, this article reviews historical and contemporary literature, and surveys participants in three distinctive community gardens, to answer several related research questions. First, what is the current state of the US community garden movement, and how have its historical roots shaped its response to current policy concerns? Second, which populations comprise today's community gardeners, and what motivates them to participate? After considering the findings from our three study gardens, and from a review of secondary and gray literature, we conclude by positing that a greater diversity of gardeners and gardening motivations, accompanied by changing leading views on urban land uses, will lead to such urban gardens remaining a more lasting feature of city neighborhood landscapes.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to analyze the relationship between the ridership of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway (SMS) and the land-use pattern of its station areas to verify the assumption that the ridership of transit stations at both ends of the range of urban structural hierarchy is more affected by density than by land use diversity, whereas the ridership of the stations in between are influenced more by land use diversity than by density. The station areas were classified and clustered according to an accessibility index, which refers to the position of the urban structural hierarchy of Seoul. A multiple regression model was applied to each cluster of the station areas. Finally, the estimated models for all station areas and for the clusters were compared to verify the assumption. The results show that the subway ridership at Seoul's CBD and fringe areas is primarily influenced by density, whereas the sub-central area is generally affected by diversity. The intermodal connectivity by bus had an influence. The results provide policy implications for Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) strategies to increase subway ridership in metropolitan areas where a number of sub-centers exist.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is particularly severe in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas, where greater than 90% of the native wetland habitat has been replaced by agriculture and urban development. The Brownsville Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas insperata), a rare subspecies of the Common Yellowthroat restricted to this area, is a good model for studying the effects of this extensive fragmentation on avian genetics and ecology. In this study, three hypotheses addressing genetics and habitat fragmentation were tested: (1) the density of Brownsville Yellowthroats is greatest along the Rio Grande rather than away from the river; (2) individuals found on or near the Rio Grande are more closely related than individuals farther away; and (3) a source-sink metapopulation model is the best fit to describe the population dynamics of the subspecies. We used 15 microsatellites to examine the genetic diversity of 128 individuals from Cameron and Hidalgo Counties (Texas) sampled during 2008-2009. The densities of yellowthroats at sites near the Rio Grande were not significantly different from densities at sites farther from the river. Genetic analysis indicated that individuals were as related to each other as would be expected in distant relatives and indicated the presence of a single, admixed population. The results suggest that the Brownsville Common Yellowthroat is able to move freely among isolated habitat patches and that wetlands along the Rio Grande do not act as an exclusive corridor for this species.

The main focus of the research is on demographic changes and population movement and on an increase in the spatial segregation of certain social groups which seems to result from the latter changes, particularly of the unemployed and the impoverished. The research also discusses social problems and changes in the quality of life which may be connected with the preceding changes. An attempt is made to encapsulate some of the main features of the new socio-spatial patterns which have emerged over the last two decades in a model of medium sized towns in this region.

AB  - Tree communities of secondary deciduous oak forests were surveyed in 13 forests (two in residential and 11 in rural areas) in the warm temperate Hokuriku District of Japan to understand the effects of fragmentation, location (residential or rural), and logging history. The rural forest logged most recently, where diameter at breast height was smallest, had a distinct canopy tree (> 12 m) community due to an increase of trees from wind-dispersed seeds. The rural forest with gaps and the two residential forests also had different canopy tree communities from the other rural forests. In contrast, the tree community in the shrub layer (a parts per thousand currency sign6 m) was not influenced by logging history and the existence of gaps but by location only. This was caused by an increase in evergreen trees (consequently causing poor light conditions on the forest floor) and a decrease in trees from wind-dispersed seeds in the residential forests. Among the rural forest patches, no negative effects of forest size and isolation on density of tree individuals were detected for any seed dispersal mode. This may be because many forest patches were arranged at distances of 10-50 m from neighboring patches in rural areas, which enables tree species with low dispersal ability to disperse their seeds to neighboring forests. However, as found in the residential forests, long-term abandonment and extensive fragmentation may gradually reduce tree diversity through loss of tree species with shade intolerance and low seed dispersal ability.

AB  - Dispersal is a significant life-history trait of vagile species that affects the distribution and genetic structure of populations. Natal dispersal in birds is the movement of an individual from its hatch site to a new location where its first reproductive effort occurs. To examine the ongoing recovery of the Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) in the upper Midwest, U.S.A., we assessed the influence of sex, hack-status (hacked or wild-fledged), and hatch site (cliff or human-made) on natal dispersal distance, and we evaluated directional trends of dispersal in the midwestern Peregrine Falcon subpopulation. We found that mean dispersal distance of female peregrines was >2 times farther than that of males. Dispersal distance did not differ between hacked females and wild-fledged females; however, hacked males dispersed significantly farther than wild-fledged males. Dispersal distance among urban-hatched females and cliff-hatched females did not differ, nor did dispersal distance of urban-hatched males and cliff-hatched males, probably because the sample size for cliff-hatched birds was small. As a whole, the direction of dispersal in midwestern peregrines was nonuniformly distributed and skewed to the northwest and southeast. This report may benefit future studies of peregrine demographics and population viability analyses by providing wildlife managers with information about the patterns and natal movements of Peregrine Falcons in the midwestem U.S.

AB  - Protected areas chief conservation objectives are to include species within their boundaries and protect them from negative external pressures. Many protected areas are not achieving these goals, perhaps in part due to land development inside and outside protected areas. We conducted spatial analyses to evaluate the ability of Canadian protected areas to mitigate the effects of nearby land development. We investigated correlations of national patterns of land development in and around protected areas and then examined national patterns of roads, urban area, and croplands in protected areas. We calculated the amount of developed land in protected areas and within 25100 km of protected-area borders, the density of roads, and extent of urban and cropland area in protected areas. We constructed logistic-regression models to test whether development in a protected area was associated with landscape and protected-area characteristics. Land development was far less extensive inside than outside protected areas. However, several protected areas, particularly small southern areas near small urban centers had substantial development inside their boundaries, and nearly half of protected areas had roads. The cumulative extent of development within 50 km of protected areas was the best predictor of the probability of land development in protected areas. Canadian First Nations, industries, government, and nongovernmental organizations are currently planning an unprecedented number of new protected areas. Careful management of areas beyond protected-area boundaries may prove critical to meeting their long-term conservation objectives.

AB  - 1. Concomitant with the rise in the proportion of the global human population that resides in urban areas has been growth in awareness of the importance of the provision of ecosystem goods and services to those people. Urban areas are themselves of significance in this regard because of their areal extent, and hence the quantity of services falling within their bounds, and because of the need for local provision of services to urban residents. 2. Here, we review key challenges to the effective management of ecosystem goods and services within urban areas. 3. These challenges include the structure of green space, its temporal dynamics, spatial constraint on ecosystem service flows, occurrence of novel forms of flows, large numbers of land managers, conflicting management goals, possible differences between perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of the distribution and flow of ecosystem services, and the wicked' nature of the problem of ecosystem service management. 4. Synthesis and applications. Urban areas present very particular combinations of challenges and opportunities for the management of ecosystem goods and services. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of green spaces greatly complicates the maintenance and improvement in service provision as well as dramatically inflating costs. Spatial constraints on ecosystem service flows mean that these can be highly dependent on the maintenance of particular areas of connectivity, but also that provision of additional key points of connectivity may be disproportionately beneficial to those flows. The existence of novel forms of flows of ecosystem services in urban areas offers means of overcoming spatial constraints on more natural flows, but will require the development of new kinds of ecosystem process models to inform their design and management. The large numbers of land managers, conflicts between the best approaches for managing for different goods and services, and frequent differences between the perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of urban landscapes create a complex management context. The management of ecosystem goods and services is closely allied to the challenges of conventional urban planning. However, applied ecology has a broad range of tools available to assist in determining solutions, including the use of high-resolution remote sensing techniques, landscape ecology principles and theory (e.g. patch and matrix frameworks, meta-population models), and systematic conservation planning approaches.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to compare urban and peri-urban mammal assemblages and relate variation in these communities to local differences in vegetation. We surveyed 15 locations in both urban and peri-urban habitats (n = 30). Boundaries of our survey areas coincided with those of National Park Service (NPS) areas in central Virginia. Over a 14-month period, we used five trap-types to document species in three guilds. A total of 9 and 15 species were documented at urban and peri-urban locations, respectively. Top predators Canis latrans (Coyote) and Felis rufus (Bobcat) were undetected at urban sites, while mesopredators were consistently more abundant. The absence of four small prey species and reduced abundances of the most common native generalist, Peromyscus leucopus (White-footed Mouse), were also associated with urban locations. Multivariate analyses of relative abundance data indicated significantly dissimilar mammal communities in urban and peri-urban locations. Shrub cover was highest in peri-urban locations, while grass cover was highest in urban sitesa pattern that was only marginally significant due to greater variability among these sites. The exotic grass Microstegium vimineum (Japanese Stiltgrass) was present at several urban sites and contributed to the complex relationship between percent grass cover and the small-mammal assemblages that we surveyed. Our results suggest that disturbances that reduce the recruitment of shrubs and other native plants and promote the spread of invasive grasses may have severe consequences for small-mammal communities. In addition, culturally preserved areas within both survey sites (i.e., battlefields planted with fescue grasses) were inhospitable to most small-mammal species and wildlife in general. In many NPS areas, there is great opportunity for development of adaptive management strategies that integrate ongoing NPS efforts to control invasive plant species with the enhancement of wildlife habitat in both culturally and naturally preserved areas. There is an urgent need for the conservation of native habitat in NPS areas and non-park sites threatened by urbanization. The primary focus of these efforts should include the control of exotic species and mesopredators, facilitation of native shrub recruitment, and, in many of these areas, the ecological restoration of historic sites. NPS lands in urbanized areas offer unique conditions for wildlife management and abundant opportunities for conserving native communities.

AB  - As neoliberal restructuring destroys historic precincts in Hong Kong, these spaces' social and living histories take on new meanings for the city's disenfranchised citizenry. In 2006 the impending demolition of Hong Kong's iconic Star Ferry Pier and Queen's Pier inspired a new form of spatial and cultural politics, which spawned unanticipated civic participation in the struggle to own the city. A lengthy cycle of oppositional actions interwove imaginative interventions, occupations, and investigative reportage, creating temporary affective spaces' around the piers. Contributors to the online citizen journalism site Hong Kong In-Media reframed sentimental mainstream media narratives by connecting urban development to political agency. The grassroots piers movement is significant because it seeded a new social movement in Hong Kong, one which shares resonances with Chinese protest culture and the global Occupy movement. Moreover, the organically constituted social formation of protesters perhaps materialises the philosophical concept of the multitude'.

AB  - Knowledge of dispersal patterns and survival rates is essential to understand population dynamics and demography, and to develop effective long-term management strategies for species of conservation concern. In New England, Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) were extirpated as a breeding species in the 1960s. Following a captive breeding and release program, the population subsequently underwent a rapid, dispersal-based expansion into its former range, particularly during the last two decades. Use of buildings, bridges, and other human-made structures for nesting has become widespread in urban areas, where the species only infrequently nested prior to reintroduction. We analyzed encounters of Peregrine Falcons banded as nestlings in the six New England states between May 1990 and June 2009 to determine: (a) differences in dispersal patterns (distance and direction) by sex; (b) differences in movement and natal dispersal among birds from cliff and artificial nest sites; (c) causes of mortality; and (d) effects of sex, age, and natal habitat type on survivorship. Of 986 Peregrine Falcons banded, 24% were encountered again at least once by December 2009. Although most encounters (76%) occurred within the study area, 24% were outside New England in eight other eastern states, three Canadian provinces, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Five percent of the marked population was later confirmed at breeding territories in the eastern U.S.A., primarily in New England. Females dispersed greater distances (natal dispersal = 152.6 km; range = 70.2- 853.5 km; n = 28) than males (88.0 km; range = 0.03-1009.7 km; n = 22). New England peregrines showed a strong tendency to settle at nest types similar to those on which they were raised (rural cliff vs. urban structures); however, we documented movement from urban to rural habitats and vice versa in equal proportions. The causes of mortality for 122 recovered birds included unknown (61%), collisions with aircraft (11%), collisions with stationary objects (8%), falling from nest site (8%), collisions with vehicles or trains (7%), gunshot wounds (2%), entanglement in fishing gear (1%), and poisoning (1%). Most deaths occurred among first-year (68%) and second-year (11%) birds, with first-year peregrines experiencing significantly higher mortality than other age classes. The estimated annual survival rate for second-year and adult falcons combined was 81%, whereas our estimate for first-year birds was only 9%; however, the latter rate likely is a significant underestimate. We found no effect of natal habitat or sex on survival.

AB  - While human-induced rapid environmental changes are putting many organisms at risk of extinction, others are doing better than ever. This raises the question of why organisms differ in their tolerance to environmental alterations. Here, we ask whether and how behavioural adjustments assist animals in dealing with the urbanization process, one of the primary causes of biodiversity loss and biotic homogenization. Based on a literature review, we present both theoretical and empirical arguments to show that behavioural adjustments to urban habitats are widespread and that they may potentially be important in facilitating resource use, avoiding disturbances and enhancing communication. While a growing number of studies report behavioural differences between urban and nonurban animals, very few studies directly address the underlying mechanisms. In some cases, the changes in behaviour occur very rapidly and involve learning, and hence can be attributed to behavioural plasticity. In other cases, however, it cannot be ruled out that behavioural differences between urban and nonurban animals result from natural selection or nonrandom sorting of individuals by behavioural traits that affect dispersal, habitat selection or establishment. Because the urbanization process is expected to continue to threaten biodiversity in the near future, there is some urgency to improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which behaviour helps animals to cope with such environmental alterations.

AB  - Water as a liquid state of earth is assumed as a proposal that integrates the surface of the water that surrounds New York City, as an occupied territory, in extension with the shore. Thus from a flexible, sustainable and self-sufficient structure, which composes the expo program: Clean Tech Expo, that will be held in 2014, five functional clusters are defined linked by a mobility network that is organized in three levels: macro, medium and micro. The macro level includes five mobility units associated with the exhibition and features themes related to each of five boroughs: walking-Manhattan, agriculture-Queens, transformation-Staten Island, energy-Brooklyn and road-Bronx. The medium level integrates collective transport units and the micro level private transport units. The transport network-blue network, links a vast territory that takes land and water as elements of the same urban reality and create the 6th borough of New York.

AB  - Community based natural resource management groups contribute to landscape scale ecological change through their aggregation of local ecological knowledge. However, the social networks at the heart of such groups remain invisible to decision makers as evidenced in funding cuts and strategic policy documents. Our research is a pilot study of the social networks in two peri-urban landscapes in Victoria, Australia. We describe the social network analysis undertaken with regard to natural resource management issues. The findings are assessed against the qualities of resilience: diversity, modularity, connectivity, and feedback loops. A social network analysis tool is discussed with participants to assess its usefulness on-ground and with agency staff involved in the project. We concluded that the sociograms are useful to the groups, however, the management of the tool itself is complex and calls for agency personnel to facilitate the process. Overall, the project did make visible the networks that contribute to a multiscalar social and ecological resilience in these landscapes, and in this regard, their use is of benefit to policy makers concerned with supporting networks that build social resilience.

AB  - Vegetation is a fundamental element in urban ecosystems, and vegetation mapping is critical for urban and landscape planning and management. While remote sensing has increasingly been used for vegetation mapping, this spatially explicit approach can be challenging due to the spectral similarity between various vegetation types and the presence of complex features in the urban environment. The objective of this study is to develop a method that can help improve vegetation mapping in urban areas from medium-resolution remote sensor imagery. Central to our method is the combined use of stratified classification and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) techniques. Specifically, we firstly partition the entire landscape into rural and urban subsets using road network density so that each subset can be processed independently to minimize the spectral confusion between some urban features and agricultural land covers. Secondly, we carefully extract all vegetation covers at the sub-pixel level for the urban subset by using the MESMA technique in order to account for small, fragmented vegetation patches that would be classified as non-vegetated classes otherwise. Thirdly, we adopt a separate supervised classification protocol to the rural subset and the vegetation covers extracted from the urban subset. Finally, we combine the classified outcomes from the two subsets to produce a complete map. We have implemented this method to produce a land cover map including various vegetation types from a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image covering a large metropolitan area. It is found that this method has substantially outperformed two related ones that use the same supervised protocol to the entire area directly or to the rural subset and the urban subset without being MESMA processed. The advantage of our method is that it has extended the capability of sub-pixel analysis beyond vegetation abundance estimation and into the area of mapping thematic vegetation types in urban areas.

AB  - A substantial body of literature has addressed the emergence of new forms of network governance in the urban realm. Whilst some authors tend to consider network governance practices as intimately linked to neoliberalism, others celebrate them as a Third Way between markets and hierarchies. Bringing urban regime analysis back into this debate can be important for three main reasons: first, this theoretical approach invites us to interrogate narratives of transformation, arguing that 'governance' and 'networks' have always been integral to governing and, therefore, forcing governance theory to clarify what is new in the network paradigm; second, urban regime analysis highlights a fact that is often neglected in the network governance literature-that, in reality, the agendas and participants of governance networks can be very different in different places and that this can lead to different types of socioeconomic outcomes; third, urban regime analysis focuses our attention on the interplay between political economic structures and local political activities in particular places, helping us to understand how local governance decisions are taken in the face of global structural pressures. The comparison between two cases of neighbourhood regeneration in Barcelona permits us to illustrate what is new in the 'network governance' era; the diversity of urban policy practices that the 'network paradigm' can encompass; as well the influence of locally specific circumstances and of local actors' policy choices on the practice of network governance.

AB  - Between 1940 and 1980, the homeownership rate among metropolitan African-American households increased by 27 percentage points. Nearly three-quarters of this increase occurred in central cities. We show that rising black homeownership in central cities was facilitated by the movement of white households to the suburban ring, which reduced the price of urban housing units conducive to owner-occupancy. Our OLS and IV estimates imply that 26 percent of the national increase in black homeownership over the period is explained by white suburbanization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Eleven microsatellite markers were used to determine the genetic population structure and spread of Aedes aegypti (Stegomyia aegypti) (Diptera: Culicidae) in Pakistan using mosquitoes collected from 13 different cities. There is a single genetic cluster of Ae. aegypti in Pakistan with a pattern of isolation by distance within the population. The low level of isolation by distance suggests the long-range passive dispersal of this mosquito, which may be facilitated by the tyre trade in Pakistan. A decrease in genetic diversity from south to north suggests a recent spread of this mosquito from Karachi. A strong negative correlation between genetic distance and the quality of road connections shows that populations in cities connected by better road networks are less differentiated, which suggests the human-aided passive dispersal of Ae. aegypti in Pakistan. Dispersal on a large spatial scale may facilitate the strategy of introducing transgenic Ae. aegypti or intracellular bacteria such as Wolbachia to control the spread of dengue disease in Pakistan, but it also emphasizes the need for simple measures to control container breeding sites.

AB  - This paper examines the land use changes of the Hungarian rural-urban fringes after the economic transition through the case study of Kecskemet. After describing the basic characteristics of the rural-urban fringe, the authors distinguish five important factors specific to Hungary, which influenced the ongoing processes of the fringe. These factors are the restructuring of the land ownership rights, the role of the municipalities as land-owners, the privatization of the hobby gardens, the decreasing role of agriculture and the local residents' alienation from the rural traditions. The case study, Kecskemet's historical heritage as a former oppidum with a well-developed tanya network led to the formation of a special relationship between the countryside and the city and is still influencing the development of the fringe. After the economic transition, the new processes appeared in four phases in the rural-urban fringe of Kecskemet. The expansion of the retail stores, upper class migrants, transportation network and greenfield industrial investments affected each part of the fringe differently. In the northern part of the fringe traditional landscape and land use remained dominant, while in the western part of the fringe, more radical changes occurred, and resulted in chaotic land use. The transformation of the rural-urban fringe in Kecskemet has not ended yet. To lessen the negative effects, stronger community control and more consequent regulations are needed in the future.

TI  - Order: the main element in the scientific analysis of avenue landscape
T2  - BAGH-E NAZAR

KW  - Spatial organization
KW  - Avenue landscape
KW  - Systematic approach
KW  - Order
AB  - The avenue is a favorite subject for theorists in various fields. The plurality of perspectives in this context entails different methods for pondering over the concept of 'avenue': through form (Lynch, 1950 and Cullen, 1961 and Bacon, 1976 and Gourdon, 2001), through aesthetics (Koblenz, 1998), through social sciences (Jacobs, 1961), through interactions between individuals (Lemenorel, 1994), through political acts (Marx, 1870) or through history (Nicaulaud, 1995). In parallel to this, the researchers are pursuing new ways to study the phenomenon of avenue. One of the latest approaches to that connection is the systematic analysis which focuses on analyzing the qualities of the city.
   Given the inadequacies of the classical approaches to deal with the complexities of the universe, a systematic approach has been developed to be used as a scientific tool to study the phenomenon of the avenue. Limitations of analytical thinking in various fields such as mathematics and biology have been at the heart of the systematic thought in the early twentieth century, and the addition of the word "system" resulted in the emergence of many disciplines. The extensible nature of this thought in various fields prepared the ground for it to become an intellectual paradigm which has been specifically useful in approaching complex issues in intellectual circles of the second half of the 20th century. This has in itself led to the development of a systematic outlook toward intellectual issues in the present century. The complex nature of the city has made the intellectuals in the area of urban studies to adopt a systematic approach as a scientific means to analyze and determine the elements of the city.
   Studies in the field of the spatial organization of the city are examples of these efforts that expose the avenue as the main element that comprise the structure of the city. Based on this, the question of the avenue as part of a systematic approach is very important in urban debates. The order of the avenue is a concept with an old background in urban issues. The fundamental role of order in the formation of systems promotes its significance in the systematic approach toward the phenomenon of avenue. Therefore, by considering the frameworks that have been defined for the urban landscape, it seems that the epistemological question about the order of the avenue is a key step in analyzing its related landscape.
   The system is a unit consisting of vital elements in three levels:
   The first level (basic): The presence of independent components, The second level (intermediate): The relationship between the components, The third level (high): The sole purpose for management of relationships.
   In a systematic approach, the city as a great central processing unit is itself composed of several subsystems which are simpler and smaller. The avenue is one of those subsystems which play an important role in the network of urban roads. Accordingly, the avenue is a basic component of the city structure and is a subsystem of the spatial organization of the city. Given the diversity of its components, the avenue is a complex system that follows the rules below:
   The avenue is an entirety, Elements of the avenue are interdependent, The order in the avenue demonstrates the relation of its components.
   -The avenue contains interactive subsystems which interact with each other in order of hierarchy.
   In the systemic theory, the avenues are the forms and functions of a whole system and the relations between them create the order of the avenue. Such order can be classified in different levels. In other words, the maximized and minimized combination of form and function creates a spectrum of various levels of order for the avenue. This is the direct product of the social and political conditions of various societies and its entirety is in line with the spectrum of absolute order to deductive order:
   The maximum unity and minimal diversity of the form represent the absolute order of the avenue which lie on a fixed spectrum and its unchangeable nature manifests the authority of a special power. By the same logic which is inherent in it, this unity and diversity is definable, measurable and perceptible by the five senses.
   The minimum unity in form and the maximum diversity of roles represent the deductive order of the avenue. The unchangeable nature of this evokes the power of the society against the authority. When considering the maximum dimensions of this side of the spectrum (role and form), it becomes evident that the deductive order cannot be put into any specific framework of logic. Nevertheless, this is not to mean that there is no logic involved in this. Rather, logic plays a resilient role on this front. Deductive order therefore is a growing phenomenon and the five senses cannot detect it on their own.
   The research has four steps:
   - Explaining order as a concept arising from the relationship in the training system;
   - Analyzing the ontological and epistemological aspects of avenue as a system;
   - Providing two basic models of avenue order;
   - Describing and evaluating the hypothesis on the basis of the avenue order.

AB  - Metapopulations occur in fragmented landscapes, and consist of demographically-independent populations connected by dispersal. Nevertheless, anthropogenic habitat fragmentation may be fatal to metapopulations, as it disrupts dispersal and gene flow, and undermines the balance between population extinction and colonization. Understanding the extent to which particular land-use practices disrupt dispersal and gene flow is therefore crucial for conserving metapopulations. We examined the structure and fragmentation of metapopulations of the endangered growling grass frog (Litoria raniformis) in an urbanizing landscape in southern Australia. Population clustering analyses revealed three distinct genetic units, corresponding to the three wetland clusters sampled. Isolation-by-distance was apparent between populations, and genetic distance was significantly correlated with the presence of urban barriers between populations. Our study provides evidence that urbanization fragments metapopulations of L. raniformis. Managers of L. raniformis in urbanizing landscapes should seek to mitigate effects of urbanization on dispersal and gene flow.

AB  - In urban environments, green roofs provide a number of benefits, including decreased urban heat island effects and reduced energy costs for buildings. However, little research has been done on the non-plant biota associated with green roofs, which likely affect their functionality. For the current study, we evaluated whether or not green roofs planted with two native plant communities in New York City functioned as habitats for soil fungal communities, and compared fungal communities in green roof growing media to soil microbial composition in five city parks, including Central Park and the High Line. Ten replicate roofs were sampled one year after planting; three of these roofs were more intensively sampled and compared to nearby city parks. Using Illumina sequencing of the fungal ITS region we found that green roofs supported a diverse fungal community, with numerous taxa belonging to fungal groups capable of surviving in disturbed and polluted habitats. Across roofs, there was significant biogeographical clustering of fungal communities, indicating that community assembly of roof microbes across the greater New York City area is locally variable. Green roof fungal communities were compositionally distinct from city parks and only 54% of the green roof taxa were also found in the park soils. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis revealed that park soils had greater microbial biomass and higher bacterial to fungal ratios than green roof substrates. City park soils were also more enriched with heavy metals, had lower pH, and lower quantities of total bases (Ca, K, and Mg) compared to green roof substrates. While fungal communities were compositionally distinct across green roofs, they did not differentiate by plant community. Together, these results suggest that fungi living in the growing medium of green roofs may be an underestimated component of these biotic systems functioning to support some of the valued ecological services of green roofs.

AB  - Biodiversity monitoring at large spatial and temporal scales is greatly needed in the context of global changes. Although insects are a species-rich group and are important for ecosystem functioning, they have been largely neglected in conservation studies and policies, mainly due to technical and methodological constraints. Sound detection, a nondestructive method, is easily applied within a citizen-science framework and could be an interesting solution for insect monitoring. However, it has not yet been tested at a large scale. We assessed the value of a citizen-science program in which Orthoptera species (Tettigoniidae) were monitored acoustically along roads. We used Bayesian model-averaging analyses to test whether we could detect widely known patterns of anthropogenic effects on insects, such as the negative effects of urbanization or intensive agriculture on Orthoptera populations and communities. We also examined site-abundance correlations between years and estimated the biases in species detection to evaluate and improve the protocol. Urbanization and intensive agricultural landscapes negatively affected Orthoptera species richness, diversity, and abundance. This finding is consistent with results of previous studies of Orthoptera, vertebrates, carabids, and butterflies. The average mass of communities decreased as urbanization increased. The dispersal ability of communities increased as the percentage of agricultural land and, to a lesser extent, urban area increased. Despite changes in abundances over time, we found significant correlations between yearly abundances. We identified biases linked to the protocol (e.g., car speed or temperature) that can be accounted for ease in analyses. We argue that acoustic monitoring of Orthoptera along roads offers several advantages for assessing Orthoptera biodiversity at large spatial and temporal extents, particularly in a citizen science framework. El Uso de Monitoreos Acusticos a Gran Escala para Estudiar las Presiones Antropogenicas sobre Comunidades de Orthoptera
   Resumen El monitoreo de la biodiversidad a grandes escalas espaciales y temporales es una necesidad en el contexto de cambios globales. Aunque los insectos son un grupo rico en especies y son importantes para el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas, han sido ignorados en estudios y politicas de conservacion, principalmente debido a restricciones tecnicas y metodologicas. La deteccion sonora, un metodo no destructivo, se aplica facilmente dentro de un marco de ciencia ciudadana y podria ser una resolucion interesante para el monitoreo de insectos, sin embargo no se ha probado a gran escala. Estudiamos el valor de un programa de ciencia ciudadana en el que especies de Orthoptera (Tettigoniidae) fueron monitoreadas acusticamente a lo largo de las carreteras. Usamos analisis bayesianos de promedio de modelos para probar si podiamos detectar patrones ampliamente conocidos de efectos antropogenicos sobre insectos, como los efectos negativos de la urbanizacion o de la agricultura intensiva sobre poblaciones y comunidades de Orthoptera. Tambien examinamos correlaciones sitio- abundancia entre anos y estimamos los sesgos en la deteccion de especies para evaluar y mejorar el protocolo. La urbanizacion y los paisajes de agricultura intensiva afectaron negativamente a la riqueza de especies de Orthoptera asi como a la diversidad y la abundancia. Este hallazgo va de acuerdo con los resultados de estudios previos sobre Orthoptera, vertebrados, carabidos y mariposas. La masa promedio de comunidades disminuyo conforme incremento la urbanizacion. La habilidad de dispersion de las comunidades incremento conforme incrementaba el porcentaje de tierra agricola, y en una menor cantidad, el area urbana. A pesar de los cambios en abundancias a lo largo del tiempo encontramos correlaciones significativas entre abundancias anuales. Identificamos los sesgos vinculados con el protocolo (p.ej.: velocidad del auto o temperatura) que pueden senalarse facilmente en los analisis. Proponemos que el monitoreo acustico de Orthoptera a lo largo de las carreteras ofrece varias ventajas para estudiar la biodiversidad en extensiones grandes tanto espaciales como temporales, particularmente en un marco de ciencia ciudadana.

AB  - Mass movements and floods triggered by rainstorms are considered some of the most serious environmental problems and are quite often able to cause great disasters in large tropical cities. This has been occurring due to anthropic activities which change natural drainage and stability of slope in urban areas. However, lower monthly rainfalls which occur with high frequency can also cause mass movements and floods. The direct and indirect effects of less intense but continuous rainfall mainly affect less privileged communities, which occupy areas more sensitive to mass movements and flooding, such as locations along river margins, coastal lagoons, mangroves, and steep slopes. This manuscript highlights the important contribution of the lower monthly rainfall totals in triggering mass movements and floods on the east side of Pedra Branca Massif in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Geoprocessing was used to estimate the total monthly rainfall in rain gauges managed by the local authority; create surface interpolation and choropleth maps; and conduct a comparative analysis of histograms of the total monthly rainfall and flooding and mass movement records provided by the City's Civil Defence. The results confirmed the direct relation between higher monthly rainfall totals and mass movements and floods, and also showed that lower monthly rainfall totals can trigger a significant occurrence of such events. Moreover, the monthly rainfall limit that could trigger mass movements and floods was confirmed on the east side of Pedra Branca Massif.

AB  - Carabid beetle assemblages in three environments in the Araucaria humid forest of southern Brazil. Carabidae is composed mainly by ground-dwelling predator beetles. It is the fourth most diverse group within Coleoptera, but its diversity in the Neotropical region is understudied. Here we describe and analyze the diversity of carabid beetles in a region of subtropical rain forest dominated by Araucaria angustifolia with different landscapes. Three areas were chosen in an environmental integrity gradient: primary forests, secondary forests and old Pinus plantations. Pitfall traps were taken monthly, in a total of 14 samples per area. 1733 adult carabid beetles, belonging to 18 species, were sampled. There were differences in richness and abundance between the sampled areas. The total scores followed the same tendency: primary forests (14 species/747 individuals), secondary forests (13/631) and Pinus forests (10/355). An analysis of similarity shows differences in species composition, for both areas and seasons. Galerita lacordarei was the most abundant species for all samples and seasons. Carabid species show similar responses in accordance with habitat heterogeneity and disturbance. The abundance of Galerita lacordarei was influenced by temperature, for all sampled sites. Environmental changes affect the carabid assemblages and decrease diversity, possibly interfering in local dynamics. Seasonality patterns seem to indicate an increase in individual movement during summer, probably in search of resources. It is suggested that microhabitat patchiness is probably an important factor affecting carabid beetle diversity at small spatial scales.

AB  - This paper investigates how urban greenspace is integrated in everyday practices of urban populations. What are the social functions that green areas serve, and how do people interact with the materiality of urban greenspace. The paper reports from a recent empirical study in Copenhagen, Denmark, and it seeks to qualify concepts of lifestyle and practice, i.e. concepts by which sociological studies can capture and understand patterns of actions in people's daily lives. Particularly it seeks to include an understanding of the role of materiality in the analyses of social practices. Inspired by actor-network theory the paper proposes to analyse the role of urban greenspace in everyday practices as actant functions performed by the greenspace and its elements. The question is which roles green areas play in people's lives and in the community. The study presented in this paper shows that urban green areas are included in everyday life as spaces for free time and household flexibility. They serve a number of different social functions by providing spaces for solitude, for being together and for the experience of civic diversity. And the possibility of having experiences of nature and landscape become an integral part of urban life.

AB  - Variation in patterns of mating within and among plant populations can be impacted by habitat disturbance and have significant implications for offspring fitness. An understanding of this variation will inform predictions of seed genetic quality, benefiting ecological restoration through better seed-sourcing guidelines. We assessed mating system variation in six populations of tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala DC.), an iconic tree of significance to ecological restoration in Western Australia. A mixed mating system was observed with predominant outcrossing (t(m) = 0.76 +/- 0.05) and low biparental inbreeding (t(m)-t(s) = 0.03 +/- 0.02). We detected some evidence of increased inbreeding in a naturally fragmented population (t(m)-t(s) = 0.10 +/- 0.04) and in a disturbed urban remnant (t(m) = 0.52 +/- 0.12), including a family with complete selfing. However, most variation in outcrossing rate occurred among individuals within populations (82%), rather than among populations (2.6%) or among groups of populations defined by fragmentation or disturbance (15.4%). Genetic diversity was not consistently lower in offspring from fragmented, smaller and/or disturbed populations. These data reinforce the importance of sourcing seeds from multiple trees for ecological restoration, and emphasise that tuart's mating system and the genetic diversity of offspring is robust to some habitat disturbance and/or fragmentation.

AB  - The knowledge of the urban air quality represents the first step to face air pollution issues. For the last decades many cities can rely on a network of monitoring stations recording concentration values for the main pollutants. This paper focuses on functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to investigate multiple pollutant datasets measured over time at multiple sites within a given urban area. Our purpose is to extend what has been proposed in the literature to data that are multisite and multivariate at the same time. The approach results to be effective to highlight some relevant statistical features of the time series, giving the opportunity to identify significant pollutants and to know the evolution of their variability along time. The paper also deals with missing value issue. As it is known, very long gap sequences can often occur in air quality datasets, due to long time failures not easily solvable or to data coming from a mobile monitoring station. In the considered dataset, large and continuous gaps are imputed by empirical orthogonal function procedure, after denoising raw data by functional data analysis and before performing FPCA, in order to further improve the reconstruction.

AB  - In the context of a global food system that has given rise to widespread concerns for food security and sustainability, reformative efforts have emerged, expanded and multiplied worldwide. To enhance understanding of the multi-faceted nature of this food movement and its scope for convergence and consolidation, in this article we propose frame alignment and alliance-building as a theoretical and analytical framework. Using New York City as a case study, we explore how school food reform may act as a particularly powerful platform for coalescing the interests and goals of diverse food system actors. We conclude with a call to interrogate school food and other reform activities with specific attention to the opportunities they pose for finding 'convergence in diversity' - in other words, for aligning the diverse and often fragmented efforts of the 'food movement' around an integrated and shared agenda with heightened potential for impact.

AB  - This study was conducted in a secondary urban patch of dry semideciduous forest in the campus of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais state. The stratum was sampled in 15 plots of 5 x 5 m, where all individuals with height >= 1 m and dbh < 5 cm (dbh: diameter at breast height at 1.30 m) were measured. We sampled 487 individuals belonging to 45 species. The species of greatest importance value were the exotic Syzygium jambos (22.06%) and the pioneer Miconia latecrenata (14.75%). The Shannon diversity index (H') was 2.65 nats.ind(-1) and the Pielou evenness (J) was 0.69. The pioneer group was the most important ecological group of species (57.7% of species and 41.1% of individuals). The significant density of the exotic species S. jambos, the low species diversity, and the high density of the pioneer group indicate a tree community with difficulties to progress to more advanced stages.

AB  - Urban areas currently have a severe shortage of recreational spaces. Many of the stream reservations are owned by the government, Therefore public use of those reservations located especially in urban areas, for recreational purposes can be considered as a fair use of the land. A 5 Kilometer stretch of Uruwal Oya adjacent to Gampaha Town was selected to implement a program to re-configure the riparian reservations into recreational areas while improving the stream to mitigate flooding. Basically the project was a landscape exercise to create a Recreational & Bio Corridor park along stream banks. Diversity of the landscape in aquatic and terrestrial interface of stream banks provided ideal conditions to grow different kinds of trees. Those paths also serve as environmentally sustainable transport for local communities by providing safe environment for walking. Out of 5 Km selected, recreational facilities with jogging path was introduced in the first 2 Km. Balance 3 Km was developed as a low cost nature trail. Due to public demand after the completion of the Gampaha Project two more similar projects are now in progress adjacent to towns of Kiribathgoda, Biyagama. Two more are in planning stage in Minuwangoda & Katana.

KW  - Peri-urban areas
KW  - Edgelines
AB  - The work of this article is to define the unit of landscape that corresponds to citrus crops in the valley and foothills of Malaga. To do this, two theoretical frameworks have been applied through an interrelated approach. Firstly, local development, identifying the elements of territorial capital and its components that are considered conditioning factors of said landscape and its dynamic. Secondly, the concepts of organic, industrial and post-industrial economics as contexts for said dynamic. The sources used are bibliographical, cartographical, statistical, urban planning documents and photographs. The results can be set out in the following terms
   : 1.-The presence of citrus crops in the Guadalhorce valley obeys the existence of three stages. The first was developed within the context of organic economics (between the 9th Century and approx 1960) during which time citrus crops were just another component in the multiple fruit and vegetable crop-growing located on the travertine rocks on the western bank of the valley. The destination of the product was self-sufficient supply and commercialisation in the city of Malaga. In the second stage (1860-1960), identifiable with the first faltering steps of the industrial economy in Malaga, monoculture areas appeared on the Guadalhorce terrace. A new agent organised these estates: urban capital which large owned estates and small tenant-run farms, changing the destination towards extra-provincial commercialisation, making the most of the proximity of the railway tracks. The third stage corresponded to the autarchic and developmentalist agrarian policies of Franco's regime, also linked to industrial capitalism, although with two different manifestations which give rise to two phases. In the first (1960-65), the policy of agrarian colonisation (institutional agent) brought about a change in the hydraulic system with channels transporting water drawn from three reservoirs built on the Guadalhorce river network. This led to an expansion of irrigated land (15,000 to 22,000 ha) under a mini estate tenant-farming structure. The expected focus was multiple fruit and vegetable crops, and growing feed for dairy cattle. In the second phase (1965-1985), the convergence of different problems with the appearance of another agent modified this situation. The problems included the poor adaptability of stepped-lands for irrigation; the low revenues of the farms; and competition for labour exercised by the urbanisation of capital and the coast. The new - private - agents were the Levante-based merchants who stimulated the growth of lemon crops to export to the European Union. The result: a landscape defined by citrus crops, planted in a regular formation, spread over terraces and glacis, and stretching towards the confluent valleys. The third phase, from 1985 to the present day, has been defined by the convergence of characteristic processes of post-industrial society with the incorrect interrelation of producer agents. Hence, low profitability combined with insufficient exploitation leads to a decrease in the cultivated land area. Simultaneously, proximity to the capital turns this into a peri-urban space, leading to the paradox that citrus trees become an icon (orange blossom), identified with a high environmental value that is attractive to potential residents. In addition, there has been expansion in commercial and transportation uses, and the location of edgelines.
   2.-As a consequence of these stages, currently the landscape of citrus fruits in the valley of Malaga is a fragmented landscape characteristic of peri-urban areas and threatened by the ambiguous treatment to which it is subject as a result of planning. Hence, the Urban Organisation Plan for Malaga (POTAUM) and the General Urban Plans (PGOU) for the different municipalities all assess citrus crops as highly valuable elements of identity, but the protection mechanisms in place have only a weak capacity to regulate the urban sprawl that is consuming them.
   3.-The proposals drawn up by the Guadalhorce Rural Development Centre (CEDER), on the other hand, provides an opportunity for these crops, by linking them with the possibilities of proximity farming. Hence, the proposal of a farm park would provide a place where landscape quality, the biodiversity of traditional irrigation systems and the profitability of farms would allow for the convergence of icon, sustainability and productive functionality.

AB  - Background: Increases in the abundance and distribution of ticks and tick borne disease (TBD) within Europe have been reported extensively over the last 10-20 years. Changes in climate, habitat management, economic patterns and changes in the abundance of hosts, particularly deer, may all have influenced this change to varying extents. Increasing abundances of tick populations in urban and peri-urban environments, such as parks, are of particular concern. In these sites, suitable habitat, wildlife hosts, tick populations, people and their pets may be brought into close proximity and hence may provide foci for tick infestation and, ultimately, disease transmission.
   Methods: The distribution and abundance of ticks were examined in an intensively used, peri-urban park. First the seasonal and spatial distribution and abundance of ticks in various habitat types were quantified by blanket dragging. Then the pattern of pet dog movement in the park was mapped by attaching GPS recorders to the collars of dogs brought to the park for exercise, allowing their walking routes to be tracked. Information about the dog, its park use and its history of tick attachment were obtained from the dog-owners.
   Results: Ticks were found predominantly in woodland, woodland edge and deer park areas and were least abundant in mown grassland. Tick infestation of dogs was a relatively frequent occurrence with, on average, one case of tick attachment reported per year for a dog walked once per week, but for some dogs walked daily, infestation 4-5 times per week was reported. All dogs appeared to be at equal risk, regardless of walk route or duration and infestation was primarily influenced by the frequency of exposure.
   Conclusions: In peri-urban green spaces, tick-biting risk for dogs may be high and here was shown to be related primarily to exposure frequency. While tick-biting is of direct veterinary importance for dogs, dogs also represent useful sentinels for human tick-exposure.

AB  - Forest restoration in urban areas often occurs in isolation from remnant forest, limiting the chances for recolonization by native species. Plants with bird-dispersed seeds can be particularly vulnerable to dispersal limitation and regeneration can be further impeded by non-native seed predators. We used a factorial experiment to investigate broadcast seeding as a method to reintroduce trees with large seeds and fleshy fruits into early successional forests. We assessed rates of seed and fruit loss, germination and seedling establishment in three seed treatments: (1) caging to exclude introduced mammalian seed predators; (2) removal of fleshy fruit pericarp; and (3) placing seeds in nutritionally enriched clay balls. Across all species (Beilschmiedia tawa, Elaeocarpus dentatus, and Litsea calicaris) seeds and fruits accessible to mammalian predators suffered significantly greater loss (58%) than those protected by cages (4%). However, seed and fruit loss in the presence of predators was reduced to only 35% across all species by the treatment combining the removal of fruit flesh and clay ball application to seeds. Establishment of B. tawa seedlings after 1 year was significantly enhanced by the clay ball treatment (12% of seeds sown vs. 6% without clay balls). Very low establishment rates were recorded for E. dentatus and L. calicaris. Broadcast seeding was found to be a viable method of improving regeneration of large-seeded late successional trees and may be a cost-effective alternative to planting saplings. Seedling establishment can be improved with fruit flesh removal and clay ball treatments, especially in the presence of mammalian seed predators.

AB  - Given widespread declines in pollinator communities and increasing global reliance on pollinator-dependent crops, there is an acute need to develop a mechanistic understanding of native pollinator population and foraging biology. Using a population genetics approach, we determine the impact of habitat and floral resource distributions on nesting and foraging patterns of a critical native pollinator, Bombus vosnesenskii. Our findings demonstrate that native bee foraging is far more plastic and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble bees forage further in pursuit of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives bee foraging distance. Furthermore, we find a negative impact of paved habitat and a positive impact of natural woodland on bumble bee nesting densities. Overall, this study reveals that natural and human-altered landscapes can be managed for increased native bee nesting and extended foraging, dually enhancing biodiversity and the spatial extent of pollination services.

AB  - Understanding patterns of natural forest expansion in rural regions under the influence of urbanization processes is crucial for integrated spatial planning across the urban-to-rural gradient. As a matter of fact, forest expansion is the only natural process that may counteract the consumption of the ecosystem capital and ecosystems services of rural lands due to uncontrolled urban sprawl. The paper addresses this topic in the paradigmatic case study of the countryside of Rome (Italy), characterized by counter dynamics of forest expansion and suburbanization. Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) is applied to classify the forest landscape structure twice (1974 and 2008) according to seven categories (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, branch) with different potential functional role as elements of a green infrastructure. Main findings are: (i) forest cover increased from 11% to 16% between 1974 and 2008; forest land uptake exceeds 4% of total study area, but shows a slower pace than the growth of built-up areas (10%); (ii) forest expansion has been to a large extent achieved by "sprawling" of islets (1.6% of the study area) along the stream network; (iii) more compact forest expansion has taken place on 0.2% of the study area in the form of additions to existing core areas or creation of new ones and (iv) the establishment of a network of protected areas nearby Rome has played a key role for the conservation and further expansion of core areas; yet, local loss of 1974 core areas stocks in a few protected areas indicates need of further law enforcement to ensure effective protection of the natural capital from degradation processes or even land conversion into built-up areas.
   Results calls for future in-depth investigations on the quality of newly created or maintained forest resource stocks associated to different spatial pattern structures. Integrated spatial planning strategies are outlined for the conservation of ecosystem capital and ecosystems services provided by forests, as major components of Rome's green infrastructure.

AB  - Arbovirus vector dynamics and spread are influenced by climatic, environmental and geographic factors. Major Chikungunya and Dengue fever outbreaks occurring the last 10 years have coincided with the expansion of the mosquito vector Aedes albopictus to nearly all the continents. We characterized the ecological (larval development sites, population dynamics, insemination and daily survival rates) and genetic (diversity, gene flow, population structure) features of two Aedes albopictus populations from distinct environments (rural and urban) on Reunion Island, in the South-West Indian Ocean. Microsatellite analysis suggests population sub-structuring Ae. albopictus populations. Two genetic clusters were identified that were significantly linked to natural versus urban habitats with a mixed population in both areas. Ae. albopictus individuals prefer urban areas for mating and immature development, where hosts and containers that serve as larval development sites are readily available and support high population densities, whereas natural environments appear to serve as reservoirs for the mosquito.

AB  - Popular communication practices allow reflecting on issues inherent to social and cultural differences as to how the market operates. In this regard, we emphasize how these experiences represent the cultural and social diversity, deepening gender issues and what strategies are used by people to overcome the limitations in the representation of these issues by the mass media. This problem is exemplified by the analysis of empirical experiments concerning the programming of community radio organized by popular social movements, and communication practices of the urban popular movement and the MST.

AB  - The study of some of the behavioral aspects of the main vector of Leishmania infantum chagasi Cunha & Chagas in the Americas, Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva), such as dispersion, population size, and vector survival rates, is important for the elucidation of the mechanisms of visceral leishmaniasis transmission. These parameters were studied by means of capture-mark-release-recapture experiments in an urban area of Campo Grande municipality, an endemic area of visceral leishmaniasis, situated in Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. Six capture-mark-release-recapture experiments were undertaken between November 2009 and November 2010 and once in January 2012 with a view to assessing the population size and survival rate of Lu. longipalpis. The insects were released in a peridomicile surrounded by 13 residences. The recaptures were undertaken with automatic light traps for four consecutive weeks after release in the surrounding area. In total, 3,354 sand flics were captured, marked, and released. The overall recapture rate during the capture-mark-release-recapture experiments was 4.23%, of which 92.45% were recaptured at the release site, indicating limited dispersal. The greatest distance recorded from the release site was 165 m for males and 241 m for females. The male daily survival rate, calculated on the basis of regressions from the numbers of marked recaptured insects during the 15 successive days after release was 0.897. The estimated male population size measured by the Lincoln Index was 10,947.127. Though Lu. longipalpis presented a limited dispersion the physical barriers typical of urban environments did not prevent the sand flies from flying long distances.

AB  - The objective was to identify the reproductive phenology and the pollination and dispersal syndromes of understory species of Semi-deciduous Dry Forest. The work was carried out from May 2010 to May 2011 in a forest fragment, about 29 hectares, localized in Catalao city, Goias State, Brazil. The phenological phases were observed weekly along a transect at 1000m. Pollination and dispersion syndromes were determined through literature data, and theses data were linked to phenology. The flowering proportion reached the peak (43,13%) in December 2010 (rainy) and fruiting (30%) in September 2010 (dry). Acanthaceae flowering peak in May 2010 and February 2011; Piperaceae peaked in October 2010 and Rubiaceae in December 2010. Fruiting in the Acanthaceae occurred during the dry period and the beginning of the rainy season, with the highest incidence in October 2010, Piperaceae reached their peak in May 2011, while in the Rubiaceae, it went on for 11 months, with the highest incidence being in March 2011. Two Acanthaceae and one Piperaceae species not fruited, but all species presented flowering. Pollination syndromes found were Ornithophily, peaking in May 2010, Melittophily, in October 2010, and Psycophily, in January 2011. Dispersal syndromes found were Anemochoric, with a higher incidence in October 2010, and Ornithocoric with two peaks, one in July 2010 and other in May 2011. The year-long presence of flowering and/or fruiting species contributes to the survival and dynamics of the community studied, because these species play an important role maintaining bees and birds in the fragment, which are important vectors of pollination and dispersal, respectively. Considering the rapid loss of the Cerrado vegetation in recent times and the study site to be a fragment localized inside the urban environment, the conservation of the green area becomes important, regardless of its small size, due to the important ecological processes that lie therein, as portrayed in this study.

AB  - The frequency of parasitism of the European mistletoe, Viscum album L. subsp. album, in the city of Lodz, a typical major city in Poland, was investigated. The infection prevalence and intensity of the mistletoe Viscum album subsp. album on its main host, Acer saccharinum as a function of host size was also investigated. The parasite showed a strong preference for alien, planted tree species (i.e. A. saccharinum, Populusxcanadensis and Robinia pseudoacacia). In 2009-2011, V. album subsp. album was observed on 28 host taxa of trees and shrubs, which represents the highest diversity of host trees in a single locality in the Poland. Within the studied area 2147 trees were infested by mistletoe. The distribution of mistletoes (V. album subsp. album) among A. saccharinum hosts is significantly aggregated. The intensity of mistletoe infection in the silver maple trees was affected by the individual tree characteristics, such as the height of the tree. The overall level of aggregation as indicated by the variance to mean ratio of mistletoe numbers per host fell within the midrange of values found in other published studies of host-mistletoe interactions. The higher mistletoe infection prevalence in taller trees results from differential dispersal of mistletoe seeds to tall trees as well as differential survival of established mistletoes on tall trees. The incidence of mistletoe was higher in city centre (zone of high density development) than it was on the outskirts of a city (outer marginal zone). It was found that the abundant occurrence of mistletoe was recorded in the stands of increased nitrogen input, while other stands have little or no mistletoe infection present. Thus, this mistletoe species uses both passive and active uptake, which may be a selective advantage in a nutrient-poor environment or on a nutrient-deficient host species.

AB  - Over the past decade, Europe's Water Framework Directive (WFD) has prompted a large amount of ecological research aiming at establishing river typologies and ecological indicators in member States. Yet, the lack of robust bioindicators in Europe's overseas regions arguably reflects minimal knowledge of the distribution patterns of aquatic species in the Community's outermost areas. Specifically, there has been no published classification of rivers for any European overseas region. Fifty-one sites were sampled for benthic invertebrates and environmental variables (land-cover, physical habitat, and water chemistry) in Guadeloupe, French Lesser Antilles. Redundancy analysis and k-means clustering were used to bring out spatial patterns in species composition in relation to environmental conditions. Our results highlighted the importance of land cover and geomorphology in delineating three ecological sub-regions (clusters) for freshwater invertebrates. Deviation from predictable community structure only occurred when river sites were subjected to harsh water chemistry alterations (urban runoff, wastewaters). Changes in species richness did not detect environmental stress efficiently within a given sub-region, probably because most sites are naturally species-poor due to the insular context and/or because disturbance is often weak. However, differences existed between clusters in terms of species identity and numerical dominance. Our a posteriori typology of sites was compared to local a priori expert opinion of river health, in an attempt to better characterize the network of survey sites, and to target sites for reference conditions.

AB  - Urbanisation introduces deep changes in habitats, eventually creating new urban ecosystems where ecological functions are driven by human activities. The higher frequency of some phenotypes in urban vs rural/wild areas has led to the assumption that directional selection in urban habitats occurs, which may thereby favour some behavioural and physiological traits in urban animal populations compared to rural ones. However, empirical evidence of directional selection on phenotypic traits in urban areas remains scarce. In this study we tested whether eumelanin-based colouration could be linked to survival in two urban populations of the feral pigeon Columba livia. A number of studies in different cities pointed out a higher frequency of darker individuals in more urbanised areas compared to rural ones. To investigate whether directional selection through survival on this highly heritable trait could explain such patterns, we conducted mark-recapture studies on two populations of feral pigeons in highly urbanized areas. We predicted that darker coloured individuals would exhibit higher survival and/or philopatry (integrated into local survival') than paler coloured ones. No difference in local survival was found between adults of different colouration intensities. However, on one site, we found that darker juveniles had a higher local survival probability than light ones. Juvenile local survival on that site was also negatively correlated with the number of chicks born. This suggests the existence of colour- and/or density-dependent selection processes acting on juvenile feral pigeons in urban environments, acting through differential mortality and/or dispersal.

AB  - Beijing, the capital city of China, has been developing the subway systems over the past two decades in fast pace. The latest round of expansion came after the successful Olympic Games in 2008, and the subways stretches to the city outskirts as well as to adjacent counties. The alluvial fans of ancient Yongding River located in the southwest of Beijing area present great challenges to the tunnelling by tunnel boring machine (TOM) in urban environment. Consisting mainly of different strata of pebbles with the ground water table generally below the tunnel alignments, the unstable ground is very sensitive to disturbances. Frequent occurrences of cobbles and boulders are dealt with by TBMs with special features.
   The earth pressure balance machine (EPBM) was chosen for Beijing Metro Line 10 Lot 11 tunnelling after considering the limitations under city environment as well as experiences from projects under similar ground conditions in other cities. The foam injection and conditioning are important tunnelling techniques in the application of EPBM to a ground which is more typical for the slurry type TBM. The arrangement of cutting tools was also adjusted according the changing of ground conditions.
   This paper describes the technical details of the EPBM employed in the pilot drive in the project, the operation measurements applied in the construction. The actual TOM performance and ground movement monitoring results are also presented and discussed. After achieving fast and safe pilot drive, some recommendations on tunnelling were given and adjustments of TOM were made. Then second TBM and pilot TOM started the drives which undercross the area with stringent settlement control requirements.

AB  - The People's Mic is a new genre of political speech. In Occupy Wall Street (OWS) general assemblies, this tactile media for public deliberation was integral to embodying new political community across American cities in a globally oriented movement of the squares. Whether or not OWS has exemplified direct democracy per se, the People's Mic has cultivated new forms of democratic charisma between previously disaggregated constituencies-a "leaderful charisma", with historical roots in pious American oratorical traditions ("hallowed speech") and more recent movements for intercultural solidarity building (global justice, horizontalist, feminist, etc.). In this article, I signal how the People's Mic atavistically conjured and resembled the American town hall meeting in a contemporary and heterogeneous US frontier assembly. Before its strategic incapacitation, the Occupy movement's widespread use of People's Mic served to undermine the authority of private-public monopolies and to place a check on mounting police repression of urban space.

AB  - Understanding the specific qualities of dynamic factors that shape how urban environments work is important to analyzing these environments effectively. Prominent among these factors is the movement of people and the patterns or trends that emerge from that movement over time. In order to better study movement as a dynamic factor in how urban spaces work an academic project titled Sen-Sys (for its use of personal GPS sensors to map dynamic urban systems) was designed and implemented to a limited degree over the course of a semester to produce a movement-based model in which the proportions of urban areas are dynamically distorted to reflect areas of high and low occupation to reflect moment-to-moment spatial behavior and visual elements are generated to reflect recurring trends in movement over of time. This paper provides an overview of Sen-Sys, frames it in relation to similar existing work and discusses it's conceivable strengths, limitations and directions for future development.

AB  - To better understand and manage complex systems like ecosystems it is critical to know the relative contribution of the system components to the system function. Ecologists and social scientists have described a diversity of ways that individuals can be important; This paper makes two key contributions to this research area. First, it shows that throughflow (T-j), the total energy or matter entering or exiting a system component, is a global indicator of the relative contribution of the component to the whole system activity. It is global because it includes the direct and indirect exchanges among community members. Further, throughflow is a special case of Hubbell status or centrality as defined in social science. This recognition effectively joins the concepts, enabling ecologists to use and build on the broader centrality research in network science. Second, I characterize the distribution of throughflow in 45 empirically-based trophic ecosystem models. Consistent with theoretical expectations, this analysis shows that a small fraction of the system components are responsible for the majority of the system activity. In 73% of the ecosystem models, 20% or less of the nodes generate 80% or more of the total system throughflow. Four or fewer nodes are required to account for 50% of the total system activity and are thus defined as community dominants. 121 of the 130 dominant nodes in the 45 ecosystem models could be classified as primary producers, dead organic matter, or bacteria. Thus, throughflow centrality indicates the rank power of the ecosystems components and shows the concentration of power in the primary production and decomposition cycle. Although these results are specific to ecosystems, these techniques build on flow analysis based on economic input-output analysis. Therefore these results should be useful for ecosystem ecology, industrial ecology, the study of urban metabolism, as well as other domains using input-output analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mexican temperate forests show a high species diversity as well as endemisms; therefore, the development of strategies for their conservation is a priority. Studies on their natural regeneration are crucial in order to understand the changes in species composition and for their restoration. The composition and abundance of seed rain and seed bank was analyzed during a year (dry and rainy seasons included), with the objective to evaluate their contribution to natural regeneration in temperate forests (Quercus spp., Abies religiosa and Pinus hartwegii forests) in the Magdalena river basin (MRB). Particularly, richness and quantity of diaspores in the seed rain, and the richness and quantity of seedlings in the seed bank were quantified. Comparison was carried out between them and also with respect to the extant vegetation. Richness resulted higher in the seed rain, with an important fraction of herbaceous, shrub and tree species characteristic of temperate forests. In the seed bank, two of the three main tree species in the area were absent, and there was a high abundance of herbaceous species characteristic of the early succession. The smallest similarity of species was found between the seed bank and the extant vegetation. Knowledge of the natural regeneration potential in the seed rain and in the seed bank allows for the consideration of certain species to be prescribed in management plans, with the aim to produce vegetation conditions similar to those of the original temperate forests.

AB  - A cluster of human plague cases occurred in the seaport city of Mahajanga, Madagascar, from 1991 to 1999 following 62 years with no evidence of plague, which offered insights into plague pathogen dynamics in an urban environment. We analyzed a set of 44 Mahajanga isolates from this 9-year outbreak, as well as an additional 218 Malagasy isolates from the highland foci. We sequenced the genomes of four Mahajanga strains, performed whole-genome sequence single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery on those strains, screened the discovered SNPs, and performed a high-resolution 43-locus multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis of the isolate panel. Twenty-two new SNPs were identified and defined a new phylogenetic lineage among the Malagasy isolates. Phylogeographic analysis suggests that the Mahajanga lineage likely originated in the Ambositra district in the highlands, spread throughout the northern central highlands, and was then introduced into and became transiently established in Mahajanga. Although multiple transfers between the central highlands and Mahajanga occurred, there was a locally differentiating and dominant subpopulation that was primarily responsible for the 1991-to-1999 Mahajanga outbreaks. Phylotemporal analysis of this Mahajanga subpopulation revealed a cycling pattern of diversity generation and loss that occurred during and after each outbreak. This pattern is consistent with severe interseasonal genetic bottlenecks along with large seasonal population expansions. The ultimate extinction of plague pathogens in Mahajanga suggests that, in this environment, the plague pathogen niche is tenuous at best. However, the temporary large pathogen population expansion provides the means for plague pathogens to disperse and become ecologically established in more suitable nonurban environments.
   IMPORTANCE Maritime spread of plague led to the global dissemination of this disease and affected the course of human history. Multiple historical plague waves resulted in massive human mortalities in three classical plague pandemics: Justinian (6th and 7th centuries), Middle Ages (14th to 17th centuries), and third (mid-1800s to the present). Key to these events was the pathogen's entry into new lands by "plague ships" via seaport cities. Although initial disease outbreaks in ports were common, they were almost never sustained for long and plague pathogens survived only if they could become established in ecologically suitable habitats. Although plague pathogens' ability to invade port cities has been essential for intercontinental spread, these regions have not proven to be a suitable long-term niche. The disease dynamics in port cities such as Mahajanga are thus critical to plague pathogen amplification and dispersal into new suitable ecological niches for the observed global long-term maintenance of plague pathogens.

AB  - Depression is the most common mental illness worldwide, and although aspects of the social environment, including social capital, have been linked to depression, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we assessed whether (1) network and psychosocial dimensions of individual social capital were each associated with depressive symptoms, and (2) the association varied according to the location of the capital, i.e., outside or inside a person's neighbourhood. The current study used data from the Montreal Neighbourhood Networks and Healthy Ageing Study (MoNNET-HA). MoNNET-HA consisted of a representative sample of 2707 adults from 300 census tracts in the Montreal Metropolitan Area. The CESD-10 instrument was used to assess the presence of depressive symptoms with a cut off of more than three symptoms used to indicate depressive symptomatology. Name and position generator instruments were used to assess the existence of a core tie, core tie diversity, and network social capital both inside and outside the neighbourhood. Questions on generalized trust, trust in neighbours, and neighbourhood cohesion were used to assess psychosocial dimensions of social capital inside and outside the neighbourhood. Community and general group participation were also included as structural dimensions of social capital. Analyses adjusted for a range of socio-demographic and economic characteristics. Results from multilevel logistic regressions indicated that the core tie diversity as well as the psychosocial dimensions of generalized trust, trust in neighbours, and perceptions of neighbourhood cohesion reduced the likelihood of depressive symptoms in urban-dwelling adults. Network and psychosocial components of social capital within neighbourhood contexts should be considered when examining social capital and depressive symptoms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A long-term monitoring of the upper Vah River was carried out in order to evaluate evolution of water quality by means of ciliate taxocoenoses. One sampling station (Liskova) was located upstream of the pulp and paper mill in the town of RuA3/4omberok, while two stations (Bystra and Stankovany) were situated downstream of RuA3/4omberok. Benthic samples were collected three times a year at each station during 2004-2011. This long-term study enabled us to assemble a comprehensive checklist of ciliates recorded in the upper Vah, and to characterize and compare the ciliate communities in the investigated watercourse. The saprobic index and valency analysis of the ciliate communities allowed us to quantify organic input and to evaluate changes in the saprobity of the upper Vah. The saprobic index ranged from 2.45 to 3.66 corresponding to the quality classes II-IV. Further, there was a prevalence of the alpha- and beta-mesosaprobic levels, but during some periods the polysaprobic level increased along with the decrease of the beta-mesosaprobic level. Beside the organic pollution, toxic contaminations were also noticed several times in the studied watercourse. This was documented by a significant drop in the species diversity and abundance of ciliates as well as by various morphological malformations and movement disorders of ciliates and other microorganisms. However, the negative effect of toxic and/or organic pollution wore off relatively quickly, indicating a good self-purification capability of the river.

AB  - The Occupy movement in Spain, locally known as the May 15 movement (15M), singularly developed throughout 2011 into a network of local neighborhood "popular assemblies." Over one hundred assemblies cropped up in Madrid alone. This article explores the conceptual and infrastructural work invested by the assemblies in the production of a particular experience of neighborhood (barrio). The barrio has become the centerpiece of the assemblies' political and geographical imagination. We offer here an ethnographic account of how the work of assembling is constitutive of a new experience of relationality, which assembly-goers refer to as "making neighbors." One makes neighbors through processes of deambulation and through an investment in the rhythmic and atmospheric production of space. The neighbor fares thus as an atmospheric person. Further, in this guise it has become both a model of and a model for political citizenship expressive of a right to the city. People's exploration of the question, "What is a neighbor?" offers an ethnographic case study on the invention of novel forms of social relations and political values in an urban commons-on the rise of the urban persona of the neighbor as a social-cum- political experimenter. Value, then, as an experimental form.

AB  - Background: Temperature and humidity strongly affect the physiology, longevity, fecundity and dispersal behavior of Aedes aegypti, vector of dengue fever. Contrastingly, the statistical associations measured between time series of mosquito abundance and meteorological variables are often weak and contradictory. Here, we investigated the significance of these relationships at different time scales.
   Methods and Findings: A time series of the adult mosquito abundance from a medium-sized city in Brazil, lasting 109 weeks was analyzed. Meteorological variables included temperature, precipitation, wind velocity and humidity. As analytical tools, generalized linear models (GLM) with time lags and interaction terms were used to identify average effects while the wavelet analysis was complementarily used to identify transient associations. The fitted GLM showed that mosquito abundance is significantly affected by the interaction between lagged temperature and humidity, and also by the mosquito abundance a week earlier. Extreme meteorological variables were the best predictors, and the mosquito population tended to increase at values above 18 degrees C and 54% humidity. The wavelet analysis identified non-stationary local effects of these meteorological variables on abundance throughout the study period, with peaks in the spring-summer period. The wavelet detected weak but significant effects for precipitation and wind velocity.
   Conclusion: Our results support the presence of transient relationships between meteorological variables and mosquito abundance. Such transient association may be explained by the ability of Ae. aegypti to buffer part of its response to climate, for example, by choosing sites with proper microclimate. We also observed enough coupling between the abundance and meteorological variables to develop a model with good predictive power. Extreme values of meteorological variables with time lags, interaction terms and previous mosquito abundance are strong predictors and should be considered when understanding the climate effect on mosquito abundance and population growth.

AB  - Empiric quantification of human mobility patterns is paramount for better urban planning, understanding social network structure and responding to infectious disease threats, especially in light of rapid growth in urbanization and globalization. This need is of particular relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used similar to 2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility, giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (similar to 80%) movements occurred within 1 km of an individual's home. Potential hourly contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally unstructured. Only up to 38% of the tracked participants showed a regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic's final size and effective reproduction number by 20% in comparison to scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies, particularly within resource-poor urban environments.

TI  - Multidimensional Israeliness and Tel Aviv's Tachanah Merkazit: Hearing Culture in a Polyphonic Transit Hub
T2  - CITY & SOCIETY
LA  - English
AB  - Israel's heated public debate over the socio-political implications of increasing demographic diversity plays out with special prominence in Tel Aviv, home to large minority citizen populations and a destination for foreign workers and refugees from Asia and Africa. The city's New Central Bus Station, or tachanah merkazit, is a transit hub and commercial complex in which multiple ethnic groups enact aesthetic and cultural dimensions of Israeli urban and national identity in flux. This paper presents a sensory ethnography of the tachanah: sonic and musical expressions of "local" and "global" Israeliness are analyzed against a backdrop of near-constant motion and transit. The somatic and ideological dimensions of movement enable Jewish Israelis, minority citizens and foreigners to assimilate sounds of culture within the tachanah at deeply-felt, personal levels. The tachanah's sonic activity is inherently political, having the potential to impact collective identity and civic reality in Tel Aviv and across Israel.

AB  - Recent research on the network of memorial landmarks of Slovenian literary culture has proven that today this network powerfully marks the cultural landscape of Slovenian territory. In the broader context of European cultural nationalism, the gradual formation of such networks can be understood as a semiotic appropriation of (national) space connected with the canonization of a handful of prominent "cultural saints" and numerous men of letters of lesser stature. In Slovenian territory, the formation of the network began in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was closely connected to the two key figures of Slovenian poetry from the early nineteenth century: Valentin Vodnik (1758-1819) and France Preseren (1800-1849). This article treats their canonization and especially the installation of their statues into the public space of Ljubljana, the capital of the Habsburg province of Carniola, in 1889 and 1905. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, monuments became an important symbolic battlefield for the Slovenian national movement, which was striving for greater cultural and political autonomy. In the broader picture, Ljubljana turns out to be a paradigmatic example of how the actual battle for the semiotic nationalization of the city was fought through the occupation of public space by statues of "great men of literature." Through this logic, the Carniolan capital would finally become a spiritual metropolis of "Slovenedom," densely populated with appropriate symbols.

KW  - Luang Prabang
AB  - Numerous studies of tourism in Luang Prabang World Heritage site in Lao Peoples Democratic Republic are critical of the perceived impacts on heritage values of the city. Criticisms relate to the incursion of new buildings into the historic core, the loss of older dwellings, increases in foreigners renting and restoring properties as guest houses and restaurants and the movement of locals out of the historic core. Other criticisms relate to the effects on community support for the monastic communities that create the sacred and ritual geography of the city, the loss of community diversity within the World Heritage boundaries and increasing uniformity as the development of tourism continues apace. While our research does not challenge these observations it raises questions about the type of analyses and conclusions reached. Too often heritage, tourism and community are considered self-evident and bounded entities, with tourism something faintly alien that causes disruption to the urban fabric of Luang Prabang and, consequently, to the values for which it was inscribed. We propose a different way of conceptualising the relationship between heritage, community and tourism by examining the interaction between global, regional and local mobilities in the context of globalisation and under the aegis of modernity.

AB  - When attempting to address the environmental problems of a catchment, it is important to consider changes in a long-term environmental context. However, the long-term data on the state of the environment that are required for such an examination are rarely documented. Such data collection typically requires several years of investigation and observation. In addition, as there may be a significant time lag between the occurrence of a phenomenon and its cause, subsequent environmental investigations of changing animal and plant states scaling up to 5 years may be inadequate. We conducted a long-term analysis of the environmental changes in five sub-catchments of the Nagara River, Japan, assessing a period of 30 years, using a questionnaire survey approach involving local communities. Four sub-catchments of the Yoshida River were also analyzed for comparison. In addition, we attempted to clarify the relationship between various environmental factors and the space-time response of animals and plants. The survey included eight topics: assumed information, hydrological characteristics, habitat conditions for living things, forest state, land cover conditions, river awareness, free-entry information, and respondent information. Our method also has academic significance in that it validates the environmental agent extraction technique using a questionnaire survey. Our results identify management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss due to climate change. Forest management and human activities should be undertaken with care, and the environmental context going forward into the next century should be considered for integrated catchment management. Elsewhere, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, and/or efforts to provide corridors to ease species movements may be necessary at the global level.

AB  - Dispersive behaviour in birds is shaped by a set of different external factors (climate, human pressure, territory quality), as well as by internal constraints (reproductive strategy, sex, age, competitive abilities). Natal and breeding dispersal was studied in the migratory population of the Mute Swan Cygnus olor in Poland. The species showed male-biased natal dispersal with mean dispersal distance of 99.7 +/- 20.0 km for males and 17.7 +/- 5.4 km for females. Consistently, larger proportion of female swans showed natal philopatry, when compared with males (36.4% vs. 9.1%). The dispersal distance has shortened over the last three decades. This tendency prevailed in males and was associated with reduction in annual migration distance due to milder winters and adaptation for wintering in urban areas. Analysis of breeding dispersal showed that only 12.3% of breeding attempts were associated with changing territories (N = 945). Breeding dispersal distance was female-biased (0.66 +/- 0.19 km for females vs. 0.35 +/- 0.14 for males; N = 316 individuals). Occurrence of mate-switching and poor reproductive success were positively associated with probability of dispersal, but moving to a new territory did not increase breeding output in a season following dispersal event. Dispersive behaviour in the Mute Swan may be perceived as a part of species-specific ecological flexibility, allowing individuals to adjust to the changing conditions at the breeding grounds.

AB  - Stream conservation and restoration strategies commonly focus on preserving extant riparian forest and restoring riparian habitat. Though these practices are beneficial to stream habitat, they may not suffice to restore stream condition in catchments heavily influenced by intensive land use. To evaluate this hypothesis, we measured invertebrate populations in 12 streams affected by different land-use types (cultivated, developed, forested and grassland). Within each stream, we compared reaches with and without riparian buffers of remnant mature forest. Within each reach, we calculated the relative abundance of individuals from the insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (%EPT) and assessed specific conductance, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature and substratum composition. Forested catchments had the highest %EPT (average 23.8) followed by grassland (16.1), cultivated (1.96) and developed (0.31). Reaches with forested buffers present were not associated with higher %EPT in forested, cultivated or developed catchments. In grassland catchments, however, %EPT was about eightfold higher in reaches with forested buffers than those without. High values of %EPT were associated with large stream substratum and low specific conductance and temperature, which were most common in forested catchments. Developed and cultivated catchments did not follow this pattern, %EPT being uniformly low, even where abiotic conditions were similar to forested catchments. These results confirm that intensive urban and cultivated land uses at the catchment scale degrade stream biological communities. They also indicate that patchy forested riparian corridors, as found in many restoration projects, are probably insufficient to mitigate severe, large-scale biological degradation.

TI  - Activising Space: The Spatial Politics of the 2011 Protest Movement in Israel
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - In summer 2011, Israel was swept by unprecedented political protest as multiple encampments occupied streets and mass rallies were held weekly in Tel Aviv and other cities. The article focuses on the spatial politics of this protest, analysing the particular strategies it used to activise urban public space. The protest initially reflected a specific urban context and limited agendanamely, the lack of affordable housing in Tel Aviv. However, as it materialised and expanded in public space, it also became more inclusive, incorporating more marginalised publics and places, addressing long-standing socio-spatial inequalities between Israel's centre' and periphery', and advancing a message of social justice'with the noted exception of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. The analysis of the Israeli protest foregrounds some dynamics that it shares with other global' protests in 2011, from Tahrir Square to Occupy Wall Street, pointing to the spatial politics of centrality, multiplicity and media-space', a mutually enforcing relationship between physical public space and mainstream and social media.

AB  - In the recent occupied squares movement (including the Arab Spring uprisings and the worldwide Occupy movement), space commoning was a process that reinvented space-as-commons through collective action: space both as a good to be shared and as a form of organizing shared practices. This paper explores such processes of urban commoning and the ways in which they are connected to emerging communities in movement as well as to the creation of new kinds of political subjectivation. Subjects belonging to such communities tend to escape dominant classifications of political and social identities and to participate in acts that create urban threshold spaces. Thus, liminality characterizes both the subjects and the spaces of the occupied squares movement.

KW  - DISCOURSE
AB  - This paper engages with the progressive politics of climate change and resource constraint developed by the Transition 'movement' which looks to develop a positive local politics of the transition to a low carbon economy and society. At the heart of this politics is a vision of economic localisation rooted in a geographical imaginary of market towns with agricultural hinterlands. Consequently, the question of how the Transition model can be applied in urban settings has not been clear, leading to the implicit assumption that urban Transition initiatives are more complex and difficult. In contrast, this paper argues that the plasticity of Transition politics means that, in some cases, an urban context might be more productive for the development of Transition initiatives because it allows for a greater diversity of political action as well as providing a density of networks and resources that can be critical for the survival of grassroots interventions.

AB  - Surveys of ash trees along the major motorway routes leading away from the city of Moscow during July 2013 indicated that emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) was well established up to 235 km west of the city and 220 km to the south. Over the last 4 years, the beetle has spread in these directions at an average rate of 30-41 km year(-1), which cannot be explained by natural dispersal alone and implies that human-assisted transport is contributing significantly to the spread of the pest, probably via the hitchhiking of adult beetles on vehicles. The European common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is uncommon in Moscow and in the boreal forests to the west and north, but those trees that are present suggest that this species is not killed as rapidly by A. planipennis as North American ash species and that it may need to suffer a degree of stress before it succumbs rapidly to infestation. Nevertheless, A. planipennis is a major threat to F. excelsior, and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality. The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe.

AB  - Relatively few studies have investigated mistletoe infestation of tree species in urban settings, and even fewer considered infestation of alien tree species. Here, mistletoe infestation incidence and intensity were studied in Durban, South Africa. The relationship of infestation to tree CBH and height was examined in detail for the mistletoe species Erianthemum dregei. Although E. dregei is known to have a wide range of host taxa, we report E. dregei infestation on 27 new host species for the first time. E. dregei occurred on 30 host species with a preference for the alien host tree Melia azedarach in our study area. The relationship between infestation and CBH indicated that the trees (irrespective of species) of >= 200 cm were more susceptible to the mistletoe attack. The implications of this pattern, as well as those of high host diversity and especially of infestation of alien trees are discussed in a conservation perspective.

AB  - Podocnemis unifilis is found throughout the Amazon basin, where it has been harvested as a highly valued source of animal protein since precolonial times. Harvesting rates are also lower during the flooding season due to the availability of habitat for turtle dispersal. This study investigated the effects of the hydrological cycle and human impacts on the abundance and population structure of the species on the middle Xingu River between September 2007 and March 2008. The highest density of basking turtles was recorded during the flooding period, while the number of specimens captured in hand nets was greater during low water. Density and capture rates varied positively with increasing distance from Altamira, the study area's main urban center. Consequently, the abundance of P. unifilis was affected negatively by proximity to urban centers. In the Great Bend area of the Xingu River, densities and abundance were lower, and the mean size of the animals was smaller. These results likely reflect the effects on local stocks of the presence of local gold-prospecting operations and, thus, more harvesting pressure on the P. unifilis population. The sex ratio was biased in favor of males (1.90:1), possibly as a result of preferential harvesting of females, which are larger in size than males and are often laden with eggs. Further long-term studies are needed to better understand the impact of anthropogenic pressures on long-lived organisms such as turtles. In addition, such information would aid the ecological sustainability of turtles in the Amazon Basin that provide rural communities with subsistence resource.

AB  - The result of the 2009 Iranian presidential election sparked protests in the streets of Tehran. This article focuses on the spatial logic of crowd occurrence and the role played by protest location in its effectiveness. Although the symbolism of space is pronounced in crowd studies from Gustav Le Bon to Charles Tilly, there is a lack of attention to the logic of crowd culmination and movement in relation to actual physical urban spaces. There are new studies examining how public space is utilized during times of political turmoil; these studies, however, focus mostly on the specific place of protest, and do not examine crowd dynamics in the city at large. This article, in contrast, contributes to the understanding of the spatial logic of mass occurrence by examining the city structure as a whole. It argues that the location of a public space in a city is far more important than its symbolic connotations, and that, following Tilly, the impact of crowds depends not only upon the what he calls WUNC equation (representing Worthiness, Unity, Numbers and Commitment of a crowd), but also on the spatial characteristics of the place of the protest.

AB  - Although the social movement that crossed race, class, sexuality and gender lines before 2008 was exemplary, there is now another type of social movement that has emerged. This movement, led by conservative right wing groups, has been stirring racial divisions by using the economic crisis to scapegoat immigrants. At the same time, the promises of the Obama Administration have not been kept. Instead, under this administration's immigration policies close to one million deportations have occurred nationally, the implementation of a Secure Communities program has led to arbitrary arrests for minor offenses and violated the due process rights of both citizens and noncitizens, and an existing program of employee immigration-status verification has led to as many as 19,000 people that have been mistakenly identified as being deportable. The ingredients of a social movement are still visible but the strategies have shifted to local organizing efforts that, in California, have resulted in legislation supporting: cities opting out of E-Verify, the right of AB540 students to attend college with financial aid, the right of people without a driver's license to stop the impounding of their cars, and the establishment of a pilot program designed to protect undocumented workers who pay state income taxes. This paper focuses on these various trends and the prospects for future systemic change.

AB  - Contemporary struggles and revolts in Athens during the economic crisis sprang from existing social relations and sowed seeds that are still growing day by day. In this paper we roam the Athenian metropolis, attempting to illuminate those aspects that prepared the ground for contemporary urban conflict. Following Lefebvre's analysis, we consider space dialectically, as a projection of society on the ground. Through a tour of Athens's particular urban characteristics, we analyze and compare the territorial spread of the December 2008 revolt and the contemporary mobilizations against austerity measures. We argue that Athens experienced the December 2008 revolt and the subsequent crisis struggles in its own distinctive way, which has similarities to but also notable differences from other recent urban conflicts such as the US Occupy movement, the Spanish indignados movement, and the Arab Spring.

AB  - Molecular methods are commonly used to investigate cryptic populations that are difficult to locate or observe directly. The population dynamics of many subterranean organisms have been overlooked, at least in part, as a result of the absence of appropriate molecular markers. Recent studies in African mole-rats have raised questions about the modes of dispersal and mate acquisition. In the present study, we apply a suite of 25 microsatellite markers to test the overground/underground dispersal hypotheses. Using these data, we also apply an approach to estimate population size and look for signal of demographic expansion or contraction. The genetic data suggest that the same breeding population extends between locations (approximately 50km), with elevated inbreeding coefficients suggestive of some degree of isolation of the urban location. Low genetic differentiation between study sites supports the proposed high levels of vagility of dispersing individuals overground. We find a signal of long-term population decline of Bathyergussuillus in this region. Their adherence to mesic conditions potentially recommends B.suillus to be of utility in monitoring the proposed climate-induced desiccation of the Western Cape. Of potential interest is the discovery of a second divergent population at the rural location, with microsatellite data suggesting contemporary reproductive isolation and a mitochondrial divergence putatively dated at approximately 0.6 Mya.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - In recent years, rapid urban growth accompanied by a significant impact on the environment has occurred in several parts of the world From 8 to 9 August 2007, torrential rain convective systems passed through northeastern Xi'an, China. The amount of rainfall exceeded 200 mm throughout a broad area in the region. The largest flood event over the past 50 years resulted in a fatality and more than RMB 500 million in economic damage. One system used to study the movement of precipitation is the Davenport WSR-88D radar coverage that allows high quality characterization of the storm at fine spatial and temporal scales. Spatial distributions of rainfall combined with the degree of urbanization of individual basins are the dominant factors that determine the magnitude of runoff response. We explore the hydrologic response to the flood events from 8 to 9 August 2007, and the viable options to reduce urban runoff by increasing rainfall infiltration through model simulation. Results indicate that the schemes are effective elements for flood control in urban areas.

AB  - We report the status of alien species on Isla de Cedros, Mexico, and analyze the information from different years that together with a collaborative effort between academic biologists, Mexican governmental agencies, and local individuals has resulted in major information about the alien species on this island. We also report species richness of distinct endemic mammal species and the presence of feral dogs (Canis lupus familiaris Linnaeus), which is the principal problematic situation in this "Marine Priority Region." The possible origin of feral dogs could be the migratory movement of stray dogs to find food in the inner part of the island, first moving to garbage dumps, reproducing in the area, and later hunting goats (Capra aegagrus hircus Linnaeus) in packs. The combination of the high density of stray dogs, urban and industrial food garbage dumps, and the large number of marine resources scattered along the seashore made ideal conditions for the establishment of feral dog packs that are affecting native species. The island does not have any natural mammal predator, but the presence of feral species, dogs and cats (Felis silvestris catus Schreber), could disturb the occurrence of endemic fauna as it has happened on other islands in the world.

AB  - La Vega is located in the heart of Granada province, occupying the depression formed by the River Genil and its tributaries, with a vast flood plain that slopes gently to the west. It is part of the Intrabaetic Depression and is bordered to the north by a series of mountain ranges belonging to the Cordillera Subbetica system and to the south by the Sierra de Almijara and Sierra de Tejeda mountain ranges in the Cordillera Penibetica system. To the east, shaping the headlands of the depression, we find the Sierra Arana and Sierra Nevada, and to the west the Sierra Gorda, making way for the River Genil as it flows towards Loja.
   This article has been written on the back of fieldwork carried out by the author when drawing up the Vega de Granada Special Plan. The author conducted 30 interviews between May and November of 2011 with various entities representing the Vega de Granada area: farmers, farming associations, irrigation associations, the University of Granada, business associations, local councils, political parties and citizen platforms such as "Salvemos la Vega". In addition to the information obtained through these interviews, extensive work was conducted previously to compile sources on this issue.
   The result of these interviews and fieldwork is reflected in this article, which seeks mainly to offer synchronic and diachronic analysis raising the question of whether there is still time to conserve and revalue the agrarian heritage of La Vega de Granada. To do this, the key patrimonial and landscape values are identified (water channels, paths, poplar groves, agrarian and industrial architecture, rivers and streams, agricultural customs, etc.).
   The River Genil, the backbone of La Vega, flows from east to west in a complex river system that not only favoured the historic development of farming activity but also plays a fundamental role in the ecological balance of this area. In addition to the invaluable river system there is also a system designed and created to capture and harness water resources, both surface and subterranean, with a complex and intricate network of hydraulic connections. It encompasses systems to capture water, such as dams and wells, infrastructures to distribute water, such as channels and dividers, and associated constructions such as mills, troughs, fountains and cisterns; giving La Vega some of its hallmark features.
   As in other historically populated territories, La Vega de Granada became intensely populated in the age of Muslim domination as irrigation techniques were perfected. The agricultural plots were adapted to the uneven terrain, creating an irregular layout of plots supplied by a large complex network of water channels. This model of territorial occupation still exists today. There was a dense network of rural paths and drovers' roads linking different areas of La Vega, forming a complex grid. However, the integration of new transport infrastructures has not taken into account the peculiarities of La Vega's landscape. The impact of these infrastructures, particularly the roads, has been devastating as they break up the territory, marginalise the network of rural paths, foster real estate speculation for second homes and divide and sever the relationship between the population and La Vega, situating urban nuclei with their backs to it.
   The road network is still incomplete, badly organised and poorly signposted, mixing agricultural traffic with conventional traffic and without meeting the mobility demands of citizens commuting to the city for work purposes, or of farmers moving around with agricultural machinery using the once rural paths.
   The area immediately surrounding the city of Granada has been radically affected by this process, with tension decreasing the further we move away from the city. This space close to Granada has seen a progressive occupation of the land for non-agricultural uses (treatment plants, scrap metal plants, shopping centres), as well as multiple land parcelling responding to speculative real estate interests. Territorial impact is not only caused by the number of new residential properties built, but because the model of urbanisation has changed from vertical to horizontal, in the form of single-occupancy houses that require greater land availability.
   Poor local coordination means that the actions taken by all local councils in La Vega, in addition to the unilateral actions of the regional or state government, lead to the progressive decline of agricultural land. As if taking "bites out of the territory", each Local Council is managing its own space in La Vega in the absence of a supramunicipal capacity to work in conjunction with one another, or to organise planning and management so as to encompass and coordinate the different interests.
   In order to maintain its traditional agrarian landscape, La Vega must implement modern competitive agriculture. It must be reorganised on the basis of cooperatives encompassing large numbers of owners, as well as through differentiation, opting for organic farming, local farming, and joint commercialisation in different channels. These measures would seem to be inevitable in terms of offering alternatives to the competition faced from other thriving agricultures that are more flexible and innovative, such as the polytunnel crop farming seen in the neighbouring province of Almeria.
   Particular mention should be made of the tobacco drying structures and the beetroot factories, which are another hallmark feature of La Vega. These drying structures come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but most commonly they are long single-storey constructions with high ceilings and perforations that facilitate ventilation and the drying of tobacco leaves. Although there are still examples of brick buildings that are of great patrimonial value, such as El Cortijo del Alitaje in Pinos Puente and El Cortijo del Rector in Granada, the drying structures seen today represent an informal, functional and casual architecture, almost the product or chance and necessity, built to respond to growing demand starting in the 1950s when tobacco crops underwent strong growth in La Vega. These humble architectures, almost DIY jobs, use leftover materials and waste, timber, woodchip or bricks and manage to create elements with their own unique personality.
   The appearance of beetroot in La Vega in the early 20th Century, on the other hand, left a major mark on the landscape, with the installation of large-scale factories. The chimney stacks and distilling towers of these factories, of which there were up to 13, located around the railway tracks, stand out against the flat landscape of La Vega. Following the crisis in the beetroot industry in the 1930s, the majority of these factories were abandoned and ended up disappearing; others are still standing, such as the ones in San Isidro and La Inmaculada del Genil in Granada, La Vega in Atarfe and San Pascual in Pinos Puente, exponents of a hugely symbolic industrial heritage, which have now been converted to house other business activities or services.
   The values and landscapes that have shaped this peri-urban agricultural landscape, which is highly symbolic yet where tensions run high, have been amply reflected by cultural manifestations through the ages, from Al Jatib to Federico Garcia Lorca. The cathartic presence of Federico Garcia Lorca, born and killed in La Vega de Granada, reflects the powerful bond between landscape and culture, art and emotions: "I belong to the heart of La Vega", wrote Federico Garcia Lorca. Throughout the literary oeuvre of the universal poet and playwright we see brushstrokes of a landscape filled with poplar groves, water channels, paths, farmers, joy and sorrow, threats and hopes ... The hispanist Ian Gibson assures that the work of Lorca would not be the same without the references to the landscape that underscore his entire literary corpus.
   The article shows that La Vega de Granada moves in a constant duality of threats and hopes. Although it is possible to recognise the landscape of La Vega as an important element in the collective memory of the granadinos, it is impossible to disentangle it from the continual threats that urban development is inflicting upon the territory.
   We might conclude that there is still time. The article sets out a series of proposals that are being cautiously promoted by public administrations. The Regional Government of Andalucia is putting the finishing touches on a Special Organisation Plan for La Vega de Granada which should see the light of day soon and which, unlike previous plans, with little or no application, must be an instrument that fosters territorial protection and the revaluing of La Vega. However, without a doubt, citizen platforms such as "Salvemos la Vega" are working energetically as the greatest defenders and promoters of La Vega, through proposals such as ensuring it is declared a cultural asset (BIC status), Heritage Area, or the steps being taken with international organisations such as UNESCO, as well as activities and projects to revitalise the economy of La Vega.

AB  - It is the story of a radical student "Los Enfermos", which together with public transport workers in Sinaloa (Mexico) took to the fight against government authorities demanding better wages for the latter. The bus driver movement transcended those goals. This paper aims to reconstruct the history of the main urban social movement Sinaloa deployed in late twentieth century. Based on the proposals of social history to analyze four fundamental edges of a popular protest that led a group of students from the Autonomous University of Sinaloa were declared in the underground and from there launched their revolutionary struggle against the Mexican state. The aspects considered here are: a) the state sociopolitical environment, b) movement origins and development of truck driver, c) balances student labor struggle, and finally d) the political effects exerted on "Los Enfermos" the final outcome of the protest.

AB  - The two currently recognized species of kangaroo mice, Microdipodops megacephalus and M. pallidus, inhabit sandy soils of the Great Basin Desert in western North America. Given their habitat specificity and the fluctuating climate throughout the Pleistocene, kangaroo mice likely endured a turbulent biogeographic history that resulted in disjunct distributions and isolation of genetic lineages. Recent phylogenetic investigations using mitochondrial data have revealed several mitochondrial clades within this genus that may represent cryptic species. These mitochondrial clades are genetically unique, occupy relatively small distributions, and, as such, may be at an increased risk of extinction due to climate change and extensive recent habitat alteration. Herein, we apply haplotype network, population genetic, and historical demographic analyses to mitochondrial data of each Micropdipodops species and mitochondrial clade to assess conservation genetics within kangaroo mice. Results indicate that each mitochondrial clade is a distinct lineage with little to no gene flow occurring among clades. Additionally, historical demographic analyses support past population expansions and identify locations of past refugium for each distinct lineage. Although mitochondrial data indicate that the clades appear to be in approximate genetic equilibrium and have not suffered any extreme bottlenecks over time, there is still concern for the survival of smaller and more vulnerable Microdipodops subpopulations due to impending habitat threats in the Great Basin Desert.

AB  - The US national response to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks accelerated the adoption and refinement of a new repertoire of protest policing we call strategic incapacitation now employed by law enforcement agencies nationwide to police protest demonstrations. The occupation movement which formally began 17 September 2011 was the most significant social movement to utilise transgressive protest tactics in the United States in the last 40 years and posed a substantial challenge to law enforcement agencies. This research seeks to better understand the implementation of strategic incapacitation tactics through a detailed analysis of the policing of the first 2 months of Occupy Wall Street (OWS) protests in New York City. Original data for this study are derived from 2-week-long field observations made in New York City during the first and second month anniversaries of the OWS occupation in Zuccotti Park. These are supplemented by activist interviews, activist accounts posted on OWS websites, Facebook pages and Twitter feeds as well as news reports, official police documents, press releases and interviews with legal observers.

AB  - Rapid changes in global climate are likely to alter species assemblages and environmental characteristics resulting in novel ecosystems. The ability to predict characteristics of future ecosystems is crucial for environmental planning and the development of effective climate change adaptation strategies. This paper presents an approach for envisioning novel ecosystems in future climates. Focusing on riparian ecosystems, we use qualitative process models to predict likely abiotic and biotic changes in four case study systems: tropical coastal floodplains, temperate streams, high mountain streams and urban riparian zones. We concentrate on functional groups rather than individual species and consider dispersal constraints and the capacity for genetic adaptation. Our scenarios suggest that climatic changes will reduce indigenous diversity, facilitate non-indigenous invasion (especially C4 graminoids), increase fragmentation and result in simplified and less distinctive riparian ecosystems. Compared to models based on biota-environment correlations, process models built on mechanistic understanding (like Bayesian belief networks) are more likely to remain valid under novel climatic conditions. We posit that predictions based on species' functional traits will facilitate regional comparisons and can highlight effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and function. Ecosystems that have experienced similar modification to that expected under climate change (for example, altered flow regimes of regulated rivers) can be used to help inform and evaluate predictions. By manipulating attributes of these system models (for example, magnitude of climatic changes or adaptation strategies used), implications of various scenarios can be assessed and optimal management strategies identified.

AB  - As a rapidly developing Asian country, Turkey suffers from a lack of education about environmental issues and the absence of a widespread environmentalist movement that might exert pressure on the government to conserve its diminishing natural resources. Artists and cultural producers are trying to fill this gap by making works that speak to the issues threatening Turkey's environmental health. Rather than limiting environmental awareness to the country's educated urban elites, effective change can only be achieved at a mass level by involving the country's rural populations and recent urban immigrants, and by recognizing them as active agents in environmentalist struggles. An appeal to more far-reaching historical perspectives, traditional modes of knowledge and indigenous modes of subsistence may be required to build a coalition that can bridge ethnic, class and geographic divides. This article looks at the works of some Turkish contemporary artists and film-makers, including the xurban collective, Halil Altindere, Ruya Koksal, Osman Sisman and Ozlem Sariyildiz, whose works engage such strategies.

AB  - The Seneque/Riverstrahler model has been used to explore the effect of human-induced changes in drainage network morphology and land use on organic and nutrient pollutions, for the last 20 years and back to the 1890s and 1790s. With the development of human civilization, past environmental constraints differed compared to today. Research has sought to reconstruct (i) point sources (domestic and industrial), using statistics and archives from these periods, and (ii) diffuse sources via landscape and riverscape analysis based both on maps and agricultural statistics from the periods concerned. This study shows that a maximum of pollution occurred in the 1890s at the height of the industrial period, due more to the industrial load than to the domestic load. This substantial organic and nutrient pollution might have lasted up to very recently, when the Brussels Northern wastewater treatment plant began operation in 2007, significantly reducing the organic and nutrient load of the Zenne River, returning to a background pollution level assessed herein for the 1790s before industrialization expanded.

AB  - Introduction: The discussion about accessibility in urban environments is observed in several studies, but the vast majority focuses attention on structural elements and not the user. Objective: This study proposes a method of assessing urban environmental movement, from the point of view of its users, to identify the relationship between perceived barriers and facilitators in the environment movement and aspects of the body functions and structures and the users' participation in activities, which denotes the degree of accessibility of these people in this space. Method: It describes a case study in Belem, Para state, utilizing a method of assessing the perception of users, based on indicators of environmental factors, activity and participation, structure and functions of the body, highlighted by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health - ICF. Results: The main finding of this study indicates that people's perceptions about their environment directly influences the movement involved in their occupations. Conclusion: Studies with this content are relevant and necessary in our current society, because they reveal how changes in major urban centers influence the accessibility and involvement of people in their occupations, thereby directly interfering with their health, quality of life, and participation in society.

AB  - The spatial and temporal incidence of possum mortality on roads was monitored in Sydney's northern suburbs over a two-year period. In total, 217 road surveys were completed, equating to over 17 000 km travelled. Almost 600 possums were observed as road-kill, with common ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) encountered in 87% of surveys and almost three times as often as common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) (encountered in 52% of surveys). Roads were classified into three categories based on adjacent landscape attributes, with the road-side environment ranging from suburban housing to continuous sclerophyll forest. Clusters, or 'hot spots', for possum road-kill were identified using GIS. Most possum fatalities, and five out of six hot spots, occurred along roads at the bush-urban interface, suggesting high possum movement rates and/or abundance at these sites. Continuous canopy across the road was available along only 4% of the roads surveyed, forcing these arboreal marsupials to cross roads via electricity wires or at ground level, making them vulnerable to collision with vehicles. In an attempt to mitigate the possum road toll, two rope tunnel bridges were erected at canopy level above the most consistent hot spot. Subsequent monitoring of the roads was undertaken for 10 months after erection of the canopy bridge and road-kill numbers declined significantly at the site of the bridges, but also at adjacent sites throughout the study area.

FX  - We acknowledge Professor Des Cooper for his input, encouragement and inspiration. Des introduced TCR to possums and marsupial ecology, and for this she will always be grateful. This project was largely conceptualised by Professor Des Cooper. The initial outline of the project was conceived by Des in conjunction with CAH and TCR with input from Dr Jutta Eymann. We thank David Harrington for assistance with vegetation surveys, Dr Emma Laxton for three months of field collection, Bonnie Russell, Belinda Ramirez and Belinda Alexandra, who were regular volunteers on road surveys, and all volunteers who reported road-killed possums to TCR. Ku-ring-gai Municipal Council generously supported this project with both technical and financial assistance. A special mention must go to the council road crews who were delayed for many hours at the time of camera installation due to a technical malfunction. Their good humour and patience is acknowledged with thanks. Funding of the canopy rope bridges was gratefully provided by WIRES (New South Wales Wildlife, Information and Rescue Service). This research was funded in part by the Macquarie University postgraduate fund. Animal ethics approval was received from the Macquarie University Animal Ethics Committee for the collection of road-killed possums, and a scientific licence (No. S11214) was issued to TCR by the Department of Environment and Conservation (now the Office of Environment and Heritage). We also sincerely thank Dr Ross Goldingay and Dr Thomas Madsen for their comments and suggestions that have significantly enhanced this manuscript.

AB  - Phenacoccus peruvianus Granara de Willink (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is an invasive mealybug of Neotropical origin. In recent years it has invaded the Mediterranean Basin causing significant damages in bougainvillea and other ornamental plants. This article examines its phenology, location on the plant and spatial distribution, and presents a sampling plan to determine P. peruvianus population density for the management of this mealybug in southern Europe. Six urban green spaces with bougainvillea plants were periodically surveyed between March 2008 and September 2010 in eastern Spain, sampling bracts, leaves, and twigs. Our results show that P. peruvianus abundance was high in spring and summer, declining to almost undetectable levels in autumn and winter. The mealybugs showed a preference for settling on bracts and there were no significant migrations between plant organs. P. peruvianus showed a highly aggregated distribution on bracts, leaves, and twigs. We recommend a binomial sampling of 200 leaves and an action threshold of 55% infested leaves for integrated pest management purposes on urban landscapes and enumerative sampling for ornamental nursery management and additional biological studies.

AB  - Monitoring the distribution and abundance of an invasive species is challenging, especially during the initial years of spread when population densities are low and basic biology and monitoring methods are being investigated. Brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys (Stal)) is an invasive agricultural and urban pest that was first detected in the United States in the late 1990s. At the time of its detection, no method was available to effectively track H. halys populations, which are highly mobile and polyphagous. One possible solution was the utilization of black light traps, which are nonspecific traps attractive to night flying insects. To determine if black light traps are a reliable monitoring tool for H. halys, a state-wide network of 40-75 traps located on New Jersey farms were monitored from 2004 to 2011 for H. halys. This proved to be a highly effective method of monitoring H. halys populations and their spread at the landscape level. The total number of brown marmorated stink bug caught in New Jersey increased exponentially during this period at a rate of 75% per year. Logistic regression estimates that 2.84 new farms are invaded each year by H. halys. The results indicate that black light traps are attractive to early season populations as well as at low population densities. Weekly trap catch data are being used to generate state-wide population distribution maps made available to farmers in weekly newsletters and online. While no economic threshold currently exists for brown marmorated stink bug, the maps provide farmers with a tool to forecast pest pressure and plan management.

AB  - From the beginning in the Ming and Qing dynasties until the end of the republic of China, "Zou Xikou" immigration movement lasted more than three hundred years, and has changed the environment of Inner Mongolia. The migrants to the han nationality and the local Mongolian' behavior all changed accordingly, their way of life and production, way of living has also changed accordingly. This change promoted the formation of the village and the city in Inner Mongolia, which is the miniature of current Inner Mongolia. This article discusses the environment and behavior transition under the influence of "Zou Xikou" immigration in Inner Mongolia. We study this transition from the historical background, production mode, population structure, and city building four angles. We also do the restitutive description, which is mainly aimed at grassland agriculture, population of localization, living centralization and regional architecture, in order to better explore the regionalism of Inner Mongolia.

AB  - This paper examines the link between subsidized housing and the concentration of poverty. I use newly available data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development that extends from the earliest years of subsidized housing reform to the present day. I find that substantial changes in the poverty rate of neighborhoods occurred predominantly in census tracts that experienced more than a 5 percent increase or decrease in their share of subsidized units, indicating that more subsidized housing is associated with greater poverty. However, the increase in the poverty rate of neighborhoods that experienced more than a 5 percent increase in either building-based or voucher units was due to the movement of poor subsidized individuals into those neighborhoods rather than changes in the poverty rate of individuals who do not live in subsidized housing.

TI  - New Ways to Write the History of Western Europe and the United States: The Concept of Intercultural Transfer(1)
T2  - HISTORY COMPASS
LA  - English
AB  - The concept of intercultural transfer was originally developed in the 1980s for the study of exchange processes between France and Germany in the time of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. More recently, various scholars have applied it to the exchange processes across the Atlantic (and between Germany and the United States in particular) and across the British Chanel (and between Germany and Great Britain in particular). Its focus is cultural transformation, since the transferred elements reflect the influence of the agents of intercultural transfer as well as both the giving and the receiving society. This paper seeks to provide an alternative to traditional accounts of German and American history by highlighting transfers that occurred in the realm of culture, education, and customs in the 19th century. Such transfer included concepts for the organization of the urban infrastructure of American cities (from museums and schools to city parks) as well as models for education (from kindergarten to university). Both cultures and societies were deeply connected by these cultural transfers even though they occurred outside the realm of state action and apart from the increasing control of both nation states over the movement of its citizens within civil society. Intercultural transfers were organized and carried out by agents of intercultural transfer. These agents were private citizens who acted on their own initiative as agents of civil society but not as agents of nation states. The development of German and American society and culture in the 19th century was, thus, intrinsically linked and resulted in a multitude of cross-cultural interconnections that contributed to the diversification of both societies. The Atlantic represented in this narrative a "connective lifeline" rather than a separating gulf.

AB  - We examine human-animal encounters as the generative source of affective knowing and learning to study the role of affect in the implementation of nature conservation. The study is based on an ethnographic approach following the embodied practices of biological field surveyors working with Siberian flying squirrels (Pteromys volans) in land use planning in Finland. The case is characterized by radical uncertainties due to the elusive life of flying squirrels, the strict conservation standard of the EU, and the pressure of urban development. The surveyors can use only indirect clues to detect these nocturnal animals, but are required to produce accurate and unambiguous ecological knowledge to planners. We found that affective learning enables knowing and increases the reliability of knowledge in such conditions. Affective learning results from alternation between constant encountering of clues and changing intensities that produce feeling states and a sense of the forest where the animals live. Ethical consideration and personal differences are important in affective learning and shape the surveyors as participants in standard development. Finally we discuss the possible implications of affective learning for standard design in nature conservation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction and Aims To develop a measure of alcohol affordability (AA) and compare the AA of 65 cities worldwide. Design and Methods In this paper, AA is defined as the proportion of median daily income needed to buy a certain quantity of certain alcoholic beverages. The income data and the price of alcoholic beverages were drawn from the Union Bank of Switzerland survey and the Economist Intelligence Unit respectively. Results A large majority of cities (87.7%, n?=?57) had a high level of AA. The top 20 ranking was occupied by European and American cities with Tokyo in the Western Pacific region being the exception. All cities belonging to high-income countries had high levels of AA. However, two cities with low-level AA came from low-middle-income countries instead of low-income countries. Discussion and Conclusions The findings have shown that alcohol consumption is highly affordable in many cities. If price policy is being considered as policy instrument of alcohol control, it is in urgent need of price adjustments. More specifically, the new emerging economies play a significant role in the world alcohol control movement because of their bright economic performance with huge population size. Further studies on AA, especially periodical monitoring and its impacts on alcohol consumption and alcohol related health problems, should be conducted so as to facilitate the formulation and evaluation price measure of alcohol control.

AB  - Geology and landscape profoundly influence society, civilization and cultural diversity on our planet. The subtle relationships between peoples have changed irrevocably since our species began its journey in the Ice Age. The last 10,000 years have been a boom time: we planted crops, domesticated animals and built cities; population burgeoned; and in most places, the link to the land was lost. Important geological places (geosites) help us to rekindle and remember our place. Our geoheritage, now with the added designation of 'Geoparks', needs to reflect this intimate relationship: by helping people refind their roots and learning from early and indigenous people through their experiences to answer modern challenges, such as surviving climate change. The Geopark concept has brought economic revitalization to many rural regions, assisting local communities and indigenous populations, and added a new tool for geoconservation. In particular, women are being empowered to pursue new lines of work and to get involved in the Geopark process. Examples from Australian, Chinese, European and Iranian Geoparks show how the Global Geopark Network is supporting UNESCO ideals for women in the twenty-first century. This trend is important because women are traditionally the primary educators of children and they bring different perspectives to understanding geoheritage and to the Geopark process.

AB  - The US Department of Agriculture Forest Service's focus on hazardous fuels reduction has increased since the adoption of the National Fire Plan in 2001. However, appropriations for hazardous fuels reduction still lag behind wildfire suppression spending. Offsetting fuels treatment costs through biomass utilization or by using innovative administrative mechanisms such as stewardship contracting are two approaches to stretching appropriated dollars further across the landscape. We use fuels treatment data (n = 8,451 locations) to ask how woodprocessing infrastructure influences where and how much hazardous fuels treatments, biomass utilization, and stewardship contracting occur on national forests in Oregon and Washington. We found that national forest ranger districts that are relatively close in proximity to sawmills or biomass facilities treated more overall ha and More wildland-urban interface ha and used stewardship contracting on more ha than ranger districts further away and that there was a threshold distance for these effects (40 minutes). We also found that proximity to sawmills and biomass facilities influenced the location and extent of hazardous fuels treatments that incorporated biomass utilization or were administered through a stewardship contract. Our analysis suggests that to be effective at offsetting some of the costs of hazardous fuels reduction and treat a greater extent of the landscape, policy strategies may need to focus on supporting a network of wood-processing facilities that is distributed across forest-based communities.

AB  - The challenges of sustainable urban development are tremendous. More than half of the earth's population lives in cities and there is an upward trend. On a global scale, the cities are the greatest greenhouse gas producers and the biggest consumers of water and energy. Urbanisation, climate change and demographic change are forcing metropolises to make their infrastructure more efficient, be environmentally friendlier, keep the high standard of living and if possible save costs. One of the keys is the selection of materials. Buildings are responsible for 40% of the energy consumption and approx. 21% of produced CO2 worldwide. Scientists and researchers from all over the world are looking into new technologies, so that energy could be used efficiently and CO2 emissions reduced, without having to pass on comfort or "lifestyle habits" [http://www.siemens.de/nachhaltige-stadtentwicklung/nachhaltige-stadtentwicklung.html?stc=deccc020187 (accessed 27.04.2012)]. Sustainability is a complex term, used in the last 2-3 decades. It involves more than just the environment and it concerns every one of mankind [cf. Schlussbericht der Enquete-Kommission Globalisierung der Weltwirtschaft Herausfordeung-en und Antworten, Drucksache 14/9200, http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/14/092/1409200.pdf, p. 393]. This is why social and engineering scientists from RWTH Aachen University have joined in their efforts to figure out how used shipping containers, which are in abundant supply, can play their role in the future of sustainable construction. After they have been used several times, freight containers are considered disused and begin to accumulate in the surroundings of seaports and harbours. The energy to produce a container is significant and considered wasted if the steel box has completed only a few runs. The first association with containers can be a cold and uncomfortable cell, however, after a glance at the properly adapted shipping containers, converted into cosy, pretty and affordable habitable spaces, this preconception can soon be dismissed. Research has shown, in terms of environment and design, they are innovative and intelligent building with cargo containers is cheaper, "greener", faster and more flexible than traditional methods. With the increase of life expectancy and population continuing to grow, demand for housing will rise as well. Demographic change and the demand will contribute to rising construction prices. Habitation is one of the essential basic needs of all people. If one takes into account population growth and the timely provision of housing for all people, existing construction methods have to be adapted and new ones developed. Space in the social sense is an expression of the society and not its reflexion [cf. M. Castells, The Rise of Network Society, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, p. 440f]. Bearing in mind the diversity in Europe's population and the anxiety for environmental protection and sustainability, also the contrariness in environmental awareness and behavior, likewise eco-friendly and polluting habits in our everyday life, which are linked together in a various and unconsidered way, validates having different levels of environmental awareness depending on the different segments of society. We speak here of the "patchwork" - character of lifestyles and values, which is illustrated and explained easily with the Sinus-Milieu-Model [Bundesministerium fur Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit, Umweltbewusstsein in Deutschland 2010, Ergebnisse einer reprasentativen Bevolkerungsumfrage, 2010, p. 13].
   This paper discusses the existing Sinus-Milieus (R) [http://www.sinus-institut.de/en/ (accessed 27.04.2012)] and their features and show hereupon the growing demand in the society on flexible living concepts and habitat designs. The theory supports, that building with steel containers could be a real solution for the social and environmental problems. A continuously availability of shipping containers as a building block is expected and therefore the construction business with steel containers has a great potential in terms of sustainability towards a sustainable construction in a sustainable city.

AB  - During the two-year period, April 2010 to April 2012, a series of extreme weather events occurred in Queensland. Due to extensive flooding and cyclonic conditions impacting communities and vital infrastructure, the majority of the state was declared a natural disaster zone. As a consequence, it is estimated the road network suffered damages in excess of $7 billion with local authorities suffering additional damage of similar magnitude in monetary terms. This paper identifies a range of issues encountered as a result of these natural disasters, including the destruction of timber bridges, settlement of piers, scour at abutments and loss of road approaches to bridges. It is postulated that the AS 5100 Bridge Design Code was written mainly for traditional rural applications. Additionally, this paper examines the actual loads that urban bridges were subjected to including floating debris such as shipping containers, cars and river-craft (for example 300 t vessels) that should be incorporated in future revisions of AS 5100. It is suggested that in future, bridge design codes should consider the context and location of bridges for connectivity and post disaster functionality. It is recommended such learning's be considered and applied to new bridges and remedial works in conjunction with suggested amendments to AS 5100 Bridge Design Code.

AB  - There are a number of challenges that need to be addressed until a wide deployment of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) becomes possible. In order to support Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) service, one of those critical issues consists of the design of scalable and stable routing algorithms that are robust to frequent path disruptions caused by vehicles' mobility and buildings' shadowing effect in urban environment. This paper argues the use of information on vehicles' movement information (e.g., position, direction, velocity, acceleration, and digital mapping of nodes) to maintain stable routes by calculating possible link-durations and preventing link-breakage events prior to their occurrences. Vehicles broadcast hand-off packets if they realize that they are in a threshold zone to keep a link of data transmission unbroken. Prior to link-breakage events, the most stable link is set up by using the values of link-duration calculated beforehand. The scheme proposed in this paper guarantees a high level of stable communication in urban VANETs and reduces the overall traffic in highly mobile VANETs. The performance of the scheme was evaluated through commercial simulator QualNet 4.5, which supports various possible effects in the city condition. Simulation results indicate the benefits of the proposed routing strategy in terms of increasing the end-to-end throughput, reducing the number of link-breakage events, reducing the end-to-end delay.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the vertical distribution and abundance of Aedes mosquitoes in multiple storey buildings in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Ovitrap surveillance was conducted for 4 continuous weeks in multiple storey buildings in 4 residential areas located in Selangor [Kg. Baiduri (KB)] and Kuala Lumpur [Student Hostel of University of Malaya (UM), Kg. Kerinchi (KK) and Hang Tuah (HT)]. The results implied that Aedes mosquitoes could be found from ground floor to highest floor of multiple storey buildings and data from different elevation did not show significant difference. Ovitrap index for UM, KB, HT and KK ranged from 0 - 29.17%, 0 - 55.56%, 8.33 - 83.33% and 0 - 91.17% respectively. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were found breeding in HT, KK and KB; while only Ae. albopictus was obtained from UM. The results indicate that the invasion of Aedes mosquitoes in high-rise apartments could facilitate the transmission of dengue virus and new approaches to vector control in this type of residential area should be developed.

AB  - This article examines diverse visions of an alternative society articulated by individuals and groups in the Global Justice Movement (GJM). It finds that many dissenters of globalization tend to converge on the idea that localization, economic descaling and political devolution would foster social conditions favourable to a just and sustainable society. Critiquing this idea, this article identifies a number of foreseeable problems associated with a descaled, localized economy with a decentralized political structure. With a notable silence on the issue of the movement of people, local-centred economic models may provide an ecological ground for anti-immigration and trade protectionism of the rich countries. Small-scale farming and small scale eco-technology are far too inadequate to meet the food and energy needs of the populace in huge urban areas. Given the fast growing rate of urbanization globally, localizers must address the issue of how to go about restructuring the economy without infringing on people's occupational aspirations and their preference for certain modes of living (rural or urban). In short, the presumed positive correlation between a descaled local economy and social justice is challenged throughout the article.

AB  - The goal of this study was to establish relationships between fitness (torso endurance, grip strength and pull-ups), hip range of motion (ROM) (extension, flexion, internal and external rotation) and movement quality in an occupational group with physical work demands. Fifty-three men from the emergency task force of a major city police force were investigated. The movement screen comprised standing and seated posture, gait, segmental spine motion and 14 tasks designed to challenge whole-body coordination. Relationships were established between each whole-body movement task, the measures of strength, endurance and ROM. In general, fitness and ROM were not strongly related to the movement quality of any task. This has implications for worker training, in that strategies developed to improve ROM or strength about a joint may not enhance movement quality.
   Practitioner Summary: Worker-centered injury prevention can be described as fitting workers to tasks by improving fitness and modifying movement patterns; however, the current results show weak correlations between strength, endurance and ROM, and the way individuals move. Therefore, the development of occupation-specific injury prevention strategies may require both fitness and movement-oriented objectives.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to know the route of Special Education in different contexts, the city of Maringa/Brazil and Guadalajara/Spain and analyze the bases underlying the organization, structure and operation of this mode of education having as starting point the process inclusive school. This investigation is based on the theoretical and methodological principles of the historical-cultural notion by Vygotsky. He argues that the existence of fundamental principles underlying the development of children with disabilities. If, on the one hand, the disability imposes limitations on the individual, hindering its development, on the other, just by causing difficulties, enables the movement to compensate, increasing the development of other capabilities. The deficit itself is less. Therefore, it is a field research carried out by means of observations, literature search and document analysis in early childhood education institutions visited in the cities mentioned above. The results showed that there are peculiarities of its path, organization and functioning of Special Education in each of the contexts analyzed. Referentemente the inclusive education movement, it is clear that Spain is a precursor of this process therefore has the right conditions in different ways to conduct the service children with special needs, and on the other hand, schools have the resources and specialized materials they need. While in Brazil the operationalization of these measures occurs more slowly. Thus, we can say that this process of inclusive education does not happen in a linear fashion within mainstream schools and so little action in the different forms of special education in two contexts analyzed.

AB  - Coyotes (Canis latrans) have expanded to live in urban areas with limited natural habitat. A year long coyote howl survey combined with geospatial information systems (GIS) was applied to locate populations within a metropolitan region, to determine the habitats where coyotes most frequently occur, and to estimate group sizes within this urbanized region. Surveys were conducted along the perimeters of natural areas and urban-residential communities. Coyote response rates varied among parks, they increased during the dispersal season relative to the breeding and pup-rearing seasons, and responses increased when broadcasts were performed closer to sunset and/or later at night as well as when temperatures were low and the moon more visible. Group sizes were estimated to be between five and 13 individuals within the parks studied, although almost half of all responses originated from outside park boundaries. In the residential areas, natural land cover was present and the areas from which coyotes were predicted to have called contained a greater proportion of natural cover than the region as a whole but variation in land cover was much greater outside parks. Overall, howl surveys allowed for an inexpensive monitoring of coyotes over large areas in urban-park environments.

AB  - Recent research on reproduction in animals has emphasized phenology and prey matching in the long term and on large spatial scales (e.g., linked to global climate change). We studied how individuals within one reproductive cycle and at small spatial scales may try to maximize access to food resources that vary in space and time. Herbivorous mammals are known to track favorable phenological stages of their food plants and move seasonally on the landscape. Whether phenology similarly affects spatial movements of birds on their breeding grounds is largely unknown. We studied postfledging movements of Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and Great Tits (Parus major) when the young were escorted by parents during 19 to 43 days posthatching. This was done over 4 years in a 1.6-km(2) woodland area in Norway in which an elevational gradient (105-266 m) caused a phenological delay in vegetation and peak abundance of caterpillar prey at the higher elevations. Postfledging movements were similar in the two tit species, with a mean distance moved from the nest to the site of observation of 134 m (range: 6-1,036, n = 104). On average, families moved upslope (mean = 4.8 m, range: -23 to 69 m; P = 0.002, n = 104), which suggests that they were able to track environmental phenology. However, most families did not move far from the nest site, possibly because the parents tried to defend a year-round territory and, therefore, could not afford to leave for longer periods.

AB  - Characterizing time intervals between successive fires in the recent history is of main interest for fire hazard prevention and sustainable environmental management as it indicates what the typical fire return interval for each type of ecosystem is. We tested the extent to which fire return intervals (FRIs) depend on fuel type and age, and we compared FRI values between two fire-prone areas of south-eastern France (Provence). These areas had similar weather and roughly similar fuel types but fuels occurred in patches with different sizes and shapes in the landscape. We built a fire database (1960-2010) and we fitted Weibull distributions of FRI in order to compute the probability density function and the hazard of burning. Our results indicate maximal probability of burning again for shrublands (garrigues and maquis), and minimal values for mixed broadleaf-conifer forests and broadleaved forests. Most fuel types of Provence showed no effect of fuel age on the probability of burning again. Only the unmanaged maquis showed a linear increase of fire hazard in time due to a rapid postfire fuel build up. Rather long fire-free intervals and low age-dependency for most forest fuels of Provence suggest that reducing their biomass may not be sufficient to reduce fire risk. In contrast, the flammable shrublands have rather short fire return intervals and represent a high fire hazard for the whole study area. The two areas had statistically significant difference of fire return intervals for a same fuel type (e.g. 18-22 years for shrublands, 20-24 years for pine forests, and 24-27 years for oak forests). This suggested that size, shape and connectivity of fuels play a major role in the probability of burning again and should be taken into account for fire management. The present policy of fire prevention puts efforts into public information and prevention, and preferential management of fuels at risk in the vicinity of roads and wildland-urban interfaces where fires occur preferentially. However, fire suppression may also take advantage of favouring low-flammable fuels with low age-dependency on strategic places in the landscape. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Buffelgrass, a highly competitive and flammable African bunchgrass, is spreading rapidly across both urban and natural areas in the Sonoran Desert of southern and central Arizona. Damages include increased fire risk, losses in biodiversity, and diminished revenues and quality of life. Feasibility of sustained and successful mitigation will depend heavily on rates of spread, treatment capacity, and cost-benefit analysis. We created a decision support model for the wildland-urban interface north of Tucson, AZ, using a spatial state-and-transition simulation modeling framework, the Tool for Exploratory Landscape Scenario Analyses. We addressed the issues of undetected invasions, identifying potentially suitable habitat and calibrating spread rates, while answering questions about how to allocate resources among inventory, treatment, and maintenance. Inputs to the model include a state-and-transition simulation model to describe the succession and control of buffelgrass, a habitat suitability model, management planning zones, spread vectors, estimated dispersal kernels for buffelgrass, and maps of current distribution. Our spatial simulations showed that without treatment, buffelgrass infestations that started with as little as 80 ha (198 ac) could grow to more than 6,000 ha by the year 2060. In contrast, applying unlimited management resources could limit 2060 infestation levels to approximately 50 ha. The application of sufficient resources toward inventory is important because undetected patches of buffelgrass will tend to grow exponentially. In our simulations, areas affected by buffelgrass may increase substantially over the next 50 yr, but a large, upfront investment in buffelgrass control could reduce the infested area and overall management costs.

AB  - In this paper the geotechnical conditions under the influence of Banat earthquakes are analyzed, regarding the constructions in Timisoara. The analysis of geotechnical conditions from a territory is a key for improving norms and building confirmation, located in seismic areas. In general, the southern part of the Bega Canal near the Timis river is composed of sandy soils in many areas with a low degree of compaction and a high level of ground waters. The main factors influencing the seismic movement on a building site can be grouped into four categories: source, seismic wave propagation, local factors of location and ground-structure interaction. The diversity of the foundation conditions in the city of Timisoara increase the uncertainty about the response of the existing structures. In the end of this paper conclusions are expressed regarding the behavior and the effects on buildings in case of an earthquake scenario.

AB  - The relations between metropolitan areas of southern Poland and domestic population migration flows in the period of 2008-2010 were discussed in this paper. Southern Polish regions demonstrate low intensity of intraregional population movements while interregional flows are quite significant, within considering territory. The majority of migration flows occur in relation to the cities of Wroclaw and Cracow, as regards neighbouring as well as remaining regions of Poland, due to their economic potential and metropolitan character.

AB  - Transportation amongst cities is found as one of the main factors which affect the outbreak of diseases. To understand the effect of transport-related infection on disease spread, an SEIRS (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) epidemic model for two cities is formulated and analyzed. The epidemiological threshold, known as the basic reproduction number, of the model is derived. If the basic reproduction number is below unity, the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. Thus, the disease can be eradicated from the community. There exists an endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable if the reproduction number is larger than unity. This means that the disease will persist within the community. The results show that transportation among regions will change the disease dynamics and break infection out even if infectious diseases will go to extinction in each isolated region without transport-related infection. In addition, the result shows that transport-related infection intensifies the disease spread if infectious diseases break out to cause an endemic situation in each region, in the sense of that both the absolute and relative size of patients increase. Further, the formulated model is applied to the real data of SARS outbreak in 2003 to study the transmission of disease during the movement between two regions. The results show that the transport-related infection is effected to the number of infected individuals and the duration of outbreak in such the way that the disease becomes more endemic due to the movement between two cities. This study can be helpful in providing the information to public health authorities and policy maker to reduce spreading disease when its occurs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prior to 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) was a bit player in the screenplay of global vector-borne viral diseases. First discovered in the West Nile District of Uganda in 1937, this Culex sp.-transmitted virus was known for causing small human febrile outbreaks in Africa and the Middle East. Prior to 1995, the last major human WNV outbreak was in the 1950s in Israel. The epidemiology and ecology of WNV began to change in the mid-1990s when an epidemic of human encephalitis occurred in Romania. The introduction of WNV into Eastern Europe was readily explained by bird migration between Africa and Europe. The movement of WNV from Africa to Europe could not, however, predict its surprising jump across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City and the surrounding areas of the United States (U.S.). This movement of WNV from the Eastern to Western Hemisphere in 1999, and its subsequent dissemination throughout two continents in less than ten years is widely recognized as one of the most significant events in arbovirology during the last two centuries. This paper documents the early events of the introduction into and the spread of WNV in the Western Hemisphere.

AB  - Environmental engineering research on decentralized, biological remediation of wastewater through the creation of treatment wetlands has advanced dramatically in the last decade. Treatment wetlands can effectively meet secondary treatment standards for total suspended solids and biological oxygen demand. Certain designs can achieve tertiary quality for ammonia, nitrates, and pathogenic bacteria. At costs equal to or lower than conventional systems, treatment wetlands can rejuvenate wastewater effluent generated by institutions, subdivisions, and small towns in diverse climates. In addition to providing ecosystem services relating to wastewater remediation, these site-based multifunctional landscapes also enhance biological diversity and provide open space values relating to scenic quality, recreation, and education. When aligned with ecosystem corridors, treatment wetlands become part of larger scale multifunctional landscapes that provide green infrastructure to guide development patterns at the regional scale. This paper examines the ability of a decentralized sequence of treatment wetlands located within public open space to improve ecosystem health and provide ecosystem service benefits to society at multiple geographic scales.

AB  - After installing electromagnet retarder on the city bus, car performances, such as safety, comfort, economical efficiency and environmental protection have been embodied and improved. However, great hidden concerns on safety will exist if matching between the electromagnet retarder and city bus fails. In this paper, brake work conditions as well as the practical operational processes of the electromagnet retarder both at home and abroad have been analyzed. The fact that possible hazardous brake work conditions may appear while electromagnet retarder brake is being put into practice after force analysis on the city bus braking has been analyzed. Drivers are guided to put electromagnet retarder into practice correctly in any road conditions after the matching between the electromagnet retarder and city bus has been analyzed.
   Brake directional stability, namely, the performance for city bus not to deviate, sideslip and lose the capability to veer. Braking deviation will occur when the braking force between the left wheel and right wheel are not even or when the suspended guide rod system and the steering system is interfered with each other while moving. Braking sideslip means the horizontal movement of uniaxial or multiple axis of the city bus while braking as the sideslip in the deep extent will inevitably result in the sideslip. While sideslip occurs during braking, especially for the sideslip of rear axle( namely, drifting), rotating or even turning around may arise, which is one of the direct reasons to cause major safety accidents. Based on the statistics, more than 70% of the ice and snow road accidents are related to the sideslip, among which 50% are caused by the sideslip. This paper will expound, on one hand, the influence on the brake directional stability exerted by the electromagnet retarder, on the other hand, the matching between the electromagnet retarder and city bus.

AB  - Background: Using evidence-based strategies within U.S. local health departments (LHDs) to provide community services can increase the likelihood of success and efficient use of resources. Dissemination of such strategies, a necessary precursor to implementation, occurs through networks of relationships and can be facilitated by weak network ties, whereas implementation is associated with strong network ties.
   Purpose: To identify LHD characteristics associated with weak and strong ties in the national network of LHDs.
   Methods: Data on the structure and functions of participating LHDs (n=2107) were taken from the 2010 National Association of County and City Health Officials Profile of Local Health Departments (Profile Study). The 2010 Profile Study was the first to include a question on communication links across the national network of LHDs. Descriptive network analysis and exponential random graph modeling were used to identify LHD characteristics associated with weak and strong communication ties. Analysis was conducted in 2012.
   Results: The LHD network was relatively sparse overall, indicating that dissemination across the entire network would be difficult. Few strong nationwide ties were found, indicating a lack of structural influences encouraging implementation. Several LHD characteristics were associated with a higher likelihood of weak and strong ties. In bivariate analyses, larger health departments were more likely to have strong ties. Weak ties were more likely among LHDs sharing jurisdiction and organizational characteristics. The only network predictor of strong ties was being in the same state.
   Conclusions: Public health efforts aimed at broad dissemination and implementation of evidence-based programming may benefit from strengthening partnerships in each state.

AB  - A large landslide occurred at Maierato (Vibo Valencia District), Southern Italy, on 15 February 2010, when rapid failure was produced after several days of preliminary movements. The landslide can be classified as a rotational slide with flowing of the mass. It occurred within a larger deep-seated gravitational movement area and was preconditioned for failure by the intrinsic geological weakness of the area. Actually, the in situ survey showed the presence of several ancient movement surfaces all around the urban area. The landslide-triggering factor was the increase in the groundwater flow, consequent to a period of heavy and prolonged rainfall. The aim of the paper is to explain the mechanism of occurrence of the February 2010 composite landslide, in order to assess the landslide hydrogeological susceptibility in the whole urban area of Maierato. For this reason, the present paper deals with: (1) identification of the landslide mechanism and triggering factors (2) slope stability back-analysis using a finite-difference-based shear strength reduction method, and (3) 3D groundwater flow modelling extended to the whole urban area both in pre- and post-failure conditions. The results show that the February 2010 composite landslide was triggered by a water table increase of about 15 m uphill the landslide scarp. This hydrogeological condition could be reached after the period of heavy and prolonged rainfall preceding the landslide event. Finally, based on the groundwater modelling in post-failure condition, a landslide hydrogeological susceptibility map was drawn for the all urban area of Maierato, showing the presence of extended areas exposed to hazard.

AB  - Microsatellite markers (N=5) were developed for analysis of genetic variation in 15 populations of the columnar cactus Stenocereus stellatus, managed under traditional agriculture practices in central Mexico. Microsatellite diversity was analyzed within and among populations, between geographic regions, and among population management types to provide detailed insight into historical gene flow rates and population dynamics associated with domestication. Our results corroborate a greater diversity in populations managed by farmers compared with wild ones (HE=0.64 vs. 0.55), but with regional variation between populations among regions. Although farmers propagated S. stellatus vegetatively in home gardens to diversify their stock, asexual recruitment also occurred naturally in populations where more marginal conditions have limited sexual recruitment, resulting in lower genetic diversity. Therefore, a clear-cut relationship between the occurrence of asexual recruitment and genetic diversity was not evident. Two managed populations adjacent to towns were identified as major sources of gene movement in each sampled region, with significant migration to distant as well as nearby populations. Coupled with the absence of significant bottlenecks, this suggests a mechanism for promoting genetic diversity in managed populations through long distance gene exchange. Cultivation of S. stellatus in close proximity to wild populations has led to complex patterns of genetic variation across the landscape that reflects the interaction of natural and cultural processes. As molecular markers become available for nontraditional crops and novel analysis techniques allow us to detect and evaluate patterns of genetic diversity, genetic studies provide valuable insights into managing crop genetic resources into the future against a backdrop of global change. Traditional agriculture systems play an important role in maintaining genetic diversity for plant species.

AB  - Age-friendly cities and communities (AFC) is an international movement initiated by the World Health Organization in response to simultaneous patterns of global aging and urbanization. A key aspect of AFC is a commitment to a cycle of continual improvement that addresses key aspects of the environment, such as accessibility, transport, intergenerational links, respect, community participation, and service provision. Given the focus of environmental influences on activity participation, this policy initiative overlaps with the core domain of concern of occupational science, that is, occupation. This discussion paper contends that occupational science is aligned with principles of active ageing and AFCs, and has the potential to provide evidence for the link between occupation and health, and open novel ways to think about and attend to the occupational rights of ageing persons. The frameworks of active ageing and AFC provide a means for occupational science to enact its values on enabling occupation and related concepts. An occupational science perspective can emphasize the development of enabling policies and, combined with the principles of AFC, contribute to the development of social policies and their enactment within local contexts, based upon a complex understanding of occupation and its relationship to health and wellbeing.

AB  - This article explores the characteristics of commuting between small towns and regional centres located beyond the sphere of metropolitan influence in an Australian context. In regional Australia there are a number of economic, social and demographic trends affecting small towns and regional areas. In respect to commuting, the majority of analysis has occurred within a metropolitan setting, despite the prevalence of commuting in rural and regional areas. This research used census data to explore socio-economic characteristics of commuters in rural and peri-urban regions in Victoria, Australia. It is suggested that those small towns located within the commuter field or sphere of influence of the nearest regional centre have become part of an economic network and that the role of these small towns is integrated within these functional regions. Within these functional regions it is suggested that mobility has filled a void in employment created by the economic and demographic trends that have affected regional Australia. The research identifies unique characteristics in respect to gender and socio-economic status of commuters from small rural towns. These results demonstrate that commuting is a distinctive phenomenon within regions beyond metropolitan influence, revealing differences to patterns within metropolitan regions.

AB  - A range of species eating the same fruit suggests that niche overlap can occur, along with potential competition among them. To test if the overlap in the coterie of fruit-eating birds is larger than would be expected by chance, we performed a comparison with coteries generated from the use of null models. The study was carried out in an area of savanna woodland of 127 ha in Uberlandia city, Brazil. Four individuals of five zoochorous plant species were selected and 60 h of focal observation was performed on each species. We recorded species of birds that consumed fruits and the quantity of fruit removed. We used an index of Proportional Similarity (PS) between each pair of plant species, using the relative proportion of fruit taken by each bird species of each plant. The mean value of observed PS was compared with the mean PS generated from randomizations. Thirty-six bird species were recorded eating fruits in the selected plant species. The mean overlap observed (PS = 0.183) was significantly higher (P = 0.032) than the mean overlap generated by the null models (PS = 0.123). This pattern suggests that competition is not an important factor in the formation of the coteries and there is sharing of resources. The abundance of fruits offered, especially in the rainy season, and the relatively low number of frugivorous species may be factors explaining the low influence of interactions and therefore the overlap between coteries.

AB  - In a capitalist society, public buildings are essential social assets that balance private and civic interests while providing convenience and comfort for the entire community. The performance of public buildings is remarkable as they are related to most people instead of a handful of users/owners in the private sector. Hence, architecture of public institutions occupies a central, subtle, and decisive role in the quality and the state of civility in the city. Living in compact environments, Hong Kong people always need and aspire for more acute use of public spaces. In this local context, common space and public buildings naturally form an extension to city living. As a consequence, public buildings are becoming multi-use, multi-value and multi-level.
   This article is a short account of the evolution and development of the public building in Hong Kong, from the early1960s to the new millennium. It considers the historic background of the modernist movement and the socio-economic setting of the city. In chronological order, the paper delineates six examples: the City Hall (1962), Town Hall in Shatin New Town (1985), Cultural Centre (1989), Heritage Museum (2000), Central Library (2001) and Wetland Park (2006). The authors present the statistical analysis of public buildings during this period and examine the cases with established criteria of public/civic buildings. Furthermore, social background and the strategies that those designs adopted are discovered and discussed. While generally following the modernist principles, the government architects in Hong Kong adopted alternative methods to respond to the increasing societal expectations along the timeline, for example, pragmatism, neo-classicism and sustainability. It concludes by suggesting the future of the city's public buildings in the West Kowloon Cultural District in the coming decade. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to evaluate subpopulation differentiation, effective population size (N-e) and evidence for population bottlenecks at various geographic levels, Aedes aegypti larvae were collected longitudinally from 2007 to 2009 from four areas in the city of Salvador, Brazil. The DNA from each larva was isolated and genotyped with five independent microsatellite markers. F-ST and Jost's D revealed significant population structuring (P<0.05) at the municipal and regional levels, while only R-ST was able to detect genetic differentiation at the level of strata within these areas. N-e analysis from longitudinal data did not show any evidence of significant change in population structure. The census population measured by the house index, however, showed a significant trend toward decrease in these areas. Active vector control measures did contribute to vector reduction, but this was not enough to decrease A. aegypti population genetic diversity in Salvador. The understanding of A. aegypti population dynamics may be helpful for planning and evaluation of control measures to make them more effective. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal change and coastal erosion have been a long-existing source of environmental changes. Traditionally, regional changes in wetland systems and their relations to agriculture, industry and urbanization are a major cause for concern. Nowadays, coastal distress has reached even global proportions: the problems of coastal change are strongly linked to the loss of fragile ecosystems, eutrophication and loss of biodiversity. Given that over 70 % of all human activity is in coastal areas, it is clear that many environmental and socio-economic changes occur at a local level and manifest themselves in a spatial context. The physical effect on the geographic morphology is evident in the related consequences for land use. A deep understanding of the changes in land use, and simultaneously in coastal erosion, calls for the integrated monitoring of the most relevant effects in fragile regions. The Ria Formosa wetland system is a unique and very special wetland system in the Algarve (Portugal) and has been integrated in the NATURA 2000 network. The strong symbiosis between nature, agriculture and fisheries, as well as tourism, in the Algarve has led to spatial-ecological synergy. By using coastal recession analysis techniques by means of remote-sensed imagery from 1987, 1989, 2000 and 2007 and by combining this information with available data sets on surface erodibility, a cost surface on multitemporal transitions of land-use classes from the CORINE Land Cover data allows us to assess and integrate a decision-making framework by means of GIS. The novelty of this combined approach to land-use management is the blend of spatial analysis and remote-sensing techniques that share important information on ecosystems at risk. Our findings suggest a growing concern to the area brought by anthropogenic activity. This is studied to a spatial accounting of the distribution of land changes and transitions, where (1) a significant loss of coastal area is witnessed along the Ria Formosa, leading in particular to loss of agricultural land. (2) This loss is underpinned by an increase in leisure facilities to respond to the tourism demand of the region of the Algarve, while landscape metrics suggest that these areas are more volatile for coastal erosion. (3) Simulation through Markov chains on the land use and effects of urban, agricultural, forest and wetland dynamics suggests that by 2026, it is expected to continue to have an increase in urban land, leading to an augmented vulnerability of coastal erosion processes brought by the loss of forest areas which protect from erosion given the root system that directly protects from the existing wave energy and helps sedimentation processes. The above methodology and the availability of data that are freely available render such a combined approach interesting for many other regions of the world, where tourism, coastal change and regional balance are of the utmost importance for sustainable development. The advanced research tools presented here are of critical importance for coastal zone degradation management.

AB  - A new rural development paradigm has emerged over the last decade. It is multifaceted by nature, connecting practices of landscape management, agritourism, organic and sustainable farming, and value-chain analysis and management. Increased food production in peri-urban areas in the developed world is typical of this new paradigm. Peri-urban areas are the transitional zones between rural and urban landscapes that experience constant population change and disturbance of traditional social, environmental, and economic characteristics. Sustainable community development initiatives are complicated in these fragmented and often contested landscapes. A case study on Australia's Sunshine Coast analyzes the challenges and opportunities of reconfiguring agri-food production systems to achieve the type of multifunctional landscape preferred by the community and primary producers alike. Scenario analysis, interviews, and surveys of traditional midscale farmers with more recent micro- to small primary producers and food artisans provide insight into the challenges faced at a grassroots level. The role of government in facilitating supportive policy and planning and connecting and building the capacity of key actors involved in local and regional food value chains is reviewed. The paper argues that the government is essential to the successful planning and management of peri-urban areas because of the fragmented and/or contested quality of this unique agri-food landscape. Without further investment in place-based collaborative research, planning, capacity building, and economic development, the local food movement in these peri-urban areas is likely to continue to occupy only a narrow "alternative" cultural and economic space.

AB  - As widely known, GPS (Global Positioning System) cannot provide the position solutions continuously in urban area due to insufficient number of visible satellites. In order to overcome the shortcoming of GPS, hybrid positioning methods have been extensively studied to complement GPS with various other aiding sensors. To bound positioning errors in urban area effectively, this paper proposes a novel hybrid positioning method combining GPS and monocular vision sensor.
   Based on the rectangular geometries of roads appearing in urban area, it can be assumed that vehicles usually move in straight direction except few cases for right/left turn and lane change. By comparing the two detected vanishing points from two consecutive image frames, it can be checked whether the vehicle is moving straight or not. Once the straight movement condition is confirmed, which occurs mostly during the drive in urban area, the incremental position can be extracted effectively for the coasting of vehicle's position even when the number of visible satellites is insufficient.
   To detect vanishing points in real-time with feasible computational burden, the proposed method combines Hough-Transformation, ROI(Region Of Interest), and Color separation methods. As compared with conventional vision-aided GPS methods, the proposed method does not require any external map information and multiple vision sensors to extract depth information. By an experiment result utilizing field-collected measurements, feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated.

AB  - Most invasive species hitchhike on human transportation, and their close associations with human activity increase their chances of uptake. Once aboard, potential invaders have to survive the journey, and those with traits such as being a general feeder or tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions tend to survive the transportation better. Similar traits are generally considered to also aid their establishment in new habitats, but studies showed that the propagule pressure, not any of the species-specific traits, is the most important factor contributing to their successful establishment. Higher propagule pressure, i.e., repeated invasions of larger numbers of individuals, reduces Allee effects and aids the population growth of invasive species in alien lands. Coined as the invasive bridgehead effect, repeated introduction also selects a more invasive population that serves as the source of further invasions to other areas. Invasive species is the consequence of homogenocene (our current ecological epoch with diminished biodiversity and increasing similarity among ecosystems worldwide) that began with the Columbian Exchange of the 15th century and possibly the Pax Mongolica of the 13-14th century. Anthropogenic movement of goods among major cities will only accelerate, and the heightened propagule pressure will increase the number of invasive species for as long as the current practices of global commercial activities continue.

AB  - In 2001, a nearly five month long sequence of shallow, mostly small magnitude earthquakes occurred beneath the city of Spokane, a city with a population of about 200,000, in the state of Washington. During most of the sequence, the earthquakes were not well located because seismic instrumentation was sparse. Despite poor-quality locations, the earthquake hypocenters were likely very shallow, because residents near the city center both heard and felt many of the earthquakes. The combination of poor earthquake locations and a lack of known surface faults with recent movement make assessing the seismic hazards related to the earthquake swarm difficult. However, the potential for destruction from a shallow moderate-sized earthquake is high, for example Christchurch New Zealand in 2011, so assessing the hazard potential of a seismic structure involved in the Spokane earthquake sequence is important. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from the European Space Agency ERS2 and ENVISAT satellites and the Canadian Space Agency RADARSAT-1, satellite we are able to show that slip on a shallow previously unknown thrust fault, which we name the Spokane Fault, is the source of the earthquake sequence. The part of the Spokane Fault that slipped during the 2001 earthquake sequence underlies the north part of the city, and slip on the fault was concentrated between similar to 0.3 and 2 km depth. Projecting the buried fault plane to the surface gives a possible surface trace for the Spokane Fault that strikes northeast from the city center into north Spokane. Citation: Wicks, C., C.

AB  - It is within the changing ambient of organization the production and their impacts on workplaces, worker health and in their spatial correspondence we have new forms of labor control and hence, new meanings and senses to the material and subjective dimension for workers. The pretension to focus on the disputed territories as parto of this process requires us to situate in the contexto of class struggle, with eyeballs, therefore, to demonstrate the territorial dynamics os work and its diferents forms of expression, with which concern us, and redefinitions the composition on the working class in their own structure. We are therefore proposing to expand the focus of approach to work to other aspects, such as, forms of exploitation, quality, ambient and work health (pathologies, the injuries and occupational diseases), which are associated with social invibility of work-related diseases, due to the inefficiency of pubic social policy, well as the social relations of work that support the different situations and forms of (de) realization of work, motivated by capital, for example, agrohidronegocio as na expression of conflicts around acess and use of land and water. The validity of productive reestructuring of capital is a reference to tune the changes that are occuring in the work that since the late 1980s orients new lines of social conflict expression. The classic format capital versus labour divides importance to other configuration forms of class domination which implies new looks on the delimitations of what is working in the countryside (salaried-worker, peasant) and what is working in the city (salaried-worker, for own account, outsourced, informal etc.) under different social relations of production and work. The continuous flow of these relations is that indicate changes in the profile of the peasants, redefinitions the ranks of urban and rural workmen and, therefore, the plasticity that hits hard work in way of consequence, changes in/of social roles and political-ideological, reach and contextualize the degradation and territorial labour movement of working class.

AB  - An experimental paradigm is proposed for the measurement of time histories of eye movements and vehicle trajectories during simulator driving. Eye movements, both distance of eye movement and numbers of fixations, along with car log data were recorded as participants maneuvered through an urban road scenario that included turning through an intersection. Eye movements during a traffic event did show how and on what the driver focused their visual attention during specific traffic events, such as right and left turns. Another analysis was conducted linking vehicle trajectory and driver eye movements. Using an integrated analysis of video clips, vehicle trajectory, and time histories of eye movements enables a better determination of the possibility for an accident occurrence.

AB  - With the rapid urban growth and development, the quality of green space available is consequently been degrading. Furthermore, many land characteristics have been altered such that the whole water cycle has been significantly changed. Some of the considerable adverse effects occur by these changes include the increase of runoff which can lead to flooding and the poor quality of receiving waters. Therefore, to improve the quality of the prevailing surface conditions whilst managing the stormwater, Green Infrastructure (GI) have been introduced which is becoming one of the promising practices of restoring the natural environment across many countries around the world. The term GI in the literature is commonly referred as Low Impact Development (LID), Best Management Practices (BMP), Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUSD), Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) and Low Impact Urban Design and Development (LIUDD) in different contexts (Eliot and Trowsdale, 2006). GI in broader terms can be defined as an "interconnected network of green space that conserves natural systems and provides assorted benefits to human populations" (McMahon and Benedict, 2006). GI can be grouped into two main categories structural and non-structural. The former include green roofs, rainwater tanks, wetlands, bio swales, pervious pavement, stormwater detention systems, planter boxes, cisterns, rain barrels and downspout disconnection amongst others. Nonstructural GI is designing the buildings or roads to minimize the imperviousness, improvement of the infiltration ability of soils by amending the properties and improving the vegetation of specific site or region. (Eliot and Trowsdale, 2006)
   Though GI is best known as an alternative to conventional stormwater management strategies, it has been proven that apart from managing stormwater GI can provide a wide range of benefits known as Eco-system Services (ESS) (CNT, 2009). Such benefits include reducing Urban Heat Island (UHI), improving air quality, saving the energy, climate change and adaptation, improving habitats and community livability amongst others. Currently, different countries across the world are committing investments on promoting the benefits of having GI within their communities and therefore it is very important to have a comprehensive study on the value of the ESS they can provide. Such holistic assessment will demonstrate to stakeholders as well as the general public that the application of GIs not only a stormwater management strategy but have many social and environmental benefits. Furthermore, when these benefits can be transferred into monetary value then wider community will appreciate the importance of GI implementation in their society. ESS of GI in six main initial categories. They are water, energy, air, UHI, climate change and community liveability.
   The ESS of GI can be studied in terms of environmental, economic and social benefits. Since the representation of benefit of each of the ESS in monetary terms can concentrate the results in to a final common resource unit, the economic benefits of these practices can produce are used for the cumulative valuation in the framework development. The valuation is done by using formulas adopted by different researchers in previous studies and applied for the conditions in Melbourne Australia. Melbourne is the second largest city in Australia with a highest rate of urban growth. Due to this scenario the green space available within the area is alarmingly degraded by creating the importance among professionals and government bodies in developing new ways to improve the region's natural environment. Therefore, the aim of this project is to develop a framework for valuing ESS of GI for Melbourne, Australia. The framework is then applied to a hypothetical case study with a green roof area of 300 square meters considering rainfall, temperature, and pricing for utilities in Melbourne area. The results of the ESS assessment indicates that a green roof located in Melbourne can approximately reduce 93 kiloliters of rainfall runoff per year and provide an economic benefit of 1245 AUD per annum by considering its energy, air quality and climate change benefits.

AB  - Species habitat preferences can be obscured when individuals have been recorded in non-core habitats because of dispersal, spillover effects or spatial errors in observation locations. Disentangling the direct effects of the habitats species are observed in from the effects of proximity to other nearby habitats is especially challenging in fragmented landscapes, as many fragmentation metrics are correlated and it is difficult to prove independent effects. In this paper we addressed this issue by comparing a number of models based on predefined ecological theories. We compared models based on quantity of core habitat surrounding observations, proximity to core habitat, or a combination of the two to explain the observed distribution of the saltmarsh inhabiting white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) in coastal New South Wales, Australia. Proximity to core habitat was considered as either Euclidean distance or cost distance, and models were assessed using Akaike's information criterion and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve on 10 random subsets of the data. We found that all models performed similarly, with the combination of cost distance and the quantity of saltmarsh performing better, but not significantly so. We compared the advantages and disadvantages of different models and also present a model averaged result. Our models suggested that the majority of saltmarshes in New South Wales were too small to have a large effect on probability of occurrence. As climate change is expected to further reduce the amount of available saltmarsh through continued mangrove incursion, coastal populations of the white-fronted chat are expected to come under increasing threat. The conversion of grasslands to urban areas may also increase the effective distance between different populations of the species and reduce gene flow and rescue effects.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) offers a comprehensive approach to evaluate and improve the environmental impacts of pavements. First, a general pavement LCA methodology is created that describes the concepts necessary to conduct a comprehensive pavement LCA. Second, the methodology is applied to the life cycle of concrete pavements to quantify current emissions across the road network. System boundaries are drawn to include all phases of the pavement life cycle - materials production, construction, use, maintenance, and end of life. Greenhouse gas emissions are quantified for twelve functional units, which evaluate average conditions for each major roadway classification in the United States. The results present the relative contribution of each component in the life cycle, the annual emissions occurring during the 40-year analysis period, and the sensitivity of these results to model parameters. It is found for all roads that the majority of emissions occur in year one - from cradle-to-gate materials production, and pavement construction - primarily due to cement production. The results are most sensitive to traffic volume, and then to parameters affecting the cement production. Based on emissions and their sensitivity, the LCA results suggest three broad reduction approaches: reducing embodied emissions, reducing use phase emissions, and reducing end-of-life emissions.

AB  - The effects of riparian land uses on water quality and macroinvertebrate communities were examined in three headwater streams of the Taizi River in northeastern China. Land uses of forest, grassland, farmland, and villages were evaluated within different widths of riparian corridors (length = 3km upstream; width = 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500m). Overall, the results revealed a significant trend for each stream linking a relatively low proportion of farmland in the riparian corridor with better water quality and healthier macroinvertebrate community. Cluster analysis confirmed significant variation in the macroinvertebrate communities found among the three streams. Correlation analysis identified significant positive correlations between the proportion of farmland and metrics of water quality (conductivity, dissolved solids, and total nitrogen) at small (25-50m) to medium (100-200m) widths of riparian corridors. The sensitive taxa of stoneflies and functional feeding groups of scrapers and predators were good predictors of anthropogenic disturbance associated with the proportional extent of farmland and village land use across most of all riparian widths. In contrast, correlations between biodiversity indices and proportion of villages and between bioassessment indices and proportion of farmland were only significant at relatively small widths (25-50m) of riparian corridors. The canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the proportions of forest (25m), farmland (200m), grassland (200m), and village (100m) showed independent effects on the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrates in the Taizi River. The first two axes contributed 34.6% of the cumulative percent variance of species-environment relations. This research indicates that management of riparian corridor land uses at relatively small to medium widths (25-200m) could be effective in restoring water quality and macroinvertebrate communities in headwater stream regions.

AB  - This article seeks to analyze the relationship between public space - the physical- and civic action - the social-. It uses the 15-M Movement as a case study, framed within the global occupation movement. It will examine the self-organization and the use of new technologies and their potential for citizens' action and transformation of public space, as well as the phenomenon of occupation and empowerment. How public is public space? The research focuses on the two opposing actors involved in public space: the legal and regulated (current planning system) and the spontaneous and often illegal (social movements). The conclusions lead towards ways to achieve a balance between the design of a public space as a place for representation and for action, as both an insurgent and institutional space, halfway between a rigid and regulated design and a flexible and spontaneous one.

AB  - Debris flow is a rapid flow which could lead to severe flooding with catastrophic consequences such as damage to properties and loss of human lives. It is important to study the movement of debris flow. Since during a debris flow process, the erosion and deposition processes are important, the no entrainment assumption is not acceptable. In this study, first we considered the debris flow as equivalent fluid and adopted the depth-averaged govern equations to simulate the movements and evolution of river bed. Secondly, the set of partial differential equations was solved numerically by means of explicit staggered leap-frog scheme that is accurate in space and time. The grid of difference scheme was derived from GIS raster data. Then the simulation results can be displayed by GIS and easily used to form the hazard maps. Finally, the numerical model coupled with GIS is applied to simulate the debris flow occurred on Oct. 20th, 2010, in Amamioshima City, Japan. The simulation reproduces the movement, erosion and deposition. The results are shown to be consistent with the field investigation.

AB  - Mass discontent erupted in 2011 through the Occupy Wall Street movement (OWS) when people took to the streets expressing frustration with growing economic disparities under neoliberal policies. In this article, I document how grassroots activists in New York City used OWS to galvanize energy for educational justice. Calling themselves Occupy the Department of Education, these teacher activists (TAs) critically analyzed wealth and power stratification as well as corporate-driven, market-based education reform. Through interviews, I explore TAs' frustration with policies undermining the participation; voices; and power of parents, students, and educators and detail grassroots organizing strategies used to respond to neoliberal reform. These five strategies included unmasking the neoliberal narrative of meritocracy and choice; diverting discontent with the economic crisis toward educational justice; amplifying voices through tools that allowed for democratic participation of people silenced by current structures; claiming coalition among diverse groups rather than embracing competitive models; and generating power by organizing for change. Ultimately, I reveal that by using such strategies, TAs worked to build a movement to confront neoliberal school reforms that they saw undermining public education.

AB  - Debris flow with wide grain size gradation, high unit weight, and non-uniformity of both flowing resistance and velocity occurs frequently at Jiangjia gully of Dongchuan area, in Kunming City of Yunnan Province, which is called as non-homogeneous debris flow and behaves with the properties of solid-liquid two-phase flows. This study has simulated the occurrence of natural debris flow by blocking up water flow from the upper reaches of a branch at Jiangjia gully. By field investigation and experiments, physical properties such as the grain size gradations of circulation zones and unit weight are analyzed synthetically to find out their effects on movement for non-homogeneous debris flow. Furthermore, this study will combine with the critical value 2.234 t/m(3) of unit weight revealed before in our research, which means that flowing velocities of solid phase and liquid phase behave with opposite disciplines with a unit weight larger than 2.234 t/m(3) and lower than 2.234 t/m(3). The research helps both investigating mechanism of non-homogeneous debris flow and designing debris flow disaster control projects.

AB  - In many Chinese cities, motorized vehicles (M-vehicles) move slowly at intersections due to the interference of a large number of non-motorized vehicles (NM-vehicles). The slow movement makes a part of M-vehicles fail to leave intersections timely after the traffic signal turns red, and thereby conflicts between vehicles from two directions occur. The phenomenon was analyzed graphically by using the cumulative vehicle curve. Delays in three cases were modeled and compared: NM-vehicle priorities and M-vehicle priorities with all-red intervals unable to release all vehicles, and longer all-red intervals ensuring release all vehicles. Marginal delays caused by two illegal behaviors that occasionally happened in mixed traffic intersections were also investigated. It is concluded that increasing the speed of M-vehicles leaving intersections and postponing the entering of NM-vehicles are the keys in mathematics, although they are uneasy in disordered mixed traffic intersections due to a dilemma between efficiency and orders in reality. The results could provide implications for the traffic management in the cities maintaining a large number of M- and NM-vehicles.

TI  - The possibility of using remote sensing technology of lidars for monitoring ecosystem health by detecting habitat condition
T2  - XIX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HIGH-POWER LASER SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS 2012
LA  - English
CP  - 19th International Symposium on High-Power Laser Systems and Applications (HPLS&A)
AB  - Since the emergence of laser and henceforth laser remote sensing in the 1960's, lidar (light detecting and ranging) technology has became a significant tool for the detection of various phenomena like wind direction and intensity, atmospheric temperature, urban and rural topography, forest fires, ocean planktonic development, and detection of various constituants such as tropospheric aerosols, stratospheric ozone, trace chemicals and etc.
   In 2009, a homemade multiwavelength Raman aerosol lidar (named MRC K09) was designed, developed and installed in the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) Marmara Research Center (MRC), and since 21 February 2011, it has been accepted to EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network). Since 2009, aerosol spatio-temporal distribution and microphysical properties have been investigated in the extremely industrialized vicinity [1,2]. MRC K09 lidar uses a Quantel Brilliant B Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) with the second and third optical harmonics at 532 and 355 nm, and a homemade Newtonian 40 cm aperture 120 cm focal length telescope. It has 7 channel spectrum analyzer detecting: parallel and perpendicular polarizations at 355 nm, elastic signals at 532 and 1064 nm, Raman signal of molecular nitrogen at 387 nm and Raman signal of water vapor at 408 nm (excited with 355 laser line), and Raman signal for molecular nitrogen at 608 nm (excited with 532 nm laser line).
   In Spring 2010, preliminary applications for the determination of forest tree species and of forest health in the Black Sea Area using an aeroborne lidar in collaboration with Bartin University, Bartin, Turkey have been made. In early 2011, a fluorescence module utilizing a Princeton Instruments PI-MAX3 1024x256 resolution CCD camera with a Princeton Instruments Acton SP 2500 0.500 m Imaging Triple Grating Monochromator/Spectograph was connected to the MRC K09 lidar system, and the first remote measurements of chlorophyll from different types of trees were made. Figure 1 demonstrates the results of these measurements, which must be considered as preliminary and in the future, the measurements can be carried out by the lidar mounted on an aircraft to cover large spatial areas.
   One of the most important reasons for biodiversity loss, habitat loss and fragmentation can be monitored in large areas by aeroborne lidars and therefore the extent of the situation can be accessed precisely, faster and more efficiently. This paper aims to give a brief overview to show the possibility of detecting the detailed situations of the habitats on terrain surfaces using lidar technology by summarizing the successful examples which have been realized thus far in different types of ecosystems like savannas, forest and grasslands.

AB  - Though the titles and acronyms of policies differ from one country to another, throughout the world a political project has taken root with the assumption that to reduce poverty and inequality, governments should privatize school systems, alter teaching from a career to contract labor, use standardized tests to make students and teachers accountable, and curtail the power and legal rights of teachers unions. This article explores how teacher activists might help reverse neoliberal educational politics by developing mutually-respectful collaborations among teachers, parents and youth in poor communities, in school-based and system-wide partnerships that involve teachers unions. Analyzing events as they were experienced and influenced by a New York City-based NGO of teachers committed to educational justice, the author examines the landscape of educational reform politics and the creation of new spaces and organizational forms not confined by collective bargaining jurisdictions and traditional bargaining demands. The study suggests that development of a social movement of teachers that might edge teachers unions in the direction of social movement teacher unionism may not occur in a linear fashion. Rather, a complex push-pull dynamic occurs with each change, opening and retracting space, remaking networks and influencing longstanding personal ties among activists.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze data gathered in 1998 and 2011 from representative samples of women secondary school principals in Texas to identify differences in personal, professional, leadership, and school characteristics.
   Design/methodology/approach - Two proportionate, random samples were drawn of women secondary principals 13 years apart. The Texas Education Directory provided the sampling frame and school data were downloaded from the Public Education Information Management System. Principals were sent surveys including measures of situational and distributed leadership as well as demographic questions. Response rates of 65 percent and 42 percent were achieved on the 1998 and 2011 surveys respectively.
   Findings - While the percentage of secondary schools led by women principals shows little change and is similar to previous research, a more nuanced examination of these women and their schools evidences progress. The diversity for women administrators has increased and women are more likely to hold positions in urban schools. Years of teaching experience has decreased and women appear to be entering the profession at a younger age. Change on both variables reflects averages for male principals. Leadership scores indicated lower adaptability and more directive styles for women in 2011; however, scores on the Distributed Leadership Inventory were high.
   Originality/value - Schools led by women in 2011 possessed a larger proportion of students of poverty but no differences were noted in school enrollment or student passing rates on accountability tests. The authors encourage districts to continue fair hiring policies and argue women have become more competitive for the large urban high school principalships.

AB  - The traffic flow at intersections is generally chaotic, and signalization is a control measure to reduce this chaos. Heterogeneous traffic at signalized intersections behave much differently from homogeneous traffic. Also, in many countries, nonlane-based traffic prevails; hence, designing control systems for such situations is a challenging task. Traffic simulation helps the analyst to model the behavior of such complex systems. Cellular automata (CA), a recent entrant in traffic flow modeling, represents the traffic flow by means of simple rules, and thus has proved to be a versatile tool in traffic simulation. The present study aims to develop a computationally efficient traffic flow simulation model integrating the concepts of cellular automata and driver-vehicle-objects, thus making a behavioral model of traffic. The model emphasizes the diversity in human behavior, and represents the traffic using the minimal modeling concept of CA. To represent multiple vehicle types, a multicell representation was adopted. Further, to address the issue of nonlane-based movement, new lateral movement rules were proposed. The model incorporated behavior at amber and lateral movements, thus attempting to achieve a near to reality representation of nonlane-based heterogeneous traffic. The model was calibrated and validated using delay data from selected intersections in India. This model was then used to predict saturation flows at signalized intersections. The model performed reasonably well in predicting the delays, but the saturation flow values showed up to 30% variability. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000207.

AB  - The anthropogenic movement of Eucalyptus species beyond their natural distributions is increasing the opportunity for interspecific hybridisation. The conservation implications arising from hybridisation between indigenous and introduced eucalypt species in modified urban landscapes is an increasingly important management issue that requires an assessment of risk. It has been claimed that much of the tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala DC., Myrtaceae) seed in Kings Park, a large urban bushland remnant in Perth, Western Australia, is of hybrid origin with introduced eastern Australian eucalypts, and especially with E. cladocalyx. Using molecular markers, we tested this claim and determined whether hybridisation in tuart is a conservation management issue in Kings Park, as well as the adjacent Bold Park. Eight microsatellite markers were used to genotype 220 open-pollinated tuart seedlings from 19 families. Allele frequency estimates for tuart were generated by genotyping 42 mature tuart trees. Forty-four trees of four alternative species thought to be capable of hybridising with tuart in these parks, including two non-indigenous species, E. cladocalyx and E. camaldulensis, and two indigenous species, E. decipiens and E. rudis, were also genotyped. Pairwise F-ST between tuart and each alternative species for these markers ranged from 0.105 to 0.204. A hybrid-index analysis of seedling genotypes showed no significant evidence for hybridisation, and no alternative species private alleles (n=35) were found in any tuart offspring genotypes. A likelihood analysis showed that the maximum likelihood of observing no private alleles of the alternative species in the progeny occurred at a hybridisation frequency of zero for all four alternative species. We conclude that hybridisation between tuart and non-indigenous species is not currently a conservation management issue in Kings Park and Bold Park. Rather, the invasion of pure non-indigenous species, and in particular E. cladocalyx, as weeds into bushland is of greater management concern.

AB  - Dengue virus transmission occurs in both epidemic and endemic cycles across tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Incidence is particularly high in much of Southeast Asia, where hyperendemic transmission plagues both urban and rural populations. However, endemicity has not been established in some areas with climates that may not support year-round viral transmission. An understanding of how dengue viruses (DENV) enter these environments and whether the viruses persist in inapparent local transmission cycles is central to understanding how dengue emerges in areas at the margins of endemic transmission. Dengue is highly endemic in tropical southern Vietnam, while increasingly large seasonal epidemics have occurred in northern Viet Nam over the last decade. We have investigated the spread of DENV-1 throughout Vietnam to determine the routes by which the virus enters northern and central regions of the country. Phylogeographic analysis of 1,765 envelope (E) gene sequences from Southeast Asia revealed frequent movement of DENV between neighboring human populations and strong local clustering of viral lineages. Long-distance migration of DENV between human population centers also occurred regularly and on short time-scales, indicating human-mediated viral invasion into northern Vietnam. Human populations in southern Vietnam were found to be the primary source of DENV circulating throughout the country, while central and northern Vietnam acted as sink populations, likely due to reduced connectedness to other populations in the case of the central regions and to the influence of temperature variability on DENV replication and vector survival and competence in the north. Finally, phylogeographic analyses suggested that viral movement follows a gravity model and indicates that population immunity and physical and economic connections between populations may play important roles in shaping patterns of DENV transmission.
   Author Summary Reports from sub-tropical regions of the world suggest a growing risk of introduction and establishment of dengue viruses (DENV) in new locales. Recent dengue epidemics in northern Viet Nam present an opportunity to study how DENV invades and spreads in these environments. The proximity of this region to tropical areas experiencing year-round endemic DENV transmission makes it an ideal site for studying the effects of human population movement and climate on DENV emergence. We performed a phylogenetic analysis using DENV-1 envelope gene sequences from Southeast Asia. We show that DENV are regularly imported into northern and central Viet Nam from southern Vietnam, and that increasingly large seasonal epidemics in the north are caused by newly introduced viruses each year. While tropical Vietnam maintains localized virus populations for multiple years, cool winter temperatures in sub-tropical northern Viet Nam may reduce mosquito populations and virus replication to levels that are not conducive to year-round DENV transmission. Finally, we found that the dispersal of DENV across the region is well-described using human movement and immunity data, and believe that increased epidemiological, entomological, and virological surveillance are needed to understand the processes by which endemic DENV transmission becomes established in new populations.

AB  - Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is the one of core technologies that provides various services in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Major services provided with multi-hop broadcasting communication are emergency warning service, forward collision warning service, and traffic information service. Frequent disconnections and low throughput due to high mobility of vehicles, fluctuant density of vehicles in traffic conditions, and interruptions of communication propagation caused by obstacles such as buildings occur in urban VANET environment. Therefore, development of a suitable multi-hop broadcast protocol that considers these characteristics of VANET should be needed. In this paper we suggest the improved distance-based multi-hop broadcast scheme for intervehicle communication. We apply two major approaches to exponential waiting time for faster collision avoidance dissemination of urgent messages and to high prioritized intersection waiting time for more probability of dissemination of messages toward out of intersections. In addition, we have applied the Manhattan map model and its traffic movement pattern into the simulation for more reliable performance evaluation in urban environments. As a result, the proposed scheme improves the performance as compared with basic distance-based broadcast. Our distance-based multi-hop broadcast scheme guarantees not only rapid broadcast but also reliable probability of successful transmission.

AB  - At 12:51 pm local time on 22 February 2011, a M 6.2 aftershock of the 4 September 2010, Darfield earthquake shook the city of Christchurch, New Zealand. The aftershock occurred on an unmapped fault less than 10 km from the city centre resulting in significant damage, particularly in the Central Business District (CBD). The earthquake resulted in the collapse of two reinforced concrete office buildings, one parking garage, and numerous unreinforced masonry buildings, including many heritage structures, leading to 185 deaths. Liquefaction was wide spread in the CBD and the eastern suburbs, resulting in foundation movement for housing and office buildings alike. Many buildings in the CBD experienced severe damage, some requiring demolition, necessitating careful controlled access to the CBD in the months following the earthquake. This paper summarizes the recorded earthquake shaking and observed damage to concrete buildings in CBD, with a specific focus on identifying future research and possible changes for seismic design practice and codes in Canada to address the Christchurch observations.

KW  - URBANISM
KW  - BORDER
AB  - The fight against impunity continues along Mexico's border, especially in the industrial hub of Ciudad Juarez. In the 1990s feminists brought this fight to international attention as they launched a transnational justice movement against feminicidio, the killing of women with impunity. In this paper I create a feminist and Marxist frame to show that there is much to be learned from the fight against feminicidio for the ongoing struggles in a border city that is now also notorious for juvenicidio, the killing of youth with impunity, which is occurring in relation to the Mexican government's declaration of war against organized crime. By situating these justice struggles within a context of North American securitization and neoliberal gentrification along the Mexico-US border, I argue that the feminist fight against impunity exposes the synergy of symbolic and material processes within the drug war. And I argue that this synergy seeks to generate value through the extermination of whole populations, especially of working poor women and their families in this border city today.

Four and two stages of excavation along the respective east and west sides of the site were planned. A row of drilled shafts was installed along each side before excavation. Severe slope movement occurred and extended outside the project area on both sides during excavation due to a weak clay layer overlying bedrock, unpredicted local trough between the soil/rock interface and improper design of the drilled shafts. Study of the possible reasons for failure includes monitoring results evaluation and numerical studies by means of the computer code Plaxis.

AB  - The paper studies the mobilization occurred in June 2013 in Brazil, initially under the banner of the Movement Free Pass, but without the existence of a lead, but multiple voices that alternate in search of social and economic change. The object of study is the communication made through social networks and their realization, or realization, the streets of major cities. The rallies demonstrate the power of communications media and a new phenomenon of talk, the use of social networks, now as uniting factor and not just a showcase of everyday life. The internet has become a new means of communication easy and free access, in addition to its fast dissipation data. Thus, the youth was used such technology to an uprising in the pursuit of social improvement of the cities where marches happened. Such a move still without an academic and social needs to be discussed so that, in addition to understood, can expand contributions to society, helping it in its claims. Was chosen as the site for the #causabrasil study and understanding of issues in which the public expresses dissatisfaction. The site performs an analysis with the combination of hastags a list of pre-registered and a list of terms used by different users of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and Google, through monitoring tool Seekr, and an infographic presents the main political demands of the population.

AB  - Despite with the current policies to reduce hazardous particle emission, global emission is still expected continue to grow over the coming decades. Over the course of the 21st century, the increase in emission at or above their current rate would very likely induce changes in the climate system larger than those observed in the 20th century. Haze is traditionally an atmospheric phenomenon where dust, smoke and other dry particles obscure the clarity of the sky. Haze often occurs when dust and smoke particles accumulate in relatively dry air. When weather conditions block the dispersal of smoke and other pollutants they concentrate and form a usually low-hanging shroud that impairs visibility and may become a respiratory health threat. A new method of collecting data for haze based environment using Zigbee technology and its design method of software and hardware is developed in this paper. MQ2 sensor and PIC16F887 are used for data collection collected and transmitted through Zigbee wireless technology to a personal computer. The data is then processed by digital computer to classify according the level of air pollutant index.

AB  - Mass movements in Brazil are common phenomena, especially during strong rainfall events that occur frequently in the summer season. These phenomena cause losses of lives and serious damage to roads, bridges, and properties. Moreover, the illegal occupation by slums on the slopes around the cities intensifies the effect of the mass movement. This study aimed to develop a methodology that combines models of shallow landslides and debris-flows in order to create a map with landslides initiation and debris-flows volume and runout distance. The study area comprised of two catchments in Rio de Janeiro city: Quitite and Papagaio that drained side by side the west flank of the Macico da Tijuca, with an area of 5 km(2). The method included the following steps: (a) location of the susceptible areas to landslides using SHALSTAB model; (b) determination of rheological parameters of debris-flow from the back-analysis technique; and (c) combination of SHALSTAB and FLO-2D models to delineate the areas more susceptible to mass movements. These scenarios were compared with the landslide and debris-flow event of February 1996.Many FLO-2D simulations were exhaustively made to estimate the rheological parameters from the back-analysis technique. Those rheological coefficients of single simulation were back-calculated by adjusting with area and depth of the debris-flow obtained from field data. The initial material volume in the FLO-2D simulations was estimated from SHALSTAB model. The combination of these two mathematical models, SHALSTAB and FLO-2D, was able to predict both landslides and debris-flow events. Such procedures can reduce the casualties and property damage, delineating hazard areas, to estimate hazard intensities for input into risk studies providing information for public policy and planning.

AB  - The assessment of the impact of urban area shield tunneling on adjacent pile foundations is essential to ensure the stability and integrity of the piled buildings. Sandy cobble strata has force transmission feature of strong dispersion; therefore the equilibrium state of original strata would be easily destroyed by shield tunneling. In this study, model tests referring to the Chengdu Metro Line 1 and using the Phi 520 mm EPB model shield machine are carried out to investigate the impact of shield tunneling on the existing pile foundation deformation and internal forces. Meanwhile, particle distinct element method is applied to analyze the soil particle movement feature surrounding the pile foundation from the micro view. Results showed that soil disturbance surrounding the pile foundation caused by shield tunneling makes the ground surface subsidence and pile foundation tilt, leading to the occurrence of stress concentration at the pile foundation base and nearby regions. Cutter head positive resistance and friction effect between shield machine and surrounding strata lead to the pile foundation three-dimensional movement and deformation during the shield tunneling.

AB  - Scale and symmetry in monumental architecture are embraced by archaeologists as the primary vocabulary in past statements of power. In ancient Mesopotamia in particular, the excessive size of public buildings implied the control of both space and people. The predictable, often symmetrical plans regulated and reflected control over users' behavior. However, interpretations based on plans alone remain simplistic; analyses from ground level can better encompass the lived experience of a building's occupants or users. Close ground-level phenomenological analysis of movement through the Neo-Assyrian capital city of Khorsabad (constructed and inhabited 717-706 B.C.E.), particularly its citadel, indicates that manipulation of fields of view, interplay of light and shadow, and variations in sound were equally important means of conveying ideological messages.*

AB  - An understanding of the evolutionary history and dynamics of invasive species is required for the construction of predictive models of future spread and the design of biological management measures. The black rat (Rattus rattus) is a major vertebrate invader with a worldwide distribution. Despite the severe ecological, economic and health impacts of this species, its evolutionary history has been little studied. We carried out extensive specimen sampling in Senegal, West Africa, and used microsatellite markers to describe the pattern and processes of invasion in this large continental area. The genetic data obtained were combined with historical knowledge concerning the presence of this species in Senegal. Data were analysed by a combination of Bayesian clustering and approximate Bayesian computation methods. The invasion pathways closely paralleled the history of human trade routes in Senegal. In several places, we detected the occurrence of multiple introductions from genetically different sources. Long-distance migration between towns and villages was also observed. Our findings suggest that genetic bottlenecks and admixture have played a major role in shaping the genetics of invasive black rats. These two processes may generate genetic novelty and favour rapid evolution along the invasion pathways.

AB  - Background: A 2005 Institute of Medicine report argues that "prevention of obesity in children and youth is, ultimately, about community," yet the literature lacks empirical research on what communities are doing to prevent childhood obesity. This research helps fill this gap and highlights promising practices.
   Cases: This research entailed exploratory analysis of three descriptive case studies of community efforts to prevent childhood obesity in the northeastern United States: Shape Up Somerville in Massachusetts, MA (urban), Whole Community Project in New York, NY (semiurban), and Eat Well Play Hard Chemung in NY (semirural). Data included stakeholder interviews (n = 23), participant observation n >= 7 events and meetings/case), and document analysis (n approximate to 100/case) from project inceptions until March, 2010. Meeting participation was tracked. Data were coded for actions and strategies. Actions were mapped to an adapted version of the ANalysis Grid for Environments Linked to Obesity (ANGELO) framework.
   Discussion: These three projects were successful in changing physical environments for food and activity through program and event offerings. The projects were less active in generating policy and economic change. The scale and scope of actions related to project longevity. Demographics of key project stakeholders may have hinged on individual and institutional identities of project facilitators and on intentionality of inclusion strategies.
   Conclusion: Such projects could likely generate greater scope and scale of environmental changes to prevent childhood obesity if funding agencies provided long-term financial support and technical assistance, even if at lower levels. Diversity of participation would also benefit from stable support and from dispersal of decision-making powers, including through distributed funding.

AB  - Episodes of high atmospheric load of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), where the concentration is over 50 mu g m(-3) hourly average value, occur about 80 times a year in Reykjavik (data from 2007 to 2009). H2S originates mainly from two geothermal power plants 25-30 km (south-)east of Reykjavik, at Hellisheidi and Nesjavellir. Certain weather-dependent dispersion conditions, such as wind, cloud cover and air temperature, allow the transport of emissions towards Reykjavik and the neighboring cities, causing local air pollution. High concentrations of H2S occur within a narrow range of weather conditions, namely slow (mean value 2 +/- 1 m s(-1)) easterly (114 degrees +/- 23 degrees) winds, together with cold air temperatures (median value -3 degrees C) and preferably no, or little, cloud cover. A classification of weather types shows the preferred occurrence of high H2S concentrations in connection with low atmospheric exchange and autochthonous weather. Stable atmospheric stratification and inversions enable the transport of H2S emissions to Reykjavik. The measured concentrations, the short lived peaks in concentration and different values at nearby measurement stations, indicate a very narrow plume, which fits well with a Gaussian plume distribution model.

AB  - Excavations in urban developed areas were commonly supported by diaphragm walls with internal braces or tieback anchors. There are still required the necessary civil works to serve the demands and also to solve the environmental problems. Wales and cross-lot struts are by far the predominant method for wall support, the large working space inside the excavation provided by a tieback anchor system has a significant construction advantage. This paper aims to evaluate the soil stiffness parameters of the alluvial Taipei soil for tie-back diaphragm wall based on back analysis of case study. The case histories of the Taipei County Administration Centre (TCAC) and NTU Hospital (NTUH) were studied in this paper. The deformation analysis was carried out by available finite element analysis tool using PLAXIS. In the analysis, beam element method together with an elastic perfect plastic soil model was used to design the diaphragm wall and the tieback anchor system. The soil was modelled as Mohr-Coulomb model. According to the basic design, the clay deposits arc modelled as undrained behaviour while silty-sand behaves in drained condition. The simulation results show that the maximum horizontal movement occurred at around the bottom of wall. At the final stage of construction, the root mean square deviation (RSMD) between measured and calculated the wall movement was 4% and 7% respectively at TCAC and NTUH sites. It was concluded that tied-back diaphragm wall can be satisfactorily modelled using elasto-plastic Mohr-Coulomb soil model. The predicted soil's modulus of elasticity can be obtained from the SPT-N relationship, for clay deposit layer and for silty-sand deposit. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Numerous plays playas occur on valley floors of endorehic basins in arid regions of the western USA. Their openness makes them attractive for hiking, vehicle travel, military, and other uses when dry. Branchiopod crustacean dormant egg banks survive in these systems and are a rich food resource for migrating birds. Brachniecta gigas Lynch, 1937, B. mackini Dexter, 1956, and Lepiduras lemmoni Holmes, 1895, and Moina cf. macrocopa (Straus, 1820) occur in the Black Rock Desert playa, Nevada, USA. We collected playa egg bank samples to determine effects of human use in three studies. We compared intact egg and ephippia density in virgin playa areas with: 1) a heavily used vehicle track, and 2) recreational camping and vehicle activity mitigated by dust abatement in Black Rock City (site of the Burning Man Festival). We also attempted to quantify changes in intact egg and ephippia density through repeated vehicle travel over a track on virgin playa. We found no observed decrease in intact egg or ephippia density attributed to incrementally increased vehicle travel over virgin playa, which may be attributed to strength of the playa substrate matrix. Differences in intact egg and ephippia density were substantially lower in heavily used vehicle tracks than in adjacent playa, but differences were not statistically significant. Density of intact eggs and ephippia in Black Rock City were lower following the festival, but differences were statistically significant only for eggs in camping areas and not roads. Weak effects observed on these roads may be attributed to dust abatement that maintained substrate density.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the microseismicity and seismotectonics of the eastern South Caspian Sea region, where the East Alborz mountains descend to meet the South Caspian Lowlands of NE Iran. To better understand the present-day tectonics and seismicity of this region, which includes the cities of Gorgan and Gonbad-e-Qabus (combined population 500 000), we installed a temporary local seismic network across the area for 6 months between 2009 and 2010. We analysed the seismicity and focal mechanisms together with data from the permanent networks of the Institute of Geophysics, University of Tehran (IGUT) and the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (IIEES), based in Tehran. Microseismicity is focused primarily on the Shahrud fault system, which bounds the east Alborz range to the south. Relatively few earthquakes are associated with the Khazar thrust fault, which bounds the north side of the range. A cluster of shallow microseismicity (<15 km depth) occurs 40 km north of the Khazar fault (within the South Caspian Lowlands; SCL), an area typically thought to be non-deforming. This area coincides with the location of three relatively deep thrust earthquakes (M-w 5.3-5.5) which occurred in 1999, 2004 and 2005. Inversion of teleseismic body waveforms allows us to constrain the depth of these earthquakes at 26-29 km. Although significant sedimentation throughout the SCL obscures any expression of recent fault activity at the surface, focal mechanisms of well-located events from the shallow cluster of micro-seismicity show a significant component of left-lateral strike-slip motion (assuming slip occurs on NE SW fault planes, typical of active faults in the region), as well as a small normal component. Inversion of traveltimes for well-located events in our network yields a velocity structure for the region, and a Moho depth of 41 km. The pattern of deep thrust and shallow normal seismicity could be explained by bending of the rigid South Caspian crust as it underthrusts the East Alborz mountains and Central Iran. Late Quaternary reorganization of drainage systems in the SCL may be the result of shallow normal fault activity within the SCL.

AB  - This paper has analyzed the effect of stack effect on natural ventilation with increasing shaft height in urban road tunnel fires by Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Results have shown that it is not the case that the higher the vertical shaft, the better the smoke exhausting effect. When shaft height increases to a certain value, the plug-holing effect occurs beneath smoke vent because of the excessive vertical inertia force induced by stack effect and the fresh air below smoke layer is drawn directly into the shaft, leading to the smoke exhausting process inefficiently. Based on the controlling inertia force acts on smoke movement, the exhausting process with different shaft heights can be divided into the horizontal inertia force control, the vertical inertia force control and the transition process between them. It comes to conclusion that the shaft can exhaust more smoke and avoid the plug-holing effect when it is at the critical plug-holing height under different heat release rates. So the critical plug-holing height is the optimal value for effective smoke exhausting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Focusing on the case of Bolivia, this paper analyzes when and why marginalized groups gain access to political power. The country's experience is puzzling. Though we would have expected the indigenous-led government that came to power in early 2006 to be more receptive to the claims of indigenous movements than to women, the opposite occurred. Indigenous groups received a mere 5% of parliamentary seats and women got a gender parity law. What explains these different results of women's and indigenous demands for political inclusion? Adopting an intersectional approach, we view marginalized groups not as a single category but as a collection of categories. Rather than a premise of politics, group unity is a political achievement. While women overcame divisions between white, urban feminists and indigenous women from popular sectors to lobby for gender parity, the indigenous movement remained divided over reserved seats and the project of indigenous autonomy more generally. Our analysis helps explain why quotas have brought women into power but not changed other features of politics and why empowerment has produced new hierarchies within the indigenous movement.

AB  - Introduced pollinator species may exacerbate the problems faced by pollinator communities, so the detection in 2006 of a new solitary bee, Anthidium manicatum, to New Zealand was concerning. We assess whether establishment of this wool-carder bee presents potential risks to native flora and fauna by recording its current distribution, which plant species it visits, which insects co-occur at these plants, and identifying which species this territorial bee attacks. Anthidium manicatum is now widespread in urban New Zealand. More than 80% of the plants visited by A. manicatum were exotic species (predominantly Lamiaceae and Plantaginaceae), although it also visited native species of Veronica (Plantaginaceae) and Lobelia (Campanulaceae). Anthidium manicatum primarily interacted with other introduced bees. Native Lasioglossum bees were seldom attacked and only for short durations. Further research is required, particularly on weeds, but we suggest that A. manicatum does not present a major direct threat to New Zealand's native flora and fauna.

AB  - Conflicts over siting of group homes for people transitioning out of homelessness or struggling with addiction illustrate the multiscalar dynamics at play between locally-based activism and supra-local laws. In Massachusetts, the state-scale legal environment limits the effectiveness of opposition to group housing; nonetheless, such opposition occurs at the municipal level. Drawing on media accounts, official documents, and interviews with stakeholders in conflicts over group home siting in Worcester, Massachusetts, I investigate the dynamics between neighborhood place claims, the responses of the local state, and the state-wide laws governing group home siting. Examining the legal frameworks relevant to social movement grievances demonstrate that law structures the political opportunities available for protest and local government response.

AB  - After more than 60 years of military occupation, 30 of these under violent military practices, a social movement forced the U.S. Navy from the island of Vieques. This victory would not have been possible without the highly effective organization of civil disobedience carried out on the island. But the sum total of the actions that eventually forced out the U.S. Navy, neither happened exclusively within the boundaries of Vieques, nor was carried out by Viequense residents alone. In this article we want to suggest that this amazing victorya testament of people's will in the face of globalizationis also a border-crossing tale. Drawing from interviews with key activists currently based in Puerto Rico and New York, this article will explore the myriad routes of connections enacted, maintained and negotiated within and beyond territorial and ethnic boundaries. It will particularly look at how various activists conjured networks of solidarity, kinship, political affiliation, and friendship, among others, in their quest to liberate the island from the U.S. military occupation. Under the backdrop of Obama's post-racial discourse, this paper illustrates how the Vieques movement circumvented the politics of Empire through creative maneuvers and negotiations.

AB  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic substances that have characteristics of persistence in the environment; transboundary movement, or the ability to travel long distances through air and water; toxicity; and bioaccumulation in living things. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a toxic chemical that never breaks down, was added to the Stockholm Convention on POPs and was listed in the Annex B restrictions with many exemptions to continue using PFOS. This study focused on the occurrence of PFOS in the water system of Bangkok, Thailand, including the Chao Phraya and Bang Pakong Rivers, tap water in industrial zones and residential areas, drinking water, and industrial wastewater. Seasonal effect of PFOS between dry season and wet season was also observed for more than 3 years. Solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled with HPLC-ESI-MS/MS was used for the analysis of these compounds. PFOS was detected in most water samples. The average concentration of PFOS in the Chao Phraya River (urban area) was 1.70 ng/L, whereas lower concentrations were detected in the Bang Pakong River (suburban area), residential tap water, and bottled drinking water, with averages of 0.7, 0.4, and 0.5 ng/L, respectively. Higher concentrations (an average of 25.1 ng/L) were found in industrial tap water, whose sources were from surfacewater near the industrial zones. Much higher concentrations were detected in industrial wastewater, with the maximum of 6; 100.8 ng/L. These results indicated that industrial wastewater was one of the major sources of PFOS contamination in the water system of the city of Bangkok. This study provided data on the spatial occurrence, its seasonal effect, and distribution of PFOS in the water environment of Bangkok and surrounding areas, which need continuous attention to this emerging contaminant.

AB  - Namatala wetland near the town of Mbale in the Eastern region of Uganda is a papyrus wetland that is subject to conversion for agriculture (mainly rice farming) and pollution by wastewater. The main goal of this study was to analyze the ecosystem functions and services of Namatala wetland and their drivers of change, and to suggest directions for sustainable use. Data on climate, hydrology, water quality, population and land use were collected. Stakeholder workshops were organized at national and local levels to identify stakeholder interests in the wetland and conflicts. The institutional context for management of Namatala wetland was analyzed. A qualitative assessment of the ecosystem services was performed. All results were integrated into a DPSIR network showing the drivers of change, impact on ecosystem services and possible responses for management. Results show that the communities around Namatala wetland strongly depend on the wetland ecosystem for provisioning services. A spatial gradient in ecosystem services was observed. The upper, converted part of the wetland is more important for provisioning services while the lower, more intact wetland supports regulating and habitat ecosystem services. The institutional framework is complex due to the involvement of several ministries at the national level and several levels of decentralized, local government. Horizontal and vertical coordination of policy implementation is weak. There are diverging perceptions among stakeholders about the priority issues in wetland management. Resource users worry about water and land use conflicts, while local and national government agencies are more concerned about agricultural encroachment and biodiversity loss. There are also differences in interpretation of land ownership between the national wetland policy and local customary arrangements. For sustainable management of Namatala wetland, there is a need for more horizontal and vertical coordination in wetland policy implementation, application of sustainable agriculture and integrated water and nutrient management techniques, and continued monitoring, research and capacity building to support adaptive management.

AB  - Communication technologies occupy a central place in contemporary theorizations of transnational social movement networks. Not only does the internet provide the technical infrastructure through which activists communicate and share information, increasing their capacity to introduce oppositional messages into the public realm (Castells); its network architecture is also closely linked to the organizational logic of contemporary social justice movements (Juris). While recognizing the fundamental importance of communication technologies for such movements, this article cautions against overly disembodied conceptions of transnational activist networks and highlights the need to pay attention to issues of place and scale, as well as the importance of affect in the construction of alternative global imaginaries. Through a case study of a small social forum event held in February 2010 in a poor urban community in the south of Brazil as part of the World Social Forum process, the article examines activists' use of communication technologies to construct transnational networks between different place-based actors. It shows that these practices are not simply concerned with establishing links between already existing places; the creation of networks is also inextricably bound up with particular constructions of place. By engaging in a politics that is simultaneously place-based and global in scope, these actors challenge traditional conceptions of scale as well as dominant epistemological paradigms.

AB  - Density currents occur in lakes and sea environments when two masses of water interact giving rise to a relative movement between them. Depending on the initial and boundary conditions, turbulence associated with them is able to lift the sediment. This fact can be a problem in places where the sediment is contaminated due to industrial activities. In 2001, a pollution episode occurred in the Flix reservoir (Tarragona, Spain), in which thousands of fish died and the water supply of cities such as Tarragona was affected. This study analyses the possibility of a density current due to a temperature difference as the explanation for this event. The previously developed one-dimensional, Lagrangian model BANG 1D of subaqueous turbid surges has been modified to incorporate temperature evolution. The obtained results show that a temperature difference can generate a density current that is able to resuspend the sediment although the grade of erosion highly depends on the initial velocity of the current.

AB  - The early years of XX.century, The Ottoman Empire's political and military issues had been caused by public order incidents in various parts of the country. During that time, in the provience of Aydin, Denizli Sandjak, various public order events, had occurred too. These were caused by bandits, military deserters, prison deserters and the Local Rums. At the end of World War I, Moundros treaty signed between Ottoman Empires and the Entente Powers, after that, the preparation of the base occupies by the central and local governments to prevent the deterioration of public order in the native people and the minorities. However the Rum minority in Western Anatolia region had been prepared the base for the Greek occupation the public order movement disturbance as well as other cities in the region of Denizli in the events that had increased Sandjak. In the meantime the security forces to ensure public order of Denizli civil administrators wanted to increase the number of claims but were not taken into occount by the central government.

AB  - The Combination of sea surface height (SSH) of satellite altimetry and tide gauge (TG) data with control of GNSS data is proposed as an alternative method of detecting vertical movement of South Java island due to the subduction process. Before the combination, both SSHs have to be preprocessed, especially the satellite altimetry data over coastal area which is noisy due to land contamination signal and fast change of meteorological condition as the location shifts from land to ocean. Preprocessing data was done through retracking waveform altimetry data using two retracking methods. The first processing result of Jason-1 data shows that several complex patterns have occured on the altimetry waveform over the coast of Java Island. It also indicates that the position of the leading edge (PLE) has shifted for about 1.01 - 1.7 from the value of on-board PLE, resulting in the amount of correction of within +/- 0.68m. At the same time, the TG data have also been preprocessed to address the gap, spike and change in reference before re-sample following the altimetry sampling time. Using a matlab developed-program, three main problems on TG data could be resolved, and the final TG data has adequate quality for the study. Finally, the GNSS measurement at the tide gauges stations have been processed using GAMIT software to compute the velocity of the crustal movement in 3D, as the control of the proposed-method. Based on statistical testing, it is identified that there is a significant difference in all 3D components of four stations with velocity of 2 - 5 cm/year except for Tanjung Mas station, city of Semarang, that has been experiecning rapid land subsidence.

AB  - The Greater Tehran Area is the most important city of Iran and hosts about 20% of the country's population. Despite the presence of major faults and the occurrence of historical earthquakes, the seismicity is relatively low at present. Thus, it is important to estimate the ground motion for preventive, reliable seismic hazard assessment. An earthquake with magnitude M-w = 4, which occurred close to Tehran, 17 October 2009, is the first local earthquake that has been recorded by the local strong ground motion network in Tehran. To simulate the ground motion caused by the earthquake a hybrid technique is used. It combines two methods: the analytical modal summation and the numerical finite difference, taking advantage of the merits of both. The modal summation is applied to simulate wave propagation from the source to the sedimentary basin and finite difference to propagate the incoming wavefield in the laterally heterogeneous part of the structural model that contains the sedimentary basin. Synthetic signals are simulated along two East-West and Southeast-Northwest profiles. Frequency, response spectra, and time domain, waveforms and peak values, parameters are computed synthetically and compared with observed records. Results show agreement between observed and simulated signals. The simulation shows local site amplification as high as 6 in the southern part of Tehran.

AB  - Previous research [Hoffmann, E. R. 2011. Capture of Shrinking Targets. Ergonomics 54 (6): 519-530] reported experiments for capture of shrinking targets where the target decreased in size at a uniform rate. This work extended this research for targets having a shrink-size versus time pattern that of an aircraft receding from an observer. In Experiment 1, the time to capture the target in this case was well correlated in terms of Fitts' index of difficulty, measured at the time of capture of the target, a result that is in agreement with the balanced' model of Johnson and Hart [Johnson, W. W., and Hart, S. G. 1987. Step Tracking Shrinking Targets. Proceedings of the human factors society 31st annual meeting, New York City, October 1987, 248-252]. Experiment 2 measured the probability of target capture for varying initial target sizes and target shrink rates constant, defined as the time for the target to shrink to half its initial size. Data of shrink time constant for 50% probability of capture were related to initial target size but did not greatly affect target capture as the rate of target shrinking decreased rapidly with time. Practitioner Summary: Shrinking targets occur in applications such as gunnery, computer games and game shooting, where the object to be shot or captured moves away from an observer. Times for capture of shrinking targets are developed in terms of a modified form of Fitts' law.

AB  - We investigated the variability of shoreline position of three adjacent pocket beaches at Barcelona city (NW Mediterranean) over a period of two years. Daily measurements of shoreline position were extracted from high-resolution video images and used to determine shoreline variability. Using empirical orthogonal function analysis we determine two dominant modes of shoreline variability. For all beaches analysed the mode that explains most of the variability (around 70%) describes the beach plan-form rotation which primarily occurs at the seasonal scale. The cross-shore translation of the beach profile, is described by the 2nd mode which explains around 30%. Both types of shoreline movement have been related to the previous nearshore conditions. This relationship was explored standardizing the translation/rotation of the shoreline and comparing it with time-averages of the cross-shore energy flux (EFcsh) and the energy flux direction (EFD). Averages over 7 to 12 days of EFcsh were significantly correlated to the translation movement. Plan-form rotation was well described by 28 to 40 day-averaging of EFD. Comparing results from the three beaches we determined that the time required to average the previous wave conditions depends on the beach characteristics (beach length and sediment grain size) in such a way that the greater the length of the beach and its sediment grain size, the slower its response.

AB  - The traditional urban texture of Diyarbakir is founded in the city walls. The traditional Diyarbakir houses have their own architectural properties, which are shaped with the effect of family structure, economical structure, cultural interaction, city walls, climate, geological structure and building materials. They also take an important place in the cultural heritage context due to their distinctive architectural characteristics. These independent houses that are isolated from the outside are located in a court. The traditional Diyarbakir houses, which are designed as summer, winter and spring places regarding to the effect of climatic factors, are generally formed of a basement, ground floor and the first floor. The basement is the area where the fuel (wood and coal) and foods for winter are stored. The service and living spaces are found at the ground and first floors. The wide entrances (ivans) and the rooms with their sliced, flat arched, quadrangular windows with columns are the building elements, which give movement and richness to the courtyard. While the walls built by basalt stones, the authentic flat roofs of the houses are covered by earthen materials. During the recent years, restoration works are conducted on monumental buildings and traditional houses in Diyarbakir by some state institutions and organizations, and, private enterprises, which enable them to be utilized in today's needs assessment. The most of the traditional houses offer a wide range of usage possibilities take an important place among them. The authentic textures of many of those houses have been destroyed due to the renovation works since 1960s. In these works, mostly additional floor and space constructions conducted by the owners. Deterioration and degeneration of the structures of the houses have increased because of the lack of proper control mechanism and incompetence of the technical staffs, working in this field. A few traditional houses have been restored to reuse with a new public functions by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, governorship, municipality, non-governmental organizations and individuals. While restoring these houses, same of the wrong implementations have been damaged the authentic texture. As a result of the inspections that have been performed, it has been seen that the new function is directly related with the destruction that may occur. It is understood that the authentic values and cultural persistence are preserved when the functions not forced the original design, comfort level and construction techniques of the houses. Annexes, renovation and modifications destroy the authentic plan of the houses are limited in restoration works conducted by the Ministry and governorship; whereas, needs were taken into consideration during works performed by individuals and non-governmental organizations. Besides, the architectural building elements were also had renovation rather than conservation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - After the Muslim conquest of Spain (93/711) the movement of Reconquista (reconquer spain) which is started by cristians, had important successes with the occupation of important Muslim cities such as Toledo (478/1085), Cordoba (634/1236) and Seville (646/1248). Because of this movement the Muslims of Andalus who were gradually losing their power lost altogether their military and political hegemony in Spain with the occupation of Granada (898/1492), the capital of the Nasrids. Some time later (905/1499) the church set up the Inquisition and Spanish rule in order that the Muslims (Moriscos) who had in their own fatherland been reduced to pariah status took up the Catholic religion. In the royal orders that were being published everything that had to do with Islam and Muslims was forbidden and the churches continued with their teaching and education activities and the Inquisition courts with their trials and persecutions in order to punish the "apostates". At the end of the processes of persuasion, persecution, deportation and punishment the belief that the Muslims who were forced to pretend were not sufficiently assimilated, that they kept their distance as regards integration into Christian society and that they made common cause with the enemies of Spain (Ottomans, France and North African dynasts) led to an event of mass exile (1018/1609) that can be characterised as the most merciless and immoral process of the seventeenth century. The exile (expulsion) not only dragged Spain into financial, social and economic chaos but also was a tragedy for the about 340.000 Muslims who were drived out by force from their homes and resulted in the loss of life of tens of thousands during the journey and in the areas where they settled.

AB  - The movement towards localism, partnerships and governing networks' has renewed academic interest in the voluntary sector role in multi-agency work in criminal justice fields. This article argues that strategic partnerships which service systems for managing offenders are organizing into more complex formations which are poised to alter academic understanding of power relationships and roles among partners. Using Adelbart Evers' (2005) concept of hybridization', the complexity of service delivery partnerships and the varying interchanges among participating agencies is discussed. The analysis focuses on the start-up and first year of operation of the Chestnut Centre', a community-based project for diverting women from custody based in a city in the midlands of England. The results are presented as a case study of participants' reflections on power and legitimacy in the partnership; experiences of collaborative working; approaches towards service users; and perceptions of multi-agency partnerships.

AB  - This article examines the legal and normative debates about the Occupy Toronto movement in order to illuminate the issues raised by Occupy Wall Street. It challenges the view that the occupation of parks and plazas was an illegitimate privatization of public space. In both NewYork City and Toronto, the courts relied on a theory that Habermas called "German Hobbesianism." This sovereigntist theory of the public was used to justify removing the protesters and disbanding the encampments. The alternative is what I call the populist model of the public, a term which describes the political mobilization of the people outside the institutional structures of the state. While my focus is on public space, I suggest the appropriation of space was the most visible aspect of a broader call for collective control of the commonwealth of society. In other words, we should understand the occupations synecdochally as struggles over the meaning and power of public and private.

AB  - In this article, I present an analysis of the discursive response of two British politicians - the Prime Minister David Cameron and the leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband - to the riots that took place in British cities in August 2011 and the Occupy protests of later in the same year. Considering this response as, following Van Leeuwen, recontextualisation of the events with which the two politicians are concerned, I suggest that in both cases a particular neoliberal discourse is employed that serves to moralise what is in actual fact material, class-based opposition. Cameron suggests that the riots are indicative of a 'moral collapse' in contemporary Britain, and Miliband, superficially aligning himself with the movement, suggests that the Occupy protests indicate a 'value gap'. In both cases, I argue, the discursive response serves as an attempt to assert as hegemonic a substantively identical moralised neoliberal understanding of the inequalities of contemporary capitalism. This is an understanding - a discourse - that I suggest is both a contributor to these inequalities and a false representation of their true nature.

AB  - The recent earthquake of Mw 6.9 which occurred on September 18, 2011 in Sikkim-Nepal border region (epicenter 27.72 degrees N, 88.06 degrees E, depth 20.7 km, similar to 68 km NW of the Capital city Gangtok) is the strongest earthquake in the instrumentally recorded history of the region. The fault plane solution of this earthquake indicates a strike-slip motion. However, the seismological and geological studies carried out so far after the earthquake could not confirm the causative fault plane. In the present study, GPS observations are used to ascertain causative source in the generation of earthquake and its correlation with the observed seismic data of the region. The co-seismic displacements recorded by GPS show maximum displacement of similar to 11 mm at Phodong and similar to 9 mm at Taplejung station, near the epicenter. A simple rigid cross fault model using GPS baseline observations was employed to figure out the causative fault plane and seismological characteristic of the region. It is inferred that the movement represents the kinematic adjustment of the subsidiary faults as a result of the displacement along the NW-SE principal plane. Strain analysis using GPS baseline inferred that the region southeast of epicenter has undergone large deformation. In addition, a significant part of the measured deformation across the surface fault zone for this earthquake can be attributed to post-seismic creep. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The extraction of ore and minerals by underground mining may induce ground subsidence phenomena. These phenomena produce several types of ground movement like horizontal and vertical displacements, ground curvature and horizontal ground strain at the surface, and associated building damage in urban regions. The influence function is a well-known and efficient method for the prediction of these movements, but its application is restricted to mining configurations with the same influence angle around the mine. However, this angle may display different values when the mine is not horizontal or when other subsidence events already occurred near the considered mine.
   In this paper a methodology and an algorithm are developed, based on the traditional influence function method in order to take into account different influence angles. This methodology is implemented in the Mathematica software and a case study is presented with data from the Lorraine iron mine field in France. Ground movements calculated with the developed methodology show a fair concordance with observed data.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) consist of 209 possible congeners, which were used primarily as dielectric and coolant fluids in closed systems, but also as plasticisers in many products. They were widely used in the United States from 1929-1979 and after which they were banned because of wide-spread occurrence in the environment and potential effects on wildlife and humans. In the Great Lakes region of the U.S.A., it has been shown that atmospheric transport is the dominant pathway for PCB loadings to the environment and that urban areas are major sources. Understanding of the specific spatial pattern of PCB loadings to the Great Lakes is limited because of the coarse spatial distribution of existing sampling sites. However, in general, loadings have been reported to be greater in the southern area of the region and lesser in the north, possibly related to urbanization and industrialization in the south. Although now banned, PCBs are still present in the Great Lakes environment and thus there is interest in the dynamics of movement among compartments in and rates of changes in concentrations in the environment. It is hypothesized that since the ban on PCBs, the previously observed spatial gradient loadings is lessening. In order to test this hypothesis, chronological records in sediments from 34 inland lakes that are widely distributed across the State of Michigan, U.S.A., which itself occupies a significant footprint in the Great Lakes region, were examined to determine: 1) the history of PCB loadings; 2) the spatial distribution of those loadings and inventories; and 3) how loadings have changed over time. These data also afforded the study of the temporal and spatial changes in patterns of relative abundances (fingerprints) of PCB congeners. Changes in patterns can give insight into: 1) the importance of local versus larger regional inputs for PCBs and 2) how well mixed the atmosphere is. One might hypothesize that local sources have unique conjener fingerprints and that the fingerprints of regional sources would reflect a more well mixed system. This hypothesis was tested by use of cluster analysis of concentrations PCB congeners from 1970 and 2000. Selected results are that larger inventories (total mass of PCBs in sediment) are found in the southern area and lesser masses in the northern areas. The larger inventories in the south are mainly near urban areas. More remote from urban areas, inventories are similar for both southern and northern areas. The spatial pattern of relative concentrations of congeners deposited in 1970 is different between north and south and unique near urban areas. In 2000 patterns more unique to urban areas have lessened and patterns in the north and south become more similar. The results of this study are consistent with both hypotheses and show the increasing influence of regional PCB loadings since banning PCBs.

Those deposits consist of mostly gravelly beds, and their depositional environments are interpreted to be fluvial, backshore, foreshore, and upper shoreface on the basis of their grain size, framework, sorting, roundness, and bedding. The vertical profiles of those marine terrace deposits show the over-all sequence of transgression and subsequent regression, and are correlated in terms of relative sea-level change except the difference in their altitudes. The differences in elevations of the bases and surfaces between the terrace deposits are deemed to have been resulted not from original topographic relief but from rate of uprifting and tectonic movement, which suggests that the elevation variation of the marine terraces in eastern coast of Korean peninsula should be discussed later in diverse aspects of stratigraphy, sedimentation, geological structures, and physical properties of basement rocks. The absolute age data for the 2nd marine terrace deposits in eastern coast and the vertical profiles of the 2nd marine terrace deposits in the study area showing transgressive and regressive sequence suggest that the 2nd marine terrace deposits were formed from 90 to 80 ka during MIS 5a. The sedimentary features of the recent gravelly beaches in study area are very similar to those of the examined 2nd marine terrace deposits, indicating that shoreline topography of study area has been changed little since late Pleistocene.

AB  - I analyzed changes in the native flora of Worcester County, Massachusetts, between the mid-1900s and the early 2000s in relation to changes in land use and climate. I also identified genera and families in which declines and apparent losses were particularly high. Current floristic data came from a recent survey of the county and historical data were obtained largely from herbarium collections, especially a county-wide survey from the 1930s to the 1950s. Climate data came from records collected in Worcester beginning in 1950, and land use data came originally from aerial photographs taken in 1951, 1971, 1985, 1999 and 2005. Average daily temperatures increased by 0.15 degrees C per decade between 1950 and 2011. The most prominent land use changes during this period were an increase in disturbed land and a decrease in fields and pastures. Extent of forests declined slightly, though forest maturity increased. Northern species decreased relative to southern species, presumably reflecting climatic changes. Losses of northern species were most evident in the southernmost towns in their ranges and were more pronounced than gains of southern species. This difference in behavior of northern and southern species presumably reflects the fact that range extensions depend on dispersal mechanisms, which can be slow, whereas range retractions reflect unsuitability of conditions, which occurs more quickly. Species of disturbed sites increased and species of fields declined, consistent with patterns of habitat change. Several families and genera had high rates of species loss or decline, and some of these, including the Orchidaceae, Ophioglossaceae, Orobanchaceae and Violaceae, have shown high rates of loss or decline elsewhere in the Northeast. Some of these changes may be tied to succession or to active eradication efforts. Two declining families (Orchidaceae, Ophioglossaceae) have juvenile stages dependent on fungi. Changes in climate, patterns of land use and other factors are likely to continue and perhaps accelerate, leading to further changes in the flora and posing challenges for conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - Aedes aegypti L. is the primary dengue vector in southern Taiwan. This article is the first report on a large-scale surveillance program to study the spatial-temporal distribution of the local Ae. aegytpi population using ovitraps stratified according to the human population in high dengue-risk areas. The sampling program was conducted for 1 yr and was based on weekly collections of eggs and adults in Kaohsiung City. In total, 10,380 ovitraps were placed in 5,190 households. Paired ovitraps, one indoors and one outdoors were used per 400 people. Three treatments in these ovitraps (paddle-shaped wooden sticks, sticky plastic, or both) were assigned by stratified random sampling to two areas (i.e., metropolitan or rural, respectively). We found that the sticky plastic alone had a higher sensitivity for detecting the occurrence of indigenous dengue cases than other treatments with time lags of up to 14 wk. The wooden paddle alone detected the oviposition of Ae. aegypti throughout the year in this study area. Furthermore, significantly more Ae. aegypti females were collected indoors than outdoors. Therefore, our survey identified the whole year oviposition activity, spatial-temporal distribution of the local Ae. aegypti population and a 14 wk lag correlation with dengue incidence to plan an effectively proactive control.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the seasonal variations of PM10-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for an estimation of the human health risk and identification of their possible sources. Ninety four PM10 samples were collected during the dry and wet seasons of 2010 and the dry season of 2011 in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and analyzed for 16 PAHs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The average PM10 concentrations were 104.91 +/- 32.70, 13.28 +/- 11.34 and 36.24 +/- 19.16 mu g/m(3) in dry season of 2010, wet season of 2010 and dry season of 2011, respectively, while the average 16-PAHs concentrations were 25.87 +/- 10.13, 3.12 +/- 2.18 and 4.58 +/- 2.18 ng/m(3), respectively. Correlations of PM10 and total PAHs concentrations were relatively high during all seasons (r> 0.796). In addition, PM10 concentrations were highly correlated with carcinogenic PAHs (r= 0.927) during the dry season of 2010, indicating that carcinogenic compounds were dominant in the particulate PAHs and could be generated from open burning, usually conducted in the dry season. The average PM10 concentration in the dry season of 2011 was much lower than that in 2010 and lower than the annual average of the past 12 years (48.17 mu g/m(3)) because of the unusually high amount of rain precipitation and low open burning activity in this year. According to the accumulated number of hot spots occurring in northern part of Thailand, approximately 19,000 spots were found in the dry season of 2010, while only 6,600 spots were found in the dry season of 2011. It can be seen that larger scale open burning activities were performed in the dry season of 2010 than in the dry season of 2011. The value of toxicity equivalent concentration from PAHs in the dry season of 2010 was higher than that of the wet season of 2010 and the dry season of 2011. This is obviously related to concentrations of PM10 and PAHs. Diagnostic ratio and principal component analysis were used to find out the sources of PM10-bound PAHs. It was found that vehicle emission and biomass burning were the main sources of PM10 and PAHs in this area. The high ratio value of benzo(a) anthracene/chrysene (BaA/CHR) in the dry season of 2010 indicated possible photochemical processes and long distance emissions. Findings on source identification of PM10 and PAHs were found to be relevant to the direction and speed of air mass movement run by backward trajectory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This population-based retrospective cohort study examined Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain in relation to prenatal and early postnatal exposure to tetrachloroethylene (PCE)-contaminated drinking water on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Subjects were identified through birth records from 1969 through 1983. Exposure was modeled using pipe network information from town water departments, a PCE leaching and transport algorithm, EPANet water flow modeling software, and Geographic Information System (GIS) methodology. Brain imaging was performed on 26 exposed and 16 unexposed subjects. Scans were acquired on a Philips 3T whole body scanner using the ADNI T1-weighted MP-RAGE scan. The scans were processed by FreeSurfer version 4.3.1 software to obtain measurements of specific brain regions. There were no statistically significant differences between exposed and unexposed subjects on the measures of white matter hypointensities (beta: 127.5 mm(3), 95% CI: -259.1, 1514.0), white matter volumes (e.g. total cerebral white matter: beta: 21230.0 mm(3), 95% CI: -4512.6, 46971.7) or gray matter volumes (e.g. total cerebral gray matter: beta: 11976.0 mm(3), 95% CI: -13657.2, 37609.3). The results of this study suggest that exposure to PCE during gestation and early childhood, at the levels observed in this population, is not associated with alterations in the brain structures studied.

AB  - Alien species are defined as species living outside of their natural range and outside of their natural dispersal potential. When an alien species enters a novel environment and has negative ecological and economical impact it becomes invasive species. Alien species are considered as one of the major threats to biodiversity after habitat destruction and enormous damage is done by them to ecosystems and economies. They have been described as an outstanding global problem. Economic damages associated with alien species in several countries in the world amount to about 5 % of the world GNP. Numerous alien insect species, many introduced only in the last 200 years, have become successfully established in various ecosystems in Europe, 1541 species of alien invertebrates are already present, 94 % of them are arthropods and 90 % of them are insects. More than half of the alien invertebrates are phytophagous (52 %) and 30 % of them infest trees and shrubs. Basic knowledge of the identity, origin, pathway, time of introduction of alien species is essential for assessing the threats from alien species and the first requirement when assessing the impact of alien species on ecosystems is to make an alien species inventory of a certain territory or country. Such studies are needed to assess which taxonomic or bio-ecological groups of alien insects are more successful invaders or more harmful to environment and economy. Croatia lacks such an inventory. Even though Croatia was included in most recent and comprehensive study of alien terrestrial arthropodes in Europe, Croatian references with first records were totally missing. There is no up-to-date list of phytophagous alien insect species on woody plants in Croatia. The aim of this paper is to provide up-to-date comprehensive list of known phytophagous alien insect and mite species on woody plants in Croatia with all relevant Croatian references.
   The starting point for compiling the list of alien species of phytophagous insects on woody plants in Croatia was a book "Alien Terrestrial Arthropodes of Europe" and database DAISIE. These are primary online resources on alien insect species available to the public and first qualified reference system on invasive alien species for the European region. We compiled the list by searching many sources of forestry, agricultural and taxonomic entomological peer-reviewed literature in Croatia, checklists and primary research publications on alien insect species. The references in these sources were examined for additional relevant publications.
   A total of 101 phytophagous alien species (98 insect species from 6 orders and 3 mite species form subclass Acarina) on woody plants were recorded (Table 1) and they are already present in Croatian entomofauna. They were dominated by Hemiptera (56.4 %), Lepidoptera (14.9 %), Hymenoptera (12.9 %), followed by Diptera (5.9 %) and Coleoptera (5.9 %), Acarina (3 %) and Thysanoptera (1 %)(Figure 1). One third (33.7 %) of the alien species in Croatia originate from Asia, 26.7 % from North America while 12.9 % are of tropical origin (Figure 2). From the 101 established alien insect species in Croatia, an increase in the number of introductions can be noted in the first decade of 21st century (Figure 3). Agricultural lands are the most frequently invaded habitats by alien phytophagous insects in Croatia (56.4 %), followed by parks and gardens (28.7 %) and woodlands and forests (14.9 %)(Figure 4).
   Order Hemiptera clearly dominates as it includes some of the most successful invaders (57 %) on woody plants in Croatia. Similar results were obtained at a country level for Hungary, Great Britain, Italy, Slovenia and Europe in general. This outcome can be attributed to the fact that species of this order remain undetected and are easily transported due to their tiny size in concert with the intensive trade in agricultural commodities. The occurrence of other orders (Lepidoptera 14 %, Hymenoptera 13 %, Diptera 6 %, Coleoptera 6 %, and Thysanoptera 1 %) is slightly different from other European countries. Results from several investigations have shown strong positive correlations between the number of alien insects per European country and the volume of manufactured and agricultural imports, road network size, the GDP and the geographic size. In contrast, alien species richness was not correlated with the total or percentage of forest cover. The number of alien insects is positively correlated with country surface area, and bordering the sea does not influence the number of alien insect species which is quite important for Croatia. There is a strong correlation between the number of alien insect species and the total amount of imports and level of international trade of the country. It can be predicted that the number of established alien insect species will grow as Croatia shows constant increase of traded commodities with other European and non-European countries. In this review we have listed alien insect species that have not yet been recorded for Croatia on European level. These are Oxycarenus lavaterae; Massilieurodes chitendeni; Adelges (Dreyfusia) nordmannianae; Pineus (Eopineus) strobi; Protopulvinaria pyriformis; Dryocosmus kuriphilus; Platygaster robinae; Aproceros leucopoda; Rhyzobius lophanthae; Rodolia cardinalis; Harmonia axyridis; Xylosandrus germanus; Caloptilia roscipennella; Caloptilia azaleella; Phyllocnistis citrella; Argyresthia thuiella; Cydalima perspectalis; Dasineura gleditchiae; Ceratitis capitata; Rhagoletis cingulata and Drosophila suzukii. Some of them are novel and only recently introduced alien species whereas some of them are present for decades in Croatia but due to the lack of a comprehensive and regularly updated inventory of alien species they have not been listed before. This also makes this up-to-date list of alien phytophagous insects in Croatia valuable. Our results have shown that Asia is the main region of origin of alien insects established in Croatia (33 %), followed by North America (27 %). The trends are similar in other European countries and Europe in general. A rapid increase in the number of new alien species introduction per year in Croatia is noticeable from the years 2007-2012 (6.4 species/year) compared to 2002-2007 (1.8 species/year) (Figure 3). In Europe, an average of 17.5 new species of insects per year was recorded between 2000 and 2007, while this value was only 8.1 from 1950 to 1974. In Europe twice as many new insect species were observed per year on trees and shrubs during the period 2000-2007 (6.3 species) compared to 1960-1979 (3.4 species). The differences between the number of new alien species/year in Europe and Croatia are probably due to differences in sampling efforts, country surface, volume of traded goods etc but the rapidly increasing trend is obvious. More than 80 % of alien insect species in Croatia (57 % on agricultural lands and 28 % in parks and gardens) have been established in man-made habitats (Figure 4).
   Only 15 % of alien insect species in Croatia have established themselves in natural environments (forests and woodlands) which is almost the same percentage as on European level. It is a common observation that simple, disturbed, man-made habitats are more easily invaded by insects and other invaders than complex, undisturbed, natural habitats. Alien insects linked to human environments and activities (e.g. ornamental plants, bonsais, seeds, large potted trees, cut flowers, vegetables, fruits) are more likely to be carried by human transports into a new region than insects living in natural areas. A study has shown that bonsais carry a more diverse alien insect fauna then timber and that ornamental plants constitute "miniature" ecosystems which may host a large variety of insects that have the potential to damage other woody plants as well. Almost 90 % of alien invertebrates in Europe were introduced unintentionally through human activities, mostly as contaminants of a commodity. In Europe, ornamental plant trade contributes significantly more than forestry products to the invasion of alien forest insects. As interception data have not been analysed in this paper, a research of such data for alien insect species and trade volumes in horticultural plants in Croatia is strongly needed. There is a strong suspicion that ornamental plants are one of main pathways of introduction of alien insects to Croatia due to the increase of the imported volumes from year to year. Alien insect species are known for being serious pests worldwide and they can impact habitats which they invade in several ways. Alien insects can affect native biodiversity through direct actions: phytophagous insects feeding on plants, a predator or a parasitoid attacking host, an alien species hybridizing with a native species or indirect actions: vectoring diseases, competing for food, or sharing natural enemies with native species. This research has shown that dangerous pests that can cause direct economic costs have invaded and are spreading in Croatia (Table 1). Due to high percentage of alien insect on agricultural lands (outdoor and in glasshouses) in Croatia (Figure 4) the yield losses of alien insect species on agricultural crops in Croatia must be considerable. Alien insects can have serious negative impact on forests, woodlands and urban parks. Some potentially damaging forest and urban pests have already established themselves in Croatia. In countries where the percentage of forest cover is high (Croatia around 44 %) the damage from alien insects is expected to be considerable. Most introductions of alien insects are unintentional and unpredictable. Less than 20 % of the alien invertebrates in Europe have been intercepted before their arrival. There are several harmful phytophagous alien species approaching the borders of Croatia: Agrilus planipennis which could pose serious threat to Croatian lowland oak ecosystems, Anoplophora sp. which is spreading rapidly in Northern Italy. Some of the most polyphagous alien insect species, such as Drosophila suzukii, have only recently been discovered in Croatia. This study has also shown a time lag between arrival and first record of an alien species which has direct implications on successful eradication measures. Climate change may directly influence establishment and colonisation of alien insect species in new territories-from other continents to Europe and from warmer European regions of Europe further north.
   Global warming is likely to influence establishment and spread of alien insect species from subtropical and tropical areas (24 % found in Croatia) especially on the Mediterranean coast. One of the main factors, globalisation, will definitely influence the upward trend of introduction and spread of new alien species in Croatia which will negatively influence economy and ecosystems.

AB  - In this paper we present a method for prediction and trajectory tracking of a set of vehicles operating in a port. The objective is to enable the prediction of risk situations in order to avoid collisions. The system is designed for high traffic areas located in ports or civil engineering projects, environments in which traffic occurs without structured lanes of movement.
   While many studies have been made on detection of collision risks in a structured environment (traffic lanes, roads, intersection, urban, etc...), few works concern open areas. The proposed system is static and positioned at critical points. The vehicles have no specific sensor, and in order to predict sufficiently in advance the risk of collision, we use cameras with wide field of view. From the images acquired by cameras with a wide field of view, position and velocity of the moving objects are extrated and tracked in order to prevent collisions. Highlighting of critical situations is done with an analytical approach in the calculation of the intersections of ellipses uncertainties.

TI  - The global sporting legacy of the Olympic Movement
T2  - SPORT IN SOCIETY
LA  - English
AB  - What has been the impact of the Olympic Movement on the long-term development of sport around the world? The obvious answer is that it has been transformative, but what about the details? To what extent does the International Olympic Committee (IOC) deliberately plan its activities and structure the Olympic and Winter Olympic Games to bring about long-term, sustainable opportunities for sport and physical activity? How could it do this more effectively? In recent years, the most frequently cited - and studied - Olympic legacies are in the areas of infrastructure (urban renewal, transportation, communications, housing, and sports facilities), international 'branding' and tourism, accessibility, and the enhanced capacity of community leaders. The benefits to sport and physical activity are simply taken for granted, on the assumption that new and refurbished sporting facilities and the inspiration of champions ensure increased participation in sport and physical activity. Yet recent research indicates that 'inspiration is not enough', that without planned, accessible, and sustained new programmes to build upon the interest generated by Olympic Games, increased participation may not occur. In Canada, for example, despite a long history of successful games and heroic athletic performances, child and youth participation rates in sport and physical activity continue to fall. Yet in the build-up to the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Vancouver, none of the Canadian sports federations in the Olympic winter sports were engaged in legacy planning or programming, nor did anyone encourage them to do so. I wrestled with these questions in this paper, written in 2002 for a conference jointly sponsored by the Olympic Study Centre at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and the IOC. I concluded that the IOC must do much more to institutionalize and strengthen its contribution to sport and physical activity.

AB  - On the day of the Tohoku-Pacific Ocean Earthquake (2011), all rail services in the Tokyo Metropolitan area were paralyzed, amid substantial confusion. Consequently, over 3 million persons were unable to return home on that day. Some, unable to contact their families, felt uneasy and set out to return home on foot. Main roads were seriously congested with cars and people, and the use of emergency vehicles was also obstructed. In this paper, we construct several models that describe decision-making and behavior of individuals attempting to reach home on foot in the wake of a devastating earthquake. The proposed models are calibrated using data taken from questionnaire surveys and person-trip surveys, addressed to occupants of the Tokyo Metropolitan area. We attempt to simulate the movement of individuals having decided to return home on foot and demonstrate the spatiotemporal distribution of those who might be exposed to city fires on their way home in the context of such an event.

AB  - To evaluate the success of vehicle emissions regulations, trends in both fleet-wide average emissions as well as high-emitter emissions are needed, but it is challenging to capture the full spread of vehicle emission factors (EFs) with chassis dynamometer or tunnel studies, and remote sensing studies cannot evaluate particulate compounds. We developed an alternative method that links real-time on-road pollutant measurements from a mobile platform with real-time traffic data, and allows efficient calculation of both the average and the spread of EFs for light-duty gasoline-powered vehicles (LDG) and heavy-duty diesel-powered vehicles (HDD). This is the first study in California to report EFs under a full range of real-world driving conditions on multiple freeways. Fleet average LDG EFs were in agreement with most recent studies and an order of magnitude lower than observed HDD EFs. HDD EFs reflected the relatively rapid decreases in diesel emissions that have recently occurred in Los Angeles/California, and on I-710, a primary route used for goods movement and a focus of additional truck fleet turnover incentives, HDD EFs were often lower than on other freeways. When freeway emission rates (ER) were quantified as the product of EF and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per time per mile of freeway, despite a two-to three-fold difference in HDD fractions between freeways, ERs were found to be generally similar in magnitude. Higher LDG VMT on low HDD fraction freeways largely offset the difference. Therefore, the conventional assumption that free-ways with the highest HDD fractions are significantly worse sources of total emissions in Los Angeles may no longer be true.

AB  - Building on a long-term, multi-sited ethnographic research project, this article illustrates and interprets the transformation processes and empowerment strategies pursued by an originally Zazaki-speaking,(1) multigenerational(2) Alevi(3) family in the Turkish-German transnational context. The family, which includes a number of Alevi priests (seyyid or dede), hails from the Dersim(4) region of eastern Anatolia, and their family biography is closely bound up with a traumatic mass murder and crime against humanity that local people call " Dersim 38" or " Tertele." Against the background of this tragedy, the family experienced internal migration (through forced remigration and settlement) thirty years before its labor migration to Germany. This family case study accordingly examines migration as a multi-faceted process with plural roots and routes. The migration of people from Turkey neither begins nor ends with labor migration to Germany. Instead, it involves the continuous, nonlinear, and multidirectional movement of human beings, despite national border regimes and politics. As a result, we can speak of migration processes that are at once voluntary and forced, internal and external, national and transnational. (5) In this particular case, the family members, even the pioneer generation labor migrants who have since become shuttle migrants, maintain close relationships with Dersim even as they spend most of their lives in a metropolitan German city. At the same time, they confront moments of everyday in-and exclusion in this transnational migration space that define them as both insiders and outsiders. Keeping these asymmetrical attributions in mind, I examine the family's sociocultural, religious, and political practices and resources from a transnational perspective, paying close attention to their conceptualization of identity and belonging as well as their empowerment strategies.

AB  - This article explores the growth of online mobilizations using data from the indignados (outraged) movement in Spain, which emerged under the influence of the revolution in Egypt and as a precursor to the global Occupy mobilizations. The data track Twitter activity around the protests that took place in May 2011, which led to the formation of camp sites in dozens of cities all over the country and massive daily demonstrations during the week prior to the elections of May 22. We reconstruct the network of tens of thousands of users and monitor their message activity for a month (April 25, 2011, to May 25, 2011). Using both the structure of the network and levels of activity in message exchange, we identify four types of users and analyze their role in the growth of the protest. Drawing from theories of online activism and research on information diffusion in networks, this article centers on the following two questions: How does protest information spread in online networks? And how do different actors contribute to the growth of activity? The article aims to inform the theoretical debate on whether digital technologies are changing the logic of collective action and to provide evidence of how new media facilitates the emergence of massive offline mobilizations.

AB  - BRT, short for Bus Rapid Transit System. has been an important choice for large and medium-sized cities to reduce the traffic congestion. Since BRT travel can greatly reduce the bus travel time of passengers, it attracts a large portion public bus trips, making BRT station a centralized area with a high density of passengers for public transport. Under the circumstances, accidents such as serious crowd, panic, trample and even casualties may occur in BRT station. It is of great significance to propose an evacuation model for BRT station to provide guidance and advices for evacuation in BRT station. First, by analysing existed computer evacuation simulation models, we propose a new simulation model, in which tine grid is used to model the BRT station and conflict resolution mechanisms and pedestrian movement rules are incorporated. Then, we develop a computer-programming evacuation simulation platform based on the evacuation simulation model. By applying it to Gangding station of Guangzhou BRT, we take a closer look on the laws of evacuation in BRT station. Finally, the simulation provides the details of the dynamic evacuation process clearly; some phenomenon such as bottleneck area and influences of obstacles are directly observed. The results verify the practicability and feasibility of the evacuation model. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Ecocriticism
T2  - LITERATURE COMPASS
LA  - English
KW  - ECOLOGY
AB  - In the last 20 years, ecocriticism has developed from its early incarnation as the relatively under-theorised preserve of nature writing enthusiasts to its current vibrant state as a sophisticated array of 'earth-centred' approaches to cultural criticism that mobilise and reframe theories drawn from a range of disciplines including ecology, philosophy, sociology and biology. Ecocriticism's diversity also extends to engaging with a variety of literary forms as well as, increasingly, film, TV, digital environments and music, and to an interest in representations of the urban. At its heart is the conviction both that we are living in a time of ecological crisis that requires us to reassess with some urgency our modes of being in the world and that our cultural perceptions of 'nature' and the 'human', and the relationship between the two, have to a large degree been responsible for these damaging modes of being. Its role is to interrogate and critique these perceptions, even within environmentalism itself, with some ecocritics also committed to exploring alternative ways of conceptualising our relationship with the non-human world. This paper briefly traces the history of ecocriticism, discussing its initial development in the USA and Britain, outlining the two strands of social ecology and deep ecology that underpin its ongoing formulation, and tracing the 'waves' of its development. It then focuses on contemporary and emergent theorisations, in particular the global inflection of current post-colonial ecocriticism and the environmental justice movement, which introduces the new paradigm of eco-cosmopolitics, and the recent formulation of ecocritical post-humanism. This emphasises the imbrication of the human in earth's matrix, drawing on the insights of ecofeminism, phenomenology and biosemiotics, and has its most recent incarnation in the currently emerging field of material ecocriticism, which, in its engagement with the complex entanglement of the human and the non-human, the social and the scientific, hints at a more dissonant paradigm.

AB  - For about four decades in Italy local, scientific literature has occasionally dealt with fluvial avulsions, suggesting they should be considered as genetically linked to a peculiar climatic worsening that occurred in the late-6th century AD (the so-called "Paul the Deacon Deluge"). Research performed by the Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici dell'Emilia-Romagna over the last few years has allowed better definition of the timing of a more articulated alluvial history, mainly concerning the Roman Imperial age and Late-Antiquity (1 st-6th century AD). The main stratigraphic details of fourteen selected archaeological excavation sites (eleven recently surveyed and three reviewed from the literature) performed in the cities of Modena, Bologna and related surroundings have been summarized. Eleven C-14 dates, ranging between the years 130 AD and 810 AD, allowed us to chronologically delimit a first framework for the riverbed network behaviour during ancient times in the central part of the region. The alluvial process appeared to be continuous throughout the time span examined. The fan trench was the most sensitive reach of the river system. It started to aggrade during the 4th century AD. During the 5th century AD and probably after the end of the 6th century AD, a number of avulsions occurred. This indicates that the fluvial system was in a metastable equilibrium, whose behavioural threshold was finally overcome. Hence, the importance of the supposed year 589 AD crisis (the "Deluge") appears to be less than previously supposed. The riverbed aggradation became evident immediately after the Roman Empire's economic and demographic crisis of the 3rd century AD, and it was probably due to the loss of the land preservation systems in the mountain catchment areas. The long duration of the aggradation phase suggests that more than one human settlement phase in the minor catchment areas and/or a minor climatic worsening pulse probably occurred during the 5th century AD. The starting of the aggradation also coincided with the end of the Petit Maclu 1 high level phase of the European lakes. Notwithstanding this, the climate's role as a forcing co-factor can still be hard to evaluate positively due to the lack of local proxy data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

As a result of this, various reflections upon the urban and regional territory as well as the creation of a superior environment for collective life emerge. In architecture, such reflection has an effect on three scopes: the chiefly academic one inside schools, particularly in the formation of professionals who have a critical thinking with regard to national politics and who are more connected to the profession's real world by finding out and practicing a poetic view of the continent; the intellectual one through the articles on critical reflection published in the magazine AUCA (funded in 1965) constituted mostly by those professors who resigned -mainly- from the University of Chile in 1963; and the academic professional one, with the proposal of a new school model under the umbrella of the south based Association of Architects.
   Many of the movements occurred in the late 60s, not only in their origin but also in the management of the following reforms -whose initial effect is the upheaval inside the training centers and the subsequent expansion to the rest of the civil population and the public space - were initiated, promoted, sustained and headed by both architecture students and professors. As a result of these events and their effects on the teaching of this discipline appears the differentiation for the different schools in their profiles and methods of education, as well as the posterior establishment of a general profession identity in Chile. In 1973 the coup takes place to mark a violent interruption of social movements in the country and the autonomy of university reform processes.
   Just by 7987 the present law of universities is promulgated. This law triggers the rise of private universities and the later emergence of new architecture schools.

AB  - Conulariella sp. and possibly one other conulariid species occur in close association with Sphenothallus sp. in the lower part of the early Floian Tonggao Formation near the town of Sandu, Guizhou Province, China. This is the only known occurrence of Conulariella in Early Ordovician rocks outside of Bohemia (Perunican terrane), and also the first report of Sphenothallus from the Ordovician of China. The apertural margin of Conulariella appears to have been mostly straight, and apertural lappets probably were not present in this genus. Some Tonggao conulariids may have attached to orbiculoid brachiopods in life. Based on the most recent palaeogeographical reconstructions of Gondwana and associated terranes, Conulariella could have had a dispersal path along the Gondwanan margin.

AB  - Imaginary Exile' wanders through the experience of reading and life reflection and traces the narrative journey of the poet Ovid in David Malouf's influential novella An Imaginary Life, which serves as both anchor and disruption to an attachment to exile. The essay follows the forced corporeal movement of the author from virginal Australian bush, into inner urban landscapes and finally the abstraction of the Law. Exile is revealed as a utopic colonial fantasy in conflict with the author's intention to engage with contemporary realities. The writer's desire to hold onto Aristotelian form is confronted by the appearance of a memory that refuses to succumb to the writers demand for craft, and thus shreds her expectations of lineal narrative. This experience of a collision between two worlds, two laws, that occurred in 1998 in a Broome courtroom, challenges romantic attachments to a language prior to law or one that can escape the world' but also challenges the capacity of the writer to incorporate into text visceral experiences that conflict with received inheritances. The images and thought behind the memoir are heavily influenced by the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, and his notion of the contemporary,' but while the author finds solace in retreat, questions of how to engage with the contemporary world linger and are passed on.

AB  - Estimating the genetic structure of a population is important for the conservation and management of wildlife. In the present study, our aim was to estimate the genetic structure of the brown bear (Ursus arctos) population in eastern Hokkaido by performing a Bayesian clustering analysis. To accomplish this goal, we used 15 microsatellites to generate genotypic data from tissue samples collected from 646 bears between 1996 and 2008. Using this genotypic data and the geographic locations where the bears were captured, GENELAND analysis detected six subpopulations. Based on the genotypic data, the STRUCTURE analysis revealed three subpopulations. As inferred from the GENELAND analysis, the core zones of the subpopulations (G-a through G-f) were located in the Shiranuka Hills (G-a), the northern area of the Shiranuka Hills (G-b), the eastern slope of the Daisetsuzan Mountains (G-c), the northern slope of the Akan Mountain Range (G-d), the Shiretoko Peninsula (G-e), and Akkeshi District (G-f). The STRUCTURE analysis indicated that G-b and G-d were influenced by gene flow from other subpopulations. National routes, towns, and farm fields were considered to have formed the distribution boundaries among the subpopulations. A high level of genetic differentiation was not observed among the six subpopulations, with the exception of G-f (F (st) = 1.35-0.176, D (s) = 0.246-0.349), which showed a geographically discontinuous distribution. We suggest that the loss of forest areas through future regional development and road building should be avoided to facilitate gene flow in brown bears in Hokkaido.

AB  - Context Spinal morphine is a common form of postoperative analgesia after caesarean section, but it is associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting.
   Objective To evaluate the hypothesis that dexamethasone reduces nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia with morphine.
   Design Interventional, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate a preoperative single dose of dexamethasone.
   Setting Patients from a tertiary hospital in the city of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil observed from 1 January through 30 June 2008.
   Patients or other participants Seventy full-term pregnant patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists 1 or 2) were studied. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups determined by a computerised table. Exclusion criteria were contraindication to regional anaesthesia, allergy to dexamethasone, opioids or local anaesthetics, hypertension or diabetes originated during pregnancy and use of any antiemetic drug received before surgery. Spinal anaesthesia consisted of hyperbaric bupivacaine and morphine.
   Intervention Patients received either dexamethasone 10mg in 100 ml of isotonic saline, intravenously or 100 ml of isotonic saline (placebo) prior to surgery.
   Main outcome Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in the first 24 h were rated and recorded. Pain scores at rest and on movement were evaluated using a visual analogue scale.
   Results During the first 24 hours, nausea occured in 12/35 (34.4%) patients receiving dexamethasone and in 32/35 (91.4%) receiving placebo (P < 0.001). During the same time period, vomiting occured in 12/35 (34.4%) patients receiving dexamethasone and in 29/35 (82.9%) receiving placebo (P < 0.001). Pain at rest and pain on movement was lower in patients who received dexamethasone at some time points during the study period.
   Conclusion Dexamethasone reduced the cumulative incidence of nausea and vomiting after caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia with morphine and lowered pain scores on the first postoperative day. Eur J Anaesthesiol 2013; 30:102-105

AB  - During the Indo-Pakistan Partition, the exodus of Muslims and the influx of Hindus and Sikhs indelibly transformed Delhi. Both groups occupied some of the city's Islamic monuments as refugee camps, of which the longest running was the sixteenth-century Purana Qila (Old Fort). If there is one indelible act that symbolized the Partition, it was the mass movement of people and the exchange of movable property. It was through exchange that India and Pakistan acquired accoutrements of nationhood such as citizens, land and a bureaucratic apparatus. At a time when trivial objects like furniture and something as vital as human life were considered exchangeable, the very object that had long been considered the repository of a nation's identity - the historic monument - became an un-exchangeable asset. Using the Purana Qila as an example, this essay suggests that during the 'long Partition', the modern tourist-monument carefully fashioned by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) ceased to function as such. The actions of these refugees and their refusal to leave transformed the tourist-monument into a space of protracted negotiation and resistance. At a time when everything was exchangeable, the potential for resistance came precisely from that which could not be exchanged.

AB  - In the period 2011 June-October, a tectonic swarm of nearly 1222 earthquakes occurred in the Messenia prefecture at the southwestern region of the Peloponnese Peninsula. The swarm happened in the Messenia's Upper Quaternary basin, 25 km NW of the city of Kalamata, and migrated from NNW towards SSE. The largest earthquakes occurred in 2011 August 14 (M-w = 4.8), September 14 (M-w = 4.6) and October 10 (M-w = 4.7), caused moderate structural damages mainly in old houses in four villages and produced particular unrest to the local population. We have investigated the monthly migration of the swarm using Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR), presenting for the first time a very close look at the deformation evolution that may reveal an aseismic slip component of the total movement. The geodetically derived slip distribution for the first 4 months revealed that slip migrated laterally along strike (north to south) and vertically from a deep portion, at similar to 2.8 km depth, to a shallow portion, at less than 0.5 km, of the fault plane, and concluded its migration towards the surface with a very shallow M-w 4.7 event of 2011 October 10 surprisingly detected by DInSAR.

AB  - After an intentional release of chlorine in an office district, public responses such as sheltering-in-place could save many lives if rapid enough. However, previous work does not estimate how fast and effective such responses would be for several possible investments in attack detection, public alert, and building ventilation, nor whether such measures would be cost effective. We estimate public response times with investment options in place, and resulting changes in fatalities as well as system costs, including false alarm costs, and cost effectiveness in terms of cost per net death avoided. The measures do have life-saving potential, especially if all response times are at or near the lower limits of the ranges assumed in this article. However, due to uncertainties, it is not clear that responses would be rapid enough to save many people. In some cases total fatalities would increase, since sheltering after chlorine vapor has already entered buildings can increase occupants' chlorine exposure. None of the options considered have median cost per statistical life saved meeting a cost-effectiveness threshold of $6.5 million across all of the chlorine exposure dose-response and ingress-delay models considered here, even if there were one attack per year in the area covered by the system. Given these and other issues discussed in this article, at this point investments to improve sheltering-in-place capability appear not to be robust strategies for reducing fatalities from chlorine attack in an office district.

AB  - The current article analyses the activity of raftsmen in the capture expedition in the urban beach of Ponta Negra, Natal-RN-Brazil emphasizing the prevalence of pain/discomfort. Work Ergonomic Analysis-WEA was used as reference methodology. For the activity analysis were used observational and interactional methods and specific protocols (diagram painful areas and Nordic Questionnaire). Twenty-one raftsmen participated in the research (50% of the population). The Artisan Fishing using Rafts represents a high musculoskeletal risk, joining physical effort, strength requirement, forced postures and movement repetition, mainly flexion extension of vertebral spine with the rotation, aggravated by the demand of strength of the stabilizing muscles to keep the poise. It has been highlighted the high percentage of reports of musculoskeletal pain in the spine, and in lower and upper limbs. 23.8% of the raftsmen have musculoskeletal pains before the expedition in one (9.52%), two (9.52%) or three (4.75%) parts of the body. One of the most reported areas was the lower back (19.05%) with intensity between 4 to 8 on a 0 to 10 scale. The prevalence of pain/discomfort after the expedition confirms the lower back to be the area of highest incidence with higher occurrence (42.86%) and intensity (between 3 and 10).

AB  - The DHF prevention efforts have been continually conducted by the local health office, but some technical obstacles such as surveillance system is still very weak, and this is known as an important part in decision making process to handle the problem using evidence based information. The research objective is to obtain information on dengue endemic mapping through GIS (Geographic Information Systems) to strengthen district surveillance system in district level. Most DHF cases occur in the productive age and located in urban areas with the larva-free rate is low. The direction of movement of the case are local diffusion. Karawang district is a low-lying areas prone to flooding. The rainy season occurs in late October to early May, but the rise of dengue cases at the turn of the rainy season to dry season, this indicates that the humidity in Karawang district supports the mosquito vector breeding. Foging will only kill adult mosquitoes, dengue control programs need to involve community participation and emphasized on public areas like schools and offices because a lot of dengue cases occurred in the productive age. GIS is capable of producing a map factors of risk and map of the case to allow for planning and evaluation of area-based dengue eradication program. GIS is useful in surveillance environmentally based disease, health interventions, and disease prevention strategies.

AB  - A good understanding of the behaviour of the traffic of a mobile network is essential for an efficient planning and management of the mobile network's scarce bandwidth resources. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach, called Handoff Time Estimation MODel (HTEMOD), to estimate the time window when a user will perform handoffs along his/her movement/path to a destination. We derive the probability distribution function of time taken to transit each road segment along the path, using a sample of users that is selected according to navigation zone characteristics, current data on road segments, and current behaviour of users on the road segment. We evaluate our model via simulations, and compare it with the model proposed in [1]. Regardless of the given probability value to obtain a time window, the road segment density and the number of road segments to handoff, HTEMOD provides a better accuracy and good duration of predicted time window when handoff will occur. Whilst the proposed HTEMOD model can be applied to any type of user equipment, its efficiency becomes more appealing in the context of vehicles (i.e., for the support of road to vehicles communications - RVC) or highly mobile nodes travelling in urban areas constrained by predefined roads and whose velocities are also restricted according to speed limits, level of congestion in roads, and traffic control mechanisms (e.g., stop signs and traffic lights).

AB  - The Ouro Roxo gold deposit lies near the city of Jacareacanga, Tapajos Gold Province, southwestern of Para, Brazil. The Ouro Roxo deposit comprises a hydrothermal system of sulfide quartz veins hosted by mylonite granitoid Tropas Intrusive Suit of Paleoproterozoic age and controlled by the N-S trending Ouro Roxo-Canta Galo shear zone (OCSZ). The host granitoids are oxidized calc-alkaline granodiorite and tonalite of magmatic arc filiation. The OCSZ is a sinistral oblique ductile-brittle shear, which belongs to the third deformation event of the Tapajos Province and has turned the granitoids into protomylonites, mylonites and breccias. The NNE-SSW mylonitic foliation dipping to ESE and stretch lineation in quartz grains indicate the tectonic movement to NW. Mineralized quartz veins and pipes are hosted by mylonites and breccias and surrounded by hydrothermal alteration halos. Besides silicification and sulfidation, concentrated in the ore bodies, three types of wall-rock alteration occur: propilitization (chlorite + phengite + carbonate); phylic alteration (phengite + quartz + carbonate + pyrite); carbonatization. Besides magmatic quartz and microcrystalline quartz of mylonites, five generations of hydrothermal quartz were recognized in the lodes. The isotopic Pb-Pb data do not support a genetic relationship between the gold deposit and the Tropas granitoids, being the deposit coeval to Maloquinha granite. The orogenic environment, the veining style, the structural control, the hydrothermal alteration and the metallic association (Au + Cu + Bi), are all consistent with a mesozona-epizona orogenic model for the genisis of the Ouro Roxo deposit.

AB  - The kudzu bug or bean plataspid, Megacopta cribraria (Fabricius), is native to Asia where it appears to be widely distributed (although the taxonomy is not entirely clear), but is infrequently a pest of legumes. This bug appeared in 2009 in the southeastern United States, where it is closely associated with kudzu, Pueraria montana Lour. [Merr.] variety lobata [Willd.] Maesen & S. Almeida. However, the insect has become a consistent economic pest of soybeans, Glycine max (L.) Merr., and some other leguminous crops in areas where large numbers can build in kudzu, in addition to being a considerable nuisance in urban landscapes where kudzu occurs. The insect has remarkable capacity for movement and has spread rapidly from nine Georgia counties in 2009 to seven states in 2012. Despite being a nuisance in urban areas and a crop pest, high populations of the bug also reduce the biomass of kudzu, which is itself a seriously problematic invasive weed, complicating the status of M. cribraria in its expanded range. Extant predators and a pathogen in the US have been observed attacking kudzu bugs in the laboratory and field, but no parasitism of eggs or nymphs has been observed to date. A single record of parasitism of an adult kudzu bug by a tachinid fly is known from the US, but no other adult parasitism has been observed in the US or elsewhere. Extant enemies may eventually significantly reduce the bug's populations, but at present native enemies appear to be insufficient for the task, and exotic enemies from the kudzu bug's native range may offer the best possibility for effective biological control in the US. Based on the available literature, the best option for an importation biological control program appears to be the platygastrid egg parasitoid Paratelenomus saccharalis (Dodd) because of its apparent host specificity, intimate biological linkages with M. cribraria, and wide geographic distribution in the Eastern Hemisphere. Other natural enemies may eventually emerge as good candidates for importation, but at present P. saccharalis appears to be the most promising.

AB  - Fipronil, a relatively new insecticide more recently developed than organophosphates and pyrethroids, has been detected in surface water draining from agricultural and urban-developed areas. This insecticide is primarily lost through subsurface and surface drainage from terrestrial areas where it has been applied. Invasive aquatic plants often need to be managed in these receiving water bodies to prevent loss of recreational and functional values (e.g., drainage), especially in subtropical and tropical areas. One insect of particular interest is the chironomid midge Cricotopus lebetis Sublette, which may be a useful augmentative biocontrol agent for the invasive aquatic weed Hydrilla verticillata L.f. Royale. Exposure of aquatic organisms, especially insects, to fipronil may significantly impact nontarget populations. These studies investigated the sensitivity of C. lebetis to fipronil exposures ranging from 24 to 96 h. The LC50 observed for each exposure interval was 7.26 g/L (24 h), 2.61 g/L (48 h), 1.78 g/L (72 h), and 1.06 g/L (96 h). The LC90 values observed were 47.18 g/L (24 h), 9.55 g/L (48 h), 6.45 g/L (72 h), and 4.81 g/L (96 h). Behavioral changes were seen at all fipronil concentration levels, where larvae exited the plant and exhibited abnormal behavior, such as restricted movement and lack of feeding. Results indicate that acute lethality occurred at environmentally relevant concentrations of fipronil.

AB  - The latest novel Katkuhaud of Ene Mihkelson picks up the image of the Bronze Soldier to illustrate the complex problem of remembering the (Soviet) past in Estonia. Katkuhaud was published at the beginning of May 2007, only a few weeks after the removal of a Soviet monument, the so- called Bronze Soldier, and the street riots accompanying this. The novel begins with the description of this monument in the Tallinn city centre being surrounded with the police barrier tape. The Bronze Soldier was erected in September 1947 as a monument to the fallen Soviet soldiers who "liberated" Tallinn in 1945 from the German occupation. In the Estonian version of events this was not liberation but re- occupation. Mihkelson's novel deals with remembering and coming to terms with the past on a personal, national and international level. In Estonia and in some other Eastern European countries the end of the Second World War and the defeat of the Nazi Germany did not mean a new beginning but more Stalinist repressions. In their case the Aufarbeitung, dealing with and making sense of the past, is rather belated. The novel is especially concerned with the problem of remembering and the different personal narratives this involves. The symbolism of the police tape at the beginning of the book develops into a metaphor for internal and external darkness, the incurable national dysfunction, the legacy of the Soviet past.

AB  - Increasing populations of the Black Vulture, Coragyps atratus (Bechstein, 1793) and the capacity this bird has to live near humans has resulted in vulture-human conflicts. These conflicts increase the need for the effective management of vultures. Improved understanding of communal roosting dynamics is a key aspect of vulture biology that provides information for effective management that can mitigate conflicts. Here we investigated factors influencing roosting site selection by Black Vultures in Manaus. We monitored 40 native vegetation remnants (VR), visiting each VR twice (two independent observers) between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. once every two-three months from June to November 2011. Using maximum-likelihood analysis and information-theoretic multimodel inference, we investigated the effects of VR covariates (size, shape, and location relative to feeding sites, to thermal power plants, and to other VRs) on VR occupancy by roosting Black Vultures. Distance to feeding sites (mainly garbage-dumping sites) was identified as the most important covariate (model-averaged beta = -0.62, SE = 0.26) and the other variables had no significant effects. Our results indicate that Black Vultures adjusted to the nearest possible roost to the food source to reduce the cost of movement. This suggests that reducing Black Vulture access to food through simple waste management and sanitation policies, including public education, may help reduce vulture-human conflicts in Manaus.

AB  - Buffer zones are narrow strips of land lying along the surface water, covered with appropriately selected vegetation. They separate aquatic ecosystems from the direct impact of agricultural land and reduce the movement of nutrients in the environment. In 2008 the European Commission established requirements for the implementation of buffer strips along water courses. Poland committed to the enforcement of these requirements until 1 January 2012. This was one of the reasons of this study. The subject of the analysis included the following rivers in Lower Silesia: Smortawa, Krynka, Czarna Woda and the selected transects of Sleza and Nysa Luzycka. Detailed studies were designed to estimate the buffer zones occurring on these watercourses and assess these zones' structure. This will be used to develop clear criteria for the selection of the width of these zones based on land use land management. It can be used in the implementation of executive acts at different levels of space management. Field research consisted of inventory the extent of riparian buffer strips on selected water courses and photographic documentation. Species composition of the vegetation forming a buffer zone was identified by using Braun-Blanquet method. There was lack of continuity of the riparian buffer zones on investigated rivers. Buffer zones should have carefully formulated definition and width because they are element of the significant ecological value, they perform important environmental protective functions and they are also the subject of Community law.

AB  - A growing movement is occurring across the United States to encourage college students to study abroad so that they may become better aware of other cultures and environments and more importantly is able to successfully compete in the global economy. ABET outcome h (the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context) and the report released by the National Academy of Engineering on Educating the Engineer of 2020 have provided further motivation for engineering educators to address this need. This paper will discuss the extension of an online survey developed and originally administered to undergraduate engineering students at the University of Arkansas, a public institution, to a new cohort at Stevens Institute of Technology, a private institution. This survey examines the factors prohibiting students from studying abroad, specifically, 1) if there are differences among gender, classification and/or program of study, 2) whether students do not study abroad due to financial, class selection, time, and/ or other reasons, 3) what percent of the cost associated with studying abroad the students need to have covered in order to be able to afford to study abroad, and 4) where students wish to study abroad. In addition, this comparison contrasts findings between a public, rural, comprehensive university (University of Arkansas) with a private, urban, technological university (Stevens Institute of Technology). Results show that the majority of public and private university students want to study abroad (ideally in Europe), but identify time and finances as constraints. Students from private institutions require less funding than those from public institutions.

AB  - Ailanthus alrissima (Tree of Heaven), an invasive tree species native to China and East Asia. was first introduced into the US ca. 1784 by William Hamilton at his Philadelphia, PA estate. However, the means and temporal progression of spread from this and other early points of introduction are not clear. This species now occurs in >40 US states, primarily as an urban and roadside weed. The Northeast supports the highest densities of Ailanthus within the US, mainly in transportation corridors and urban areas, where it has become the dominant tree species. A recent, widespread increase in Allan thus incidence in eastern hardwood forests, not unlike prior invasions along railways and roadsides, suggests that current conditions favor invasion in natural environments. To help elucidate the life history of Ailanthus in Pennsylvania and the northeastern US, as well as answer fundamental biological questions concerning this species, we conducted dendrochronological (tree-ring) studies and floristic surveys beginning in 2010. Although we studied population dynamics, age structure, and tree-ring characteristics of Ailanthus primarily in Pennsylvania, we supplemented our studies using trees from adjacent northeastern states. Floristic studies, conducted between 2010 and 2011, revealed Ailanthus to be present in 60 of 67 Pennsylvania counties, including nine previously unreported counties. Tree-ring studies of these trees, as well as of trees from adjacent states, indicated Ailanthus was a suitable species for tree-ring analyses, although false rings were observed in >20% of trees examined. Our results also revealed Ailanthus to be longer-lived than previously reported, reaching ages >100 years, at which time female trees still produced viable seed. However, extant Ailanthus did not exceed 120 years in age, and therefore could not be directly linked with any documented late 18th-century or early 19th-century plantings. Nevertheless, continuous colonization in southeastern Pennsylvania, spanning two centuries, by overlapping generations of Ailanthus was supported by observations at Bartram's garden in Philadelphia. Regression analysis revealed that tree diameter was a significant predictor (le = 0.80) of Ailanthus age and could be used to estimate ages of historic trees whose diameters were reported in early literature, which revealed establishment of Ailanthus in six Pennsylvania counties 70-118 years earlier than previously reported. Tree-ring studies of extant trees revealed that Aar/nth/is had gone unreported in some counties for 50 years, during which subsequent invasions occurred. Lastly, we report that widespread invasion of forests by Ailanthus is a relatively recent phenomenon in Pennsylvania, with most invasions occurring after 1965, following major forest disturbances such as salvage logging in the aftermath of widespread insect defoliator outbreaks, especially Lymantria c//spar (Gypsy Moth) defoliations. These findings are consistent with previously reported lag times between initial colonization and the onset of rapid range expansion for other invasive plant species. Our results emphasize the need for more thorough inventories of A ilanthus within forests prior to harvesting. Such inventories will afford forest managers opportunities to preemptively eradicate Ailanthus and mitigate future invasions by this species.

AB  - Individual behavior that reduces vulnerability to predation can affect population dynamics of animals. Temperate-nesting Canada Geese (Branta canadensis maxima) have increased steadily throughout the Atlantic flyway and have become a nuisance in some parts of their range. The objective of our study was to describe movements and habitat use during the postbreeding period of Canada Geese recently established in southern Quebec. More specifically, we wanted to determine whether geese were using areas where hunting was allowed to assess the potential of harvest to control the number of geese. We tracked a sample of geese fitted with radio or conventional alphanumeric collars throughout the fall in three zones characterized by different habitats and hunting pressure. Before the hunting season, geese left the breeding area where hunting was allowed to reach suburban areas where firearm discharge was prohibited or hunters' numbers were low. These postbreeding movements occurred when juveniles were approximately three months old. We observed few local movements among zones once migrant geese from northern breeding populations reached the study area. Radio-collared geese used mainly natural habitats (75.4 +/- 2.6%), followed by urban (14.4 +/- 2.7%), and agricultural habitats (10.3 +/- 0.8%). They were located 73.8 +/- 6.2% of the time in areas where hunting was prohibited. Geese that attended their juveniles during brood rearing were more prone to use areas where firearm discharge was restricted than geese that had abandoned or lost their brood. This study shows that under the prevailing regulations, the potential of hunting to manage the increasing breeding population of Canada Geese in southern Quebec is limited.

AB  - Background Studies on a limited scale in urban settings of Bangladesh report stillbirth rates that do not specifically provide information on the situation of underprivileged slum populations. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of, and risk factors associated with, stillbirth in a developing population. Methods A casecontrol study was conducted on women having a singleton birth between November 2008 and April 2009 in 34 slum areas in Dhaka. Data were collected on 231 women with stillbirth (cases) and 464 women having livebirth (controls). This study utilised the records of the Manoshi programme and supplemented it with data obtained through interview of the women. Results The stillbirth rate was 26 per 1000 total births, of which 62% occurred during the intrapartum period. Obstetrical complications contributed to 61.4% of stillbirths. Illiterate women [odds ratio (OR) 1.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1, 2.2]], women aged 35 years (OR 2.9 [95% CI 1.5, 25.5]), preterm delivery (OR 5.2 [95% CI, 3.2, 8.5]), prolonged labour (OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.6, 4.6]) and failure of labour progress (OR 2.4 [95% CI 1.1, 5.5]) were significant maternal risk factors, while decreased fetal movement, fetal malpresentation and fetal distress were the fetal risk factors associated with stillbirth. Conclusions Risk factors associated with stillbirths are amenable to intervention. There is an urgent need to educate pregnant women about risk factors for stillbirths during antenatal visits. Encouraging women to deliver at health facilities and better management of obstetrical complications may help reduce the burden of stillbirths in Bangladesh.

AB  - This paper explores the nature, source and spatial variation of the salinity of water used for irrigation in a coastal urban farming area in Cape Town, South Africa, where water from the Cape Flats aquifer is drawn into storage ponds and used for crop irrigation. Water samples were collected in summer and winter from selected sites across the study area and were analysed for salinity as well as for concentrations of major and minor ions. Each site consists of one borehole and one pond. Isotope analysis was done for the summer samples so as to assess effects of evaporation on water quality and salinity. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the variation in range of concentration of specific ions with the recommended ranges set by the South African Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Geographical information system (GIS) analysis was used to describe the spatial distribution of salinity across the study area, and hydro-geochemical analysis was used to assess the possibility of seawater intrusion into the aquifer system and to characterise groundwater in the study area. The results of the research showed that the concentrations of chloride, nitrate, potassium and sodium exceeded the target maximum limit according to DWAF and FAO guidelines. Groundwater and pond water were also observed to be brackish in most parts of the research area in terms of total dissolved salts content, and fresh water was only found in the middle section of the research area. It is concluded that the accumulation of salts in groundwater and soil in the study area is mainly due to the agricultural activities and partially due to the natural movement of water through the geological formation of the Cape Flats region. These findings permit the formulation of a conceptual model of the occurrence of the salinization process, which implies that the groundwater and pond water in the study area are generally suitable for irrigation purposes, but need to be used with caution as the vegetables grown are classified as sensitive and moderately sensitive to salt according to DWAF guidelines for irrigation water quality (1996). The research paves a way for possible quantitative simulation of salt mass balance in future.

AB  - Near-surface monitoring and subsurface characterization activities were undertaken in collaboration with the Southwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership on their San Juan Basin coal-bed methane pilot test site near Navajo City, New Mexico. Nearly 18,407 short tons (1.670 x 10(7) kg) of CO2 were injected into 3 seams of the Fruitland coal between July 2008 and April 2009. Between September 18 and October 30, 2008, two additions of approximately 20 L each of perfluorocarbon (PFC) tracers were mixed with the CO2 at the injection wellhead. PFC tracers in soil-gas and in the atmosphere were monitored over a period of 2 years using a rectangular array of permanent installations. Additional monitors were placed near existing well bores and at other locations of potential leakage identified during the pre-injection site survey. Monitoring was conducted using sorbent containing tubes to collect any released PFC tracer from soil-gas or the atmosphere. Near-surface monitoring activities also included CO2 surface flux and carbon isotopes, soil-gas hydrocarbon levels, and electrical conductivity in the soil. The value of the PFC tracers was demonstrated when a significant leakage event was detected near an offset production well. Subsurface characterization activities, including 3D seismic interpretation and attribute analysis, were conducted to evaluate reservoir integrity and the potential that leakage of injected CO2 might occur. Leakage from the injection reservoir was not detected. PFC tracers made breakthroughs at 2 of 3 offset wells which were not otherwise directly observable in produced gases containing 20-30% CO2. These results have aided reservoir geophysical and simulation investigations to track the underground movement of CO2. 3D seismic analysis provided a possible interpretation for the order of appearance of tracers at production wells.

AB  - Many forms and theories regarding human collective behaviors have been developed in the last century. Yet, these theories may not be adequate to explain today's human collective behaviors in the Digital Age. Societies worldwide are witnessing more and more unexpected collective behaviors such as flash mobs than a decade ago. Therefore, understanding what is shaping human collective behaviors in the 21st century would give insight into a variety of current, important societal phenomena and issues in the Digital Age.
   The researchers conducted a pilot study on flash mobs as a means to investigate the collective behaviors inspired by modern social media and its potential impact on business practices in the Digital Age. Researchers observed that flash mobs serve a wide range of purposes ranging from business marketing to personal artistic expression. Some are constructive to our society and others are not. What factors trigger flash mobs? Can flash mobs be an effective tool used in business practices? In this research, we develop a framework with social, economic, demographic, and technological dimensions based on Melucci's (1989) new social movement theory and five hypotheses. Data was collected, filtered, and analyzed based on flash mob activities in the United States occurred during 2003-2013 that was posted on YouTube. The results of this study revealed that: 1.The frequency of flash mobs activities and the number of mobbers (participants of flash mobs) are highly correlated to the city's population. 2. The more people with higher post-secondary education, the more frequency of flash mobs activities. 3. No correlation exists between the income level and the frequency of flash mobs. 4. More business- type flash mobs happened in the Northern states than elsewhere in the United States. At this stage, there is no sufficient data to support the possession of mobile cellular phones as a contributing factor to the frequency of flash mob occurrence.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN VETERINARY ASSOCIATION

KW  - QUANTITATIVE PCR ASSAY
AB  - African horse sickness (AHS) is a controlled animal disease in South Africa, and as a result of the high mortality rates experienced, outbreaks in the AHS controlled area in the Western Cape Province have a significant impact on affected properties as well as on the exportation of live horses from the AHS free zone in metropolitan Cape Town. An outbreak of AHS serotype 1 occurred in the surveillance zone of the AHS controlled area of the Western Cape during the summer of 2011. The epicentre of the outbreak was the town of Mamre in the magisterial district of Malmesbury and the outbreak was confined to a defined containment zone within this area by movement control of all equids and a blanket vaccination campaign. A total of 73 cases of AHS were confirmed during this outbreak, which included four confirmed subclinical cases. The morbidity rate for the outbreak was 16% with a mortality rate of 14% and a case fatality rate of 88%. Outbreak disease surveillance relied on agent identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, which is novel for an AHS outbreak in South Africa. The source of this outbreak was never confirmed although it is believed to be associated with the illegal movement of an infected animal into the Mamre area. This detailed description of the outbreak provides a sound scientific basis to assist decision making in future AHS outbreaks in the AHS controlled area of South Africa and in countries where AHS is an exotic or emerging disease.

AB  - Fire over the past decade has affected forests in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California, providing an excellent opportunity to examine how this disturbance, and subsequent post-fire salvage logging, influenced California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) breeding-season site occupancy dynamics there and in the nearby San Jacinto Mountains. Using occupancy survey data from 2003 to 2011 for all-detections and pairs-only data, we estimated annual extinction and colonization probabilities at 71 burned and 97 unburned breeding-season sites before and after fire, while controlling for confounding effects of non-fire-related temporal variation and among-site differences in habitat characteristics. We found no statistically significant effects of fire or salvage logging on occupancy dynamics of spotted owls of southern California. However, we found some evidence that fire and logging effects could be biologically meaningful. For pairs data, the model-averaged mean of fire-related effects on colonization and extinction probabilities resulted in a 0.062 lesser site-occupancy probability in burned sites 1-year post-fire relative to unburned sites. Post-fire salvage logging reduced occupancy an additional 0.046 relative to sites that only burned. We documented a threshold-type relationship between extinction and colonization probabilities and the amount of forested habitat (conifer or hardwood tree cover types) that burned at high severity within a 203-ha core area around spotted owl nests and roost centroids. Sites where approximately 0-50ha of forested habitat within the core area burned at high severity had extinction probabilities similar to unburned sites, but where more than approximately 50ha of forested habitat burned severely, extinction probability increased approximately 0.003 for every additional hectare severely burned. The majority (75%) of sites burned below this threshold. Sites where high-severity fire affected >50ha of forested habitat could still support spotted owls, so all burned sites should be monitored for occupancy before management actions such as salvage logging are undertaken that could be detrimental to the subspecies. We also recommend that managers strive to reduce human-caused ignitions along the wildland-urban interface, particularly at lower elevations where owl sites are at higher risk of extinction from fire.

   In recent years, large-scale saltwater intrusion has been threatening the freshwater supply in the metropolitan cities surrounding the Pearl River delta (PRD). Therefore, a better understanding of the saltwater intrusion process in this region is necessary for local water resource management. In this paper, a one-dimensional flow and salinity model of the Pearl River networks was established to improve our understanding of saltwater intrusion problems in deltas. The model has high spatial resolution, discretized into 328 reaches and 5108 cross-sections, and the time step is 300 seconds for the hydrodynamic model and 30 seconds for the salinity model on the basis of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. The model is calibrated and validated against the field measurements of the water surface elevation, discharge, and salinity at around 40 gauges in 2005 and 2001, respectively. The estimated results are in reasonable agreement with the observational data, suggesting that the model is sufficiently robust to simulate the movement of flow and salinity in the Pearl River networks. The simulated 0.5 parts per thousand salinity isohaline in the Pearl River networks displays a shape similar to "S" and slanting to the right, indicating that the maximum saltwater intrusion length occurs at the Humen outlet. In 2005, the saltwater intrusion lengths intruded far upstream at an average length of 32.4 km from the eight outlets, which is nearly two times that in 2001. Four representative upstream flows were also simulated to acquire quantitative knowledge of the response of the saltwater intrusion to discharges. Finally, historical data were collected to compare the situations of saltwater intrusion in the river networks in the 1960s and 2005. The result implies that the abrupt change in topography due to intensive dredging campaigns in the river networks is probably the most crucial factor leading to the saltwater intrusion outbreaks in large areas of the PRD in recent years.

AB  - Land use in east China tends to change from paddy rice to vegetables or other high-value cash crops, resulting in high input rates of organic manures and increased risk of contamination with both heavy metals (HMs) and antibiotics. This investigation was conducted to determine the accumulation, distribution and risks of HMs and tetracyclines (TCs) in surface soils and profiles receiving different amounts of farmyard manure. Soil samples collected from suburbs of Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province were introduced to represent three types of land use change from paddy rice to asparagus production, vineyards and field mustard cultivation, and divided into two portions, one of which was air-dried and sieved through 2-, 0.3- and 0.149-mm nylon mesh for determination of pH and heavy metals. The other portion was frozen at -20 A degrees C, freeze-dried and sieved through a 0.3-mm nylon mesh for tetracyline determination. HM and TC concentrations in surface soils of 14-year-old mustard fields were the highest with total Cu, Zn, Cd and aTCs of 50.5, 196, 1.03 mg kg(-1) and 22.9 mu g kg(-1), respectively, on average. The total Cu sequence was field mustard > vineyards > asparagus when duration of land use change was considered; oxytetracycline (OTC) and doxycycline were dominant in soils used for asparagus production; OTC was dominant in vineyards and chlortetracycline (CTC) was dominant in mustard soils. There were positive pollution relationships among Cu, Zn and aTCs, especially between Cu and Zn or Cu and aTCs. Repeated and excessive application of manures from intensive farming systems may produce combined contamination with HMs and TCs which were found in the top 20 cm of the arable soil profiles and also extended to 20-40 cm depth. Increasing manure application rate and cultivation time led to continuing increases in residue concentrations and movement down the soil profile.

AB  - El Shalal-Kema area is located east of Aswan town and Nile River. The Quaternary sediments (unconsolidated material of sands, gravels, and clays intercalation) represent the main aquifer in the studied area. Its water is under unconfined condition, and the water table is shallow (vary from 7.5 to 16.3 m). The concerned aquifer is recharged mainly from Aswan Dam Lake, from the excess irrigation water and from septic tanks, where the area is not served by sewage system. The direction of the groundwater movement is generally from south to north. The transmissivity values of the Quaternary aquifer (from three pumping tests) are relatively high (vary from 1,996 to 3,029 m(2)/day). The exploitation of groundwater is carried out where there is continuous withdrawal for industrial and domestic uses with a total average quantity of groundwater of 71,304 m(3) per day (25.67 million m(3) per year). The hydrochemical characteristics of the Quaternary aquifer is studied based on the chemical analysis of 29 groundwater and four surface water samples collected from different sites. The chemical composition of the groundwater is dominated by calcium Ca2+ from the cations and bicarbonate (HCO (3) (-) ) from the anions, and the order of cation abundance is Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ and HCO (3) (-) > SO (4) (2-) > Cl- among the anions. The groundwater types are normal chloride water, normal sulfate water, and normal carbonate water. The hypothetical salt combination revealed the presence of different salts arranged in terms of their predominant as Ca(HCO3)(2), Mg(HCO3)(2), NaCl, Na2SO4, MgSO4, KCL, NaHCO3, MgCl2, CaSO4, and K2SO4. The analytical measurements to the NO2 and NH3 reveal that their values decrease in summer and increase in winter due to the stoppage of pumping which leads to the increase of the wastewater quantities that reach the groundwater. The chemical and microbiological analyses show that the aquifer in this area is contaminated with fecal and disease-causing bacteria. The main cause of this contamination is the outflow from the septic tanks; therefore, the construction of sewage network is a vital solution. Chlorination is important to disinfect the groundwater at the tanks before its distribution to the houses.

AB  - The post-cancer period is a transition phase, and one that is very difficult psychologically for the patient. Issues, both somatic as well as psychological, can develop even if the cancer occurred a long time ago. Developed while preparing for the 29th congress of the SFPO (Caen, October 2012), the aim of the SFPO guidelines is to raise awareness of this period and its associated difficulties, and to support development of the organisation of psycho-oncology care for this post-cancer period, as well as its integration into the overall and continued treatment for patients. This integration is based, amongst other things, on the quality of the town hospital health network (quality in communication) and the accessibility of long-term psychological care. This integration ensures that psychological support is adapted to meet somatic reality, such as taking emotional factors associated with physical symptoms into consideration. These recommendations, based on an analysis of the literature and collective professional expert opinions, define: 1) the importance of an assessment of the patients' psychological state and of the family circumstances in the post-cancer period by hospital-based oncology teams and those working in town-based practices, and including any severe physical symptoms; 2) the need for a specialised assessment by a mental health professional in light of any long-term or repeated emotional symptoms, any persistent functional symptoms, any cognitive issues or any difficulty in returning to family and socio-professional roles; 3) the methods of anticipating post-cancer issues; 4) the need for access to long-term psychological care; 5) the need to systematically integrate psychologist appointments into the individual care programme; and 6) research ideas.

AB  - A cross-disciplinary (sedimentological, geochemical, micropalaeontological and archaeological) examination of 12 continuous cores, up to 20 m long, integrated with stratigraphical, geomorphological and historical investigations, allows for reliable delineation of the middle-late Holocene environmental evolution in the Pisa old town area, with special emphasis on the Etruscan age transition. Depositional facies were identified through integration of sedimentological and micropalaeontological (benthic foraminifers, ostracods, phytoclasts and palynomorphs) data, while sediment dispersal patterns were reconstructed on the basis of geochemical analyses. Facies architecture was chronologically constrained by combined archaeological and radiocarbon dating. The turnaround from early Holocene, transgressive conditions to the ensuing (middle-late Holocene) phase of sea-level highstand is witnessed by a prominent shallowing-upward succession of lagoonal, paludal and then poorly drained floodplain deposits supplied by two river systems (Arno and Serchio). This 'regressive' trend, reflecting coastal progradation under nearly stable sea-level conditions, was interrupted by widespread swamp development close to the Iron-Etruscan age transition. The expansion of vast, low-lying paludal areas across the alluvial plain was mostly induced by the intricate, short-term evolution of the meandering Arno and Serchio river systems. These changes in the fluvial network, which occurred during a period of variable climate conditions, strongly influenced the early Etruscan culture (7th-5th century BC) in terms of human settlement and society behaviour. Conversely, a strong impact of human frequentation on depositional environments is observed at the transition to the Roman age (from the 1st century BC onwards), when the wetlands were drained and the modern alluvial plain started to form. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction fits in with the original geographical descriptions mentioned in Strabo's Chronicles, and provides chronologically constrained data of fluvial evolution from the Pisa old town area.

Due to the main earthquake fault is characteristic of thrust movement, secondary geological disasters are distributed in the upper plate, for example in Shuangshi Town, Taiping Town and longmen Countryside in Lushan County and surrounding areas of Muping Town in Baoxing County. The abnormal loosening and fragmentation of the mountains caused by the 7.0 magnitude earthquake can provide a great many of materials for secondary geological disasters' occurrence. Once torrential rain or heavy rain occurs, large-scale landslides, debris flows and avalanches will be formed in the areas. Secondary geological disasters will frequently occur in the future many years. The zone along Shuangshi-Taiping. Longmen-Qishuping(Part B in Fig. 2) and the area near Muping Town in Baoxing County will be high danger places.

TI  - THE POSITION OF THE LATE MODERN MOVEMENT IN THE GERMAN CULTURAL HERITAGE ACT A Comparison with the Questions in slovakia
T2  - ARCHITEKTURA & URBANIZMUS
LA  - Slovak
AB  - At the end of the 1980s, the German art historian and expert on architectural theory Norbert Huse adopted the term "Unbequeme Denkmalpflege", best translated as "uncomfortable cultural heritage protection". This phenomenon was a reaction to the highly lax approach of heritage institutions towards specific architectural works of the 20th century, of which a wide range of examples exists in Germany. Until today, this term can be taken to mean primarily the response of politically influenced architecture of the Nazi or the GDR regimes.
   As currently much in use, the term perfectly describes all arguments, discussions and emotions that occur in connection with this architecture, and is applicable as well to architecture in Slovakia. Is this kind of architecture worth preserving? If yes, what should be the criteria to evaluate it? The main aim of the discussions is to find a reasonable way to treat the architecture of the previously mentioned regimes, as well as the architecture of 60s and 70s, which is usually wrongly qualified as socialistic architecture. In Germany, a lot of buildings are in danger of being pulled down, since they do not fit with contemporary esthetic views and historical concepts still present in Germany, still aiming towards revitalization and innovation of the cities.
   Nonetheless, German experts are increasingly concerned about the question of to what extent should cultural heritage protection concern itself with this type of architecture? Much as in Slovakia, it is a commonplace in Germany as well that the objects of cultural heritage protection are historical monuments and buildings - the elementary condition for listing being the age of the building.
   Nonetheless, the status that the date of the origin of the building is not a legally binding heritage value in Slovakia, is supported by The Declaration Of the Slovak National Council on Cultural Heritage Protection No.49/2002, 2 Basic Definitions, article 1 and 2.
   According to this Act, every building could be possibly integrated into the system of heritage protection if it complies with at least one of the values given, which are evaluated by the experts and the Monuments Board of the Slovak Republic - without considering the age of the building as a criterion. Many deputies of responsible bodies have provided the argument that this or that building is not "old enough" to be considered as a monument. Even though a monument should first of all be a witness or a source of knowledge for some particular development (historical or human), based on a clear analysis of the Slovak Register of Monuments, we may allege that this architecture is not a priority of the Monuments Board. Even despite the major elapse of time between the 1960s and the year 2013, we can clearly note that for the era after 1945, the Register of Monuments contains 847 objects, out of which only 2 objects were completed after 1960.
   In the field of cultural heritage and monument protection in Germany, post-1945 architecture is a topic for several years and the wide and extensive discussions and conferences (also of an international importance) have contributed to the protection or preservation of this modern heritage. Every federal state (Bundesland) has its own legislative act defining architectural landmarks differently. At the same time, in all of the 16 states there is an anticipation that the architecture of late Modernism could be granted heritage protection.
   In both Slovakia and Germany, the main argument provided in registering a built object to the monuments register is its date of origin. Only the history makes the building worth protecting. According to the law, the building must date from "previous decades". However, this particular formulation is not outlined and the conditions are not defined with much precision. Moreover, beyond sheer chronology, it is worth noting that in an era without stylistic homogeneity, as has been the case from the beginning of the 20th century, it is not easy to differentiate what style is "past" and what is an architectural tendency in progress. Or, in other words, what is "only old" and what is already considered as historical.
   From the year 1971, when the modern law on monument protection on the state and federal level in Germany took effect, the number of historical periods brought into its scope has widened quite significantly. In the beginning, only the objects that originated by the end of the 19th century were considered as historical; in following years the first half of the 20th century was added - including Secessionism, classical Modernity, the Neue Sachlichkeit and the conservative "Heimatschutz" style. Also, over time the architecture of The Third Reich was included, even if only on grounds of its historical importance. Starting from the decade of the 1990s, the time span has widened significantly - by now, the period of the 1960s and 1970s has gained sufficient distance and a sense of enough historic importance to be already considered a "past decade" in German heritage and monument protection. Nonetheless, the registration of these buildings of this particular era is far from clear and problem-free. In the first place, these buildings are very different in terms of technology, aesthetics and indeed architectural style. Therefore, obtaining and examining their qualities cannot be done with the same evaluation methods that are valid for the older monuments.
   As it would appear, Slovak experts have quite a lot to do until this architecture is listed and classified under current heritage protection practice. Yet the simple question of categorization or changes in evaluation methods for architecture is not the only problem with modern architecture that the heritage authorities in Slovakia should address. The problems that are currently facing the evaluation of Late Modernist buildings in Slovakia can only be solved by legislation.
   Since the Slovak Monuments Board refuse to register such objects primarily on the basis of insufficient age, concurrent steps must be taken to avoid the devastation and loss of these buildings. True, the argument that this architecture needs some time to be evaluated in terms of quality and benefits is correct and fully understandable. However, the extent and the rapid pace of development of our cities, together with the constant pressure on the part of the investors and developers are the main causes why such buildings are usually appreciated only "in memoriam".
   One of the legislative possibilities should be a new definition of the word "noteworthy". According to experts, there are some general obligatory decrees that protect such notabilities but since they lack the force of legislative acts they do not have enough importance when it comes to the decision-making about the further destiny of the "noteworthy" building, a status that offers strong potential for its protection. If granted legislative value, however, the building could acquire a completely different position in the system of Slovak monuments protection.
   In German monument protection, the term "noteworthy" is mentioned quite frequently. In regular practice, it is applied to objects which are not necessarily specified as monuments but for which there exists some reason for protection and preservation. Usually, the designation is invoked for buildings seen as worth preserving by society at large. As a result, the preservation of such objects, even though proposed by a small group or an individual, is accordingly subjected to evaluation by professionals. Criteria invoked by the expert boards include the importance of the building for its surroundings, its documentary value, its status as an example for a specific folk tradition or importance for local history. At a later date, it is expected that such architecture should be granted the status of a monument, or at least obtain some other form of protection.
   In Slovak heritage-protection law, a similar term occurs as well. According to professionals in the field, however, it is redundant and has only a declarative meaning, not a legislative one. Buildings with such a designation have no legislative protection and could be pulled down like any other building. And yet, it is precisely these buildings currently under this designation that should gain protection through legislative force.
   Designations of what is "notable" are applied at the immediate local level; therefore it is in the competence of the individual city or town how to handles such buildings and what fate is in store for them. This list, with its own specific criteria and values, should be helpful for the restoration or preservation of the architecture of the 1960s and 1970s. By giving an importance to a definite building, we may create a form of protection and a future assurance for this particular building. The status of "notability" would not be an equivalent category to that of the monument, it would instead serve as an intermediate stage and be subordinate to the monument in terms of categorization. The difference between the "notable" building and the monument would be in the level of protection, the building measures allowed, and the possibility of changes, which would mean to meet halfway with the investors, mainly in terms of alterations the architecture regarding energy conservation.
   By defining clear conditions, we could avoid the loss of valuable architectural heritage and could acquire the desired time distance for eventual monument status.
   From this short introduction to the treatment of Modernist architecture in Germany. and its comparison with the ambitions in Slovakia, we can immediately note that our German colleagues from the Cultural Heritage and Monuments board are one step ahead: they have evaluated the architecture of the 1960s and the 1970s as deserving protection, elaborated an advisory evaluation methods and created categories for distinguishing the best of the era. But mainly - they discuss: in many specialized forums and web portals, popular initiatives... Discussions are carried on at various levels, at universities, in cities, during conferences. Altogether, the situation is not much different in Slovakia, only in Germany it is carried out on a much larger scale: the voices are heard, the words and the opinions of the participants have some importance, along with the opinions of professionals.
   To sum up, we cannot say that the development of cultural heritage and monuments protection in Slovakia is delayed - on the contrary, it is not. Attempts have appeared towards acceptance of this modern architecture, more and more voices are being raised, popular or professional opinions are presented for registering important examples on the list of monuments. However, currently with this legislative and the stubbornness of many bureaus they do not have the chance to succeed.

AB  - Knut Dorum A confrontation of absolutism and the society of orders. The making of a popular public sphere on the Norwegian countryside 1814-1850 Previous studies of political culture in Norway in the period 1814-1850 have mainly concentrated on events and movements surrounding the Storting and the bourgeoisie in large urban areas. Exceptions were formation of the peasants' opposition in the Storting and of the radical lower class movement under the guidance of Marcus Thrane in 1848-1851. Little attention has been paid to the development of a popular rural public sphere and the early democratization of local communities in Norway in the period 1814-1850. This article argues that democratization and politicization taking place after 1814 intensified in the 1830s and 1840s and encompassed large numbers of the rural lower classes (including servants, cottars and craftsmen). These processes occurred more rapidly and to a far greater extent than previous research has maintained areas such as inns, tavernas, small taprooms, the church Green as well as private homes and houses were all given new meanings and functions and, as a result, became informal political arenas that differed from those existing before 1814. Groups and individuals from various social backgrounds came together to discuss and identify societal issues of common interest and thereby to influence political action and decision making. In addition to spreading liberal political ideas, this led to widespread literacy and the distribution of letters, books, pamphlets, handwritten and printed protest documents and newspapers, especially in regard to important school reforms. In the decades after 1814, considerable efforts made to increase local self-government were often initiated from below; these materializing in new political institutions based on popular representation and heralding the ensuing great communal reform in 1837 dictating that local law devolve a substantial amount of power from local authorities to popular local bodies. This combination of forces led to vastly popular political radicalization and strong opposition to the Establishment. The present article tones down the common description of peasants as traditional and restricted in their opposition to State officials (the embetsmenn), and also the established view that politicization reached the peasant elite or upper social strata in the local communities first. Furthermore, the article underlines that 1814 was a watershed year characterized by relatively rapid formation of a socially inclusive rural public sphere whose political implications parallel what we know took place in contemporary England and France.

AB  - Previous studies of railroad employment in the nineteenth-century USA have focused on occupational mobility but remarkably little is known in quantitative terms about the geographical and inter-sectoral mobility of railroad workers in a regional or inter-regional context. Uniquely in the antebellum era among the four main trans-Appalachian railroads, which were the largest in the nation, the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O) published comprehensive payroll lists for several specific months between 1842 and 1857. Analysis of these payrolls in conjunction with city directories and manuscript schedules from the 1860 census has enabled reconstruction of key aspects of regional labor market dynamics linked to the railroad sector during this period. A number of important findings emerge, which both amplify and run counter to received wisdom. The most significant of these is that railroad workers fell largely into two groups regardless of skill level. The first group made the railroad a source of long-term employment, while the second used the railroad as a source of temporary employment either in between spells of agricultural labor locally or as a means of raising funds to move west and acquire land in newly settled districts closer to the frontier. This nineteenth-century tendency to revert to the agricultural sector runs counter to the expectations of twentieth-century human capital theory. The conventional post-bellum picture of large numbers of rootless 'boomers' gravitating westwards between railroad companies, is not in evidence on the B&O of the late 1850s. Over longer time-spans, there is some westward movement along the B&O itself, although this was partially counterbalanced by an eastward flow toward Baltimore from the interior. Shop-men had lower retention rates, especially at more westerly points, than the supposedly mobile trainmen, while railroad employees in generic trades, such as blacksmiths and machinists, were more likely to move than their non-railroad counterparts. This important finding suggests that generic workers should not be treated as homogeneous occupational groups, although such homogeneity is very largely implicit in the coding of available digital census datasets. Further to this, extensive construction work along the line of the B&O persisted long after operational service had commenced, and this provided additional opportunities for regular or intermittent railroad labor force participation. Overall, though it was not immune from competition for labor, the enormous size of the B&O compared to most manufacturing establishments of the time made it a key regulator of employment opportunity across the region that it served.

AB  - Climate warming is occurring at an unprecedented rate in the Arctic and is having profound effects on host-parasite interactions, including range expansion. Recently, two species of protostrongylid nematodes have emerged for the first time in muskoxen and caribou on Victoria Island in the western Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Umingmakstrongylus pallikuukensis, the muskox lungworm, was detected for the first time in 2008 in muskoxen at a community hunt on the southwest corner of the island and by 2012, it was found several hundred kilometers east in commercially harvested muskoxen near the town of Ikaluktutiak. In 2010, Varestrongylus sp., a recently discovered lungworm of caribou and muskoxen was found in muskoxen near Ikaluktutiak and has been found annually in this area since then. Whereas invasion of the island by U. pallikuukensis appears to have been mediated by stochastic movement of muskoxen from the mainland to the southwest corner of the island, Varestrongylus has likely been introduced at several times and locations by the seasonal migration of caribou between the island and the mainland. A newly permissive climate, now suitable for completion of the parasite life cycles in a single summer, likely facilitated the initial establishment and now drives range expansion for both parasites.

AB  - The Guantan landslide, with a total displaced mass of about 468 x 10(4) m(3), was triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and succeeding rainfall in Jushui Town, Sichuan Province, China. The landslide occurred on an anti-dip hard rock slope with a weak rock founding stratum of 200 m in thickness. To investigate the failure mechanism of the Guantan landslide, dynamic behaviors of hard and soft rock slopes were investigated by means of large scale shaking table tests. The laboratory models attempted to simulate the field geological conditions of the Guantan landslide. Sinusoidal waves and actual seismic waves measured from the Wenchuan Earthquake were applied on the slope models under 37 loading configurations. The experimental results indicated that deformation mainly developed at a shallow depth in the upper part of the hard rock slope and in the upper (near the crest) and lower (near the toe) parts of the soft rock slope. An equation for predicting the depth of sliding plane was proposed based on the location of the maximum horizontal acceleration. Finally, it was concluded that the failure process of the Guantan landslide occurred in three stages: (1) toppling failure caused by compression of the underlying soft rock strata, (2) formation of crushed hard rock and sliding surface in soft rock as the result of seismic shocks, particularly in the horizontal direction, and (3) aftershock rainfall accelerates the process of mass movement along the sliding plane.

AB  - This paper investigates the current and future road traffic requirements around Peradeniya town, provides a summary of the detailed study of stability analysis of the adjoining slope area at Peradeniya town and finally a slope area re-shaping design solution is worked-out based on slope stability analysis for the unstable area in the town. The classified traffic movement data and road geometrical data were used to illustrate the present traffic conditions and future traffic requirements for a design period of 20 years. The required carriageway width for each road and the lateral distance towards the slope that requires to be excavated from the centre of the existing road (i.e. land requirement for Colombo-Kandy road widening) was decided based on the outcome of the study. The slope area was analysed with the ground water levels, field and laboratory test data for its stability using Morgenstern-Price finite slope stability method under three different scenarios: firstly, considering actual observations, secondly for an adverse condition, and thirdly for a situation after rearranging the shape of the slope to an angle of 350 with controlled ground water table. The results of the study indicate that the road towards Colombo has to be widened up to 25m from the centre of the existing road towards slope area at Peradeniya. The stability of most parts of the area is in critical state and there is a higher percentage of probability for occurrence of landslide hazards during rainy seasons and the results of reshaping the slope area gives a remarkable level of stability.

AB  - Background: In Brazil, a higher percentage of abnormal sperm after high temperature and relative humidity observed a higher semen volume in the rainy. The semen quality may be significantly affected by environment, by fluctuations in temperature, humidity and photoperiod. The objective of this study was to evaluate the seasons influence (spring, summer, autumn and winter) on semen characteristics and testosterone levels in Nellore and Simmental bulls raised on field.
   Materials, Methods & Results: The city of Presidente Prudente-SP-Brazil, where the experiment was realize, presents latitude 21 degrees 29'50 '' S, longitude 49 degrees 14'2 '' W and altitude of 475 meters. In 2008/2009, the climatic factors measured for Spring - SP; Summer - SU; Autumn - A and the Winter - W were: average temperature (SP - 25.9; SU - 26.6; A - 21.9 and W - 21.1 degrees C), stroke (SP - 400.9; SU - 464.0; A - 721.3 and W - 142.6 hours), cumulative rainfall (SP - 291.8; SU - 925,0; A - 273.0; and W - 191.8 mm) and average relative humidity (SP - 65.9; SU - 71.7; A - 70.1 and W - 66.7%). Five Nellore and five Simmental bulls with 48-72 months old, extensively managed were evaluated for sexual soundness using physical and morphological characteristics of semen and testosterone serum levels. Sixteen semen samples by automatic electroejaculation were carried out in each of 10 bulls, totaling 160 samples. The experiment was conducted from September to August and made four harvests in each of the four seasons. The analysis of testosterone concentration (ng/dL) were performed with commercial kits and quantification of the hormone made by radioimmunoassay (RIA) totalizing eight replicates per bull, 2 per season, totalizing 80 samples. Data on characteristics of semen and testosterone evaluation were subjected to analysis of variance, considering the study as a factorial experiment, and the differences between means compared by Tukey test at 5%. There was decreased motility and vigor semen (P < 0.05) during winter in Simmental bulls. There was correlation between serum testosterone (P < 0.01) to motility and vigor in Nellore and Simmental bulls. In relation to sperm morphology, major and total defects were different (P < 0.05) between breeds in the spring, with higher percentages observed in the Simmental breed. In the winter, for minor and total defects, there were differences between breeds (P < 0.05) being major to the Simmental. For the Simmental breed, there was difference (P < 0.05) between summer and winter seasons for the major sperm defects and total quality with better morphology in the summer. The sperm concentration, between breeds, in spring and autumn showed differences (P < 0.05), being higher for the Simmental. There was difference (P < 0.05) between breeds for testosterone, in the summer season. In the Simmental breed there was a significant correlation between testosterone and semen characteristics, being mass movement (0.31), concentration (0.37) and total defects (-0.26). For the major and total defects in the Simmental, average correlations were obtained in relation to testosterone.
   Discussion: The seasonal variation has been studied with a focus on physical characteristics and sperm morphology in cattle in the tropics, describing the decline in semen quality can occur due to thermal discomfort of the animals. Based on the data it is possible to conclude that the results showed a hormonal and semen characteristics variation throughout the season change the semen quality. Bulls from Nellore breed differed from Simmental, demonstrating adaptability to the field conditions.

AB  - Background: Transforaminal and interlaminar epidural steroid injections are commonly used interventional pain management procedures in the treatment of radicular low back pain. Even though several studies have shown that transforaminal injections provide enhanced short-term outcomes in patients with radicular and low back pain, they have also been associated with a higher incidence of unintentional intravascular injection and often dire consequences than have interlaminar injections.
   Objectives: We compared 2 different approaches, midline and lateral parasagittal, of lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injection (LESI) in patients with unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathic pain. We also tested the role of concordant pressure paresthesia occurring during LESI as a prognostic factor in determining the efficacy of LESI.
   Study Design: Prospective, randomized, blinded study.
   Setting: Pain management center, part of a teaching-community hospital in a major metropolitan US city.
   Methods: After Institutional Review Board approval, 106 patients undergoing LESI for radicular low back pain were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups (53 patients each) based on approach: midline interlaminar (MIL) and lateral parasagittal interlaminar (PIL). Patients were asked to grade any pressure paresthesia as occurring ipsilaterally or contralaterally to their "usual and customary pain," or in a distribution atypical of their daily pain. Other variables such as: the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire, pain scores at rest and during movement, use of pain medications, etc. were recorded 20 minutes before the procedure, and on days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, 120, 180 and 365 after the injection.
   Results: Results of this study showed statistically and clinically significant pain relief in patients undergoing LESI by both the MIL and PIL approaches. Patients receiving LESI using the lateral parasagittal approach had statistically and clinically longer pain relief then patients receiving LESI via a midline approach. They also had slightly better quality of life scores and improvement in everyday functionality; they also used less pain medications than patients receiving LESI using a midline approach. Furthermore, patients in the PIL group described significantly higher rates of concordant moderate-to-severe pressure paresthesia in the distributions of their " usual and customary pain" compared to the MIL group. In addition, patients who had concordant pressure paresthesia and no discordant pressure paresthesia (i.e., "opposite side or atypical") during interventional treatment had better and longer pain relief after LESI. Two patients from each group required discectomy surgery in the one-year observation period.
   Limitations: The major limitation of this study is that we did not include a transforaminal epidural steroid injection group, since that is one of the approaches still commonly used in contemporary pain practices for the treatment of low back pain with unilateral radicular pain.
   Conclusions: This study showed that the lateral parasagittal interlaminar approach was more effective than the midline interlaminar approach in targeting low back pain with unilateral radicular pain secondary to degenerative lumbar disc disease. It also showed that pressure paresthesia occurring ipsilaterally during an LESI correlates with pain relief and may therefore be used as a prognostic factor.

AB  - Border zone research has become one of the most important objectives in geographical investigations in Hungary. Geographers, in the first phase of their research, formulated the academic problem itself; that is, whether or not border zone settlements develop differently from those settlements which are located in other parts of the country. Border zone location supposedly has an - advantageous or disadvantageous - impact on the development of a given settlement. In the next phase of research, - between 1991-1994, empirical research was carried out. Statistical analyses and surveys through questionnaires were made in relation to the areas and settlements located in the vicinity of the Serbian-Hungarian border. This research was primarily aimed at exploring the economic relations of these settlements, and, as a result, the conclusion was drawn that in most cases border zone location is favourable when a developed region meets another relatively developed region. If the two sides of the border are both underdeveloped, that is, poverty meets poverty, or there is a considerable developmental gap between the settlements located on the two sides of the border, border zone location is only to preserve the peripheral characteristics of the given settlement. At the end of this paper the candidate status of Serbia, will be discussed, too.
   As it has been stated earlier, in the last few decades the investigation of areas near Hungary's border became an important research topic for geographers in Hungary. Consequently, initially we also carried out empirical research in the initial phase of our research, with the aim of exploring economic relations. Later, we turned our attention to cross border relations. This change can be explained by the emergence of euroregions and of various other regional organizations in Hungary. Thus the first part of the paper explores the results of our theoretical research, while in the second part the summary of our own empirical investigations will be published. The investigation of the complex and many-sided system of relations between man and nature and the in-depth exploration of this problem was an important task for several geographers in the 20th century. Initially, our research also focused on geographical regions (e.g. geography of the area between the Danube and the Tisza rivers.) Due to the intensity of professional discussions and debates a sharp distinction was made between aspects of human geography and physical geography.
   The emergence of economic regions (rayons), a process of the 1960s, occupied a central position in the research dealing with aspects of human geography. It became generally accepted that the establishment of regions should serve the interests of practical planning. (Vorosmarti A, 1961.) This kind of research into economic regions was seen in a strong ideological context, which was the result of Hungary's contemporary historical context and social system. In the 1990s socio-economic relations were being transformed and these changes challenged the science of geography as well. Ethnic and political geographic investigations were gaining significance; researchers aimed at exploring the effect of changing conditions on society and on certain areas and regions. These questions are difficult to answer in our days as well. While in previous decades those investigations were significant, which supported planning, today more attention is paid to the interrelatedness of various international projects. The political changes of the 1990s created a favourable political background for regional cooperation between the individual countries. The process of the development of international regions is a political question, too. In areas of uneven development several zones emerged with significant differences concerning their level of development. Most disadvantaged areas are of peripheric location, i.e. they lie in the vicinity of the country- or county borders Peripheric location and border zone location do not mean the same thing, still, both terms describe a specific condition. The relationship between administration and the regions of specific location is rarely harmonious, although the specific problems of these regions could be addressed more efficiently if they would got refelcted in the administrative system, too. Political boundaries closely relate to the emergence of nation-states. When interpreting the notion of borders from the point of view of political geography, it can be stated that borders exemplify separation and union as well. Border zone itself is a political as well as a spatial category. The development and possibilities for improvement in border zone settlements are influenced by the notion about national borders and also by the historically justified system of relationships between the given countries.
   Any region comprises a certain group of settlements (Dovenyi Z. 1980.) and the intensive relations between them. It can also be considered as a system of relations between the centre and its zones of attraction. All definitions describe a region as an area - although there are differences in these descriptions considering the individual interpretations and their ideological background.. The notion of the region is not a permanent, static category; a region is a dynamically changing social phenomenon, undergoing significant changes all the time. Consequently, a region can be interpreted as a process. Considering the above it is a process during which a certain region develops as part of society's spatial organization, i.e. it is the institutionalization of the region. This process comprises four levels. 1. The emergence of the spatial framework 2. The emergence of the ideological framework 3. The emergence of the institutional framework 4. Institutionalization, i.e. the existence of a regional system and regional awareness.
   Cooperation within the border zone is an integral part of the foreign policies of the countries concerned.. The social and economic content of cooperation is in accordance with the four main principles of the European Union, that is the free movement of capital, work force, goods and services. The trilateral cooperation is part of this idoeology, which is aimed at improving cross border relations in the human as well as in the economic spheres. It also aims to integrate these processes into the framework of up-to-date European processes. Regarding the level of the development of these regions there are asymmetries, which can be explained by human resources problems, as well as the heterogeneous development of economic factors. (Herendi I. 2009.) The geographical location of the University of Szeged was decisive when we chose the 74 settlements of the border zone for our human and physical geographical analyses.. These investigations resulted in including 23 additional settlements from Voivodina (Serbia) and 44 settlements from Partium (Romania) into our research. (These latter settlement are disregarded by this paper).
   All the other settlements were examined from a variety of aspects.
   Social conditions
   The region's demographical conditions are of specific nature. The towns with the largest population density are symmetrically located in the region.
   Economic conditions
   Agriculture is the traditional employer of the region and and subsidiary enterprises are of great significance, too..
   Industry is of low productivity, it has lately been transformed into sercvice industries, or, in a worse scenario, it did not survive the changes..
   The process of the emergence of regions is a significant factor in cross border cooperation within Europe. It is our mutual interest that cross border existence as well as regionalism be interpreted in a complex way and in acordance with all their implications. (Nagy I. 2001.) Similar investigations were carried out using the same indicators in 2010 concerning the area of the Danube-Kris-Mures-Tisza Economic Cooperation. The economic activities of the population, GDP figures, the quality of life were all considered.
   In summary, cross border research can enhance the formation, the functioning and the development of regions. This is the primary reason why this -and similar - research will be of utmost importance in a variety of academic disciplines in the future, too.
