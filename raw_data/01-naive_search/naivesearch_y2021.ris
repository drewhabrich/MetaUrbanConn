AB  - Context Large cities contain different sizes and distributions of green spaces in a sea of buildings and roads. This urban landscape establishes habitats for different species that migrant through or persist in cities. Objectives To describe and analyze how green spaces patterns differ in large cities by using new mapping methods. This tool helps urban planning for land use decisions. Methods Using Patch Analyst Metrics, we propose a new method to analyze the current spatial arrangement of green spaces in Mexico City and New York City, long-established urban areas, as case studies. Results The two cities differ in the number, size, and spatial distribution of green spaces. Mexico City has high numbers of large green spaces for native species habitat, but most of them are in a cluster in the south. In New York City, large spaces are distributed scattered throughout the whole territory, but New York City has much small areas than Mexico City. This spatial analysis shows areas for connectivity among existing green spaces that can improve the dispersal of many taxa of plants and animals. However, ecological planning must vary between the cities; no single generalization is appropriate. Conclusions Much data are available on the potential dispersal of species through cities, but a easily applied framework for understanding the existing habitat distribution is needed for future decisions. The results suggest mapping mechanisms can help to increase plant and animal movement patterns. However, these older cities have idiosyncratic starting points that must be the basis of future improvements.

AB  - Biodiversity-sensitive cities can contribute to reconnect humans with nature and halt global biodiversity loss. Achieving biodiversity-sensitive cities is challenging, especially in regions threatened by growing urbanization. To inform urban management and planning in a global biodiversity hotspot, we conducted a multi-scale assessment of drivers of Neotropical birds in the capital city of Santiago de Chile. We investigate the influence of local and landscape variables on native bird species richness and abundance. We surveyed birds and vegetation in 449 sampling points distributed across the city. Native bird species richness was greater in areas with greater shrub and woody vegetation cover at the local scale. Native bird species richness was also greater with high vegetation density in the surrounding landscape and near to an urban boundary. Native birds were abundant in areas with large woody vegetation cover at both local and landscape scales, high vegetation density in the surrounding landscape, near to an urban park and near to an urban boundary. Additive effects of vegetation at different spatial scales suggest that combining local and landscape management, planning and design will be best to preserve native birds in a large city. Although native birds are species rich and abundant near the urban fringe and decrease towards the interior of the city, local-scale management of habitat encouraging shrub and tree planting and landscape-scale actions such as targeting high levels of vegetation (including woody cover) and providing a well-distributed network of urban parks will help sustain native birds across the city. Greening actions at local and landscape-scale will contribute to achieving biodiversity-sensitive cities, providing benefits for people and nature.

AB  - Context Urbanisation is an environmental filter for many species that leads to community homogenisation, with a few species inhabiting isolated patches (e.g. public and private gardens and parks) embedded within the urban landscape. Promoting biodiversity in urban areas requires understanding which species traits allow species to survive the urban landscape. Objectives The objective of this study was to assess how species traits and landscape factors combine to allow species functional groups to live in the city. Methods We used butterfly count data collected by volunteers in 24 gardens of Barcelona city, during 2018 and 2019. Species were clustered in functional groups according to their traits. We applied a multinomial choice model to test for the effect of the landscape on the different functional groups. Results Three functional groups became prevalent in the city while a fourth, containing most sedentary specialist species, was filtered out. Although the observed groups had similar species richness, abundances varied depending on urban landscape characteristics. Specialist sedentary specialists and medium mobile species were all favoured by patch connectivity; while the presence of mobile generalist species was only enhanced by habitat quality. Our results indicate that butterfly communities are more diverse in highly connected gardens. Conclusions Our study highlights the need of contextualised management with actions accounting for the species functional groups, rather than a management focused on general species richness. It demonstrates that urban landscape planning must focus on improving connectivity inside the city in order to diversify the community composition.

AB  - The negative impact of urbanization on biodiversity can be buffered by blue (e.g., rivers, ponds) and green (e.g., parks, forests) spaces. However, to prevent biodiversity loss and reduce the risk of local extinctions, blue and green spaces need to be connected by corridors, so that organisms may disperse between sites. Landscape connectivity affects local community composition and metacommunity dynamics by facilitating dispersal. The goal of this study was to test the relative roles of pond environmental properties, spatial structure, and functional landscape connectivity on differentiation of invertebrate metacommunities in urban ponds in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. We characterized functional connectivity as blue connectivity (distance to water bodies), green connectivity (land use), and combined blue-green connectivity. We estimated functional connectivity by using electrical circuit theory to identify dispersal corridors. Interestingly, while circuit theory is often used in single-taxon studies, this method has rarely been applied to multiple taxa forming a metacommunity, as we have done in this study. Indeed, our study contributes toward an increased focus on the role of dispersal at the metacommunity level. We deter-mined that functional connectivity was the most important factor in explaining community differentiation, with the local environment contributing comparatively little, and spatial structure the least. Combined blue-green functional connectivity had a major influence on structuring urban pond communities, explaining 7.8% of the variance in community composition across ponds. Furthermore, we found that increased functional connectivity was associated with an increase in the number of species. In summary, our results suggest that to preserve biodiversity in urban ponds, it is important to enhance functional connectivity, and that open green spaces could augment blue corridors in maintaining functional connectivity in urban pond metacommunities. To generalize these findings, future urban biodiversity studies should compare how functional connectivity affects meta-communities across multiple major cities. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - As the world becomes more and more urbanized, it is increasingly important to understand the impacts of urban landscapes on biodiversity. Urbanization can change local habitat factors and decrease connectivity among local habitats, with major impacts on the structure of natural food webs. However, most studies have focused on single species, or compared rural to urban habitats, which do not inform us on how to design and manage cities to optimize biodiversity. To understand the local and spatial drivers of ecological communities within urban landscapes, we assessed the relative impact of local habitat factors (sunlight exposure and leaf litter) and spatial connectivity on an oak-associated herbivore community within an urban landscape. From the local habitat factors, leaf litter but not sunlight exposure was related to herbivore species richness, with leaf litter contributing to the maintenance of high species richness on isolated trees. Guilds and species differed strongly in their response to local habitat factors and connectivity, resulting in predictable variation in insect community composition among urban oaks. Taken together, our study shows an interactive effect of local and spatial factors on species richness and species composition within an urban context, with guild- and species-specific life histories determining the response of insects to urban landscapes. To maintain biodiversity in the urban landscape, preserving a dense network of local habitats is essential. Moreover, allowing leaf litter to accumulate can be a simple, cost-effective conservation management practice.

AB  - Landscape changes due to urban expansion may severely influence urban biodiversity through direct and indirect effects. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the urban expansion effects on species diversity is essential for conservation biologists, urban planners, and policymakers to help design more practical and effective conservation strategies. Here, based on monthly bird survey data of 12 university campuses distributed in the center and the Xianlin university town of Nanjing city, we first compared the differences of the campuses bird species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices. Then, we analyzed the effects of a variety of landscape attributes on the campuses bird species richness. Unlike other studies, we also constructed a 2 km buffer area surrounding each campus and analyzed the effects of the landscape attributes of the buffer area on species richness. We found that bird species richness was higher in the campus of Xianlin compared to those in the center. Landscape attributes played an important role on bird species richness, especially for the determinants in the buffer area. Specifically, species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices increased with the increasing area of water and green space both within the campus and the buffer area. Not surprisingly, bird species richness and diversity were more affected by fragmentation of the buffer area, increasing with the aggregation index and decreasing with the splitting index. Our study emphasized that landscape attributes of both campuses and buffer areas determined bird species richness and diversity, offering several practical implications for urban biodiversity maintenance and eco-friendly urban planning.

AB  - Biodiversity maintenance is a crucial ecosystem service. Due to time limits and data availability, assessing biodiversity using indicators or models has become a hot topic in recent decades. However, whether some proposed indicators can explain biodiversity well at the local scale is still unclear. This study attempted to test whether the habitat quality index (HQI) as measured using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs (InVEST) model could explain variations in bird diversity in New Jiangwan Town, a rapidly urbanized region of Shanghai, China. The relationships from 2002 to 2013 among HQI and the two diversity indices, species richness and species abundance, were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and gray correlation analysis. No significant association was found. Habitat connectivity was then integrated to develop a new combined indicator of habitat quality and connectivity index (HQCI). The associations between HQCI and the two diversity indices were improved significantly. The results indicated that connectivity may be an important factor explaining the diversity of certain species at a local scale. More empirical studies should be conducted to provide scientific evidence relating habitat quality to biodiversity.

AB  - Urban areas are quickly expanding in the southeastern United States with varying effects on biodiversity. Maintaining bird richness in cities is essential for conserving ecosystem function. In this study, we determined the relative importance of landscape composition and configuration on urban avian richness in the southeastern U.S. We used linear models to explore the influence of the proportion, size, aggregation, and edge density of forests, wetlands, and developed land cover types on urban avian species richness and feeding guild diversity. We found that the proportion of developed land in a city, a composition metric, and forest edge density of cities, a configuration metric, had consistent negative effects on bird richness and feeding guild diversity. These results differ from previous studies that have found landscape configuration to have a minimal influence on bird richness. Urban revegetation should therefore focus on reducing expansion of developed land and reducing edge density of large forest patches.

AB  - In peri-urban regions, the establishment of new forest patches can be affected by specific community assembly rules driving species extinction debts and colonization credits. This might result in species surpluses or deficits and shifts in species composition along forest establishment, whose association with human-driven landscape transformation remains largely unknown. We have compared plant assemblages in peri-urban Mediterranean forests of contrasting history (recent vs. preexisting; post- vs. pre-1956) according to species' habitat requirements (forest, scrub-grassland, synanthropic or other) and dispersal mode (vertebrate- vs. non-vertebrate), while considering site and landscape characteristics. Species richness and cover were mostly associated to site characteristics, but also to forest connectivity and history. Connectivity increased total species cover, forest species richness and both richness and cover of vertebrate-dispersed species, while reducing non-forest species richness and synanthropic species cover. Regarding forest history, recent stands showed higher total and non-forest species richness, higher scrub-grassland species cover and lower cover of vertebrate-dispersed species than preexisting forests. Thus, recent stands exhibit a species surplus due to the extinction debt of scrub-grassland species and the transient abundance of synanthropic species, despite the observed colonization credit of vertebrate-dispersed species. These results emphasize the importance of forest connectivity when managing plant species assemblage in peri-urban forest patches but also highlight the need to consider recent history of habitat patches to manage time lags in biodiversity change in human-transformed landscapes.

AB  - Rapid urbanization is emerging as one of the leading threats to the biodiversity globally. But is especially a cause of concern for tropical countries which are urbanizing much faster and with relatively less urban planning than temperate ones. Urban green spaces are established to reduce the negative impacts of urbanization by conserving a large suite of species. Yet our knowledge on the significance of urban green spaces for supporting urban fauna and enhancing species richness is lacking for tropical countries such as India. We examined how landscape and local scale features of urban green spaces influence bird species richness, density, fine-foraging guild richness and composition during breeding and non-breeding season in Dehradun, India. We quantified landscape level variables in the 250 m buffer around 18 urban green spaces. We sampled vegetation and bird community during breeding and non-breeding season through 52 intensive sampling point spread across 18 urban green spaces. Size of the urban green space at landscape level and tree species richness at the local scale emerged as important predictors influencing bird species richness, density and richness of imperilled insectivorous guild across seasons. Urban green spaces within education institutions and offices experiencing less vegetation management supported higher bird species richness and density whereas city parks were species poor. Community composition was affected more strongly by built-up cover and barren area in the landscape matrix and also by tree species richness at the local scale within urban green spaces. City planners should focus on allocating green spaces within urban settings and expand the formal green spaces. Existing green spaces could be improved by augmenting compositional and structural heterogeneity of vegetation as well as conservation of large old native trees.

AB  - Aspiring towards cities that are sustainable and equitable, as detailed by Goal 11 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, has become increasingly relevant given the growing human population in urban areas. A key part of guaranteeing that cities meet Goal 11 is to ensure equitable access to urban green spaces, and the biodiversity that they support, for all residents. However, there is evidence from developed world cities of a Luxury Effect, where wealthier residents have greater access to urban biodiversity than poorer residents. To test for this Luxury Effect in a developing world city, we measured bird species richness and diversity in 27 urban green spaces in Johannesburg, South Africa, to examine how socio-economic and ecological drivers influence urban biodiversity. We found no evidence of a Luxury Effect with the median income of neighbourhoods surrounding the green spaces having no significant effect on bird richness or diversity. There were, however, ecological effects with surrounding natural land-cover negatively correlated to richness, and a positive influence of wetland connectivity on richness. The negative effect of natural land-cover is possibly due to the relatively low bird diversity of the natural grasslands surrounding Johannesburg. The positive effect of wetland connectivity and the lack of a Luxury Effect indicate that the use of waterbodies to historically separate populations has buffered poorer neighbourhoods from depreciated biodiversity within the selected green spaces. The effect of wetlands also further emphasises the importance of water availability on urban biodiversity. This indicates that historical land use decisions can still influence how biodiversity is distributed in urban landscapes.

AB  - Green roofs offer numerous environmental benefits, and thus their implementation is considered an initiative to create sustainable cities. However, the characteristics of green roofs that could enhance arthropod biodiversity and ecological functioning are poorly known, especially for South American countries. Here, we analyzed the influence of several characteristics of green roofs (plant species richness, vegetation cover of the roof, age, substrate depth, area, and isolation in terms of height and green cover in the landscape scale) on the abundance, richness (total and by functional feeding groups), and community composition of arthropods. To do that, we selected 30 green roofs located in different urbanization contexts, from small towns in semi-rural areas to Cordoba, the second-largest city of Argentina. Our results indicated a high diversity of arthropods, registering a total of 12,942 individuals corresponding to 505 species from 14 orders, being herbivores and parasitoids the dominant groups. The area of the green roofs was positively linked to total species richness, species richness of most functional feeding groups, and total abundance of arthropods. The community composition of arthropods on green roofs was also affected by their area, and by the green cover in the landscape. Moreover, green roofs with higher plant richness, mainly spontaneous, and less isolated (both vertically and horizontally) favored entomophagous arthropods. Other variables, such as age and vegetation cover of the green roofs, were also important for herbivores, predators, parasitoids and detritivores. Our study clearly demonstrates that green roof size is not all that matters for supporting arthropod biodiversity because promoting high plant diversity, allowing spontaneous ecosystem dynamics, and diminishing roof isolation foster entomophagous arthropod diversity. Our study is the first that considers multiple factors of roofs in South America and provides key knowledge for stakeholders interested in the development and management of this green infrastructure in semi-rural and urban landscapes.

AB  - Insect diversity levels and change in remnant urban habitats have been poorly examined in Neotropical regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity and composition of foliage/shrub dwelling beetles (Insecta: Coleoptera) regarding the influence of patch attributes (i.e., patch size, connectivity, and surrounding matrix) and within-patch habitat complexity, in an urban landscape at Chetumal, Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. Despite the potential species-specific responses to urban landscape pattern, our study reveals that there are effects of patch spatial features and habitat complexity on overall beetle diversity.These effects are as follows: 1) relatively larger urban patches contained higher overall beetle richness, 2) beetle species composition varied significantly regarding understory vegetation structure and tree richness, and 3) patches of intermediate vegetation age had highest beetle richness.This research provides a case study of patch and habitat features related to Neotropical insect assemblages in urban settlements, underlying the importance of using ecological information to offer management recommendations in ever-expanding urban tropical settlements.

AB  - Accelerated rates of urbanization negatively impact natural habitats and biodiversity. Studies of the effects of urbanization on fauna have emphasized taxonomic diversity, but this does not necessarily reflect effects on the evolutionary history of assemblages. Here, we study how urbanization influences phylogenetic diversity (PD) of bird assemblages in a small-medium city in the Central Andes of Colombia. Between 2016 and 2017, we performed bird surveys in 76 urban cells and 23 rural cells around the city. Then, we measured habitat characteristics (e.g. anthropogenic noise level, impervious and forested area) in sampled cells. PD of birds was between 1.37-1.42 MY higher in the rural than in the urban habitat. Within the urban habitat, the PD of birds reduces as impervious area and noise levels increase, while in the urban cells with most forested areas reach the highest PD values. Most of these differences and relationships disappear when we performed similar analysis controlling for differences in species richness. A low turnover of PD between assemblages of birds recorded inside Armenia and its less urbanized surroundings suggest green areas in the study area could mitigate the effects of urbanization in native fauna, and ameliorate connectivity between urban cells.

AB  - Urban forests are often remnants of former larger forested areas, and traditionally considered as degraded habitats due to negative effects of urbanization. However, recent studies have shown that urban forests managed for recreational purposes can be structurally close to natural forests and may provide habitat features, such as dead wood, that are scarce in intensively managed forest landscapes. In this study, we assessed how urbanization affects polypore species richness and the number of red-listed polypore species in forest stands, and the occurrences of polypore species on individual units of dead wood. Spruce-inhabiting polypore assemblages and their associations to urbanization, local habitat connectivity and dead-wood abundance were investigated in southern Finland. The effects of urbanization on polypore species richness and individual species were largely negligible when other environmental variability was accounted for. Several red-listed polypore species were found in deadwood hotspots of urban forests, though urbanization had a marginally significant negative effect on their richness. The main driver of total species richness was dead-wood abundance while the number of red-listed species was also strongly dependent on local habitat connectivity, implying that a high degree of fragmentation can decrease their occurrence in urban forests. We conclude that the highest potential for providing habitats for threatened species in the urban context lies in large peri-urban recreational forests which have been preserved for recreational purposes around many cities. On the other hand, overall polypore diversity can be increased simply by increasing dead-wood abundance, irrespective of landscape context.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation has largely reduced biodiversity in the urban fringe. The prioritization of individual habitat patches can provide spatially explicit guidance for ecological conservation and restoration. Numerous studies discussed the effectiveness of purely spatial connectivity metrics to rank the conservation priority of habitats, but hardly resolved this issue in a dynamic landscape context. Meanwhile, spatio-temporal connectivity metrics were usually applied at the landscape scale, but are rarely extended to determine habitat priority at the patch scale. As such, we extend a generalized betweenness centrality metric into spatio-temporal connectivity networks to evaluate conservation priorities of individual habitat patches from a dynamic landscape perspective. The contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are examined at varying dispersal distances of the target species. Caidian District, the fringe of Wuhan City in central China, is taken as a case study. The results illustrate that a net decrease in habitat amounts and quality from 2005 to 2015 was mainly caused by urban expansion and agricultural production. The positive contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are observed at distance thresholds exceeding 200 m at the landscape scale, which allows us to capture the response of habitat priority to landscape dynamics. Accordingly, we develop a balanced conservation strategy for multiple species and the targeted conservation measures based on the coupled analysis of quality and conservation priority of habitat patches. Our findings are expected to provide solid support for biodiversity conservation in urban growth.

AB  - Urbanization is a major contributor to habitat loss and fragmentation and is considered a global threat to biodiversity. We studied reptile and amphibian species diversity and abundance in a highly fragmented landscape adjacent to the second largest metropolitan area in the United States. Habitat patches in our study area were made up of remnant native vegetation surrounded by roads, housing, and other urban development. Species richness and diversity were positively associated with patch size, but patch age was not significantly associated with community characteristics. Four relatively common species were not detected in the small patches, indicating the possibility they had been extirpated by the time monitoring began, and six rarer species were not detected or detected only once in these patches. Although the patch size effect on species diversity was strong, we found that several of the small habitat patches had similar diversity to large patches, indicating potential value of these small habitat patches in protecting species as "microreserves.'' In addition, one lizard species was found to be significantly more abundant in the smaller patches. To determine if abundance changed over time, we compared capture rates for four common lizards at the same sites ten years later. For three of the four species, abundance decreased over that period, specifically in the small patches. Although our long-term monitoring has confirmed that the full suite of herpetofauna is currently preserved in the study area overall, declines even in the common species over time hint at the potential severity of the threat of urbanization to rare species.

AB  - Vegetation plays a fundamental role in conserving the biological diversity of urban areas. From isolated trees to multi-hectare patches, green spaces are critical to species conservation in urban landscapes. The abundance of green spaces can regulate the availability of habitat and resources for species' survival. In many urban areas, the lack of vegetation inventories and ecological information at fine spatial resolutions limits conservation efforts. To evaluate the potential of very high-resolution imagery (WorldView-2, 30-cm resolution) to fill this gap, we sought to a) map contrasting urban vegetation cover types (grass, shrubs and woody vegetation) at the meter scale and with high accuracy, b) quantify the structural and functional connectivity of urban vegetation, and c) estimate the status of productive vegetation. We focused our analysis on land use and cover in the city of Xalapa in Veracruz, Mexico, and employed multiscale satellite imagery to estimate vegetation cover, connectivity, and health. We identified 38,579 patches of woody vegetation, of which 93 % corresponded to isolated trees contributing to 27 % of vegetation connectivity. Without woody vegetation, the connectivity index decrease up to 97 %; removing grass or shrubs would reduce connectivity by 38 % or 32 %, respectively. We identified 10 patches disproportionately important to connectivity, of which seven had some type of legal protection. Across vegetation types, 38 % of the vegetated area was unhealthy. Wooded element connectivity assessment at a fine spatial resolution is crucial to conserve and restore these key resources for biodiversity and human well-being in urban environments.

AB  - Pollinator welfare is a recognized research and policy target, and urban greenspaces have been identified as important habitats. Yet, landscape-scale habitat fragmentation and greenspace management practices may limit a city's conservation potential. We examined how landscape configuration, composition, and local patch quality influenced insect nesting success across inner-city Cleveland, Ohio (U.S.A.), a postindustrial legacy city containing a high abundance of vacant land (over 1600 ha). Here, 40 vacant lots were assigned 1 of 5 habitat treatments (T1, vacant lot; T2, grass lawn; T3, flowering lawn; T4, grass prairie; and T5, flowering prairie), and we evaluated how seeded vegetation, greenspace size, and landscape connectivity influenced cavity-nesting bee and wasp reproduction. Native bee and wasp larvae were more abundant in landscapes that contained a large patch (i.e., >6 ha) of contiguous greenspace, in habitats with low plant biomass, and in vacant lots seeded with a native wildflower seed mix or with fine-fescue grass, suggesting that fitness was influenced by urban landscape features and habitat management. Our results can guide urban planning by demonstrating that actions that maintain large contiguous greenspace in the landscape and establish native plants would support the conservation of bees and wasps. Moreover, our study highlights that the world's estimated 350 legacy cities are promising urban conservation targets due to their high abundance of vacant greenspace that could accommodate taxa's habitat needs in urban areas.

AB  - Urbanization is a major cause of biodiversity loss and disconnection between people and nature. For this reason, the creation and maintenance of green areas as part of the urban landscape is a common practice in cities around the world. These green areas are generally a result of particular public policies regarding how these areas can be accessed, maintained, and how they are connected to other natural fragments in the city. In an effort to investigate aspects of the ecology of such green areas of the city of Curitiba, southern Brazil, the present study measured distinct parameters of the structure of butterfly assemblages from 19 forest fragments of distinct classes of protection, testing the influence of different policies (protection category) on butterfly assemblages. Comparatively, we also tested the predictive power of landscape variables (at distinct scales) and fragment quality (e.g. diameter at breast height, density of vegetation) using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Overall, 14,596 individuals belonging to 412 butterfly species were recorded, but values of species diversity and composition are very heterogeneous, indicating that the protection categories do not significantly interfere with the structure of the butterfly assemblages. More important than the protection category is the forest fragment quality and landscape connectivity. Our models showed that degraded fragments tend to present a specific butterfly composition, whereas the more urbanized landscape have poor butterfly species richness. These results reinforce the importance of implementing public policies that prioritize the conservation of the quality of forest fragments in every class of protection, as well as the conservation of forest fragments throughout the urban landscape.

AB  - There has been a recent increase in interest on how urbanization affects soil fauna communities. However, previous studies primarily focused on some limited land use types or line transects of urban-rural gradients. At family and higher taxonomic levels, we investigated the changes of soil mesofauna communities (abundance, species richness, and community structure) with urbanization intensity along different disturbance features in 47 sites evenly located in downtown Guangzhou and adjacent regions. The 47 research sites were classified into four ecosystem types mainly according to the location (rural/urban), vegetation cover, and management intensity. In turn, the four types with increasing urbanization intensity were rural forest, urban forest, urban woodland, and urban park. Firstly, the role of urban soil property (soil physicochemical characteristic and soil heavy metal content) in regulating soil mesofauna community was investigated. The results showed that soil mesofauna abundance and diversity decreased with increasing soil pH, total nitrogen content (TN), and heavy metal comprehensive index (CPI). Soil Pb decreased soil mesofauna species richness (taxa number) and regulated soil mesofauna community structure. Secondly, we examined the effects of landscape changes on the soil mesofauna community. We found impervious surface (IS) ratio did not predict changes in soil mesofauna abundance, species richness, or community structure. Instead, IS ratio was positively correlated with soil pH, soil TN, and CPI. After excluding sites that belonged to rural forests and urban parks, site area was positively correlated with soil mesofauna abundance. Thirdly, our results revealed significant differences in soil property, landscape trait, and soil mesofauna community among the four ecosystem types. Interestingly, urban forest, the one lightly disturbed by urbanization, but not rural forest, had the highest soil mesofauna abundance. Soil mesofauna abundance in urban woodlands was similar to that in urban parks, which was about half of that in urban forests. Species richness in urban parks was 21% lower than that in rural forests. Our results also showed that urban woodland and urban parks had distinct mesofauna community structures compared to those in rural forests and urban forests. In conclusion, the present study suggested that (1) soil property changes due to urbanization, such as increased pH and heavy metal enrichment in urban soil, decreased soil mesofauna abundance and species richness, changed community structure, and mediated the effect of landscape change on soil mesofauna community; (2) however, soil and landscape changes could not explain the increase of abundance in urban forests, which supported the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

AB  - The conservation and promotion of biodiversity in urban spaces has become a core concern in urban greening. As cities continue to densify, however, urban green spaces are becoming smaller and more isolated. Many hope that wildflowers, and with them also faunistic biodiversity, can be maintained through networks of small informal green spaces. Currently, there are little data available for city planners to answer the questions of how patch size and ecological connectivity affect the population persistence of wildflowers in small vegetation patches. To address these concerns, we surveyed all vegetation patches greater than 1 m2 in public spaces across seven 1 km2 quadrats distributed across the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Our survey focused on a list of 166 herbaceous vascular plant species. We analyzed vegetation patch topologies (frequency distributions of size and connectivity) and related it to alpha and beta species diversity. Dispersal traits of investigated species were used to interpret connectivity patterns. Over 75 % of patches were <20 m2 in size, however, these small patches made up only 3.4 % of total vegetation area. Species richness was significantly positively correlated with patch area. Nevertheless, taken together, small patches had similar species richness and higher beta diversity than larger patches. These small patches contribute far more than expected to overall wildflower species richness in the city - "punching above their weight". This held true even for less common species. However, our research indicates that connecting these patches to one another and to larger green spaces is essential to unlocking their potential as habitats and potentially allowing for the natural colonization and reinforcement of existing populations. As cities densify, we must acknowledge that small vegetation patches such as tree discs or road margins are essential for the survival of wildflower populations and associated fauna, especially in highly urbanized areas.

AB  - Cities are human dominated ecosystems providing novel conditions for organisms. Research on urban biodiversity is rapidly increasing, yet it is still hampered by the partial spatial coverage of cities and because of existing taxonomic biases. Predictive models have proved to be a key tool to solve this shortfall. However, predictive models have rarely been used in urban ecosystems due to either the lack of sufficient species records or high-quality predictors (e.g. meaningful ecological maps). Here, we assemble a large cross-taxa inventory of 1446 species from 12 taxonomic groups, including several understudied invertebrate groups, sampled in 251 sites in Zurich, Switzerland. We investigate the species diversity distributions and the structure of species assemblages along artificial urban ecological gradients by applying predictive models. We find that the general species diversity distribution law, where assemblages are dominated by a few very abundant and frequent species, applied consistently across all taxonomic groups (3% of the species accounting for approximately 50% of abundance). Furthermore, only species of intermediate abundance and frequency are spatially structured along urban intensity gradients, with rare species numbers keeping constant even in the most urbanised parts of the city. In addition, we show that green areas with low mowing regimes are associated with higher species diversity in the majority of taxonomic groups. Hence, this suggests management relaxation as a low-cost solution to promote species richness. Our study demonstrates the potential of predictive modelling for addressing ecological questions in urban environments and to inform management and planning.

AB  - As large amounts of natural environments are lost due to urbanization, the role of remnant native vegetation in the preservation of biodiversity has become even more significant. Remnant native forest patches are essential refugia for flora and fauna and are crucial for the maintenance of ecosystem processes in urbanized landscapes. We evaluated the influence of landscape structure on ants and spiders associated with Atlantic Forest remnants in urban landscapes. We sampled 14 forest areas in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador and tested the effect of the landscapes' proportion of forest cover, mean landscape isolation, and mean landscape shape complexity on the taxonomic and functional richness and the community composition of both groups. The species collected were classified into functional groups based on behavioral attributes and environmental preferences. Overall, there were strong adverse effects of forest loss, decreased connectivity, and an increase in edge effects associated with the mean shape complexity of the forest remnants. However, the spiders responded to all three landscape structure characteristics whereas the ants only responded to the landscape mean shape complexity. Our findings indicate that the maintenance of urban forest habitats is essential for the conservation of biodiversity in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador and the preservation of ecological functions performed by species within the forest areas.

AB  - Ponds are lentic waterbodies with a high conservation value for biodiversity that have long been overlooked by management policies. Recent initiatives aimed to promote the conservation of these ecosystems by restoring or creating new ponds throughout Europe. Therefore, studying responses of aquatic invertebrates to local pond characteristics and connectivity between them is determinant to understand community dynamics and colonization processes of these scattered ecosystems. We studied larval communities of odonates in 20 created or restored ponds to assess their colonization during the first 2 or 3 years. Community dynamics in relation to pond vegetation, landscape context and connectivity with other ponds were also investigated. No difference in species richness was found between restored and created ponds. Most species colonized the ponds during the first year, but a different pattern in colonization was observed between Anisoptera and Zygoptera. Community composition was related to the landscape context of ponds and the time since pond creation or restoration. Abundances were positively related to pond connectivity, especially in the suborder Zygoptera. No relationship was found between vegetation and Anisopteran larvae, while Zygoptera seem more sensible to the vegetation structure due to their endophytic oviposition. This work confirms the high colonization capacity of odonates and shows that creation of new ponds could be as efficient as pond restoration to enhance the conservation of freshwater species. It also highlights that landscape characteristics and connectivity between ponds are determinant to support higher abundances and a posteriori increase population viability at the landscape scale.

AB  - Animal biodiversity in cities is generally expected to be uniformly reduced, but recent studies show that this is modulated by the composition and configuration of Urban Green Areas (UGAs). UGAs represent a heterogeneous network of vegetated spaces in urban settings that have repeatedly shown to support a significant part of native diurnal animal biodiversity. However, nocturnal taxa have so far been understudied, constraining our understanding of the role of UGAs on maintaining ecological connectivity and enhancing overall biodiversity. We present a well-replicated multi-city study on the factors driving bat and nocturnal insect biodiversity in three European cities. To achieve this, we sampled bats with ultrasound recorders and flying insects with light traps during the summer of 2018. Results showed a greater abundance and diversity of bats and nocturnal insects in the city of Zurich, followed by Antwerp and Paris. We identified artificial lighting in the UGA to lower bat diversity by probably filtering out light-sensitive species. We also found a negative correlation between both bat activity and diversity and insect abundance, suggesting a top-down control. An in-depth analysis of the Zurich data revealed divergent responses of the nocturnal fauna to landscape variables, while pointing out a bottom-up control of insect diversity on bats. Thus, to effectively preserve biodiversity in urban environments, UGAs management decisions should take into account the combined ecological needs of bats and nocturnal insects and consider the specific spatial topology of UGAs in each city.

AB  - Ponds and lakes may be common in urban landscapes and frequently have high biodiversity and conservation value. The importance of landscape-scale conservation of lentic habitat networks has recently been recognised, yet little research has been conducted at this scale. Approaches to inventorying lentic habitats at the landscape-scale are needed to support science and conservation. This paper uses remote sensing to inventory lentic habitats across Greater Kuala Lumpur (GKL), Malaysia, characterising their distribution, abundance and type. Remote sensing images were employed to automatically identify and map the distribution of lentic habitats, capturing 1,013 individual ponds and lakes, which represent 74.3 % of the likely total. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), a multivariate hierarchical clustering method, was used to develop a typology using physical characteristics extracted from the imagery, yielding six distinct types. The diversity of habitat types was greater in peri-urban and suburban areas (Shannon's H = 1.68) than in the urban core (Shannon's H = 1.48), suggesting that urban structure influences the spatial pattern of lentic habitat diversity. Physicochemical and vegetation field data were collected from a sample of each type (n = 60). Comparisons of group membership in the typology produced from remote sensing and field data indicated demonstrable heterogeneity in local conditions within each type, and a lack of consistency between local and broader scale characteristics. Our work shows how inventories produced from remote sensing can provide insights into landscape-scale biodiversity drivers, and contribute to larger-scale conservation of lentic habitat networks. This approach can complement local studies to improve understanding of factors operating at different scales.

AB  - Although urbanization is increasing worldwide, private gardens may help mitigate the impact of urbanization on butterfly diversity. We investigated how local and landscape factors correspond with the observed butterfly species diversity and species composition in Viennese private gardens. The goal is to determine the importance of private gardens for butterfly conservation. Butterfly species were observed by skilled volunteers by applying a citizen science approach. We related butterfly species numbers in private gardens with local parameters and landscape composition in a radius of 1 km around each garden. Data were analyzed using a regression approach based on generalized linear models. The butterfly species richness in private gardens was positively correlated with butterfly species richness in the surrounding landscapes. Butterfly species richness in private gardens increased with higher proportions of area relevant for butterflies in the surrounding landscape and with increasing numbers of host and nectar plant species in the private gardens. A higher proportion of wooded areas in the surrounding landscape was related with a smaller proportion of the landscape butterfly species pool being observed in the private gardens. Overall, our results could be useful in land use planning, and for future studies of how to integrate citizen science and make urban gardens more beneficial for butterfly conservation.

AB  - Urbanization has resulted in significant habitat loss and fragmentation worldwide, which threats the provision of ecosystem services for human health and life. Maintaining and improving the connectivity of the remnant habitats in and around cities is essential for landscape planning. Landscape metrics have been widely used for modeling and evaluating how landscape structures affect habitat connectivity for different species in many previous studies. However, the results of some previous studies were not consistent and even contradictory. This might limit the applications in practical habitat conservation. In the present study, four actual landscapes with a series of forest cover ratios in Fuzhou City, China, were selected. By using graph-based connectivity indices, the importance of habitat patches for landscape connectivity was explored. The effects of habitat proportion and three patch-level structural factors (i.e., patch size, shape, and position) on habitat patch importance indices were examined. Our results suggest that habitat proportion governed the overall landscape connectivity. The three structural factors explained approximately 80 % of the variation in the patch importance of connectivity indices. Patch size was the primary factor determining patch importance, while patch location was related to the partition of the three fractions of patch importance. Considering the different roles of the three structural factors played in landscapes with different habitat proportion, the spatial advice for local habitat conservation was proposed. Moreover, general conservation strategies regarding different habitat proportions were provided at the landscape scale and patch scale. Our findings would provide scientific evidence for local decision makers, and could be combined with other conservation planning tools.

AB  - In promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service capacity, landscape connectivity is considered a critical feature to counteract the negative effects of fragmentation. Under a Green Infrastructure (GI) perspective, this is especially true in rural and peri-urban areas where a high degree of connectivity may be associated with the enhancement of agriculture multifunctionality and sustainability. With respect to GI planning and connectivity assessment, the role of dispersal traits of tree species is gaining increasing attention. However, little evidence is available on how to select plant species to be primarily favored, as well as on the role of landscape heterogeneity and habitat quality in driving the dispersal success. The present work is aimed at suggesting a methodological approach for addressing these knowledge gaps, at fine scales and for peri-urban agricultural landscapes, by means of a case study in the Metropolitan City of Rome. The study area was stratified into Environmental Units, each supporting a unique type of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV), and a multi-step procedure was designed for setting priorities aimed at enhancing connectivity. First, GI components were defined based on the selection of the target species to be supported, on a fine scale land cover mapping and on the assessment of land cover type naturalness. Second, the study area was characterized by a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) and connectivity was assessed by Number of Components (NC) and functional connectivity metrics. Third, conservation and restoration measures have been prioritized and statistically validated. Notwithstanding the recognized limits, the approach proved to be functional in the considered context and at the adopted level of detail. Therefore, it could give useful methodological hints for the requalification of transitional urban-rural areas and for the achievement of related sustainable development goals in metropolitan regions.

AB  - 1. Cities are seen as quintessentially human; however, because they can offer viable habitat to many plants, animals and other forms of life, cities are also dynamic ecosystems.
   2. As urban areas expand to house more of the global human population and reduce natural habitat for wildlife, the need for wildlife-inclusive urban planning and design becomes increasingly pressing.
   3. The 2019 Urban Wildlife Information Network Summit responded to this need by connecting a group of 80 scientists, urban planners and designers to examine the role of cities in combating the global biodiversity crisis.
   4. The Summit focused on identifying and addressing barriers to transdisciplinary work between these communities, such as disciplinary silos, varying incentive structures, funding, differences in spatio-temporal scale, existing infrastructure and values and bias.
   5. We explore the challenges to network building for wildlife-inclusive design and planning revealed by the Summit and offer potential solutions for overcoming these obstacles for more effective collaboration around wildlife-inclusive cities.

AB  - Ongoing, rapid urban growth accompanied by habitat fragmentation and loss challenges biodiversity conservation and leads to decreases in ecosystem services. Application of the concept of ecological networks in the preservation and restoration of connections among isolated patches of natural areas is a powerful conservation strategy. However, previous approaches often failed to objectively consider the impacts of complex 3-D city environments on ecological niches. We used airborne lidar-derived information on the 3-D structure of the built environment and vegetation and detailed land use and cover data to characterize habitat quality, niche diversity, and human disturbance and to predict habitat connectivity among 38 identified habitat core areas (HCAs) in Nanjing, China. We used circuit theory and Linkage Mapper to create a landscape resistance layer, simulate habitat connectivity, and identify and prioritize important corridors. We mapped 64 links by using current flow centrality to evaluate each HCA's contribution and the links that facilitate intact connectivity. Values were highest for HCA links located in the west, south, and northeast of the study area, where natural forests with complex 3-D structures predominate. Two smaller HCA areas had high centrality scores relative to their extents, which means they could act as important stepping stones in connectivity planning. The mapped pinch-point regions had narrow and fragile links among the HCAs, suggesting they require special protection. The barriers with the highest impact scores were mainly located at the HCA connections to Purple Mountain and, based on these high scores, are more likely to indicate important locations that can be restored to improve potential connections. Our novel framework allowed us to sufficiently convey spatially explicit information to identify targets for habitat restoration and potential pathways for species movement and dispersal. Such information is critical for assessing existing or potential habitats and corridors and developing strategic plans to balance habitat conservation and other land uses based on scientifically informed connectivity planning and implementation.

AB  - Context Landscape connectivity is assumed to influence ecosystem service (ES) trade-offs and synergies. However, empirical studies of the effect of landscape connectivity on ES trade-offs and synergies are limited, especially in urban areas where the interactions between patterns and processes are complex. Objectives The objectives of this study were to use a Bayesian Belief Network approach to (1) assess whether functional connectivity drives ES trade-offs and synergies in urban areas and (2) assess the influence of connectivity on the supply of ESs. Methods We used circuit theory to model urban bird flow of P. major and C. caeruleus at a 2 m spatial resolution in Bedford, Luton and Milton Keynes, UK, and Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to assess the sensitivity of ES trade-offs and synergies model outputs to landscape and patch structural characteristics (patch area, connectivity and bird species abundance). Results We found that functional connectivity was the most influential variable in determining two of three ES trade-offs and synergies. Patch area and connectivity exerted a strong influence on ES trade-offs and synergies. Low patch area and low to moderately low connectivity were associated with high levels of ES trade-offs and synergies. Conclusions This study demonstrates that landscape connectivity is an influential determinant of ES trade-offs and synergies and supports the conviction that larger and better-connected habitat patches increase ES provision. A BBN approach is proposed as a feasible method of ES trade-off and synergy prediction in complex landscapes. Our findings can prove to be informative for urban ES management.

AB  - Cities are new and expanding ecosystems that harbor a variety of habitats with different degrees of permeability to the local fauna. However, the assessment of urban landscape permeability usually considers biotic and abiotic conditions, with sociopolitical dimensions (e.g., zoning regulations) - also important in shaping urban biodiversity - being underrepresented in the formulation of resistance surfaces. Our main goal was to compare urban landscape permeability for birds between two scenarios: one that considers only species' responses to land cover for the formulation of resistance surfaces (LandC), and another that incorporates how birds would respond to different levels of occupation (i.e., amount of permeable area and maximum building height per individual lot) given the urban zoning regulations defined by the city's master plan (LandC + UrbZ). We used the software LSCorridors to simulate Multiple Least Cost Corridors (MLCC) for five forest bird species. We hypothesized that incorporating master plan regulations would better describe the variation on landscape resistance through the urban landscape. The simulations resulted in different MLCC among species and between scenarios, highlighted by differences in landscape permeability. As expected, simulations for scenario LandC resulted in more options for straighter paths than simulations for scenario LandC + UrbZ. Our results demonstrate the potential influences of sociopolitical aspects on landscape permeability modelling. Within cities, species movements are influenced not only by behavioral and environmental characteristics, but also by the urban landscape that was shaped by planning and management decisions throughout a city's history. Therefore, we emphasize that sociopolitical dimensions must be considered when assessing urban landscape permeability.

AB  - Urban green space provides refuges for species that are unintentionally introduced by humans and which do not belong to the remnants of natural habitats in urban areas. However, the quantitative relationships between urban green space properties and these spontaneous species are unclear. To address this, we surveyed plant species occurring in urban green patches in Kunming city, which is located in a biodiversity hotspot in southwest China. We classified spontaneous plants into native, non-native and invasive plant species. A total of 386 spontaneous species belonging to 278 genera and 92 families were recorded in 190 patches. Most of the recorded species were herbaceous plants (76.2 %). While invasive species constituted a relatively small proportion of the total species pool (17.9 %), six out of ten of the most frequently occurring species were invasive. Regression models inspired by the theory of Island Biogeography show that total, native, non-native and invasive spontaneous species richness in urban green patches were best explained by the size of the ?island? (patch area), dispersal limitations (as expressed by ?distance to city boundary?) and edge effects (as shown by the landscape shape index). While the set of drivers of spontaneous plants is similar for the different groups of species, the relative importance of each driver varies among them. Our study provides quantification of drivers of biodiversity patterns in urban green space. Based on this understanding, planning and management of urban green space can be adapted to maximize spontaneous plant conservation in rapidly urbanizing biodiversity hotspot regions.

AB  - Context Although many studies have considered urban structure when investigating urban ecological networks, few have considered the three-dimensional (3D) structure of buildings as well as urban green spaces. Airborne LiDAR datasets provide an opportunity to quantify 3D structure and evaluate 3D metrics in connectivity mapping. Objectives We examined an urban ecological network using the 3D structure of both green spaces and buildings. Methods Using breeding-season bird species observations and airborne LiDAR data collected, we assessed the influence of 3D structural variables on species diversity. We used correlation analyses to determine if vertical distribution, volume, area, and height of both buildings and vegetation were related to bird species diversity. Then we conducted circuit theory-based current flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) analysis using the LiDAR-derived structural variables. Results We found that the volumes of buildings and 8-10 m vegetation heights were both highly correlated with species richness per unit area. There were significant differences between 2D and 3D connectivity analysis using LiDAR-derived variables among urban forest patches, boulevards, and apartment complexes. Within urban forest patches and parks, 3D CFBC represented canopy structural characteristics well, by showing high variance in spatial distributions. Conclusions The 3D CFBC results indicated that adjacent high-rise buildings, dense apartment complexes, and densely urbanized areas were isolated, as characterized by low centrality values, but that vegetation planted in open spaces between buildings could improve connectivity by linking isolated areas to core areas. Our research highlights the importance of considering 3D structure in planning and managing urban ecological connectivity.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation caused by urbanization often have negative impacts on wildlife in cities. There are considerable studies investigating the relationship between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. However, so far, very few studies have examined the influence of species traits combined with landscape factors on vulnerability to urbanization in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we investigated how species traits and park characteristics influenced bird sensitivity to urbanization in the highly urbanized city of Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks. For each bird species, we collected data on nine life-history and ecological traits that are commonly assumed to influence urbanization vulnerability. For each park, we selected six landscape variables that are commonly considered to influence bird response to urbanization. After phylogenetic correction, the nine species traits were used separately and in combination to evaluate their associations with species abundance, an indicator of urbanization vulnerability. We then used the RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to test relationships between species traits and environmental variables. We found that the 75 species analyzed demonstrated considerable variation in vulnerability to urbanization. Using PGLS analyses and model averaging, we found that habitat specificity was the single best ecological predictor of urbanization vulnerability in birds in Nanjing city parks. The RLQ analysis showed that body size and habitat specificity were correlated with distance to city center and connectivity of the parks, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit species with smaller body mass and lower habitat specificity in urbanized landscape. Therefore, conservation efforts giving priority to species with high habitat specificity and to parks with high connectivity and far away from the city center may prove effective for the preservation of bird diversity in our highly urbanized system. Meanwhile, preventing future habitat loss and destruction in existing city parks may also effectively conserve these vulnerable species.

AB  - Context Prioritising is likely to differ depending on the species considered for connectivity assessments, leading to a lack of consensual decisions for territorial planning. Objectives The objective was to assess the relevance of identifying priority areas for connectivity for groups of species based on common dispersal abilities. We aimed to assess the impact of target groups choices on predicted priority areas. Method The study was located at the Thau Lagoon territory to demonstrate the methodological approach. Ecological niche modelling was used to quantify species resistance and to identify suitable habitat patches. We coupled the least-cost path methodology with circuit theory to assess species connectivity. We classified connectivity from high to low levels and averaged the results by dispersal groups. Results We found important differences in identified priority areas between groups with dissimilar dispersal abilities, with little overlap between highly connected areas. We identified a gap between the level of protection of low dispersal species and highly connected areas. We found mismatches between existing corridors and connectivity in low dispersal species, and a greater impact in areas of expected urban sprawl projects on favourably connected areas for species with high dispersal capabilities. Conclusion We have demonstrated that a diversity of dispersal capacity ranges must be accounted for in order to identify ecological corridors in programmes that aim to restore habitat connectivity at territorial levels. Our findings are oriented to support the decisions of planning initiatives, at both local and regional scale.

AB  - Urban environments are heavily anthropogenic and often species depauperate. Many bird species, however, persist in cities, facilitated in part by the vegetated habitats cities provide. Urban vegetation management is likely to be key to bird conservation in cities, but supporting such conservation requires a more complete understanding of the relationships between urban birds and different aspects of urban vegetation than we currently possess. We sought to identify relationships between the species richness and abundance of songbird nesting guilds and attributes of urban vegetation to help build this understanding. We used guild richness and abundance and urban vegetation data compiled via point-count and urban-forest surveys in the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City corridor of Iowa, USA to construct binomial N-mixture models. We used our models to evaluate relationships between the abundance and richness of native songbird nesting guilds and different attributes of urban forests and understory vegetation. Relationships between nesting guilds and urban vegetation differed among guilds, although relationships with some attributes of urban vegetation (e.g., impervious and lawn cover) were more similar. Our models indicate that some characteristics of urban vegetation (e.g., tree height, evergreen trees, standing dead trees) are related to the richness or abundance of only one guild, while others (e.g., low vegetation) are important predictors for multiple guilds, but with different relationships. These findings suggest that some attributes such as lawn and impervious cover could be managed city-wide to support conservation, but few vegetation management approaches could be applied uniformly across cities to support species in all nesting guilds. These results thus indicate that urban conservation in the study area and beyond is likely to require vegetation management that is targeted to specific settings within cities and to the requirements of different groups of species that occur within those settings to support a diversity of bird species.

AB  - Urban water managers face numerous challenges, including limited natural resources for maintenance of technical infrastructure, changing demography, and dramatic environmental degradation. Although the vision of the "water-sensitive city" helps to develop tools and strategies toward more sustainable urban water systems, it does not consider biodiversity effects. We therefore aimed to determine habitat provision or habitat services provided by important rainwater management measures (e.g., ponds, swales, rain gardens, green roofs, green walls, permeable pavement), and to highlight how specific design and management practices for such measures enhance urban biodiversity. There is evidence of habitat services provided by rainwater management measures. Nevertheless, the categorization of such measures as civil engineering structures and their related rules limit efforts to optimize the biodiversity friendliness of design and management. The main factors to provide enhanced and more sustainable habitats are shaping design and maintenance according to target species and favoring connectivity by integrating rainwater management measures into the urban blue-green network. We find that strategic implementation of combinations of rainwater management measures into existing built-up areas allows greater multifunctionality of urban infrastructure. The "biodiversity-friendly and water-sensitive city" implies the efficient integration of ecological design measures in urban planning at building, neighborhood, and landscape scales.

AB  - Surface coal mining leads to a series of landscape ecological disturbances and ecological environmental prob-lems. Landscape ecological network plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance, protecting biodiversity, preventing pollution diffusion, and increasing landscape connectivity. However, previous studies on the landscape ecological network of mining cities have not thoroughly considered the impact of mining on landscape ecology. This study proposed a framework of landscape ecological network construction controlling surface coal mining effect on landscape ecology. The minimum cumulative resistance model was used to simulate the landscape ecological network by constructing a resistance surface based on the multi-regulation integration. The newly constructed landscape ecological network is helpful for improving the landscape function of the mining areas, preventing the impact process of mining, and the self-restoration of mining cities in semi-arid steppes. The research results can provide a reference for the ecological restoration, urban planning, and land-scape ecological management of mining cities in semi-arid steppes.

AB  - Urbanization is a worldwide problem affecting wildlife negatively. Cities cause habitat suppression, fragmentation, among other disease spreading, suitable conditions for exotic species, and direct animal kills-consequently, local native species might be extinct. Still, urban areas can also provide biodiversity maintenance because some species can be adapted to the urban environment. Here, we assess how the urban environment influences the displacement of native turquoise-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva). We created a map of environmental suitability to modeling A. aestiva displacement routes among three protected areas in Brasilia, Brazil. We tested (1) if the modeled corridors tend to be near to the areas where A. aestiva occurs and (2) how landscape spatial heterogeneity influences those modeled routes. We expected to observe oriented routes in homogeneous areas (few pixels with high-frequency selection), and the opposite in heterogeneous areas. To test our hypotheses, we recorded A. aestiva and correlated its presence/absence with the modeled corridors and correlated the landscape spatial heterogeneity with different metrics of the modeled corridors. Our results indicate that at least one of the modeled routes was near to the points with parrots. In general, potential dispersal routes with little spatial variation occurred in homogeneous areas. In the urban matrix, potential routes were less oriented with more spatial variation. Our results suggest the adoption of different strategies to manage the natural environment in an urban matrix. By managing the spatial heterogeneity, it is possible to direct how the species use the space, promoting the displacement to desired areas, avoiding the more urbanized ones.

AB  - Human land use is one of the primary threats to terrestrial species richness and is considered a priority for meeting global sustainability and biodiversity targets. Decision-support tools, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), are widely used for developing strategies to achieve such objectives. Currently available life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods apply the countryside species-area relationship (c-SAR) to quantify habitat conversion impacts on species richness. However, additional effects of habitat fragmentation are yet ignored in these assessments. We use the species-habitat relationship (SHR), an adaptation of the c-SAR that considers both habitat conversion and fragmentation effects, to develop a new set of land-use characterisation factors for 702 terrestrial ecoregions (in 238 countries), four land-use types (urban, cropland, pasture, and forestry), and four taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles; plus the aggregate of these vertebrate groups). The SHR generally predicts higher per-area impacts of land-use than the impacts estimated by the c-SAR (a median relative difference of +9%), indicating that land-use impacts may be systematically underestimated when ignoring fragmentation effects. Whereas per-area impacts of land-use on regional species richness are highest in temperate regions, reflecting the diminished extent of natural habitat, per-area impacts of land-use on global species richness are highest in the subtropics, reflecting the importance of tropical regions and islands to global vertebrate species diversity. The large variety in magnitude of land-use impacts across the world's regions emphasizes the importance of regionalised assessments. The set of characterisation factors proposed here can be readily used in environmental decision-making. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is hypothesized that biodiversity is maintained by interactions at local and regional spatial scales. Many sustainability plans and management practices reflect the need to conserve biodiversity, yet once these plans are implemented, the ecological consequences are not well understood. By learning how management practices affect local environmental factors and dispersal in a region, ecologists and natural resource managers can better understand the implications of management choices. We investigated the interaction of local and regional scale processes in the built environment, where human-impacts are known to influence both. Our goal was to determine how the interaction between spatial variation in habitat heterogeneity in algal management of urban ponds and dispersal shape biodiversity at local and regional spatial scales. A twelve-week mesocosm study was conducted where pond management and dispersal were manipulated to determine how spatial variation in habitat and dispersal from various source pools influence zooplankton metacommunities in urban stormwater ponds. We hypothesized that dispersal from managed or unmanaged source pools will lead to community divergence and local management practices will act as an environmental filter, both reducing beta diversity between managed ponds and driving compositional divergence. Our results suggest that zooplankton dispersal from managed or unmanaged source pools was important to explaining divergence in community composition. Furthermore, local management of algae marginally reduced compositional turnover of zooplankton among ponds but did not lead to significant divergence in community composition. Management practices may act as strong environmental filters by reducing beta diversity between ponds. As hypothesized, source pool constraints led to compositional divergence and local management practices resulted in reduced compositional turnover between ponds. The results of this study suggest that sustainability and management plans may have complex effects on biodiversity both within and across spatial scales. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The natural capital components in cities ("blue-green infrastructure" BGI) are designed to address long-term sustainability and create multi-benefits for society, culture, business, and ecology. We investigated the added value of BGI through the research question "Can the implementation of blue-green infrastructure lead to an improvement of habitat connectivity and biodiversity in urban environments?" To answer this, the Biological and Environmental Evaluation Tools for Landscape Ecology (BEETLE) within the Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator (LUCI) framework was adopted and applied in Christchurch, New Zealand, for the first time. Three ecologically representative species were selected. The parameterisation was based on ecological theory and expert judgment. By implementation of BGI, the percentages of habitats of interest for kereru and paradise shelduck increased by 3.3% and 2.5%, respectively. This leads to improved habitat connectivity. We suggest several opportunities for regenerating more native patches around the catchment to achieve the recommended minimum 10% target of indigenous cover. However, BGI alone cannot return a full suite of threatened wildlife to the city without predator-fenced breeding sanctuaries and wider pest control across the matrix. The socio-eco-spatial connectivity analysed in this study was formalised in terms of four interacting dimensions.

AB  - The construction of the urban ecological network has a comprehensive effect on urban aesthetics, society and economy, and provides the driving force for urban sustainable development. However, we found few studies on constructing and optimizing urban ecological networks in cities with the highest human density. In this paper, landscape patter n indexes were applied to analyze the landscape characteristics and morphological patter n analysis (MSPA) to identi f y the ecological source, the landscape connectivity and the region attributes revised the ecological resistance surface, and urban ecological network was constructed by MCR model. The results show that: (1) many ecological land types mainly distributed in the tributaries of the Yangtze River, while only forest land and water areas occupied in the northwest are. (2) Compared with 1995 and 2005, the number of ecological corridors in 2015 was decreasing. Although the ecological connectivity was improved, which of the Yangtze River was limited. (3) The coordinated development and the ecological protection ecological network optimi-zation plan would promote the connectivity of the urban ecological functioning stability. This study provides recommendations for the optimization of the urban ecological network, which ar e of great significance for protecting biodiversity, improving ecosystem functions, and maintaining the regional ecological security pattern.

AB  - The investigation of plant assemblages growing in urban ecosystems offers the chance to observe new interactions among biodiversity, urban planning and public health, in the context of a changing world with increasing city surfaces and populations. In this context, the aim of this work is the study of floristic, ecological and functional diversity of land use types of Milan, such as a) Built-up areas (urbanized and productive zones), b) Roads (borders and flowerbed of main boulevards and avenues), c) Railways (tracks borders, stations and adjacencies) and d) Green areas (parks, gardens, and orchards). A floristic survey was performed through stratified sampling and a floristic database was built. The following bioecological information was added to each sampling location: species richness, %alien species, %families, %life forms, functional diversity, %Grime's CSR strategies, Ellenberg's indicator values (EIVs), urbanity index and functional diversity estimators. Differences among land use types were detected with linear mixed models. In total, about 300 taxa were recorded, and 34 % of the species surveyed were aliens. The Railways were prominent with regard to several traits such as floristic richness, number of insect-pollinated species, mean EIV for light and soil reaction and functional diversity estimators. On the other hand, the urbanity index was the lowest in Railways. In general, Urban areas and Roads had lower trait values, while Green areas had intermediate performances. Our results showed that despite the expected high presence of ruderal and alien species, typical of disturbed environments, the urban landscapes of Milan are diversified in their ecological functions and included areas rich in uncommon species limited to peculiar habitats. The railway landscape of Milan represents a reservoir and refuge for many native species, incorporating microhabitats not present in other city landscapes. Therefore, railway areas should be included in the planning of green networks to improve connectivity and support the nature in urban landscapes.

AB  - Understanding the timescales that shape spatial genetic structure is pivotal to ascertain the impact of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity and reproductive viability of long-lived plant populations. Combining genetic and ecological information with current and past fragmentation conditions allows the identification of the main drivers important in shaping population structure and declines in reproduction, which is crucial for informing conservation strategies. Using historic aerial photographs, we defined the past fragmentation conditions for the shrub Conospermum undulatum, a species now completely embedded in an urban area. We explored the impact of current and past conditions on its genetic layout and assessed the effects of genetic and environmental factors on its reproduction. The historically high structural connectivity was evident in the genetics of the species. Despite the current intense fragmentation, we found similar levels of genetic diversity across populations and a weak spatial genetic structure. Historical connectivity was negatively associated with genetic differentiation among populations and positively related to within-population genetic diversity. Variation partitioning of reproductive performance explained similar to 66% of the variance, showing significant influences for genetic (9%), environmental (15%), and combined (42%) fractions. Our study highlights the importance of considering the historical habitat dynamics when investigating fragmentation consequences in long-lived plants. A detailed characterization of fragmentation from 1953 has shown how low levels of genetic fixation are due to extensive gene flow through the non-fragmented landscape. Moreover, knowledge of the relationships between genetic and environmental variation and reproduction can help to implement effective conservation strategies, particularly in highly dynamic landscapes.

AB  - Context Ecological networks are systems of interconnected components that support biodiversity, ecological processes and ecosystem services. Such structures play a crucial role for nature conservation and people well-being in anthropogenic landscapes. Assessing connectivity by using efficient models and metrics is a sine qua non condition to preserve and improve appropriately these ecological networks.
   Objectives This study aims to present a novel methodological approach to assess and model connectivity for species conservation (Bufo calamita; the natterjack toad) and human recreation in the city.
   Methods The study used a combination least cost and circuit models to identify priority corridors in the City of Liege, Belgium. Green areas, habitats and relevant movement parameters were derived based on existing studies around (i) the occurrence, ecology and biology of the natterjack toad and (ii) human behavioural studies on urban pedestrians. Combining the two models allowed the assessment of connectivity for both species via two different metrics visualised using priority corridors on maps.
   Results The connectivity assessments identified lack of connectivity as the potential route to extinction of natterjack toads at one of the source sites.
   Conclusions This study provides examples of how combining least cost and circuit models can contribute to the improvement of urban ecological networks and demonstrates the usefulness of such models for nature conservation and urban planning.

AB  - Human activities have tremendous impact on the environment but the extent of this influence on animals is frequently unknown. Here we focus on a ubiquitous man-made landscape element, power line corridors in forested areas where vegetation is regularly mowed, and its effects on avian species richness and abundance. We surveyed bird communities at 35 sites in southern Czech Republic and found power line corridors hosted on average three more bird species and eight more individuals than transects in the surrounding forests. The lesser whitethroat (Sylvia curruca) and the tree sparrow (Passer montanus) were the most frequently detected species under power lines, suggesting the importance of these habitats for openhabitat specialists. Overall, we found positive effects of this human-altered landscape element on avian communities but future studies could focus on communities of other animals in this habitat with an emphasis on the presence of endangered species.

AB  - Large-scale infrastructure development that accompanies global urban transformation threatens biodiversity and ecosystems around the world. Transportation infrastructure, in particular, uniquely affects landscape structure and connectivity. However, spatially explicit, quantitative analyses of change in habitat configuration due to multiple, linked transportation infrastructure are rare. Here, we analyze how a new airport and new highway system altered the spatial pattern of forest habitats to the north of the Istanbul metropolitan region in the context of two-decade-long landscape change. We carry out a land-change analysis from 2000 to 2019. We then analyze the changes in the spatial patterns of various forest habitat types across the metropolitan region, within and in the vicinity of the airport site, and in a key biodiversity area (KBA) that the new highway passes through. New transportation infrastructure significantly altered the forest habitats. Ten percent of all forest cover was lost, a quarter of which due to the new transportation development. Overall and within the KBA, respectively, core forest habitat decreased by 20% and 16%; the share of isolated, highly fragmented, and edge habitats within the remaining forest increased by 7% and 8%. On the European side of the metro area, the last remnants of the connectivity between the western and eastern sections of the forests were lost. The degradation of the forest landscape has implications for the endemic biodiversity and ecosystem services relied on by the metropolitan area. Our findings inform landscape strategies to arrest these degradation trends. Such strategies can succeed if ecological conservation is integrated into planning and current highly centralized governance structure is reformed.

AB  - The Tiber River stretch crossing the metropolitan area of Rome (Italy) is regarded as one of the main biological corridors of the city, as it diversifies the urban landscape while contributing to the plant diversity. This paper aims to document the current plant richness occurring along the Tiber within the city by providing a comprehensive inventory of the spontaneous vascular flora and an overview of its composition, and structural, chorological and ecological features. This flora lists 493 species and it is characterized by: i) high species richness (more than 30% of Rome's flora), ii) presence of species with naturalistic value, as rare or included in Red List IUCN categories, iii) high number of ruderal and multizonal species (including several aliens) that have well adapted to human disturbance, and have partially replaced the typical riverine plants, iv) wide spread of eutrophic aquatic species, and rarefaction of those species that are more sensitive to eutrophication and water pollution. The dataset and the overview reported in this study can be useful for future research, with a special focus on a better naturalistic management of the urban river ecosystem, and the conservation of the floristic heritage within the city of Rome.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate warming is expected to shift the geographical distribution of forest trees worldwide. Urbanization-induced landscape fragmentation represents a considerable impediment to species' range shifts. Large-scale afforestation is often suggested to be an effective measure to mitigate the negative impacts of landscape fragmentation. However, the effectiveness of afforestation on climate-driven forest migration has rarely been evaluated in urban environments. Here, we tested the effectiveness of two common afforestation strategies in promoting the migration of bird-dispersed tree species in Greater Manchester, UK: (A) planting trees in private gardens and roadsides and (B) establishing large woodlands in public lands. A modelling approach combining graph and circuit theory was used to assess the improvement in landscape connectivity after urban afforestation and to analyze how the two strategies promote the process of forest migration under climate change. Our results suggested that planting trees in gardens and streets could improve the spatial patterns of forest migration by forming stepping stones for the movement of birds across the urban matrix; establishing large woodlands in public areas could enhance the probability of forest migration between urban woodlands by providing population hubs. We found that the effectiveness of urban afforestation was strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of trees and the physical characteristics of local bird species. The study offers new insight into the biodiversity benefits of urban landscapes, encourages tree-planting programs in urban environments, and calls for close cooperation between urban foresters, designers, and managers to cope with the changing climate.

AB  - Landscape simplification and degradation through agricultural intensification is widely recognized as a main driver of biodiversity loss. In intensively used agricultural landscapes, patches of semi-natural habitats and particularly connections between them are of high importance for many taxa. Vegetated connections like hedgerows are especially important for foraging and commuting of mobile taxa such as bats. However, the interest of another treeless linear habitat - herbaceous field margins - remains unstudied for insectivorous bats. Field margins are nevertheless known as an important habitat for other taxa, including bat prey. Here we assessed the importance of field margins for bats compared to other landscape variables. We measured bat activity based on a repeated passive acoustic monitoring during 17 complete nights in summer on 112 study sites in an intensively used agricultural landscape. Each night, we sampled bat species activity and community metrics (i. e. species richness and community habitat specialization index) at different distances to field margins, and along a gradient of relative density of field margins. To compare field margin effects with other landscape variables, the sampled sites were selected by keeping a large variability in these other variables (land-cover Shannon diversity index, forests, hedgerows, water bodies, main roads, urban areas, grasslands, number of crops and rapeseed percentage). Only Myotis sp. were affected by herbaceous field margins. Specifically, the Myotis group activity decreased with the distance to herbaceous field margins (i.e. towards field crop cores), and positively correlated with relative density of herbaceous field margins, for which the effect size was comparable to other landscape variables. However, other landscape variables such as the proportion of and the distance to forests, the relative density of and the distance to hedgerows or land-cover Shannon diversity index, affected species richness, community specialization index, and bat activity of species from open, edge and narrow-space foragers, including the Myotis group as well. Our results highlight that herbaceous field margins have a positive effect on the activity of narrow-space bat foragers as Myotis species, but do not replace other landscape variables that drive the activity of the whole community.

AB  - In response to the widely recognized negative impacts of urbanization on biodiversity, many cities are reimagining urban design to provide better biodiversity support. Some cities have developed urban biodiversity plans, primarily focused on improving biodiversity support and ecosystem function within the built environment through habitat restoration and other types of urban greening projects. The biophilic cities movement seeks to reframe nature as essential infrastructure for cities, seamlessly integrating city and nature to provide abundant, accessible nature for all residents and corresponding health and well-being outcomes. Urban biodiversity planning and biophilic cities have significant synergies in their goals and the means necessary to achieve them. In this paper, we identify three key ways by which the urban biodiversity planning process can support biophilic cities objectives: engaging the local community; identifying science-based, quantitative goals; and setting priorities for action. Urban biodiversity planning provides evidence-based guidance, tools, and techniques needed to design locally appropriate, pragmatic habitat enhancements that support biodiversity, ecological health, and human health and well-being. Developing these multi-functional, multi-benefit strategies that increase the abundance of biodiverse nature in cities has the potential at the same time to deepen and enrich our biophilic experience in daily life.

AB  - Introduction: Migration of people from rural environments to cities has accelerated urbanization and modified the landscape as well as the ecological processes and communities in these areas. The Costa Rican endemic Cabanis's Ground-Sparrow (Melozone cabanisi) is a species of limited distribution restricted to the "Gran Area Metropolitana", which is the biggest urban settlement of the country. This area has experimented and still experiment an ongoing fragmentation and loss of habitat used by this species (coffee plantations, shrubs, and thickets). Objective: To determine the effects of urbanization on habitat abundance and spatial pattern for the occurrence of Melozone cabanisi. Methods: We modeled the area of potentially suitable habitat for this species in Costa Rica using occurrence and bioclimatic data. Then, we estimated the actual suitable habitat using land cover type layers. Finally, we analyzed the connectivity among the actual suitable habitat patches using single-patch and multi-patch approaches. Results: From the area of potentially suitable habitat estimated by the bioclimatic model, 74 % were urban areas that are unsuitable for Melozone cabanisi. The largest suitable patches within urban areas were coffee plantations; which also were crucial for maintaining connectivity between habitat patches along the species' range. Conclusions: To preserve and protect the Melozone cabanisi, these areas must be taken into consideration by decision-makers in the present and future management plans. We recommend avoiding change shrubs and thickets to urban cover to preserve the occurrence of Melozone cabanisi, and implement a program for the payment of environmental services to landholders, supported by the local governments, to protect those habitats in urban contexts.

AB  - Recent reports of drastic declines in insect populations have raised global concerns about their conservation. Light pollution is a near inseparable feature of human-altered landscapes and is a potential contributing factor to insect declines. However, despite the wide recognition of the deleterious effects of lights on insects, whether these effects scale up to impact insect populations remains unclear. Here, we relied on a combination of ecological niche modeling, geographical information systems, and interviews on local ecological knowledge to assess the synergistic effects of landscape light pollution and habitat loss and fragmentation on populations of the Choc ' o golden scarab Chrysina argenteola. Sightings of C. argenteola by locals revealed individuals are scarcer in areas with reduced forest cover and rely on inter-patch dispersal to cope with habitat fragmentation, where they were constantly attracted to urban lights. Increasingly lit landscapes had more individuals attracted to lights, but the opposite was true in areas with less than 4 km2 of remaining forest cover. We suggest this pattern arises as landscape light pollution intercepts individuals during inter-patch dispersal. This hinders habitat connectivity, potentially disrupting metapopulation dynamics, being populations inhabiting areas with scarce fragmented habitat more vulnerable to this process. We show light pollution acts in combination with habitat loss and fragmentation in detriment of insect populations at the landscape scale.

AB  - Context Romania is currently one of the best-connected landscapes, with high-quality habitats and a high density of brown bears. However, regional development measures are needed for the nation's economic growth, and without responsible government actions, these measures pose a threat to brown bear connectivity, a vital pillar of the entire Carpathian region. Despite having important implications for the species conservation, bears sex-specific behaviour has been overlooked in connectivity assessments. Objectives The study's main goals were to (i) develop sex-specific distribution and connectivity models, (ii) assess the movement patterns differences between females and males, and (iii) identify high-quality areas to be secured for species connectivity conservation. Methods We designed a methodological framework based on interdisciplinary approaches and modelling tools for landscape connectivity combined with novel spatial analysis. Telemetry data of sixteen bears (females and males) were utilized to predict habitat selection (MaxEnt), and circuit-theoretic approaches (Circuitscape) were applied to identify the potential movement corridors of both sexes and high-priority areas. Results The obtained results provided new evidence on the uneven movement patterns and pathways used by males and females in the study region. Males' movement preferences were related to river shores and dense forest coverage areas, avoiding urban areas, while females were predicted to move across forested and open areas and were more tolerant to human-modified areas. Three high-quality areas were delineated for both sexes, and connectivity conservation efforts are needed due to the vicinity of anthropic pressures. Conclusions This study depicts the usefulness of combining interdisciplinary approaches and provides planners, managers, and decision-makers with practical solutions to address sustainable design and management within the intervened landscapes. Using separate female and male spatial models for leading management and conservation measures, setting connectivity targets within environmental and impact assessments while adopting conservation easements could secure a safety network for biodiversity conservation in the Carpathians.

AB  - Urbanisation threatens species through habitat loss, isolation and fragmentation. Greenspace in urban landscapes often provides connectivity and habitat for wetland-dependent species. Accessible greenspace measures the combined effects of movement barriers (e.g., roads) and the total amount of greenspace on populations. I determined whether accessible greenspace was a better predictor of amphibian occupancy at ponds than the total amount of greenspace, and at what spatial scale. I also assessed the relative importance of habitat variables at the local pond-scale. Frog surveys were conducted at 65 ponds distributed along an urban-rural gradient over two breeding seasons in the greater Melbourne region, Australia. Accessible greenspace was mapped around ponds at varying spatial scales (250 m - 2000 m) using potential barriers to amphibian movement. The best-ranked multi-species occupancy model included the proportion of total greenspace within a 1000-m radius of a pond and four local-scale covariates (presence of mosquitofish, pond permanence, vertical pond walls and water conductivity). There was no support for models containing accessible greenspace. There was a positive relationship between the probability of community and species-level occupancy and total greenspace within 1000 m of a pond. There was a negative relationship between mean community occupancy and the presence of a vertical pond wall at a site. There was no apparent effect of barriers on occupancy, indicating that urban areas may be more permeable for movement by some species than predicted. Individual species responses demonstrated that management actions are required at fine and broad spatial scales to benefit amphibian communities in urban landscapes.

AB  - Anthropogenic land transformation, especially agriculture and urban development, are the leading causes of natural land cover loss and ultimate decline in environmental functionality and connectivity in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. However, recent developments in the form of housing estates with conservation and environmental management intentions (termed eco-estates) have increased. These eco-estates generally improve species and functional diversity in urban regions of coastal KwaZulu-Natal and improve connectivity for biodiversity between urban green spaces and existing natural landscapes. To provide the first comprehensive development and management guidelines for eco-estates, we reviewed and assessed research into the effects of eco-estate development on environmental functionality and connectivity using case studies from coastal KwaZulu-Natal. We suggest suitable regions for eco-estate establishment and provide detailed guidelines for ecoestate development, environmental rehabilitation and conservation, and eco-estate flora and fauna management. These guidelines will hopefully facilitate biodiversity conservation and improve current and future eco-estate management and, ultimately, the ecosystem health of coastal KwaZulu-Natal. They are applicable for ecoestate development and management in similar tropical and sub-tropical mixed land-use matrices.

AB  - Forest edges have significant effects on plant species and trait compositions. However, most current studies on edge effects are based on natural forests, and studies on edge effects in urban forests are still limited. Here, we set up 50 survey plots in Wuchao Mountain National Forest Park, an urban forest of Hangzhou, China. We tested how species composition changed with distance from the forest edge. Specifically, we investigated dispersalrelated traits for 86 species, and analyzed trait composition changes with distance from the forest edge. The NMDS analysis revealed a significant difference in species composition between forest edge and interior, but species richness and functional diversity remain unchanged. However, single traits showed higher divergence than expected. The percentage of fleshy-fruited species declined with distance from the edge, but plant abundance of mammal-dispersed and animal-dispersal seed mass was increased. The different trend in seed size of different dispersal mode and seed mass from edge to the interior within the community may be related to the loss of mammal-dispersed plant species at the forest edge. This suggests that edge effects have a high influence on functional traits in urban forests, but not on species diversity. Edges had significant effects on animal-dispersed species and trait composition of plant communities. Our study highlights the importance of maintaining forest integrity by protecting interior habitats in urban regions. We also recommend reducing the creation of new edges and increasing the buffer area for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Developing green infrastructure (GI) has drawn increasing attention as a strategic planning approach for advancing urban sustainability. The connectivity of green spaces, a central principle of GI, has been considered in planning studies regarding its structure and functions for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services delivery; however, aspects of GI connectivity across temporal and spatial scales are rarely addressed. This paper aims to develop and apply a method for the GI connectivity analysis at multiple spatiotemporal scales. A transferable and multi-scale workable approach is presented to reveal the changes of structural and spatial heterogeneity of urban GI. Our method includes i) morphological spatial patterns analysis for central and green corridors recognition, ii) a graph-based quantification of GI connectivity based on the Conefor model, and iii) least-cost path analysis for identifying potential green corridors. We apply the GI connectivity analysis method in the Ruhr Metropolitan Area (RMA), one of Europe's largest agglomerations. We use spatial Urban Atlas data from 2006 to 2018. At the metropolitan scale, we find that GI connectivity in the RMA decreases 3.9% from 2006 to 2018, even though the general distributions of GI changes only slightly. With reference to the municipal scale from 2006 to 2018, four major types of GI connectivity changes were discovered in RMA's 15 cities, namely consistent decreasing, consistent increasing, increase followed by decrease, and vice-versa. Our findings provide new evidence on GI connectivity changes across a twelve-year difference and at metropolitan and municipal scales, as well as the identification of priority areas for increasing GI connectivity. It provides insights on the evolving and heterogenous nature of GI connectivity in support of decision-making for more sustainable met

AB  - Formulation of the problem. Urban landscapes are distinguished from the surrounding territories by the radical transformation of all components under the influence of anthropogenic factor. Flora and fauna which are one of the most important factors in maintaining the ecological balance of urban landscapes are undergoing the largest changes in cities. Therefore, an urgent problem is the conservation of biota in cities. The solution of this problem involves protection of existing and restoration of degraded habitats of flora and fauna in cities; creation of the necessary migration conditions for the exchange of genetic information.
   Purpose. The purpose of the article is to identify the peculiarities of flora and fauna, landscape complexes of biocentres of Vinnytsia ecological network.
   Methods. In order to achieve this purpose, a study of flora and fauna and landscape complexes of the urban territory was conducted; the habitats of rare species of flora and fauna, the areas of occurrence of the associations of the Green Book of Ukraine were revealed; features of quasi-natural areas valuable for the conservation of biodiversity were analyzed. The studies were conducted using the following methods: field research (key, area and route), analytical-cartographic analysis, collecting and processing of statistical information, literary-cartographic, theoretical generalization and systematization of facts, analysis, abstraction, analogy, synthesis.
   Results. 25 biocentres are singled out in the structure of Vinnytsia local ecological network. They represent all the landscapes of the city: typical forest-steppe and mixed forests; river-beds, floodplains, above-floodplain terraces, slopes and watersheds; forest-steppe woodlands, passage valleys and upland oakery; conditionally natural and anthropogenic.
   The characteristic features of urban ecological network biocentres are determined by their location within certain types of landscape terrain. Therefore, the floodplain, above-floodplain-terrace, slope, watershed and complex groups of biocentres of Vinnytsia are distinguished. Complex biocentres dominate in areas (70.7%). They cover several types of landscape terrains. But slope and watershed types prevail among them. Large areas (22.8%) are covered by biocentres of the above-floodplain-terrace group. Slope (1.9%) and watershed (1.3%) biocentres are the least common. Biocentres are represented by quasi-natural areas where rare species of living organisms and plant associations are frequently seen.
   Scientific novelty. For the first time since 2015, after increasing the area of Vinnytsia, local biocentres of the city's ecological network have been singled out. The peculiarities of landscape complexes, flora and fauna of biocentres have been revealed, in particular the list of rare species of flora and fauna has been defined.
   Practical importance. Distinguished biocentres of Vinnytsia local ecological network will help preserve the biotic and landscape diversity of the city, maintain ecological balance of the city territory.

AB  - The Neotropical region has been subjected to massive urbanization, which poses high risks for some global biodiversity hotspots and losses of ecosystem functions and services. In this study, we investigate how distance from large patches of native forests (source areas) and vegetation (green)/and infrastructure (gray) characteristics affect bird species richness and functional diversity in Sao Paulo megacity, southeastern Brazil. We analyzed the effects of source areas and green/gray characteristics on species richness and functional diversity (richness, evenness, and divergence) indices. We detected 231 bird species, and our data confirmed our predictions: (1) bird species richness in urbanized habitats was found to be (similar to 50-85%) lower than in source habitats; (2) species richness and trait composition significantly decreased as the distance from the source area increased, while functional richness was not affected by this metric; and (3) shrub and herbaceous covers and maximum height of trees were positively correlated with species richness and unique functional traits regarding habitat, diet, foraging and nesting strata and dispersal ability of birds in the forest-urban matrix. The number of buildings was negatively correlated with bird species richness and functional richness. Maximum height of buildings caused dramatic declines in functional evenness. Functional divergence was notably lower in sites with high shrub cover. Our study stresses the complexity of vegetation embedded in large Neotropical urban settlements and the need to maintain large protected areas surrounding megacities to mitigate the impacts of urbanization on birds.

AB  - Context Connections among ecosystems and their components are critical to maintaining ecological functions and benefits in human-modified landscapes, including urban areas. However, the literature on connectivity and ecosystem services has been limited by inconsistent terminology and methods, and largely omits human access to nature and its benefits as a form of connectivity. Objectives In this paper, we build upon previous research and theory to define distinct categories of connectivity, considering both ecological and social dimensions, and identify ecosystem services that are supported by them. Methods We reviewed the literature to determine socio-ecological benefits that depend on the categories of connectivity. Results We identified four distinct but interrelated categories of connectivity: landscape, habitat, geophysical, and eco-social connectivity. Each connectivity category directly or indirectly supports many ecosystem services. There are overlaps, conflicts, and synergies among connectivity categories and their associated services and disservices. Conclusions Identifying the services that arise from these four categories of connectivity, and how they interact, can help build a common understanding of the value of connectivity to maximize its benefits, improve understanding of complex socio-ecological systems across disciplines, and develop more holistic, socially equitable decision-making processes, especially in urban landscapes.

AB  - Whether cities are more or less diverse than surrounding environments, and the extent to which non-native species in cities impact regional species pools, remain two fundamental yet unanswered questions in urban ecology. Here we offer a unifying framework for understanding the mechanisms that generate biodiversity patterns across taxonomic groups and spatial scales in urban systems. One commonality between existing frameworks is the collective recognition that species co-occurrence locally is not simply a function of natural colonization and extinction processes. Instead, it is largely a consequence of human actions that are governed by a myriad of social processes occurring across groups, institutions, and stakeholders. Rather than challenging these frameworks, we expand upon them to explicitly consider how human and non-human mechanisms interact to control urban biodiversity and influence species composition over space and time. We present a comprehensive theory of the processes that drive biodiversity within cities, between cities and surrounding non-urbanized areas and across cities, using the general perspective of metacommunity ecology. Armed with this approach, we embrace the fact that humans substantially influence beta-diversity by creating a variety of different habitats in urban areas, and by influencing dispersal processes and rates, and suggest ways how these influences can be accommodated to existing metacommunity paradigms. Since patterns in urban biodiversity have been extensively described at the local or regional scale, we argue that the basic premises of the theory can be validated by studying the beta-diversity across spatial scales within and across urban areas. By explicitly integrating the myriad of processes that drive native and non-native urban species co-occurrence, the proposed theory not only helps reconcile contrasting views on whether urban ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots or biodiversity sinks, but also provides a mechanistic understanding to better predict when and why alternative biodiversity patterns might emerge.

AB  - Increased nitrogen (N) deposition threatens global biodiversity, but its effects in arid urban ecosystems are not well studied. In addition to altered N availability, urban environments also experience increases in other pollutants, decreased population connectivity, and altered biotic interactions, which can further impact biodiversity. In deserts, annual plant communities make up most of the plant diversity, support wildlife, and contribute to nutrient cycling and ecosystem processes. Functional trade-offs allowing coexistence of a diversity of annual plant species are well established, but maintenance of diversity in urban conditions and with increased availability of limiting nutrients has not been explored. We conducted a 13-yr N and phosphorus (P) addition experiment in Sonoran Desert preserves in and around Phoenix, Arizona, USA to test how nutrient availability interacts with growing season precipitation, urban location, and microhabitat to affect winter annual plant diversity. Using structural equation modeling and generalized linear mixed modeling, we found that annual plant taxonomic diversity was significantly reduced in N-enriched and urban plots. Water availability in both current and previous growing seasons impacted annual plant diversity, with significant interaction effects showing increased diversity in wetter years and greater responsiveness of the community to water following a wet year. However, there were no significant interactions between N enrichment and water availability, urban location, or microhabitat. Lowered diversity in urban preserves may be partly attributable to increased urban N deposition. Changes in biodiversity of showy species like annual wildflowers in urban preserves can have important implications for connections between urban residents and nature, and reduced diversity and community restructuring with N enrichment represents a challenge for future preservation of aridland biodiversity.

AB  - Optimizing the layout of green infrastructure (GI) is an effective way to alleviate the fragmentation of urban landscapes, coordinate the relationship between urban development and urban ecosystem services, and ensure the sustainable development of cities. This study provides a new technical framework for optimizing GI networks based on a case study of Kaifeng, an exemplar of many ancient cities along the Yellow River in China. To do this, we used a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) methodology and combined it with Procedure for mAthematical aNalysis of lanDscape evOlution and equilibRium scenarios Assessment (PANDORA) model to determine the hubs of the GI network. Then we employed a least-cost path approach to simulate potential corridors linking the hubs. We further identify the key 'pinch points' of the GI network that need priority protection based on circuit theory. Altogether, this framework takes patches that have a high level of ecosystem services and are more important in maintaining overall connectivity as hubs, thereby improving the accuracy of hub identification. Moreover, it establishes a direct connection between GI construction and ecosystem services, and improves biodiversity conservation by optimizing the network structure of GI. The results of the case study show that this framework is suitable for GI planning and construction, and can provide effective technical support for the formulation of urban sustainable development strategies.

AB  - Dog walking is a highly popular leisure activity in cities around the globe. It is also a controversial issue for urban conservation and green space management due to presumed ecological impacts of dogs. Yet regulations allowing or prohibiting the presence of dogs in areas of conservation concern are rarely based on demonstrated effects of dogs on urban nature. To unravel the relationships between the presence of dogs at a site and soil features and plant and animal diversity, we selected dry grassland as our study system since this type of ecosystem is of conservation concern in many cities and is frequently used for dog walking. We combined data on the number and movement patterns of dogs and their owners in 52 dry grassland patches in Berlin, Germany, to create a novel index of dog presence and activity. We then analysed the relationship between the index and soil features, species richness of plants and seven invertebrate taxa, and abundances of sand lizards, a species of particular conservation interest. Generalised linear models revealed significant relationships between the dog index and one soil parameter and some biodiversity measures. The dog index was positively related to phosphorus and nonnative plant richness but negatively to spider diversity. While dogs may facilitate biological invasions, likely through a combination of eutrophication and disturbance, overall relationships with general species richness or richness of endangered plant or animal species were weak. These results indicate opportunities for reconciling urban nature conservation with moderate dog walking in urban grassland areas. Still, urban policies should consider remaining dog-related risks in other ecosystem types - a promising direction for further urban research.

AB  - Obtaining the characteristics of an urban ecological network structure and connectivity plays an important guiding role in the concrete implementation of ecological construction in a space. Resistance assignment is a key step in ecological network construction. However, most research ignores the diversity of land use in an urbanization environment and the difference between ecological space centres and boundaries. Taking Minhang District of Shanghai as an example, this paper puts forward an optimal evaluation method for an urban ecological network. By combining the morphological spatial pattern analysis method and graph theory, the resistance value of different urban land uses was evaluated, and the ecological network was constructed by comprehensively considering the land use types, land area, forms, and positions. The connectivity and the importance of individual nodes at four different thresholds were quantified. The results revealed that the core and the edge areas of the morphological spatial pattern analysis occupied the highest amount of space, 33.34 % and 21.92 %, respectively. In addition, there were relatively few large and high-quality ecological spaces, and the green space was seriously fragmented in the study area. The degree of structural connectivity was related not only to the area proportion of the ecological space but also to the area of connected patches. The contribution value of each node to the overall network connectivity was affected by the mobility of the species, the node area, the spatial location, and the surrounding matrix environment. This study provided a framework designed to optimize the evaluation method of an urban ecological network. The influence of the type and structure of urban land use on the resistance value was analysed in a more detailed way, and the results of the connectivity and the important nodes were obtained more accurately.

AB  - Aim An understanding of how biotic communities are spatially organized is necessary to identify and prioritize habitats within landscape-scale biodiversity conservation. Local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) identifies individual habitats that make a significant contribution to beta diversity and may have important practical implications, particularly for conservation of habitat networks. In this study, we develop and apply a conservation prioritization approach based on LCBD in aquatic invertebrate communities from 132 ponds.
   Location Five urban settlements in the UK: Halton, Loughborough, Stockport, Birmingham and Huddersfield.
   Methods We partition LCBD into richness difference (nestedness: RichDiffLCBD) and species replacement (turnover: ReplLCBD) and identify key environmental variables driving LCBD. We examine LCBD at two scales relevant to conservation planning: within urban settlements and nationally across the UK.
   Results Significant differences in LCBD values were recorded among the five settlements. In four of the five urban settlements studied, pond sites with the greatest LCBD values typically showed high replacement values. Significant LCBD sites and sites with high taxonomic diversity together supported more of the regional species pool (70%-97%) than sites with high taxonomic diversity alone (54%-94%) or what could be protected by the random selection of sites. LCBD was significantly associated with vegetation shading, surface area, altitude and macrophyte cover.
   Main conclusions Conservation prioritization that incorporates LCBD and sites with high taxonomic diversity improves the effectiveness of conservation actions within pond habitat networks, ensures sites supporting high biodiversity are protected and provides a method to define a spatial network of protected sites. Identifying new, effective conservation approaches, particularly in urban areas where resources may be scarce and conflicts regarding land use exist, is essential to ensure biodiversity is fully supported, and detrimental anthropogenic effects are reduced.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for a wide range of ecological processes, including to disease spread, once it describes the degree to which landscapes facilitate or impede vector and hosts dispersion. Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

AB  - City life is harsh and inhospitable for many animal species, particularly for non-volant mammals that face increased mortality risks in urban settings. Yet, studies on non-volant city mammals are limited and mostly restricted to temperate regions. Here, I evaluated the density and adaptability of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a species with a series of advantageous pre-adaptations that could facilitate city life, in highly built up urban environments of a tropical city Joao Pessoa (>800,000 people), in NE Brazil. I surveyed a total of 56 streets from seven randomly chosen districts within the city. I used multiple linear regression to determine the factors that could influence marmoset abundance. I found a total of 53 tree species of which half could be used as food resources. To reach food resources marmosets moved along and crossed streets using insulated power lines and phone cables. Marmoset density (66.9 ind/km(2)) was significantly low compared to populations inhabiting forest remnants. Nevertheless, along streets with high canopy cover, their density was similar to that reported for forest fragments. Canopy cover and trees providing food resources were key predictors of marmoset abundance. The presence of an exotic tree species (Terminalia catappa) that provides gum, showed to be key for groups persisting in extremely urbanized areas. Planting more of this species and increasing connectivity between forested areas are management strategies that might help long term persistence of marmosets in highly built up areas. Marmosets are common in Brazilian cities and could provide opportunities for contact with nature and increased well-being of human urban dwellers.

AB  - Urbanization alters the distribution and characteristics of waterbodies, potentially affecting both the habitat availability and connectivity for aquatic wildlife. We used Landsat satellite imagery to observe temporal and spatial changes in open-water habitats in Zhengzhou, a rapidly growing city in central China. We classified open water into six categories: perennial rivers, seasonal rivers and streams, canals, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. From 1990 to 2020, in 5-year intervals, we identified, counted, and measured the area of each kind of waterbody, and we used a model selection approach with linear regressions to ask which climate and anthropogenic drivers were associated with these changes. We also used Conefor software to examine how these changes affected the landscape connectivity for waterfowl. Over the study period, lakes and canals were the only waterbody types to show statistically significant changes in surface area, increasing by 712% and 236%, respectively. Changes in lakes and canals were positively correlated with the length of water pipeline in the city. The connectivity of waterbodies fluctuated over the same period, mirroring fluctuations in the perennial Yellow River. Ponds contributed very little to landscape connectivity, and the importance of reservoirs decreased over time. Conversely, canals played an increasingly important role in landscape connectivity over time. Counterintuitively, the connectivity of waterbodies increased in the built-up part of the city. Our results show that urbanization can have unexpected effects-both positive and negative-on the connectivity and area of open-water habitats. These effects are likely to be important for waterfowl and other aquatic organisms.

AB  - Riverine ecosystems form a dendritic network in which landscape and catchment-scale properties influence freshwater community structure. Placed in a restoration framework, this suggests that regional drivers can overrule the benefit of measures aiming at improving local habitat quality. Disentangling the relative influence of local and regional drivers on freshwater communities is thus crucial for ecosystem management and restoration. Along riverbanks, soil bioengineering is often used to both control erosion and improve ecological conditions. Soil bioengineering techniques aim at copying naturally functioning riverbank models and can thus be viewed as riparian ecosystem restoration. Nevertheless, these techniques are mostly designed at the local scale and are implemented in a broad range of rivers. This implies large variations in regional drivers, which may greatly influence the response of freshwater communities to restoration efforts. We studied 37 riverbanks, from civil engineering to soil bioengineering, plus natural willow stands, in the foothills of the Alps and Jura Mountains, and assessed the relative influence of local (terrestrial and aquatic habitat conditions) and regional (water quality, hydrological context and land cover composition) drivers on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Using multivariate GLM and structural equation modelling, we investigated variations in the taxonomic and functional composition and in the diversity of native, exotic, shredder and scraper taxa to both set of drivers. Our results showed that soil bioengineering improved local habitat conditions, with an increase in the vegetation density and in the aquatic habitat quality. These changes directly influenced functional composition but indirectly diversity patterns. Instead, we found that native and shredder species richness increased between civil engineered and soil bioengineered structures, suggesting a positive effect of vegetated riverbanks on other local abiotic factors (i.e. shade, water temperature, organic matter supply). Our results also showed that macroinvertebrates were more influenced by regional than by local drivers. Thus, the hydrological context best explained the composition of taxa feeding habits and variation in taxa diversity, with larger abundance and richness of scrapers and shredders in small headwater streams. Land cover ranked second in explaining variation in functional composition. Also, the diversity of natives, scrapers and shredders increased as the proportion of predominantly urban landscapes decreased. Finally, the abundance of scraper and native species increased with water quality, while the richness of exotic species decreased. Overall, these results highlight the hierarchical structure of local and regional drivers on freshwater communities. Along river networks, catchment-scale properties and landscape attributes are major drivers of macroinvertebrate assemblages. Soil bioengineering improves habitat quality and as such appears to be a good compromise solution to control erosion and support freshwater communities, even though this nature-based solution cannot solve anthropogenic pressures at larger scales. To improve the efficiency of restoration efforts, integrated approaches accounting for both local and regional drivers remains a priority.

AB  - Considering the necessity of interdisciplinary approaches for planning and managing the expansion of urban landscapes worldwide, this study aimed to (1) assess landscape permeability for birds and people inhabiting a Neotropical city and (2) propose priority streets and areas for the implementation of a green infrastructure project that could benefit both. To reach these goals, we generated resistance surfaces using expert knowledge to simulate multiple least-cost corridors (MLCC) between parks and green spaces within an urban landscape for people and seven bird species. We compared the solutions using a corridors' spatial agreement analysis, which allow us to identify the overlap between modeled corridors for all organisms or functional groups of interest. We also identified the streets most selected by the simulated MLCC and then identified a green space which is a convergence point of corridors modeled for both people and bird species. Finally, we suggested priority streets for planting trees and proposed interventions to turn the green space into a multifunctional park, conciliating social and ecological perspectives.

AB  - Mangroves are a dominant structural habitat within tropical and subtropical estuaries that provide a number of ecosystem services, including habitat for a range of crustaceans and fish. However, mangroves are one of the most threatened estuarine habitats globally, having been severely reduced in extent, and replaced by urban structures. Here, we test for the effects of both natural (e.g. seagrass, rock and mangroves habitat extent, and connectivity) and human (e.g. extent of urban area) landscape variables on the number and type of fish inhabiting mangroves forests. We used remote underwater video stations to quantify fish assemblages within mangroves at 150 sites in 30 estuaries across Queensland, Australia. Fish community structure was best explained by the extent of mangroves and seagrasses within an estuary, the distance to the estuary mouth, and the size of the estuary and catchment. Moderate catchment size and proximity to the estuary mouth increased species richness and abundance of harvestable fish at individual mangrove sites. In order to maintain mangrove fish assemblages and the functions they provide, management initiatives should focus on maintaining natural estuarine seascapes that are located closer to the mouth of estuaries, in particular, focusing on estuaries that have lower levels of catchment urbanization.

AB  - Pollinators are among the first to be lost when natural habitat is reduced to small patches and this can have cascading effects on multiple plant species. Simultaneously, the loss of natural habitat cuts people off from nature and, when people are out of touch with nature they do not care for biodiversity, resulting in further losses. Theoretically, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on pollinators can be mitigated by reconnecting isolated conservation areas with stepping stones and, if these are located in an urban matrix, they offer opportunities for people to reconnect with nature. Here we assess the effect of creating stepping stone habitats for nectar-feeding birds across Cape Town, South Africa. With the help of pupils, we planted gardens of indigenous, bird-pollinated plants at eight schools in the urbanized matrix between two conservation areas. To test for change in the bird community on school grounds we conducted 398 bird observation sessions over a seven-year period. Changes in attitudes and knowledge were assessed with questionnaires distributed to 176 pupils. We found that, as gardens matured, nectar availability increased and the probability of observing a Southern Doublecollared Sunbird (Cinnyris chalybeus) on school grounds during a 30 min period increased from 10% to 50%. Bird species richness increased from -5 to -7 species. Questionnaire scores increased by 30% in participating pupils versus 8% in non-participating pupils. Although effects were small, the results suggest that it is possible to restore the bird-pollination mutualism in cities and in the process reconnect people with nature.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement The Anthropocene has seen declining biodiversity inextricably linked to our societies, values, and choices. This requires ecologists to engage with the public in ecosystems such as cities to learn from and help inform their values and experiences regarding their role in urban nature. This article presents a transdisciplinary citizen science project on spontaneous urban vegetation in the context of urban botany, art-science, and participatory research that engages with the ecology of cities. We address the interdependence of ecological and social networks, suggesting how plant ecology can become more relevant for society in the Anthropocene, while presenting a specific methodology for engaging the public with urban botany. Cities are socio-ecological systems that require new ways of thinking and engagement to successfully conserve biodiversity. In this article, we present the citizen science project Where Seeds Fall which was undertaken in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. It was developed in an "ecology with" cities approach seeking to conduct research with the humans living in the ecosystem while learning from and helping inform their values. Our project brings together the perspectives of ecologists, artists, and planners on the three themes of urban wastelands, spontaneous vegetation, and ecological connectivity. It is placed in the context of urban botany, environmental arts and participatory research. Volunteers placed trays of bare soil (without seeds) in their gardens and balconies and monitored what plants arrived and germinated. They then were able to share information about their trays (images, species lists) with one another through a spatially explicit web platform. The project was accompanied by public outreach events and artistic interventions in public space. This article presents the methodology of the project so that it can be replicated elsewhere. Based on the experiences with the project we discuss evolving transdisciplinary perspectives on wild plant biodiversity in cities.

AB  - Quantitative securing of green space in already developed cities has many practical limitations due to socio-economic limitations. Currently, South Korea is planning a green network to secure and inject effective green space, but it is difficult to reflect it in the actual space plan due to the abstract plan. This study utilizes circuit theory and least-cost path methods for presenting a green network that is objectified and applicable to spatial planning. First, an analysis of the Least-cost Path revealed 69 least-cost paths between 43 core green areas of the study site. Most least-cost paths have been identified as passing through small green areas and streams in the city. Using the circuit theory, it was also possible to distinguish areas other than least-cost paths from areas with high potential for development, areas where target species are concentrated within corridors. In particular, areas with relatively high green network improvement effects were derived within and around corridors. This study is most significant in establishing and evaluating existing urban green networks, overcoming the limitations discussed at the linear level and expanding to the area level. To increase the utilization of this study in the future, field surveys and monitoring studies on target species need to be supplemented.

AB  - Due to the intensified land use in transformed landscapes, grassland biodiversity is often restricted to habitat fragments inadequate for arable use or for urban development. In continental parts of Eurasia, the similar to 600,000 ancient burial mounds (called "kurgans") built by nomadic tribes of the steppes are amongst the most widespread landmarks providing refuge for dry grassland species. In our study by using plant functional groups and functional traits, we aimed at gaining insight into the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping the structure and the composition of assemblages of grassland specialist plant species on kurgans embedded in the agricultural landscapes of East-Hungary. As a comparison, we also studied roadside verges and pristine extensive grasslands in the same region. We found that despite their small size, due to the lack of human disturbances and high microhabitat diversity kurgans can maintain a high species richness and percentage cover of specialists, especially when compared to verges. We revealed that assemblages of specialist plants on kurgans are characterized by traits typical to terrestrial habitat islands such as self-compatibility, large seed mass and tall stature. Kurgans and extensive grasslands were characterized by higher functional diversity (both at the level of single traits and multi-trait based functional dispersion) which is probably due to the higher level of environmental heterogeneity compared to the homogeneous environment in verges.

AB  - Engineered soils provide numerous ecosystem services in urban landscapes, such as water regulation and plant growth. They are constructed to optimize soil physicochemical properties but their biological properties are given little consideration. In particular, earthworm communities may be highly impacted by soil engineering processes and soil isolation caused by asphalted surfaces separating soils, and in particular roadside soils, from pseudo-natural soils. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate (i) the effects of soil engineering processes applied to construct roadside soils, and (ii) the effects of soil isolation from pseudo-natural soils by asphalted surfaces on earthworm communities. The study was conducted in an urban landscape in the suburbs of Paris, France. We sampled earthworms in roadside soils from two distinct soil engineering processes: basic engineering (BER) associated with shallow stripping depth and advanced engineering (AER) associated with deep stripping depth and organic amendment. Within each soil engineering process, two levels of soil isolation were defined depending on the asphalted surface separating roadside soils from pseudo-natural soils: light isolation (LI) in case of a narrow cycle path, and high isolation (HI) in case of a wide road. Soil engineering did not affect the total earthworm abundance whereas the total species richness was negatively impacted in comparison to nearby pseudo-natural soils. High soil isolation differently impacted earthworm communities depending on the engineering process. Regarding AER, earthworm abundance and species richness were significantly lower in HI than in LI while no differences were observed between BER-LI and BER-HI. Overall, engineering processes define the soil's ability to host earthworms, and soil isolation defines soil ability to be colonized from nearby environments. Considering the contribution of earthworms to the provision of ecosystem services, both soil engineering and soil isolation should be taken into account in urban projects to optimize their development in urban landscapes.

AB  - Roads threaten animal species through habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and direct mortality. It is crucial to understand how species respond to linear infrastructure for effective conservation of animal communities in fragmented landscapes. We assessed relationships between amphibian abundance and roads/ railways and habitat fragmentation. We examined whether the combined effects of habitat loss and roads or railways (accessible habitat) was a better predictor of amphibian abundance than (1) the total amount of habitat surrounding ponds, (2) distance to a highway or railway, or (3) surrounding road cover. Aquatic surveys for amphibian larvae were conducted at 30 freshwater ponds over the breeding season in a mixed peri-urban/ agricultural landscape in Hungary. Landscape variables were quantified within a 1000-m radius surrounding ponds and habitat variables were measured at the local (pond) scale. The larvae of seven amphibian species were detected. There were strong relationships between the abundance of amphibian larvae and the distance to a highway and the proportion of road cover within 1000 m of ponds. Relationships with accessible habitat and total habitat amount were uncertain, while there were no clear relationships with a major railway. Larval abundance increased with pond size, but there were mixed relationships with the presence of fish. Our results suggest that road effects were having a stronger impact on amphibian abundance than the combined effects of roads and habitat amount in the study area. Highways appeared to be negatively impacting amphibian communities within a wide road-effect zone up to 1 km from ponds. However, our results were obtained from a single-season snap-shot study and multi-season surveys are likely required to reduce uncertainty in the model predictions. Our analysis suggests that road mitigation projects for amphibians should create large ponds in areas with no highways and low road density, and with connectivity to surrounding habitats.

AB  - Examining the effects of disturbances within marine urban communities can shed light on their assembly rules and invasion processes. The effects of physical disturbance, through the removal of dominant native habitat builders, were investigated in the recolonization of disturbed patches and colonization of plates on pier pilings, in a Chilean port. On pilings, disturbance substantially affected community structure after 3 months, although it slowly converged across treatments after 10 months. On plates, cryptogenic and non-indigenous species richness increased with removal severity, which was not observed in natives. Opportunistic taxa took advantage of colonizing at an early successional stage, illustrating a competition-colonization trade-off, although indirect effects might be at play (e.g. trophic competition or selective predation). Recovery of the habitat builders then occurred at the expense of cryptogenic and non-indigenous taxa. Whether natives could continue winning against increasing propagule and colonization pressures in marine urban habitats deserves further attention. The interactions between disturbance and biological invasions herein experimentally shown in situ contribute to our understanding of multiple changes imposed by marine urbanization in a growing propagule transport network.

AB  - Urbanization transforms natural ecosystems, creating an environmental mosaic, characterized by native vegetation sites mixed with constructed sites. In this study, we compared dung beetle taxonomic and functional diversity between residential and greenspace sites (remnants of native vegetation) in an urban landscape in the Brazilian Cerrado. We sampled dung beetles in February (2013-2014 - 2015) in four sites of remnants of native Cerado (here called "greenspace") and four residential sites in the city of Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Greenspace sites are characterized by a mixture of plants of two distinct strata (phytophysiognomy Cerrado sensu stricto), a woody layer of trees and large shrubs, while residential sites are characterized by residential buildings (housing and commercial sites), unpaved roads with tree-lined streets. Dung beetle abundance and species richness were higher in greenspace sites. Species composition differed significantly among habitats but functional composition did not differ. Functional dispersion and functional richness was higher in greenspace sites. On the other hand, functional evenness was similar between greenspace and residential sites. In this study, we found higher taxonomic and functional components of dung beetle diversity in greenspace when compared to residential sites in the Brazilian Cerrado. Thus, we highlight the importance greenspace sites for the conservation of dung beetle biodiversity and consequently their ecological services (i.e. such as soil aeration, secondary seed dispersal, parasite regulation), which indirectly can affect human life quality in the urban matrix.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to increasingly fragmented urban habitat patches, and the biodiversity within these patches and in their surrounding areas is severely threatened. This ecological problem is spreading from cities to counties dominated by villages and towns, and is especially prevalent in economically developed areas. Constructing a reasonable ecological network is an effective way to balance the contradiction between regional development and ecological protection. Taking Anji County of the Zhejiang Province, China as an example, this study first identified ecological sources based on morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and connectivity analysis, and then extracted and constructed ecological networks by using a minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and network analysis. Finally, the results were optimized by adding additional ecological sources and setting stepping stones. The priority of the corridor is determined by the gravity model, and the analysis of the ecological networks in this study drills down to the town scale. The results show that the initially constructed ecological network includes 10 ecological sources and 22 ecological corridors, of which six are important ecological corridors that need priority construction. However, the ecological networks were less distributed in the central and northern regions, so four supplementary ecological sources and two stepping stones were added to optimize the ecological network. The connectivity of the optimized ecological network improved, and the values of alpha (the closure), beta (line-point rate) and gamma (network connectivity) increased by 4.6%, 10.45% and 2.18%, respectively. In addition, there were obvious differences in the area and land use types of ecological networks among towns, so it is necessary to formulate targeted construction strategies. Through an in-depth analysis from county to town, this study makes the construction and management of ecological networks more operable for country administration, and provides reference for the balance of ecological protection and regional development at the county level.

AB  - Biodiversity within cities is fundamental for human health and well-being, and delivers a wide range of critical ecosystem services. However, biodiversity is often viewed as an afterthought or final addition once an urban development nears completion. As such, provisions for biodiversity are typically tokenistic and do not achieve the experience of everyday nature that people need. Considering biodiversity requirements at the start of an urban development allows for strategic, intentional design with biodiversity enhancement in mind. Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD) is a protocol that aims to create urban areas that deliver on-site benefit to native species and ecosystems through the provision of essential habitat and food resources. Here we present a case study demonstrating how BSUD methods can be used to (a) encourage successful outcomes for nature, (b) improve the aesthetics and liveability of the urban form, and (c) engage stakeholders in a process that supports other aspects of urban design including park and streetscape design. Fishermans Bend (Melbourne) is the largest urban renewal project in Australia, and one of the first of this scale to explicitly include biodiversity targets. We outline the methods used to co-create biodiversity objectives with diverse stakeholders, and how these, combined with a quantitative analysis of their potential biodiversity impact, were translated into clear design and planning recommendations. We critically reflect on the success of this method for 1) communicating and facilitating provisions for biodiversity across different stakeholders and 2) providing clear messaging around biodiversity across different planning disciplines.

AB  - Cities are not often considered priority areas for threatened mammals; however, recent research suggests that urban areas may be important for water vole (Arvicola amphibius) conservation. To establish the potential importance of cities in supporting water vole populations, we used National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Atlas data to examine the occurrence of water voles within the United Kingdom (UK). Water voles were recorded in 28 out of 64 official UK cities in the last decade (2010-2018), and rivers and streams within parks, sports grounds, and urban reserves were the most important habitat types. In total, we found 497 records of water vole sightings within official cities, representing 5.0% of all records for this species in the NBN Atlas. Our results show that water voles are indeed found within many cities, suggesting that urban populations of water voles are more common in the UK than previously recognised. We therefore recommend that the importance of these urban populations for conservation of this species should be further established.

AB  - The ability of insects to persist in urban greenspace depends on their ability to usefully interact with available plant resources. Greenspace design influences plant-insect interactions by: (1) limiting the plant-species pool available for interaction through plant choice, (2) limiting the insects that are available for interaction through site-occupancy dynamics, and (3) mediating insect preferences based on the context of particular plant-insect interactions through structural barriers, microclimatic changes or competition. We designed an experiment to measure the effect of greenspace design attributes on site occupancy and insect preferences while keeping plant availability constant. Using a set of five functionally distinct flowering plant species ("phytometres"), we used occupancy-detection modelling to test factors affecting probability of visitation for eight groups of pollinating insects (ants, beetles, butterflies, bumblebees, honeybees, small bees, and hoverflies amend other flies) across 102 urban squares in Munich, Germany. We found that the probability of detecting an interaction was low for most functional groups, and situational factors, such as weather or competition from co-occurring flowers, were the primary drivers of visitation. Increasing the proportion of unsealed surfaces and quantity or diversity of flowers on the site had a positive influence on the probability of interaction, and, to a lesser extent, on probability of occupancy. Landscape connectivity and site area were important for only a few groups. Together, our results suggest that small-scale habitat conditions are more important than site context for influencing pollinator visitation. Designers can encourage interaction through contiguous provision of floral resources and unsealed surfaces while limiting internal barriers.

AB  - Sustainability is a target that involves many socio-ecological questions, depends on opportunities and combines different initiatives. This can be especially difficult in regions with high biodiversity scores, mega cities, high level of human populations and an intense and long-standing land use. Here, we show how a mega trail, named Atlantic Forest Trail, within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest can join the protection of biodiversity and sustainable tourism through a 4270 km corridor connecting protected areas and crossing a variety of landscapes. Further, we show some initiatives of ongoing biodiversity monitoring, and an analysis of ecological restoration in private lands that can be applied in many regions to improve habitat connectivity for both biodiversity and human use.

AB  - This study introduces the Transversal Connectivity Index (TCI) as an ecological indicator for classifying the natural landscape patches by their effective transversal connectivity to the water surfaces. The method applies specifically to urban areas at which the quality of blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is of fundamental importance in reducing the climate change consequences. Effective transversal connectivity among the BGI at the metropolitan scale supplies various ecosystem services in support of nature-based solutions for emerging urban challenges. The TCI value is computed (determined) by integrating a variety of existing and novel landscape indicators into an equation. The connectivity indicators belong to two categories: the intra-patch consists of the isoperimetric quotient, and patch ecological indicator, and the inter-patch ones listed as the band level, the shared border ratio, and the transport fragmentation buffer. The method is tested on the metropolitan zone of Berlin, and the results reveal unconventional findings of the effectiveness of BGI in urbanized landscapes. Despite the abundant green surfaces present in Berlin, only 50% of them have direct access to freshwater surfaces, based on Urban Atlas land use land cover data. The proposed indexing method is reproducible for other metropolitan areas, leading to comparative evaluation of effective BGI, having direct implications with emerging agendas of metropolitan management and policy making like the City Biodiversity Index, the concept of Sponge City, and Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Housing dispersal in emerging cities should be investigated as it occurs to achieve a better understanding of future housing dispersal. In this study, housing preferences are analyzed in Doha Metropolitan Area based on Gordon's theory. Machine learning (especially the generalized adversarial network) is utilized to predict the future urban growth of the city. The housing dispersal of expatriates is visualized in the predicted urban growth map of Doha city based on an investigation of housing supply trends, household income levels, government vision, and census data. The study proves the feasibility of this approach for managing urban growth in emerging cities worldwide. It is a robust solution to the increasing imbalance in the urban morphology of metropolitan cities. The conclusions drawn from the broad-spectrum housing dispersal findings of this study will inform policymakers and planners regarding the realities of spatial patterns and future urban growth.

AB  - The world is rapidly urbanizing, thereby transforming natural landscapes and changing the abundance and distribution of organisms. However, insights into the effects of urbanization on species interactions, and plant-pathogen interactions in particular, are lacking. We investigated the effects of urbanization on powdery mildew infection on Quercus robur at continental and within-city scales. At the continental scale, we compared infection levels between urban and rural areas of different-sized cities in Europe, and investigated whether plant traits, climatic variables and CO2 emissions mediated the effect of urbanization on infection levels. Within one large city (Stockholm, Sweden), we further explored whether local habitat features and spatial connectivity influenced infection levels during multiple years. At the continental scale, infection severity was consistently higher on trees in urban than rural areas, with some indication that temperature mediated this effect. Within Stockholm city, temperature had no effect, while local accumulation of leaf litter negatively affected powdery mildew incidence in one out of three years, and more connected trees had lower infection levels. This study is the first to describe the effects of urbanization on plant-pathogen interactions both within and among cities, and to uncover the potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns at each scale.

AB  - Human-designed landscapes can host diverse pollinator communities, and the availability of floral resources is central to supporting insect biodiversity in highly modified environments. However, some urban landscapes have relatively few pollinator-attractive plant species and management in urban environments rarely considers the function of these plants in generating and supporting a stable ecological community. Evaluations of 25 cultivars within five commercially popular herbaceous perennial ornamental plant genera (Agastache, Echinacea, Nepeta, Rudbeckia, and Salvia) revealed variation in the total and proportional abundance of visitors attracted. These varieties supported multiple pollinator functional groups, however bees were the primary visitors to in this system. Cultivars were assessed according to their function within a plant-pollinator network. Comparisons of artificial networks created with the six most attractive and six least attractive cultivars demonstrated that a planting scheme using the most attractive cultivars would attract nearly four times as many bee species, including several specialists and rare species. Plant diversity in the landscape was correlated with abundance and diversity of pollinator visitors, demonstrating that community context shapes a plant's relative attractiveness to pollinators. We conclude that herbaceous perennial cultivars can support an abundance and diversity of pollinator visitors, however, planting schemes should take into consideration the effects of cultivar, landscape plant diversity, floral phenology, floral area, and contribution to a stable ecological community.

AB  - Mammals figure prominently in tropical ecology because of their role in seed dispersal, herbivore control, and nutrient cycling. Urbanization is a conservation concern for mammals not only because of lost habitat, but also other negative impacts such as illegal hunting and pollution. Some mammals are resilient to urbanization and can persist in degraded habitats; however, this has not been studied in many tropical sites. We used camera traps to study mammals in Peperpot Nature Park (PNP), a secondary forest located 5 km from the capital of Suriname, and compared it to the large Central Suriname Nature Reserve (CSNR). We found fewer species in PNP (20) compared to CSNR (30), however, PNP included apex predators and species of conservation concern, and the two sites had a similar relative abundance of large cats and most mesocarnivores. Smaller mammal species had higher relative abundance at PNP while larger herbivores were scarce or absent, likely from poaching, as PNP is still connected to interior forests. The detection models revealed that the park, the camera trap was set in, was the most common significant factor for most species, suggesting that broader landscape level effects are important. In occupancy models, the null model was the most common top model across species, but then followed by park. Despite fewer species being detected than in large protected areas, the presence of some species in PNP which are historically absent in developed areas shows promise for small urban tropical forests to support robust mammal communities, provided they maintain some connectivity to larger source habitats.

AB  - Geomorphological alterations, hydrological disconnectivity and water pollution are among the dominant pressures affecting ecological integrity in urban streams. River restoration approaches often involve utilising in-stream structures to encourage flow heterogeneity and promote habitat diversity. However, few studies examine the success of such projects. In this study, fish density, biomass and community structure at paired restored and unrestored reaches across five tributaries of the River Thames were examined. Fish density varied among rivers and reaches but was generally higher at restored sites. Restored sites also exhibited higher overall fish biomass, attributed mainly to the presence of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) at the River Wandle. Despite higher density and biomass values at restored sites, the community structure analysis did not identify strong links between either river or restoration status using either species-specific density or biomass. Our results highlight that although reach-scale restoration can lead to localised increases in species density and biomass, this may chiefly be due to aggregation owing to preferential habitats created through restoration activities at these sites. Over larger spatial scales, significant improvements to species richness and diversity are likely to be limited due to the poor water quality and disconnected nature of these urban streams. Whilst reach-scale restoration clearly has the potential to provide preferential habitats for fish species, future efforts should focus on improving connectivity for fish across the wider Thames basin network by removing barriers to passage, improving water quality, restoring watershed processes and creating well-connected, diverse habitats which can facilitate the survival of a wide array of fish species throughout their life cycle.

AB  - As urbanization continues to expand worldwide, more and more urban areas become home to wild animals able to adapt to city life, generating a growing need for information. In the Greater Paris area, the existence of three wild mammals (the stone marten, Martes foina, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes and the hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus) is attested. However, little is known regarding their presence. The research reported in this study aims to shed light upon their co-existence with city dwellers. Specifically, the areas where contacts between these species and the inhabitants are the most likely are studied. Gaining insight on the distribution of such areas allows for those in charge of wildlife-related issues to target where management measures may be needed the most, whether they concern biodiversity promotion initiatives or conflict mitigation actions. In this paper, we investigate the landscape compositions in which these encounters have been the most frequent using presence records. To do so, we analyzed the land use types within buffers set around contact points and applied statistical operations (correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering) on the obtained results. Results show that while some landscape compositions attract all three species (namely areas where greenery is prevailing), others were only favored by one or two of the species.

AB  - Background With the increasing fragmentation of landscape induced by rapid urbanization, the construction of ecological networks is of great significance to alleviate the degradation of urban habitats and protect natural environments. However, there is considerable uncertainty when constructing ecological networks, especially the different approaches to selecting ecological sources. We used the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen as a study area to construct and optimize ecological networks using a coupling approach. Ecological source areas were extracted using morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and the landscape index method. Ecological networks were constructed using the minimal cumulative resistance (MCR) model and the gravity model. Stepping stones and ecological fault points were added in corridors to optimize the ecological network. Results Ten core areas with maximum importance patch values were extracted by the landscape index method as ecological source areas according to MSPA, after which corridors between ecological sources were constructed based on the MCR model. The constructed ecological networks were optimized using 35 stepping stones and 17 ecological fault points. The optimized ecological networks included 11 important corridors, 34 general corridors, and seven potential corridors. The results of corridor landscape-type analysis showed that a suitable ecological corridor is 60 to 200 m wide. Conclusions Overall, our results imply that ecological source areas can be identified virtually, and that ecological networks can be significantly optimized by combining MSPA and MCR models. These results provide a methodological reference for constructing ecological networks, and they will be useful for urban planning and biodiversity protection in Shenzhen and other similar regions around the world.

AB  - Mixed-species vegetation, such as that in semi-natural meadows, is increasingly adopted in urban green infrastructure to enhance habitat quality and aesthetic value; however, little is known regarding the consequences of using meadow mixes in river revetments. In the present study, 20 herbaceous species that naturally occur in habitats with infrequent and periodic inundation were mix-planted in hydrology-induced and disturbed revetments along the mainstream of the Yangtze River in the typical mountain city of Chongqing, China. The experimental meadow communities exhibited persistence under the constraints imposed by the prevailing hydrological conditions and disturbances, such as the extremely high soil wetness variability between periodical inundation on seedlings, the drought during the summer, and the transition between runoff washout and quick drainage. All planted species survived under the changing hydrological conditions, while the semi-natural meadow maintained good growth and visual landscape quality. Meadow mixes were significantly superior in species richness, abundance and structural diversity over the existing homogeneous community dominated by invasive liana Humulus scandens. Community data suggest that species richness has increased by more than 60% in the meadow mix over the existing vegetation. The meadow communities resisted invasion by indigenous weeds and colonising species that spread through wind-dispersal and hydrochorous transport from the upstream catchment. We therefore recommend prioritising taxonomically diverse meadows for river revetments wherever possible. This study provides a valid framework that can be used to inform future vegetation restoration schemes in river revetments affected by complex hydrological variation and disturbances. The methodology is applicable to a broad range of vegetative revetment structures.

AB  - Understanding the response of plant species richness to environmental filters is critical for conservation management as there is an increasing emphasis on plant restoration in urban/rural planning. However, empirical studies on the effects that the regional species pool has on plant species richness often overlook small spatial scales, therefore requiring more comprehensive approaches. As mountains can act as barriers to plant dispersal, the impact on the species pool, particularly, should be a priority. This study aimed to investigate how the regional species pool affects the local plant species richness in a multivariate context. We sampled vascular plant communities along three transects located in three valleys across the Chongli District, China, where four common habitat types were selected for sampling: grassland, shrubbery, pure forest, and mixed forest. We compared the differences in the multi-scale species richness and species composition between habitats and regions and used piecewise structural equation modeling to analyze the relative importance of the regional species pool, habitat species pool, soil resource availability, and exposure for local plant richness. The beta-diversity had the highest contribution to the total species richness between valleys and habitats. The species composition between regions and habitats showed a significant difference and the local species richness was most strongly affected by the soil characteristics, but effects from the regional species pool still played an important role. Conservation efforts and urban/rural planning should use a multi-level and multi-scale approach based on a detailed structural investigation.

AB  - This article summarizes the data of a survey of flowering plants in 80 sites in five European cities and urban agglomerations (Antwerp, Belgium; greater Paris, France; Poznan, Poland; Tartu, Estonia; and Zurich, Switzerland). Sampling sites were selected based on a double orthogonal gradient of size and connectivity and were urban green areas (e.g. parks, cemeteries). To characterize the flowering plants, two sampling methodologies were applied between April and July 2018. First, a floristic inventory of the occurrence of all flowering plants in the five cities. Second, flower counts in sampling plots of standardized size (1 m(2)) only in Zurich. We sampled 2146 plant species (contained in 824 genera and 137 families) and across the five cities. For each plant species, we provide its origin status (i.e. whether the plants are native from Europe or not) and 11 functional traits potentially important for plant-pollinator interactions. For each study site, we provide the number of species, genera, and families recorded, the Shannon diversity as well as the proportion of exotic species, herbs, shrubs and trees.

AB  - The development of urban agglomeration in aquatic areas is premised on ecological security. The construction of ecological security network is an effective measure to reduce ecological resistance and guarantee economic development. In this study, a comprehensive ecological security network (ESN) evaluation approach is developed by integrating the Minimum Cumulative Resistance (MCR) model and Duranton and Overman Index (DOI). Taking the urban agglomeration around Poyang Lake in 2015 as a case, the MCR model showed the ecological landscape pattern of discrete connection and large overall ecological resistance. The DOI model indicated that the industries of moderately polluted were global localization, while heavily polluted were small-scale localization and large-scale dispersion. Accordingly, the ESN consisting of 35 ecological sources, 34 ecological corridors, 57 artificial corridors, and 39 eco-economic strategic nodes can avoid the threat of industrial layout to the ecological landscape. The results of this study complemented the guidance of industrial agglomeration theory on the basis of "source-sink" theory. The dual evaluation approach of landscape ecology and economic agglomeration proposed in this study explores interdisciplinary data fusion of different scales, and also provides a reference for inter-municipal coordinated ecological management and restraining urban excessive expansion.

AB  - In cities, humans directly and indirectly affect plant and wildlife communities. These human-species interactions are not included in traditional ecological approaches used to understand why and how organisms are distributed. Here, we incorporate human behaviors into urban community assembly theories and detail all the complex ways humans affect the dispersal, selection and persistence of species in cities. To do this, we integrate human behaviors and actions into traditional filter frameworks used to study community assembly. We use our framework to develop testable hypotheses to predict patterns of urban diversity as well as pose key considerations for future research. In order to have a predictive understanding of how urban biodiversity responds to environmental, social and land use change, it is necessary to better understand interactions between humans and other organisms.

AB  - Bumblebees are a key pollinator group globally which have declined over time. However, while some species remain common others are rare and have declined at a sharper rate. The Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus Morawitz) is classified as 'Endangered' on the Irish Red List, and 'Vulnerable' at European level. We aimed to investigate the ecology of B. distinguendus within the wider bumblebee community in its only remaining Irish population to inform conservation management. Eight true bumblebee species were recorded in total in four habitat types surveyed, with highest species richness in species-rich grassland and highest abundance in urban habitats. Highest numbers of B. distinguendus were found in two designated nature reserves. However, outside these reserves the species was only found in three of twelve sites surveyed in both species-rich and coastal grassland habitats. B. distinguendus is a late emerging species in this region with a foraging preference for Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra). Availability of key forage species was lowest when numbers of B. distinguendus were highest, potentially limiting survival of this species. Some smaller suitable habitats in urban areas and roadside verges were not used by the species, which suggests potential issues with habitat connectivity, patch size and/or availability of nesting and hibernation sites. Implications for insect conservation Based on our findings, we suggest that existing species-rich and coastal grassland sites should be conserved, and other areas restored, for B. distinguendus in Ireland. Conservation management should focus on delaying cutting grasslands until late September, winter grazing of stock and reducing pesticides and fertilisers with the aim of increasing forage availability in late season, and ensuring that suitable habitats are connected in the landscape to allow adequate habitat area as well as movement and dispersal of the species to new areas.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most lasting anthropogenic disturbances threatening native species diversity including ants. Ants play important ecological functions such as seed dispersal, biological pest control, and bio-indicators of environmental changes. Herein, we investigated and tracked ant communities in three sites (rural, suburban and urban) in 2007 and resampled the same categories ten years after, using the same methods. A total of 39 species belonging to 7 subfamilies and 19 genera was recorded during the two sampling periods. During the 10-year study period, ant species richness declined in sites that were rural in 2007, but suburban in 2017. However, ant species richness increased between 2007 and 2017 in sites that were suburban and urban in 2007, and urban sites in 2017. In contrast, ant abundance increased significantly within all sites over time. Six tramp species were found in different sites with Wasmannia auropunctata and Pheidole megacephala being the most common species between 2007 and 2017 respectively. Tramp species represented more than a half of all ant fauna at each sampling period and their abundance increased by 55% between 2007 and 2017. These results indicate changes in ant community composition and highlight explosion of some tramp species with urbanization over longer temporal scales. This study also demonstrates that the rapid transformation of suburban and rural areas into built environments leads to the replacement of native species by disturbance specialists in urbanized areas over time. The suburban peak in species numbers suggests that edge effects may influence the diversity and composition of ant species along urbanization gradients. Further research is needed to understand the ecological processes shaping the ant community in areas with intermediate levels of disturbance.

AB  - City-regions are conferred economic advantage through their brokerage roles, which close structural holes between other city-regions that would otherwise not be connected within firm networks. Here, we identify city-regions whose brokerage roles are defined by their network positionality as intermediaries using flows based on ownership relations between headquarters and subsidiary locations. Applying Gould and Fernandez's framework of five potential brokerage types, we find city-regions play one or more brokerage roles characterized by both global and domestic flows. Moving beyond understandings of brokerage as a position, we explain diversity in brokerage as defined by economic processes underlying urban networks.

AB  - 1. Urban areas can host speciose bee communities due partially to the species-rich combination of both native and alien plant species found in these landscapes. However, in intensively-constructed zones, it could be expected to record a low plant diversity used by bees because of the high proportion of paved surfaces in these areas. 2. We investigated the influence of urbanisation on the cavity-nesting bee-plant community and interaction network structures in a medium-sized city. The floral diversity used by nesting females in cell provisioning was retrieved from the pollen content obtained from trap-nests collected in 11 sites located in an urban landscape gradient. 3. Eighty pollen types belonging to 20 families were identified in the 155 pollen samples analysed. At least seven alien plant species were identified in samples from all sampling points. The landscape analysis revealed a positive influence of the proportion of green areas on the pollen type richness, although the null model was also selected as best model. Likewise, all network metrics but connectance were not influenced by any of the landscape variables. 4. Our findings demonstrated that notwithstanding the sampling sites the floral diversity used by bees and the alien pollen type richness were similar. Likewise, the bee-plant networks were modular, asymmetric, and highly specialised. The positive adaptation that cavity-nesting bee species present in urban environments and the presence of bee species that can explore a diverse flora may indicate that the local variation in the landscape had little influence on their interactions with plants.

AB  - Even if the ecological role of trees outside forests (TOF) is acknowledged, few studies provide an exhaustive census and define their principal characteristics, considering not only the patch size but also the effect of the surrounding land-use type on TOF biodiversity. Using a multiphase sampling design, we provided a map showing the spatial distribution of small woodlots outside forest (SWOF), a type of TOF, embedded in different land-use types in Sardinia, a Mediterranean hotspot of biodiversity conservation. Once located and mapped, we investigated the differences among SWOFs enclosed in different land-use types, in terms of vegetation structure and plant species richness (native and alien), searching for indicator species able to characterize SWOFs located in different land-use types. Hence, we explored the effect of environmental factors and vegetation structure on native and alien contingent in SWOF's plant communities.
   Our findings indicated that SWOFs were widely spread along the land-use intensification gradient, both in natural and human-modified land-use types. The area covered by SWOFs increased following the gradient of land-use intensification, reaching the highest value in urban zones (0.85%), and the lower in agricultural and natural and semi-natural areas (0.31% and 0.23%, respectively).
   We found dissimilarities between SWOFs located in different land-use types in terms of species richness, composition and indicator species, both native and alien. Notably, the contribution of alien species to the overall diversity was low both in natural and human-modified land-uses.
   Nevertheless, alien and native taxa showed different responses to environmental drivers: alien taxa were not affected by landscape variables, while the native ones were significantly influenced by all investigated environmental drivers and by the structural complexity of vegetation.
   SWOFs embedded in human-altered areas, in particularly in agricultural land-use, show good levels of naturalness: these results indicate that SWOFs represent an opportunity for natural conversion and rewilding of altered ecosystems.
   Small woodlands outside the forest can be the pillars to build and extend the green infrastructure network in both natural and modified land-uses, delivering important benefits for ecosystem services, and offering nature-based solutions to pamper fragmentation effects.

AB  - Researchers and managers of natural resource conservation have increasingly emphasized the importance of maintaining a connected network of important ecological patches to mitigate landscape fragmentation, reduce the decline of biodiversity, and sustain ecological services. This research aimed to guide landscape management and decision-making by developing an evaluation framework to construct ecological security patterns. Taking the Jianghan Plain as the study area, we identified key ecological sources by overlaying the spatial patterns of ecological quality (biodiversity, carbon storage, and water yield) and ecological sensitivity (habitat sensitivity, soil erosion sensitivity, and water sensitivity) using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and the Chinese Soil Loss Equation Function. Ecological corridors were obtained by the least-cost path analysis method and circuit theory. A total of 48 ecological sources (3812.95 km(2)), primarily consisting of water area, forestland, and cropland, were identified. Ninety-one ecological corridors were derived, with a total length of 2036.28 km. Forty barriers and 40 pinch points with the highest improvement coefficient scores or priority scores were selected. There were 11 priority corridors with very high levels of connectivity improvement potential and conservation priority, occupying 16.15% of the total length of corridors. The overall potential for ecological connectivity is high on the Jianghan Plain. Our framework offers a valuable reference for constructing ecological security patterns and identifying sites for ecological restoration at the regional scale.

AB  - The article discusses methodological approaches to the assessment of the spatial configuration and structure of green spaces and fragments of the natural landscape (for Malaga, Spain). Modern modeling techniques using geographic information systems (GIS) are used to assess Malaga's green infrastructure in terms of the configuration, fragmentation, and spatial structure of green spaces (with GuidosToolBox software). Morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) focuses on the geometry and connectivity of components based on a raster image of the study area, can automatically identify ecological corridors of different sizes, and can further rank them within the network, thereby making it possible to assess the connectivity of the natural framework of the city. With MSPA, it is possible to identify the configuration and structure of green spaces, the main basic reserves (cores) and islands of green infrastructure, and the ecological corridors and to assess the connectivity and fragmentation of green spaces, which is critical for the determination of the unity of the ecological framework of the parameters. The scientific novelty of the research consists of the developed methodological approaches for the determination of high-priority areas of the green infrastructure network, which are simultaneously important for both the conservation of biodiversity and for the development of the recreational and aesthetic qualities of green spaces.

AB  - Preserving and restoring wildlife in urban areas benefits both urban ecosystems and the well-being of urban residents. While urban wildlife conservation is a rapidly developing field, the majority of conservation research has been performed in wildland areas. Understanding the applicability of wildland science to urban populations and the relative importance of factors limiting species persistence are of critical importance to identifying prescriptive management strategies for restoring wildlife to urban parks. We evaluated how habitat fragmentation, habitat quality and mortality threats influence species occupancy and persistence in urban parks. We chose California quail Callipepla californica as a representative species with potential to respond to urban conservation. We used publicly available eBird data to construct occupancy models of quail in urban parks across their native range, and present an application using focal parks interested in exploring quail reintroduction. Urban parks had a 0.23 +/- 0.02 probability of quail occupancy, with greater occupancy in larger parks that were less isolated from potential source populations, had higher shrub cover and had lower impervious cover. Less isolated parks had higher colonization rates, while larger parks had lower extinction rates. These results align with findings across urban ecology showing greater biodiversity in larger and more highly connected habitat patches. A case study highlighted that interventions to increase effective park size and improve connectivity would be most influential for two highly urban focal parks, while changes to internal land cover would have a relatively small impact. Low joint extinction probability in the parks (0.010 +/- 0.013) indicated reintroduced populations could persist for some time. Synthesis and applications. We show how eBird data can be harnessed to evaluate the responsiveness of wildlife to urban parks of variable size, connectivity and habitat quality, highlighting what management actions are most needed. Using California quail as an example, we found park size, park isolation and presence of coyotes are all important drivers of whether quail can colonize and persist in parks. Our results suggest reintroducing quail to parks could be successful provided parks are large enough to support quail, and management actions are taken to enhance regional connectivity or periodic assisted colonization is used to supplement local populations.

AB  - Delineating population boundaries in anthropogenic landscape is of critical importance for domains of biology that are concerned with the ecology, evolution and conservation of species. This remains particularly difficult for species where there is no obvious demarcation of geographical populations and dispersal patterns are poorly known. This is often the case in amphibian species that reproduce in aquatic habitats but live otherwise in terrestrial habitats. Sampling of such species usually occurs in the aquatic habitat (i.e., breeding sites) but these may represent neither genetically nor demographically distinct populations. Here, we analyzed the genetic structure of a stream-breeding species, the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) along a rural-to-urban land use gradient. We used genetic data and Bayesian clustering approaches, which rely on genetic information without assuming predefined populations, to delineate distinctive genetic units along this gradient, and compare genetic diversity between rural and urban areas. The different analytical approaches used partitioned our dataset in slightly different but highly congruent clusters, that included localities which were up to 19 km apart from each other. Genetic breaks occurred at unexpected places while several landscape features reported to act as barriers on gene flow for amphibians did not lead to genetic breaks. Our results emphasize the difficulty to delineate management units in open systems, especially for long-lived species, for which the timespan between the establishment of a barrier and its translation into clear genetic breaks will take longer than in short-lived species.

AB  - Since 2007, more people in the world live in urban than in rural areas. The development of urban areas has encroached into natural forest ecosystems, consequently increasing the ecological importance of parks and fragmented forest remnants. However, a major concern is that urban activities have rendered urban forests susceptible to non-native species incursions, making them central entry sites where non-native plant species can establish and spread. We have little understanding of what urban factors contribute to this process. Here we use data collected by citizen scientists to determine the differential impacts of spatial and urban factors on non-native plant introductions in urban forests. Using a model city, we mapped 18 urban forests within city limits, and identified all the native and non-native plants present at those sites. We then determined the relative contribution of spatial and socioeconomic variables on the richness and composition of native and non-native plant communities. We found that socioeconomic factors rather than spatial factors (e.g., urban forest area) were important modulators of overall or non-native species richness. Non-native species richness in urban forest fragments was primarily affected by residential layout, recent construction events, and nearby roads. This demonstrates that the proliferation of non-native species is inherent to urban activities and we propose that future studies replicate our approach in different cities to broaden our understanding of the spatial and social factors that modulate invasive species movement starting in urban areas.

AB  - In light of the long-term pressure and short-term impact of economic and technological globalization, regional and urban resilience has become an important issue in research. As a new organizational form of regional urban systems, the resilience of urban networks generated by flow space has emerged as a popular subject of research. By gathering 2017 data from the Baidu search index, the Tencent location service, and social statistics, this study constructs information, transportation, and economic networks among 344 cities in China to analyze the spatial patterns of urban networks and explore their structural characteristics from the perspectives of hierarchy and assortativity. Transmissibility and diversity were used to represent the resilience of the network structure in interruption scenarios (node failure and maximum load attack). The results show the following: The information, transportation, and economic networks of cities at the prefecture level and higher in China exhibit a dense pattern of spatial distribution in the east and a sparse pattern in the west; however, there are significant differences in terms of hierarchy and assortativity. The order of resilience of network transmissibility and diversity from strong to weak was information, economic, transportation. Transmissibility and diversity had nearly identical scores in response to the interruption of urban nodes. Moreover, a highly heterogeneous network was more likely to cause shocks to the network structure, owing to its cross-regional urban links in case of disturbance. We identified 12 dominant nodes and 93 vulnerable nodes that can help accurately determine the impetus behind network structure resilience. The capacity of regions for resistance and recovery can be improved by strengthening the construction of emergency systems and risk prevention mechanisms.

AB  - Background Efficient and safe movement is fundamental for wild birds to thrive in their environments. For arboreal forest animals, especially birds, canopy cover has a large impact on birds' daily movements and is a crucial component of conservation strategies seeking to retain avian population in disturbed or urban habitats. Methods We translocated woodland bird species utilizing different forest strata during two non-breeding seasons in Gainesville, FL, USA. We used linear model and generalized linear model to examine the effects of canopy cover and species identity on homing success and speed. Results Among our study species of Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis), and Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), we found that Carolina Chickadees and Tufted Titmice were more likely to return than Northern Cardinals. Among birds that successfully returned, homing speed is significantly affected by forest canopy cover and species identity (titmice had higher homing speed than cardinals). Birds return much faster in landscape with higher canopy cover. Conclusions This study presented evidence of species identity's effect on homing success and speed in common feeder bird species in Southeast US and provided further evidence that bird movements in the suburban land cover are constrained by low canopy cover.

AB  - Urban soils harbor billions of bacterial cells and millions of species. However, the distribution patterns and assembly processes of bacterial communities remain largely uncharacterized in urban soils. It is also unknown if we can use the bacteria to track soil sources to certain cities and districts. Here, Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to survey soil bacterial communities from 529 random plots spanning 61 districts and 10 major cities in China. Over a 3,000 km range, community similarity declined with increasing geographic distance (Mantel r=0.62), and community composition was clustered by city (R-2=0.50). Within cities (<100 km), the aforementioned biogeographic patterns were weakened. Process analysis showed that homogenizing dispersal and dispersal limitation dominated soil bacterial assembly at small and large spatial scales, respectively. Accordingly, the probabilities of accurately tracking random soil sources to certain cities and districts were 90.0% and 66.7%, respectively. When the tested samples originated from cities that were more than 1,265 km apart, the soil sources could be identified with nearly 100% accuracy. Overall, this study demonstrates the strong distance-decay relationship and the clear geographic zoning of urban soil bacterial communities among cities. The varied importance of different community assembly processes at multiple spatial scales strongly affects the accuracy of microbial source tracking.

AB  - Nowadays, an increasing number of large cities, districts, and towns have tools for the Planning and Management of Green Infrastructures. All such tools seek a progression towards a future city model that is more resilient on an environmental, economic, and social level. To achieve this, emphasis is placed on the creation of a green infrastructure and, particularly, on improving urban biodiversity, urban forests, the value of natural areas in the urban environment, periurban agriculture, ecological connectivity, and accessibility. Moreover, the recent COVID19 health crisis has further highlighted that the city dweller's relationship with the environment requires a reconciliation with nature and rural life that goes beyond typical compartmentalization. The objective must be to emphasize the need to establish creative processes which, through micro-scale activities (landscaping), generate the articulation of visible actions on a territorial scale (landscape planning) in both the natural environment (environmental landscape planning) and the urban environment (town planning based on the landscape). This article analyzes the issue of the large towns in south-west Madrid, where there is a dramatic divide on the border between the city landscape and the surrounding natural or agricultural landscape, and where there is an increasing need to establish landscapes with a certain uniqueness and to classify them as protected periurban areas, nature reserves, or land for which use and management is regulated. It is therefore important to develop environmental quality standards to assess Green Infrastructures as a whole: the administrative processes, their design, construction, maintenance, and resilience. This research focuses upon how this change in the planning and management of green periurban areas improves the multifunctionality of periurban spaces along with the intrinsic quality of the landscape, and promotes the city's sustainability and resilience and improves governance. From the conclusions drawn, it should be noted that analysis, design, and action should be built on premises of sustainability and multifunctionality, and comply with the criteria for characterizing elements as green infrastructure. In the field of study, the characterization of the periurban area, and its subsequent assessment as a green infrastructure, provide the guidelines for action for devising an Open Space Strategy. This strategy constitutes a cross-disciplinary planning tool for local authorities when reading the landscape.

AB  - Substantial efforts have been devoted to investigating the effects of urban form on fundamental natural and social patterns. Such efforts, however, focus mostly on the urban and regional scales. Despite fine-scale investigations that have been conducted recently to analyze how the urban landscape influences urban vitality at the local scale, these studies are often based on the two-dimensional shape of spaces and ignore the diversification of economies and activities in various cities throughout the day. This work examined the relationships between multidimensional urban form and urban vitality at the street block level and explored their variations across fifteen megacities in China. Based on the framework of Conzen's town-plan analysis, multidimensional urban form was quantified from three fundamental aspects: city plan, building forms, and land utilization. The local vitality was measured in social and economic dimensions at different times of day using restaurant data and nighttime lights. Our results revealed the time- and place-varying relationships between urban form and urban vitality and indicated the successes and failures of widely accepted norms of a good city form. In particular, connectivity, compactness, building arrangement, iconic buildings, transport facilities, and open and green spaces were found to be important for urban vitality, whereas land-use mixture and building density presented limited or unintended effects. Furthermore, some urban form indicators could contrarily contribute to vitality for different cities, times, or dimensions, suggesting that urban spaces bearing these qualifications might not be constantly attractive.

AB  - Urbanisation is a prominent and increasing form of land-use change, with the potential to disrupt the interactions between pollinators such as bees and the flowering plants that they visit. This in turn may cause cascading local extinctions and have consequences for pollination services. Network approaches go beyond simple metrics of abundance and species richness, enabling understanding of how the structure of plant-pollinator communities are affected by urbanisation. Here we compared pollination networks between native vegetation (bushland) remnants and residential gardens in the urbanised region of the southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. Across fourteen sites, seven per habitat, plant-bee visitor networks were created from surveys conducted monthly during the spring-summer period over two years. Extinction slope (a measure of how extinctions cascade through the network), and network robustness and nestedness were higher for bushland remnants, suggesting that networks in bushland remnants had greater functional integrity, but if disrupted, more cascading extinctions could occur. In contrast, niche overlap between pollinators was higher in residential gardens, suggesting greater competition for resources. Most species-level properties did not differ between habitats, except for normalised degree, which was higher in bushland remnants. In conclusion, it appears that pollination networks in managed residential gardens are not structurally equivalent with those in bushland remnants. This has implications for conservation of wild bee assemblages in this biodiversity hotspot, and suggests removal of remnant native vegetation for residential development could disrupt the integrity of plant-pollinator assemblages.

AB  - Several biodiversity-centered metrics exist to quantify the importance of landscape and habitat features for conservation efforts. However, for species whose habitat use is not quantified by these metrics, such as those in urban areas, we need a method to best identify features for targeted conservation efforts. We investigated the use of social network analysis (SNA) to identify and quantify these critical habitat features. We used SNA to identify network existence in chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica) roost usage, quantify the importance of each roost site, and evaluate the impact of the loss of key sites. We identified a network consisting of ten chimney swift roosts in southern Nova Scotia, Canada, and found that 76% of swifts used more than one roost throughout the breeding season. We also isolated three key (most connected) roost sites. We evaluated the effect of loss of these key sites on the network by using a Wilcoxon-Pratt signed-rank test and by analyzing the structure of the subsequent network. We found that connections between roosts and the structure of the network were significantly affected by the loss of these key sites. Our results show that SNA is a valuable tool that can identify key sites for targeted conservation efforts for species that may not be included in conservation efforts focused purely on biodiversity.

AB  - Hedychium coronarium is an invasive plant widespread in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, especially in riparian areas. However, its distribution along streams is not continuous and the factors that are related to its local occurrence are unknown. We investigated which natural and anthropogenic drivers, particularly concerning dispersal and disturbance, facilitate establishment of H. coronarium. We sampled 148 randomly chosen riparian sites (each containing two plots) in a subtropical basin in southern Brazil and recorded presence/absence of the plant and some environmental variables in situ; other variables were extracted via GIS software. We performed a GLMM with presence/absence as the response variable, sampling site as a random factor and five predictors: intensity of ecosystem degradation, dominant type of terrestrial vegetation, river substrate size class, Strahler stream order and downstream distance to the nearest urban centre. Our results point out that invader presence is favoured by local human disturbance (high riparian degradation and presence of non-native forest), and possibly dispersal, as there is a higher H. coronarium presence probability in proximity to urban centres. Furthermore, a higher presence probability in downstream sections (higher Strahler order) might be explained by hydrologic dispersal of rhizome fragments. Our study illustrates that in the case of riparian invasions it is important to consider terrestrial and aquatic drivers, both natural and anthropogenic.

AB  - Urban expansion and associated habitat transformation drives shifts in biodiversity, with declines in taxonomic and functional diversity. Forests fragments within urban landscapes offer a number of ecosystem services, and help to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we focus on a tropical forest environment, and on the soil biota. Using eDNA metabarcoding, we compare forest fragments within the city of Cayenne, French Guiana, with a neighbouring continuous undisturbed forest. We wished to determine if urban forest fragments conserve high levels of alpha and beta diversity as well as similar functional composition for plants, soil animals, fungi and bacteria. We found that alpha diversity is similar across habitats for plants and fungi, lower in urban forests for metazoans and higher for bacteria. We also found that urban forests communities differ from undisturbed forests in their taxonomic composition, with urban forests exhibiting greater turnover between fragments potentially caused by ecological drift and limited dispersal. However, their functional composition exhibited limited differences, with an enrichment of palms, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria and a depletion of climber plants and termites. Thus, although urban forest fragments do shelter soil biodiversity that differs from native forests, the losses of soil functions may be relatively limited. This study demonstrates the strong potential of a multi-taxa eDNA approach for rapid inventories across taxonomic kingdoms, in particular for cryptic soil diversity. It also demonstrates the key role of urban forest fragments in conserving biodiversity and ecosystem function, and points to a need for more systematic monitoring of these areas in urban management plans.

AB  - A loss of natural capital within cities and their surrounding areas has been noticed over the last decades. Increasing development associated with higher sealing rates has caused a general loss of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) within the urban environment, whereas urban sprawl and the improvement of road networks have deeply fragmented the surrounding landscape and jeopardized ecosystems connectivity. UGS are an essential component of the urban system, and their loss has a greater impact on, e.g., ecological and hydrological processes, threatening human well-being. Different types and spatial configurations of UGS may affect their own ability to provide ecosystem services, such as biodiversity support and water regulation. Nevertheless, the study of UGS spatial patterns is a research branch poorly addressed. Moreover, UGS analyses are mainly focused on public and vast green spaces, but seldom on informal, private, and interstitial ones, returning a myopic representation of urban green areas. Therefore, this study investigates the UGS spatial patterns within six Southern European cities, using the urban morphology analysis to assess all urban vegetated lands. Results revealed three main Urban Green Spatial Patterns (UGSPs): Fragmented, Compact, and Linear Distributions. UGSPs taxonomy represents a novelty in the urban morphology field and may have important implications for the ability to provide ecosystem services and, thus, human well-being.

AB  - Microbes are abundant inhabitants of the near-surface atmosphere in urban areas. The distribution of microbial communities may benefit or hinder human wellbeing and ecosystem function. Surveys of airborne microbial diversity are uncommon in both natural and built environments and those that investigate diversity are stationary in the city, thus missing continuous exposure to microbes that covary with three-dimensional urban structure. Individuals in cities are generally mobile and would be exposed to diverse urban structures outdoors and within indoor-transit systems in a day. We used mobile monitoring of microbial diversity and geographic information system spatial analysis, across Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA in outdoor and indoor-transit (subways and train cars) environments. This study identifies to the role of the three-dimensional urban landscape in structuring atmospheric microbiomes and employs mobile monitoring over similar to 1,920 kilometers to measure continuous biodiversity. We found more diverse communities outdoors that significantly differ from indoor-transit air in microbial community structure, function, likely source environment, and potentially pathogenic fraction of the community. Variation in the structure of the urban landscape was associated with diversity and function of the near-surface atmospheric microbiome in outdoor samples.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures can affect the distribution of species and elicit the appearance of spatial patterns that provide insights into the species' responses to environmental filtering, mediated by their functional traits. Due to the functional redundancy in ecological communities, the spatial variations of species and functional traits can occur at different scales, but little is known on this topic, especially for soil arthropods with limited dispersion capabilities and highly dependent on environmental characteristics. The present research aims at shedding light on the spatial ecology of both the taxonomic and functional biodiversity of collembolan communities colonizing urban parks, adopted as model taxa for their functional traits, diversity and sensitivity to environmental drivers. To this end, the spatial patterns and scales of collembolan communities from 8 parks in Naples (Italy) and 14 in Montpellier (France) were investigated through an approach based on Moran eigenvector maps, modified to allow for evaluating the community spatial connectivity and the scales underpinning the spatial variation of each species and functional trait. The obtained findings demonstrate a limited spatial connectivity of collembolan communities in terms of both taxonomic and functional diversity, with mostly species-specific micro-scale variations that may be shaped by environmental constraints.

AB  - As cities overgrow, the need for ecological restoration is becoming increasingly urgent, especially in densely populated areas. Urban ecological restoration represents the best approach to undertake damages to restore native ecosystem remnants fulfilling biodiversity but also social goals in dense urban settings such as Mexico City. The feasibility of restoring unique xerophytic scrub vegetation in lava field remnants was evaluated in a portion of a university campus in Mexico City. Here we present an index (Need and Feasibility of Restoration Index, NFRI) for such purpose. The NFRI was designed through multicriteria analysis and considered ecological, economic, and social indicators. Cluster and principal components analysis were carried out to identify different groups of lava field remnants with similar characteristics and to point out critical variables that in turn would support management strategies. The outcomes made evident the necessity of restoring native vegetation for all of the evaluated remnants; however, the group containing the largest ones obtained the highest values for restoration feasibility and NFRI. The recovery of the rest of the remnants is critical to support the ecological restoration of the area as this may provide connectivity with better-preserved ecosystem remnants. When the restoration is unaffordable due to financial constraints, it is highly recommended to direct efforts towards ecological rehabilitation actions. The establishment of native xerophytic gardens is promoted when remnants cannot support a self-sustainable plant community. It is crucial to include the diversity of views and values of the community and the economic and ecological aspects to guarantee the sustainability of the landscape, especially in the urban context. The latter can provide better planning and design processes, ensuring benefits for humans and nature.

AB  - This research aims at integrating ecological networks modelling in a participatory approach in order to assess impacts of land-use planning scenarios on landscape connectivity. This approach was applied to the metropolitan area of Bordeaux, a highly dynamic territory that has been modified by several decades of rapid urbanization. Whilst ecological network modelling is widely used in the academic spheres, the concept of ecological network itself also rose within operational stakeholders acting in land-use planning. However, exchanges between scientists and stakeholders about this concept and its modelling and decision-making applications remain rare and generally relate to discussions about results of analyzes carried out by scientists on their own. To our knowledge, no studies to date have involved stakeholders throughout the whole modelling process. In this purpose, we developed an adapted companion modelling approach bringing together scientists and stakeholders for co constructing (1) a multi-species approach based on ecoprofiles, (2) a conceptual model of the territory's social-ecological functioning and (3) five land-use planning scenarios over a 15-years horizon. In parallel, we used a landscape graphs approach for modelling ecological networks of ecoprofiles, computing local and global connectivity metrics and estimating scenarios' impacts on multi-species connectivity. The results globally showed negative impacts of dystopian scenarios or anticipated trends in planning on landscape connectivity (from-20.5% to-8.1% on average, respectively), and in a lesser extent positive impacts of utopian or trans formative scenarios (+1.5% and 4.5% on average, respectively). Scenarios' impacts also varied among ecoprofiles, with some ecoprofiles showing similar or antagonistic effects. These results served as a support of debates between stakeholders on the consequences of policy decisions and actions on connectivity, and on the possibilities of translating connectivity modelling in land-use planning and biodiversity conservation in an urban context.

AB  - Aim: To predict the distribution of suitable habitats for Malayan gaur (Bos gaurus) at a highly fragmented forest area in Peninsular Malaysia and to identify the potential connectivity between suitable habitat patches.
   Methodology: Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitats of the Malayan gaur. Gaur presence-only data and six environmental variables were collated for the habitat suitability modeling, and area under curve (AUC) value was used to estimate the performance of the model. The resulting model was then used to derive a potential connectivity map through least-cost analysis using Corridor Designer toolbox in ArcGIS 10.4.
   Results: The AUC value of the habitat suitability model was 0.84. Distance from urban areas indicated the highest relative contribution to the model (26.9%), followed by distance from water body (24.2%) land use (18.0%) elevation (14.3%), slope (14.0%) and lithology (2.6%). Predicted suitable habitats for gaur were found mostly in lowland forest areas, especially in the vicinity of rivers within forest reserves. A total of five wildland blocks were derived from the habitat suitability model, and several potential corridor swaths were identified connecting the wildland blocks.
   Interpretation: The absence of gaur occurrence in suitable habitats suggest that fragmented habitats greatly affected gaur distribution and population. Road network and agricultural lands are the major barriers of gaur movement as they are very sensitive towards disturbances and conflict. Thus, this research proposes potential connectivity at a regional scale for Malayan gaur for use in future planning in conservation, management and development.

AB  - This study investigates how a city's innovation capacity could be influenced by its polycentric urban structure. Drawing upon a panel data set containing 267 Chinese cities at the prefecture level and above from 2006 to 2016, and using an instrumental variables approach, we reveal a significant and negative causal relationship between polycentricity and a city's innovation capacity. We further discuss the mechanisms of agglomeration economies, socioeconomic diversity and firm location choice that drive the innovation impact of polycentricity. The paper highlights the need to rethink and re-evaluate the current movement of 'planned polycentrism' in the Chinese context.

AB  - Ticks of small mammals pose a significant risk to public health but these hazards are poorly understood in the tropics due to the paucity of information on the disease ecology of ticks in these regions. Mapping and quan-tifying the diversity of small mammal/tick networks and the effects of habitat on these medically important systems is key to disease prevention. Singapore represents a microcosm of much of tropical Asia as it has a diverse, though poorly studied, community of ticks and small mammals. Singapore also has a range of terrestrial habitats exhibiting a gradient of degradation. Small mammals and their ticks were sampled across the island in four main habitat types (old secondary forest, young secondary forest, scrubland, urban) across 4.5 years. Four tick species were collected (Amblyomma helvolum, Dermacentor auratus, Haemaphysalis semermis, Ixodes gran-ulatus) from 10 small mammal species. Habitat was found to have a significant effect on both the abundance and structure of tick communities on small mammals. Old secondary forest communities had the highest tick abundance, comparatively high connectance, niche overlap (among ticks), linkage density, and were the preferred habitat of the zoonotic tick I. granulatus. Therefore, future disease spillover is likely to emerge from small mammal-tick communities in old secondary forests.

AB  - Urban diffuse pollution affects water resources as much as its rural counterpart does; however, it is considerably less studied. The full complexity of the urban landscape needs to be addressed to apprehend the diversity of surface layouts and covers, multiple pollution sources, and the diverse changes caused by different types of drainage systems. In this article, crucial patterns of pollution source areas are categorized, and current knowledge on their temporal and spatial variations are collated. Urban alterations of transport processes that enhance, delay, or inhibit diffuse pollution transport from source areas through the urban watershed are detailed. Current knowledge regarding diffuse pollution patterns and processes is conceptually merged by the simultaneous assessment of urban structural and functional connectivity relevant for pollutant transfer. Applying a more holistic approach is considered a prerequisite for identifying critical source areas of diffuse pollution within complex urban catchments, to minimize the transfer of particular harmful pollutants and to enhance future management of urban waters.

AB  - Integrated regional planning aims to achieve sustainable development by considering multiple socio-economic, environmental, and ecological goals. However, determining the synergies and trade-offs between sustainability goals is a challenging task that requires an in depth analysis of the system-level effects of the implementation of planning policies. For example, polycentricity (i.e. multiple urban centres) is a common regional urban planning goal, which has shown to be beneficial for a region's socio-economic conditions, but may also change the configuration of the settlement network (i.e. settlements connected by roads and traffic). Given the dependency of animal species on well-connected habitat networks, another possible planning goal is to maximise habitat availability (i.e. the total amount of habitat that is accessible for an individual animal). However, changes to a region's settlement network can have a variety of impacts on the region's habitat networks. Due to these interactions, it is unclear whether maximising polycentricity and habitat availability are compatible planning goals. To address this question, we developed a mathematical model of interacting settlement and habitat networks in a region of Switzerland. The settlement network model allowed us to predict commuter and traffic flows in our study region under a certain distribution of jobs and people across the municipalities. The level of polycentricity in our region was measured by calculating the hierarchy in the commuter flow network. The traffic flow network was linked to the habitat network, which was used to calculate the mean habitat availability. With multi-objective optimisations, both polycentricity and habitat availability were maximised by changing the distributions of jobs and people. Although both goals could be improved compared to the current situation, there was a trade-off between polycentricity and habitat availability along the Pareto front. Developing the region towards either of the planning goals could be achieved by changing the distribution of jobs and people mainly in mid-sized municipalities and by a strong collaboration between municipalities. Our results increase the understanding of the complex interactions in urban regions and can lead to recommendations for integrated urban and conservation planning.

AB  - Expansion of agricultural and urban areas and intensification of catchment land-use increasingly affect different facets of biodiversity in aquatic communities. However, understanding the responses of taxonomic and functional diversity to specific conversion from natural forest to agriculture and urban land-use remains limited, especially in subtropical streams where biomonitoring programs and using functional traits are still under development. Here, we conducted research in a subtropical stream network to examine the responses of macroinvertebrate taxonomic and functional diversity to different types of land-use in central China. Our results showed that medium body size, univoltine, gill respiration, and slow seasonal development were much higher in natural forest sites, while certain traits related to strong resilience and resistance (e.g., small body size, fast seasonal development, bi-or multivoltine, abundant occurrence in drift, sprawler) dominated in high-intensity agriculture and urbanization sites. We further found that land-use compromised water quality (e.g., increases in total phosphate, conductivity and water temperature) and habitat conditions (e.g., high proportion of sand and silt, gravel, and channel width) accounted for the changes in trait composition based on a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analysis. Moreover, natural forest sites presented relatively high values of functional richness than other land-use, demonstrating the importance of natural forest maintenance to promote high levels of functional diversity. However, taxonomic diversity indexes showed higher sensitivity to distinguish different types of land-use compared to functional diversity measures. Even so, given that certain trait categories showed significant relationships with specific local environmental stressors, trait-based approaches can provide reliable evidence to diagnose the cause of impairment and complement the results of the taxonomic-based approaches. Our findings support the idea that taxonomic and functional approaches should be integrated in river restoration and land-use management.

AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) maps are a key input in environmental evaluations for the sustainable planning and management of socio-ecological systems. While the impact of map spatial resolution on environmental assessments has been evaluated by several studies, the effect of thematic resolution (the level of detail of LU/LC typologies) is discordant and still poorly investigated. In this paper, four scenarios of thematic resolutions, corresponding to the four levels of the CORINE classification scheme, have been compared in a real case study of landscape connectivity assessment, a major aspect for the biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision. The PANDORA model has been employed to investigate the effects of LULC thematic resolution on Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity (BELC) at the scale of the whole system, landscape units, and single land cover patches, also in terms of ecosystem services. The results show different types of impacts on landscape connectivity due to the changed spatial pattern of the LULC classes across the four thematic resolution scenarios. Moreover, the main priority areas for conservation objectives and future sustainable urban expansion have been identified. Finally, several indications are given for supporting practitioners and researchers faced with thematic resolution issues in environmental assessment and land use planning.

AB  - The analysis of urban ecosystems is crucial for building resilience in cities and moving towards their sustainability. One of the fundamental components of these ecosystems is the urban forest. To determine the contributions and effects of trees in cities, a sample of the urban area of the city of Turrialba in central Costa Rica was analyzed using the model iTree Eco, which allows the main ecosystem services provided by trees in cities to be valued. Although in this study it was not possible to quantify all the ecosystem services included in the model, it was possible to analyze the elements and structural context of the study area, the value of carbon sequestration and storage, as well as the structural value of the trees. Annually, in the study area, with 18 tree species identified, more than 60 000 USD are generated from these three ecosystem services alone. Of the species identified, Zygia longifolia stood out for its greater abundance and leaf area, Erythrina poeppigiana in height and greater carbon storage, Mangifera indica in greater carbon sequestration and oxygen production, and Veitchia sp with the greatest structural value. Likewise, it was evident that maintaining the riverbanks of the Turrialba River and its tributaries, in its passage through the urban area of this city, provides the greatest amount of ecosystem services derived from the trees it keeps and where there is still a significant potential to include new plantations.

AB  - Exposure to biodiverse aerobiomes supports human health, but it is unclear which ecological factors influence exposure. Few studies have investigated near-surface green space aerobiome dynamics, and no studies have reported aerobiome vertical stratification in different urban green spaces. We used columnar sampling and next generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, combined with geospatial and network analyses to investigate urban green space aerobiome spatio-compositional dynamics. We show a strong effect of habitat on bacterial diversity and network complexity. We observed aerobiome vertical stratification and network complexity that was contingent on habitat type. Tree density, closer proximity, and canopy coverage associated with greater aerobiome alpha diversity. Grassland aerobiomes exhibited greater proportions of putative pathogens compared to scrub, and also stratified vertically. We provide novel insights into the urban ecosystem with potential importance for public health, whereby the possibility of differential aerobiome exposures appears to depend on habitat type and height in the airspace. This has important implications for managing urban landscapes for the regulation of aerobiome exposure.

AB  - It is increasingly common for developers to be asked to manage the impacts of their projects on biodiversity by restoring other degraded habitats that are ecologically equivalent to those that are impacted. These measures, called biodiversity offsets, generally aim to achieve 'no net loss' (NNL) of biodiversity. Using spatially-explicit modeling, different options were compared in terms of their performance in offsetting the impacts on wetlands of the planned urban expansion around Grenoble (France). Two implementation models for offsetting were tested: (a) the widespread bespoke permittee-led restoration project model, resulting in a patchwork of restored wetlands, and (b) recently-established aggregated and anticipated "banking" approaches whereby larger sets of adjacent parcels offset the impacts of several projects. Two ecological equivalence methods for sizing offsets were simulated: (a) the historically-prevalent area-based approach and (b) recently introduced approaches whereby offsets are sized to ensure NNL of wetland functions. Simulations showed that a mix of functional methods with minimum area requirements was more likely to achieve NNL of wetland area and function across the study area and within each subwatershed. Our methodology can be used to test the carrying capacity of a landscape to support urban expansion and its associated offsetting in order to formulate more sustainable development plans.

AB  - Urban forests provide many ecosystem services, such as reducing heat, improving air quality, treatment of stormwater, carbon sequestration, as well as biodiversity benefits. These benefits have resulted in increasing demand for urban forests and strategies to maintain and enhance this natural infrastructure. In response to a broader resilience strategy for Melbourne, Australia, we outline how a metropolitan-wide urban forest strategy (Living Melbourne) was developed, encompassing multiple jurisdictions and all land tenures. To this end, we mapped tree cover within the Melbourne metropolitan area, modelled potential habitat for some bird species, and investigated the role of tree cover for urban heat island mitigation. We outline the consultation and governance frameworks used to develop the strategy, the vision, goals and actions recommended, including canopy and shrub cover targets for different parts of the metropolitan area. The metropolitan-wide urban forest strategy acts as an overarching framework to guide local government authorities and various stakeholders towards a shared objective of increasing tree cover in Melbourne and we discuss the outcomes and lessons from this approach.

AB  - To reframe the imperfect review processes of nation-scale actions on area-based conservation through protected area (PA) networks, we first created novel infrastructure to visualize nation-level biodiversity information in Japan. We then assessed the performance of the existing PA network relative to land exploitation pressure and evaluated conservation effectiveness of PA expansion for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The Zonation software was used to spatially prioritize conservation areas to minimize biodiversity loss and the extinction risk for 8077 Japanese vascular plant and vertebrate species under constraints of the existing PA network and land use. The spatial pattern of the identified priority areas, which were considered candidate areas for expansion of the current PA network, was influenced by land-use types according to the mask layers of non-PAs, and low-, middle-, and high-ranked PAs. The current PA network reduced the aggregate extinction risk of multiple species by 36.6%. Indeed, the proportion of built-up areas in the existing PAs was generally smaller than that in the areas surrounding PAs. Notably, high-ranked PAs effectively restricted the built-up pressure (0.04% every 10 years), whereas low-ranked PAs in national park and wild-life protection areas did not (1.8% every 10 years). Conservation effects were predicted to substantially improve by expansion of high-ranked (legally strict) PAs into remote non-PAs without population/socioeconomic activities, or expansion of medium-ranked PAs into satoyama which have traditionally been used for agriculture and forestry, and urban areas. A 30% land conservation target was predicted to decrease extinction risk by 74.1% when PA expansion was implemented across remote areas, satoyama, and urban areas; moreover, PA connectivity almost doubled compared with the existing PA network. In contrast, a conventional scenario showed that placing national parks in state-owned and non-populated areas would reduce extinction risk by only 4.0%. Conservation prioritization analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of using a comprehensive conservation approach that reconciles land-sparing protection and land-sharing conservation in other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) in satoyama and urban green spaces. Our results revealed that complementary inclusion of various PA interventions related to their governance and land-use planning plays a critical role in effectively preventing biodiversity loss and makes it more feasible to achieve ambitious conservation targets.

AB  - Few studies have considered linkages of mobile predators across large spatial scales despite their significant and often critical role in maintaining ecosystem function and health. The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) is a large, widespread coastal predator capable of undertaking long-range movement, but there is still limited understanding of intra-regional differences in movement and habitat connectivity across latitudes within the same coastline. This study used acoustic telemetry data and network analyses to investigate long-range movements, residency patterns and seasonal habitat linkages of sub-adult and adult C. leucas along the east coast of Australia. Our results revealed that C. leucas tagged in Sydney Harbour were mainly present within this temperate estuary in summer and autumn; the rest of the year individuals were detected in tropical and subtropical habitats from southern and central Queensland. In contrast, the detection probability of C. leucas tagged in the Townsville Reefs (central Great Barrier Reef) peaked in spring, with a portion of the tagged population migrating south during the summer months. Differences in residency time between tagging locations were also detected, as all C. leucas tagged in Sydney Harbour were absent between June and November, but 35% of the tropical-reef tagged population remained resident year-round. Network analyses complemented these findings by revealing different seasonal habitat use between regions, thus highlighting complex seasonal-habitat linkages of C. leucas along the coast. Our findings support the hypothesis that the timing, duration, and drivers involved in the long-range movements and connectivity of sub-adult and adult C. leucas vary between latitudinal regions, most likely driven by the interaction between seasonal temperature changes, foraging and reproduction.

AB  - Urban transformation is an inevitable trend for mining cities to achieve sustainable development. Analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution laws and driving mechanisms of mining cities is necessary for providing a scientific basis for their transformation. In this study, Jixi was taken as an example, which is a typical mining city in China. Based on geographic information system, various mathematical statistical analysis methods were used to quantitatively analyze the evolution pattern of mining cities. In addition, the driving mechanisms of land expansion in mining cities were examined further. The results showed that (1) the urban land in the mining city is mainly distributed in low-lying areas, and land expansion mainly occurred in flat areas. (2) Based on the distribution of mineral resources, the land use pattern of mining cities was scattered; with steady economic development, the urban spatial pattern tends to be compact. (3) The spatial pattern of mining cities is affected by natural, economic, and policy factors. The results reveal the spatiotemporal evolution law and driving mechanism of the patterns in mining cities, thereby providing a scientific basis for the sustainable development planning and land management of mining cities.

AB  - The ongoing discussion on the nature of the organization of Early Bronze Age settlements and their social structure in an intensely settled part of the southern Levant (independent 'city-states' vs 'neither cities nor states') calls for data on which to base our understanding of shared economic patterns and regional connections. Here, we report the results of our macrobotanical investigation of the Early Bronze Age III (2,680-2,600 cal BCE) levels at Tell es-Safi/Gath, a large fortified settlement in central Canaan. A dense residential neighborhood was sampled at high resolution for a multi-faceted analysis of plant use in order to address its economic strategies and regional relationships. The resulting rich and diverse plant assemblage enables reconstruction of the diversity of agriculture, fuel sources, land use practices, mobility, and connectivity. Results of the study provide, for the first time, direct botanical evidence for the structural patterns of an intensive localized agro-pastoral economy and enable comparative analysis of the regional diet. Moreover, the results shed light on rare yet continuous long-distance plant dispersal and human mobility across biogeographical boundaries within the southern Levant.

AB  - The recent global urban expansion has seen a massive decline and loss in the connectivity of urban vegetation. In urban areas, some vegetation patches have increasingly become isolated and less connected by a matrix composed of impervious surfaces and transportation networks like roads. Vegetation fragmentation is a global threat to the remaining urban green spaces and has an impact on biodiversity conservation, environmental quality and urban microclimates. So far, a lot of work has been done on mapping and monitoring urban green spaces, some using conventional methods and of late using remotely sensed data. However, not much is known or well documented on the new developments in the remote sensing of vegetation fragmentation in urban areas over the last two decades. Thus, the objective of this research work is to present a detailed and comprehensive synthesis of the progress of remote sensing in assessing and monitoring landscape structure of urban green spaces and vegetation fragmentation. Specifically, scientific literature from the year 2000 to 2020 was reviewed to provide a state-of-the-art progress on the remote sensing of vegetation fragmentation in urban areas. Results indicate that between 2000 and 2020, there was a considerable increase in the number of scientific publications on vegetation fragmentation in urban landscapes. The discrete landscape pattern indices are the most widely used method. Comparatively, Land Remote Sensing Satellite System (Landsat) data was widely used due to its suitable spatial and temporal resolution, free availability and the presence of historical archival data that spans over a period of 40 years. The most commonly used scale was local (a city and/or municipality) followed by regional (more than one municipality in one continent) and then global (several selected cities and urban areas across continents). Only two studies were conducted at the global level. Further, geographic bias was observed in most of the accessed vegetation fragmentation studies. The review showed that vegetation fragmentation studies were done mostly for cities in China, North America and Europe while cities in most parts of Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Oceania and South America have not been comprehensively studied. The study also showed that the majority of cities across the globe have experienced severe vegetation fragmentation over the years. This review underscores the relevance of scientific findings in urban and spatial planning to minimize the loss of urban green spaces and to conserve and restore affected areas.

AB  - In order to improve the urban ecological environment and human settlement environment. and enhance the effect of urban landscape planning, in this paper, an urban landscape planning resoui-ce evaluation and optimization method based on the theory of compound ecosystem is proposed. This method comprehensively considers environmental, social, and economic benefits, and selects urban landscape as the evaluation sample, and then an urban landscape planning resource evaluation index system was built. The analytic hierarchy process is used to establish a judgment matrix and obtain weights, and a multi-objective linear weighting function method is used to construct an evaluation model to evaluate the resources of urban landscape planning. Finally, combined with the theory of compound ecosystems, a landscape planning optimization method is given from three aspects: ecological network construction, diversified space construction and sustainable development. The results show that the effect of urban waterfront reconstruction using this evaluation method is good. It can accurately assess the landscape level of each survey point in the study area, optimize control of urban pollution sources, treat polluted garbage, increase vegetation, and improve the diversity of the urban ecological environment and realize the optimization of urban landscape planning.

AB  - In this study, the Songgang River (SR) was selected as a typical contaminated urban river in a highly urbanized city (Shenzhen) that is extensively polluted by heavy metals (HMs). Five representative sampling sites were selected from different urban functional areas along the SR, and the spatial and vertical distributions of HMs and the related environmental risk were investigated. In addition, the distribution variability, composition, and abundance of microbial communities, as well as the correlation between the abundance of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the HM contents were analyzed. The spatial distribution of HMs in the sediment revealed wide variation among the different urban functional areas. Industrial and residential areas had higher HM contents, following the order of Cu > Zn > Ni > Cr > Pb. In addition, the vertical characterization (5-300 cm) of HM content showed a decreasing trend with depth, with a distinct layer around 120-180 cm that might have been caused by anthropogenic activity. An ecological risk assessment indicated that Cu, Ni, and Cr pose high potential risks in these industrial and residential areas (at the depth of 5-180 cm). Furthermore, microbial community analysis indicated that some HM-tolerant bacteria (e.g., Gallionella, Acidovorax, Arenimonas, Curvibacter, and Sideroxydans) were dominant in the 5-120 cm layer, corresponding to high HM contents. A canonical correspondence analysis and co-occurrence network further confirmed that there was a strong correlation among the urban functional areas, HM contents, and the abundance of microorganisms in the urban river sediment. The results of this study have the potential to provide a bio-augmentation strategy for the in-situ bioremediation of sediment contaminated by HMs.

AB  - This study aimed to use the applications of Ensemble Species Distribution Modelling (eSDM), Geographical Information Systems (GISs), and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for the design of a protected area (PA) for the critically endangered yellow-spotted mountain newt, Neurergus derjugini, by tracking and excluding the effects of climate and landscape changes in western Iran and northeastern Iraq. Potential recent and future distributions (2050 and 2070) were reconstructed by eSDM using eight algorithms with MRI-CGCM3 and CCSM4 models. The GIS-based MCDA siting procedure was followed inside habitats with high eSDM suitability by eliminating the main roads, cities, high village density, dams, poor vegetation, low stream density, agricultural lands and high ridge density. Then, within the remaining relevant areas, 10 polygons were created as "nominations" for PAs (NPAs). Finally, for 10 different NPAs, the suitability score was ranked based on ratings and weights (analytical hierarchy process) of the number of newt localities, NPA connectivity, NPA shape, NPA habitat suitability in 2070, NPA size, genetic diversity, village density and distance to nearest PAs, cities, and main roads. This research could serve as a modern realistic approach for environmental management to plan conservation areas using a cost-effective and affordable technique.

AB  - Wetlands are among the most vulnerable ecosystems, stressed by habitat loss and degradation from expanding and intensifying agricultural and urban areas. Climate change will exacerbate the impacts of habitat loss by altering temperature and rainfall patterns. Wetlands within Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchment are not different, stressed by extensive cropping, urban expansion, and alteration for grazing. Understanding how stressors affect wildlife is essential for the effective management of biodiversity values and minimizing unintended consequences when trading off the multiple values wetlands support. Impact assessment is difficult, often relying on an aggregation of ad hoc observations that are spatially biased toward easily accessible areas, rather than systematic and randomized surveys. Using a large aggregate database of ad hoc observations, this study aimed to examine the influence of urban proximity on machine-learning models predicting taxonomic richness and assemblage turnover, relative to other habitat, landscape, and climate variables, for vertebrates dwelling in the wetlands of the GBR catchment. The distance from the nearest city was, by substantial margins, the most influential factor in predicting the richness and assemblage turnover of all vertebrate groups, except fish. Richness and assemblage turnover was predicted to be greatest nearest the main urban centers. The extent of various wetland habitats was highly influential in predicting the richness of all groups, while climate (predominately the rainfall in the wettest quarter) was highly influential in predicting assemblage turnover for all groups. Bias of survey records toward urban centers strongly influenced our ability to model wetland-affiliated vertebrates and may obscure our understanding of how vertebrates respond to habitat loss and climate change. This reinforces the need for randomized and systematic surveys to supplement existing ad hoc surveys. We urge modelers in other jurisdictions to better portray the potential influence of survey biases when modeling species distributions.

AB  - Color is an important element to consider when shaping urban characteristics. However, previous studies seldom included quantitative analyses of color relationships between urban agglomerations within proximal regions and with similar cultures to distinguish and shape individual urban personalities. This study focused on Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou metropolitan areas, which are influenced by Minnan culture, and collected natural and cultural landscape network images that collectively represent the urban landscape in China. Color extraction, computer vision processing technologies, and clustering algorithms, such as k-means partitioning, hierarchical methods, and co-occurrence frequency, were applied using image recognition. We then established an urban color database and quantified color attributes. Finally, we conducted a comparative analysis of dominant colors and color combination associations in Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou metropolitan areas to explore their similarities and differences and define their characteristics. We also considered other cities of the same type for comparison. (C) 2021 Higher Education Press Limited Company. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications Co. Ltd.

AB  - Costa Rica is recognized worldwide for its nature conservation policy following the traditional land-sparing approach. However, concerns have been raised about the opposite trends of the agricultural land cover changes driven by the option to expand old and new export crops after the country's external debt crisis of the 1980s. We study what happened during the last 20 years by applying landscape ecology metrics to the REDD+ land cover maps of 1986, 2001, and 2014, and statistically testing these indicators with the locations of species richness of plants and birds recorded by INBio. Our results confirm that deforestation has been reversed and most of the biodiversity considered is housed in forestland, but also that the expansion of export monocultures and urban sprawl have fragmented and isolated these tropical forests. Ecological connectivity values decreased 13% across the territory, all crops are negatively correlated with bird and plant locations, and the metropolitan expansion caused a detrimental impact on coffee agroforestry. All these outcomes are consistent with the growing deficit of the Costa Rican physical trade balance due to a faster increase of tropical exports than the growing imports of staple food, with a loss of soil organic matter filled by high doses of agrochemicals imported. Overcoming these environmental problems require a new land-sharing approach to nature conservation aimed at improving ecological connectivity through an agroecology approach combined with land-use planning to preserve the remaining green belt of the shade coffee plantations as a buffer green infrastructure in the metropolitan area.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity can shape genetic structure and functional connectivity of populations. When this heterogeneity imposes variable costs of moving across the landscape, populations can be structured according to a pattern of "isolation by resistance" (IBR). At the same time, divergent local environmental filters can limit gene flow, creating an alternative pattern of "isolation by environment" (IBE). Here, we evaluate IBR and IBE in the insect-pollinated, biennial plant Sabatia angularis (L.) Pursh (Gentianaceae) across serpentine grasslands in the fragmented landscape of SE Pennsylvania, USA using similar to 4500 neutral SNP loci. Specifically, we test the extent to which radical alteration of the landscape matrix by humans has fundamentally altered the cost of movement, imprinting a pattern of IBR dictated by land use type and intensity, and the potential for IBE in relation to a gradient of heavy metal concentrations found in serpentine soil. We reveal a strong signal of IBR and a weak signal of IBE across sites, indicating the greater importance of the landscape matrix in shaping genetic structure of S. angularis populations in the study region. Based on Circuitscape and least cost path approaches, we find that both low- and high-intensity urbanization resist gene flow by orders of magnitude greater than "natural" habitats, although resistance to low-intensity urbanization weakens at larger spatial scales. While cropland presents a substantially lower barrier than urban development, cumulative human land use surrounding populations predicts within-population genetic diversity and inbreeding in S. angularis. Our results emphasize the role of forest buffers and corridors in facilitating gene flow between serpentine grassland patches and averting local extinction of plant populations.

AB  - Background Disentangling the relative roles of environmental filtering and spatial processes in structuring ecological communities is a central topic in metacommunity ecology. Metacommunity ecology in the temperate river ecosystems has been well developed, while less attention has been paid to subtropical urban river networks. Here, we examined the ecological factors and seasonal difference in structuring macroinvertebrates metacommunity assembly in the subtropical urban river networks in Shenzhen, South China. Results Our results revealed that there was no significant distinction of macroinvertebrate community composition among seasons, with only the relative abundance of Mollusca and Odonata significantly differed in both wet and dry seasons. One possible explanation was that most macroinvertebrates are generally pollution-tolerant taxa characterized with nonseasonal life cycle. In addition, distance-based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning approach revealed that metacommunity was determined equally by the environmental and dispersal-related factors. Further, our results showed that, although a slight temporal variation of relative contribution, the identity and explanation power of ecological factors were different among seasons. Specifically, stronger environmental filtering structuring community dynamics was observed in the dry than wet seasons, which might be owing to higher environmental heterogeneity under a low water-flow condition. Moreover, we detected that the influence of spatial processes was stronger in the wet than dry seasons, indicating an obvious dispersal processes due to high connectivity among sites. Conclusion Overall, our results revealed that environmental and spatial factors equally explained variations of macroinvertebrate metacommunity, implying the necessity of considering dispersal-related processes structuring ecological communities in river bioassessment programs. Moreover, degraded habitat conditions and water quality were the predominant factors that affected macroinvertebrate communities, indicating the significance and feasibility of improving local abiotic conditions to sustain local biodiversity. Further, our findings revealed the importance of seasonal dynamics of these urban river networks in structuring macroinvertebrate metacommunity. Thereby, our study improves the understanding of ecological processes governing macroinvertebrate metacommunity and underlines the idea that community ecology studies should go beyond the single snapshot survey in river networks.

AB  - Public spaces are key elements in making a just city. These spaces are important due to the potential roles they can have in the individual and social life of the citizens, and as a result, by redefining them, we can take a big step toward more just cities. In this study, by an extensive literature review on the right to the city discourse, we designed a conceptual model that includes components and variables that affect the construction of a just city. In order to refine this model, according to 15 experts with research experience on the right to the city and public spaces, we used the Fuzzy-Delphi technique. The DEMATEL method has also been used to understand how the main components of the conceptual model interact with each other. Our findings show that the movement toward just cities through public space requires an increase in democracy, equity, participation, diversity and appropriation, and among the mentioned components, diversity has the highest impact, while appropriation is of the lowest impact.

AB  - Revealing patterns of genetic diversity and barriers for gene flow are key points for successful conservation in endangered species. Methods based on molecular markers are also often used to delineate conservation units such as evolutionary significant units and management units. Here we combine phylo-geographic analyses (based on mtDNA) with population and landscape genetic analyses (based on microsatellites) for the endangered yellow-bellied toad Bombina variegata over a wide distribution range in Germany. Our analyses show that two genetic clusters are present in the study area, a northern and a southern/central one, but that these clusters are not deeply divergent. The genetic data suggest high fragmentation among toad occurrences and consequently low genetic diversity. Genetic diversity and genetic connectivity showed a negative relationship with road densities and urban areas surrounding toad occurrences, indicating that these landscape features act as barriers to gene flow. To preserve a maximum of genetic diversity, we recommend considering both genetic clusters as management units, and to increase gene flow among toad occurrences with the aim of restoring and protecting functional meta-populations within each of the clusters. Several isolated populations with especially low genetic diversity and signs of inbreeding need particular short-term conservation attention to avoid extinction. We also recommend to allow natural gene flow between both clusters but not to use individuals from one cluster for translocation or reintroduction into the other. Our results underscore the utility of molecular tools for species conservation, highlight outcomes of habitat fragmentation onto the genetic structure of an endangered amphibian and reveal particularly threatened populations in need for urgent conservation efforts.

AB  - To explore response of plant diversity of urban remnant mountains (URMs) to its surrounding urban spatial morphological (USM), nine URMs embedded in the built-up area of Guiyang City were selected as the research objects by kernel density method. The total of 99 plant diversity survey plots were set up by the combination way of slope direction and slope position. Taking the edge line of the sample URMs as the datum, 16 buffer zones were set successively outward at step lengths of 100 m, with a total width of 1600 m. USM indices within each buffer zone were calculated by using spatial syntax and road density (RD). The relationship between USM indices and plant diversity of URMs were analyzed. The results shown that: (1) Plant diversity of URMs displayed a positive response to its surrounding USM indices, and the Connection ( Con), Integration (I) and RD had significant response to the plant species diversity; The response relationship between the plant species diversity and the USM indices mostly started from 400 m scale, and the significance was mainly at the 600 m scale. (2) The order from high to low of the response relationship in different plant community levels was tree, herb and shrub; the response to Con, I and RD was strong in tree, that of to RD was significant in shrub, and that of to I, Con and Control (Ctrl) was strong in herb. (3) The response strength in different slope position was the foot of mountain > mountainside > mountaintop; There was a weak and unstable correlation between plant diversity in different slope direction and RD in the corresponding direction. This research could provide some scientific reference for mountainous urban spatial planning and plant diversity protection of URMs.

AB  - The lack of information on biological aspects of small mammals in Brazil fits into two of the main gaps in knowledge of biodiversity - the Linnean and Wallacean shortfall. We performed a broad compilation of studies developed in the Parana state to consolidate the first list of non-volant small mammal species. Furthermore, we indicate which regions lack information and greater sampling efforts to understand the biological aspects of small mammals. We listed 50 species belonging to 30 genera, five families, and two orders, which represent 37% of marsupials and small rodent species occurring in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our results indicate that are regions in the Parana state, such as the southwest, without a single record of small mammals, reveling a Wallacean shortfall of approximately 138.584 km(2). Studies on the small-bodied mammal fauna in the state of Parana are influenced by accessibility bias, concentrated at sites less than 50 kilometers distant from cities, roads, or airports. New research will not only have the challenge of knowing the species richness in regions that are still poorly or hitherto no studied, but also evaluate the state and the population dynamics of the species that persist in densely anthropized areas.

AB  - Urban tourism is considered a complex system. Tourists who visit cities have diverse purposes, leading to multifaceted travel behaviors. Understanding travel movement patterns is crucial in developing sustainable planning for urban tourism. Built on network science, this article discusses 12 key topologies of travel patterns/flow occurring in a city network by applying network motif analytics. The 12 significant types of travel mobility can account for approximately 50% of the total movement patterns. In addition, this study presents variations in travel movement patterns depending on not only different lengths of stay in topological structures of travel mobility, but also relative proportions of each type. As a result, this article suggests an interdisciplinary approach that adopts the network science method to better understand city travel behaviors. Important methodological and practical implications that could be useful for city destination planners are suggested.

AB  - While a variety of anthropogenic impacts on lotic biodiversity have been documented, food-web responses to catchment development are poorly understood. We selected 27 stream food webs of comparable quality and conducted an analysis to assess the effect of catchment development on food-web structure. We quantified population densities, built-up area, and proximity to urban centres, and calculated a Settlement Index for each catchment using Principal Components Analysis. We also calculated the percentage of agricultural land cover in each catchment. Next, we assessed the correlations between the structural properties of food-webs (species richness, connectance, mean food-chain length, linkage density, trophic generality, and trophic vulnerability) and the Settlement Index as well as agricultural land cover. We found that linkage density, trophic vulnerability (number of consumers per species), and trophic generality (number of resources per species) were higher in streams with greater Settlement Index, indicating a reduction in specialisation. However, no clear trends were observed for species richness, connectance, and mean food-chain length. Agricultural land cover was also not related to food-web structure. We propose that the reduction in specialisation may be driven by species turnover and feeding plasticity, as biotic invasion or species impoverishment was not evident.

AB  - The relationship between walking, the contemplation of the landscape and the network of roads and livestock trails is argued by resorting to the origin of these roads, that is, trails designed to facilitate the movement of animals at the slow pace of herds and shepherds. Although the function of transhumance is currently residual, the livestock trails are being recovered and used by the competent administrations, with the aim of improving the articulation of the territory through which they pass, favoring biodiversity and landscape diversification in urban environments and, to a large extent, responding to the new citizen demands related to leisure, sports and recreational activities typical of today's society. This work makes a methodological proposal for these public itineraries from the intervention in the landscape, taking as a case study a livestock trail of the Metropolitan Green Corridor of Seville, the Cordel de Gambogaz, which runs between the capital of Seville and the town of Santiponce.

AB  - The article focuses on the relevant topic of the development of the ecosystem consisting integral landscape formations of biocentric-network type, which has been done in many countries of Europe since the 1990s. The article emphasizes certain achievements of independent Ukraine regarding the methodological developments of the concept of ecosystem, first of all at the national and regional levels and also the low level of its introduction at the local level. In the process of performing (based on studying foreign and domestic experiences) the scientific study of development and perspectives of the development of local ecosystem of a residential area as a basis for the regional ecosystem in the conditions of Yampil city of Vinnytsia Oblast, we determined its extremely high biotic and landscape diversities, and also the threats of its significant transformation. As an important step to prevent negative influence of agrarian activity of inhabitants of Yampil on the environment with restoration of diversity it is characteristic of, we considered the development of the city's ecosystem. The scientific substantiations made by applications of tools became the basis for the development of local ecosystem. In the developed scheme "Local ecosystem of Yampil city", we indicated the structural elements of the ecosystem, their localization, toponyms, made corresponding indications on the map and provided all its elements with descriptions. The key and connective territories of the local ecosystem of Yampil city are compartmentalized based on the adopted criteria of the selection. Their internal structures that we characterized in details allowed us to assess the special roles of the key and connective territories in the preservation of biodiversity, landscape basics of the formation and further development of Yampil city. The territories of the city which were not included in the local elements of the ecosystem are considered restorative and buffer territories within the local and regional ecological networks. The suggested scheme of the local econetwork is basic concerning the implementation of the following stages of the development of the ecosystem by composing schemes at the regional and general national levels and is the main condition for the balanced development of the Transnistria region. We obtained the results so as to preserve and effectively use the biotic and landscape diversities combined with non exhaustive use of natural resources, which is the main goal of contemporary nature use, ecological safety and nature protection. The recommendations were developed for the use of nature-protection and administrative bodies in decision making and any kind (land use, nature protection, ecological, etc) of studies.

AB  - One million species are threatened with extinction globally, including more than half of the native bee species in North America. In Canada, as of July 2020, 42 municipalities have signed a resolution to commit to the standards of the Bee City Canada program which includes creating and enhancing pollinator habitat, along with celebrating and raising awareness about pollinators in their communities. Our central argument is that the commodification of pollination has detrimental effects on people, pollinators, and ecosystems, and that a diverse economies framework is one conceptual model that can help shift our perspective. Within the 'save the bees' narrative, a capitalocentric, unidimensional image of pollination persists, driven by particular forms of market power and domination. Well-intentioned individuals and groups may be constrained by industryd-ominated messaging that limits their understanding of appropriate interventions. Meanwhile, Bee City Canada offers municipalities the opportunity to engage in conservation efforts by starting where they are and building on a network of Bee Cities across the country. We conducted a collective case study involving in-depth interviews with members of Ontario Bee Cities. Our thematic interpretive analysis shows how a diverse economies framework can help us to understand the value and contributions of this initiative in previously undervalued and under-recognized ways and how they help to advance a whole-of-community approach. It is only through decentering the hegemonic market-based view of pollination that true conservation of bee diversity, and associated pollination services, can be prioritized. Our findings show that Bee Cities can animate a vibrant political ecology through a collective municipal identity, by centering bees (and other pollinators by proxy).

AB  - Rapid urbanization has resulted in pervasive occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in urban aquatic ecosystems. However, limited information is available concerning the ARG profiles and the forces responsible for their assembly in urban landscape lagoon systems. Here, we employed high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) to characterize the spatial variations of ARGs in surface and core sediments of Yundang Lagoon, China. The results indicated that the average richness and absolute abundance of ARGs were 11 and 53 times higher in the lagoon sediments as compared to pristine reference Tibetan lake sediments, highlighting the role of anthropogenic activities in ARG pollution. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated that various anaerobic prokaryotic genera belonging to Alpha, Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes and Synergistetes were the potential hosts of ARGs. The partial least squares-path modeling (PLS-PM) analysis revealed positive and negative indirect effects of physicochemical factors and heavy metals on the lagoon ARG profiles, via biotic factors, respectively. The horizontal (mediated by mobile genetic elements) and vertical (mediated by prokaryotic communities) gene transfer may directly contribute the most to drive the abundance and composition of ARGs, respectively. Furthermore, the neutral community model demonstrated that the assembly of sediment ARG communities was jointly governed by deterministic and stochastic processes. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the diversity and distribution of ARGs in the benthic habitat of urban lagoon systems and underlying mechanisms for the spread and proliferation of ARGs.

AB  - Despite its importance as a component of urban green spaces, as far as we are aware no study has focused on plant diversity in urban green corridors (GCs). Therefore, this study aimed at: (i) characterizing tree and shrub communities in Lisbon's GCs and (ii) assessing whether GCs' users value trees and shrubs. We counted Lisbon's GCs users in the same places where we assessed the tree and shrub community. Along the nine GCs, we observed trees and shrubs belonging to 70 species, distributed across 35 families with most (>= 50%) species and plants being trees, exotic, pollinated by insects, with fruit dispersion by animals, evergreen leaves, and producing dry fruits. Most GCs had a similar number of users (20-30 users h(-1) survey(-1)) except for those of Central and Ribeirinho, which were more frequented (60 and 100 users h(-1) survey(-1), respectively). Most users (>= 50%) were adults, walking accompanied, and performing leisure activities. Finally, the number of users was shown to be influenced by: (i) tree and shrub relative abundance, confirming that users preferred greener corridors; and (ii) function(s), showing that users preferred the most multifunctional GCs (i.e., GCs fulfilling ecological, cultural, and recreational functions). Our data suggest that Lisbon's GCs favor more the inclusion of citizens than ecological functionality and resilience.

AB  - In recent decades, the biodiversity of freshwater environments has decreased sharply due to anthropogenic disturbances that damaged ecosystem structures and functions. Habitat restoration has emerged as an important method to mitigate the degradation of river ecosystems. Although in many cases a post-project monitoring has been promoted to access the restoration progress, it is still unclear how aquatic community changes following river habitat restoration in China. Macroinvertebrate communities intermediately positioned within ecosystem food webs play a key role in ecosystem processes within river ecosystem, driving energy flow and nutrient cycling. Here, benthic macroinvertebrates are used as bio-indicators to assess the ecosystem health of degraded urban rivers, restored urban rivers, and undisturbed rivers. This study aims to determine (i) how habitat restoration influences macroinvertebrates diversity and how this compared to degraded and reference conditions; (ii) how did macroinvertebrate community compositions differ in restored, degraded, and reference sites; and (iii) the environmental factors shaping macroinvertebrate communities. Habitat restoration significantly increased the diversity and richness of macroinvertebrate community and intolerant species and shifted the community composition towards reference status. Habitat characteristics and water chemistry, including substrate diversity, water velocity, and both nutrients (TN) and organic pollutants (TOC), appeared to shape the turnover of these communities. Habitat characteristics contributed to most of the variation of the entire macroinvertebrate community. Our research indicates that habitat restoration is an efficient approach to restore the aquatic community and hence improve river ecosystem health for freshwater conservation and sustainable management in Zhejiang province. This study strengthens our understanding of the changes of macroinvertebrate community after habitat restoration and important controlling variables that attribute to these changes, which provides an important guidance for future freshwater management.

AB  - The increase in artificial light at night (ALAN) is widely considered as a major driver for the worldwide decline of nocturnal pollinators such as moths. However, the relationship between light and trees as 'islands of shade' within urban areas has not yet been fully understood. Here, we studied (1) the effects of three landscape vari-ables, i.e. sources of ALAN (mercury vapour/LED street lamps; overall light pollution), impervious surfaces (e.g. roads, parking lots and buildings), and tree cover on species richness and abundance of two major macro-moth families (Noctuidae and Geometridae) and (2) the potential mitigating effect of trees on macro-moths attracted to ALAN. We undertook a landscape-scale study on 22 open green areas along an urban-rural gradient within Berlin, Germany, using light traps to collect moths. Macro-moths were identified to species level and GLMMs applied with the three landscape variables at different scales (100 m, 500 m and 1000 m). We found a significant negative effect of mercury vapour street lamps on macro-moth species richness, while impervious surfaces showed significant negative effects on abundance (total and Geometridae). We further found significant positive effects of tree cover density on species richness and abundance (total and Geometridae). Effects of tree cover, however, were mostly driven by one site. LED lamps showed no predictive effects. A negative effect of ALAN (MV lamps and overall light) on macro-moths was most prominent in areas with low tree coverage, indi-cating a mitigating effect of trees on ALAN. We conclude that mercury vapour street lamps should be replaced by ecologically more neutral ALAN, and that in lit and open areas trees could be planted to mitigate the negative effect of ALAN on nocturnal pollinators. In addition, sources of ALAN should be carefully managed, using movement detection technology and other means to ensure that light is only produced when necessary.

AB  - The physical structure of the cities is in constant evolution, increasingly fluid and open to transformations, with the urban nuclei being prepared to respond and organize the pressures they suffer from the very production of space. Regarding the temporal dimension, the ephemeral takes importance on how we should use in a temporal way an alternative to achieve the urban transitions, without being stuck to only one solution. The study presents itself as a discussion of the theme of tactical urbanistic action as an intermediary element between the right to the city and the kinetic city. Through a qualitative approach, with an exploratory character, it builds a thought about the changes that occur in cities over time, the transformation power that individuals have in planning and creating it, bringing to reflection the reaffirmation of the right to the city. It is concluded that the transformations on the urban reflect the city as kinetic, in constant change and movement, highlighting the role of tactical urbanism. Endowed with a "local" logic, tactical or ephemeral urbanism responds to the needs of citizens linked to where they live, dynamizing the concepts of the right to the city, and tries to approximate the transformation of urban space with ephemeral interventions.

AB  - Human modification of natural landscapes is a key threatening process contributing to the decline of global biodiversity. Amphibians are particularly vulnerable to this threat, with over a third of species threatened as a direct result. However, some habitat modifications may be less detrimental than others, with some species known to successfully thrive in certain artificial habitats while others undergo further declines. Yet, recognizing how amphibians respond to different habitat modifications remains limited, particularly on a global scale. Herein, we examine the known artificial habitat associations of amphibian species globally, demonstrating artificial habitat use is dependent on their conservation status, life history, taxonomic order, and geographical location. Approximately one-third of all amphibians were found to use artificial habitats, including nearly half of all nonthreatened and one-sixth of threatened species, with usage decreasing as conservation status increased. Terrestrial, generalist, and caecilian species were much more likely to use artificial habitats. Non-threatened species were more likely to utilize artificial habitats such as aquaculture ponds, pastureland, canals, excavations, urban areas, and rural gardens. Plantations, heavily degraded former forests, and wastewater treatment areas contained a greater proportion of threatened species, particularly in Afrotropical, Indomalayan, and Oceanian regions. Countries with the most amphibians utilizing artificial habitats were Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Madagascar, and Ecuador. However, the greatest number of threatened species using artificial habitats were found in Mexico, Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, and China. We highlight the potential value or threat of each artificial habitat type, which may be used to better focus valuable conservation efforts.

AB  - Industrialization and urbanization have led to continuous urban development. The rapid change in land-use type and extent has a significant impact on the capacity of ecosystem services. Changes in the landscape pattern of roads, rivers, railway stations, and expressway entrances and exits have evident geographical proximity effects. We used landscape pattern indices and ecosystem service value (ESV) to evaluate the landscape pattern and ESV spatial differentiation of the Pearl River Delta region and its typical transportation infrastructure and rivers in 1990, 2000, and 2017. The results show that rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to changes in urban land use along the Pearl River Estuary. Urban land changes on the east bank of the Pearl River are greater than urban land changes on the west bank of the Pearl River; the landscape diversity of the Pearl River Delta has increased, the connectivity of the landscape has decreased, and the degree of fragmentation has increased. Second, the city size of the Pearl River Delta was negatively correlated with the ESVs. The ESVs in the core areas of the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration were smaller than those in the fringe areas. With the gradient change in urban land use, ESVs showed a growing trend from the city center to the surrounding areas. The key areas for ecological protection and restoration should be central urban areas and suburbs. Third, the siphoning effect of the buffer zones of railway stations and expressway entrances and exits was very strong and drove the development and utilization of the surrounding land. As the degree of land development in the buffer zone decreased, the ESVs increased. Fourth, different grades of roads in the Pearl River Delta had different impacts on the regional landscape and ESVs. County roads had a greater interference effect than expressways, national roads, and provincial roads, and the riverside plains of the Pearl River Delta have a large development space, low urban development costs, and multiple land-use activities that have profoundly changed the landscape of the river buffer zone.

AB  - Hundreds of cities across the globe are mobilising the convening power of food to deliver food security and sustainability outcomes supported by an increasing number of national and international city food networks devoted to scale-up and out this urban food revolution. This paper presents the first comparative analysis of this increasingly networked urban foodscape based on data from 13 national and international initiatives which together represent more than 500 cities across the globe. By applying a translocal governance framework, the paper explores the different aims, structures and mechanisms activated by this complex landscape of networks and how these intrinsic characteristics endow them with diverse strengths and limitations. To examine further the role of networks in rescaling the impact urban food policies, I analyse the metagovernance of these initiatives exploring discourses around coordination of these networks and identifying potential convergence points. Results from this study are translated into policy recommendations aimed at unfolding further the transformative capacity of translocal networks and elevate their role in unfolding a more integrated and equitable new urban food agenda; mainly by proposing to reinforce the cross-scalar alignment of food policies, making the case to invest in connective infrastructure such as network and backbone organisations, work with a wider diversity of agents, and provide open spaces that democratise access to collective knowledge and capacities. c. As urban food policies become the new norm, this research stresses the need for rescaling food system interventions that effectively deliver social and spatial justice in an increasingly polarised word.

AB  - Approximately 100 years ago, unregulated harvest nearly eliminated white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from eastern North America, which subsequently served to catalyze wildlife management as a national priority. An extensive stock-replenishment effort soon followed, with deer broadly translocated among states as a means of re-establishment. However, an unintended consequence was that natural patterns of gene flow became obscured and pretranslocation signatures of population structure were replaced. We applied cutting-edge molecular and biogeographic tools to disentangle genetic signatures of historical management from those reflecting spatially heterogeneous dispersal by evaluating 35,099 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived via reduced-representation genomic sequencing from 1143 deer sampled statewide in Arkansas. We then employed Simpson's diversity index to summarize ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub-sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of re-colonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a statewide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas is also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories.

AB  - All cities face complex challenges managing urban stormwater while also protecting urban water bodies. Green stormwater infrastructure and process-based restoration offer alternative strategies that prioritize watershed connectivity. We report on a new urban floodplain restoration technique being tested in the City of Seattle, USA: an engineered hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone has long been an overlooked component in floodplain restoration. Yet this subsurface area offers enormous potential for stormwater amelioration and is a critical component of healthy streams. From 2014 to 2017, we measured hyporheic temperature, nutrients, and microbial and invertebrate communities at three paired stream reaches with and without hyporheic restoration. At two of the three pairs, water temperature was significantly lower at the restored reach, while dissolved organic carbon and microbial metabolism were higher. Hyporheic invertebrate density and taxa richness were significantly higher across all three restored reaches. These are some of the first quantified responses of hyporheic biological communities to restoration. Our results complement earlier reports of enhanced hydrologic and chemical functioning of the engineered hyporheic zone. Together, this research demonstrates that incorporation of hyporheic design elements in floodplain restoration can enhance temperature moderation, habitat diversity, contaminant filtration, and the biological health of urban streams.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The expansion of urban areas in combination with climate change places great pressure on species found in freshwater habitats. Dragonflies are iconic freshwater organisms due to their large body sizes and striking coloration. They have been widely used to indicate the impacts of natural and human-mediated activities on freshwater communities, while also indicating the mitigation measures required to ensure their conservation. Here, we review the major threats to dragonflies in southern Africa, specifically those in urban areas. We also provide information on effective mitigation measures to protect dragonflies and other aquatic insects in urban spaces. Using three densely populated areas as case studies, we highlight some of the greatest challenges for dragonflies in South Africa. More importantly, we give a summary of current mitigation measures which have maintained dragonflies in urban spaces. In addition to these mitigation measures, public involvement and raising awareness contribute greatly to the common cause of protecting dragonflies around us.
   Urban settlements range from small villages in rural areas to large metropoles with densely packed infrastructures. Urbanization presents many challenges to the maintenance of freshwater quality and conservation of freshwater biota, especially in Africa. There are many opportunities as well, particularly by fostering contributions from citizen scientists. We review the relationships between dragonflies and urbanization in southern Africa. Shifts in dragonfly assemblages indicate environmental change, as different species are variously sensitive to abiotic and biotic water and bank conditions. They are also conservation umbrellas for many other co-occurring species. Major threats to southern African dragonflies include increasing infrastructure densification, frequent droughts, habitat loss, pollution, and invasive alien vegetation. Mitigation measures include implementation of conservation corridors, maintenance of healthy permanent ponds, pollution reduction, and removal of invasive alien trees. Citizen science is now an important approach for supplementing and supporting professional scientific research.

AB  - Rapid urbanization and drastic land-use change have led to landscape fragmentation and ecological environment deterioration in the regions along the Grand Canal. Building an ecological network is an important means to improve the connectivity of habitat patches and carry out ecological protection and restoration of territorial space, which is of great significance to ensure regional biodiversity and ecological security. In this article, we took the Huaiyang Section of the Grand Canal (Huaiyang Canal) as the study area, used the ecosystem service assessment model, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and the landscape connectivity evaluation method to identify ecological sources, then used the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and the gravity model to extract and grade ecological corridors. Based on these, the ecological network was constructed by combining the identification method of ecological nodes and ecological breakpoints. The aim of this was to provide a reference for the ecological space optimization of Huaiyang Canal and even the entire Grand Canal, the formulation of an ecological protection plan, and the implementation of territorial space ecological restoration. The results showed that the spatial distribution of the water conservation service, soil conservation service, carbon sequestration service, and biodiversity conservation service were significantly different, and the level of ecosystem services showed a trend of continuous degradation from 1990 to 2018. There were 12 ecological source patches comprehensively identified by multiple methods, with a total area of 2007.06 km(2). In terms of spatial distribution, large ecological source patches were mainly distributed in the central and western areas adjacent to the Grand Canal, while small ecological source patches were scattered in the eastern and southern border regions of the study area. The total length of ecological corridors was 373.84 km, of which the number of the primary ecological corridor, secondary ecological corridor, and tertiary ecological corridor were 9, 7, and 7, respectively, and the suitable width of the ecological corridor was 200-400 m. After optimization, the proposed ecological network was composed of 3 key ecological source patches, 9 important ecological source patches, 23 terrestrial corridors, 10 aquatic corridors, and 18 ecological nodes. Twenty-nine ecological breakpoints were key areas requiring ecological restoration. The overlap rate of the integrated ecosystem service change area and land-use change area was 99%, indicating that land-use change has a significant impact on regional ecosystem services. This study is of great significance for carrying out the ecological protection and restoration of the Huaiyang Canal and adjusting local land-use policies. It also provides a typical case demonstration for identifying an ecological network and formulating ecological restoration planning for other sections of the Grand Canal and cities along the canal.

AB  - Human land transformation is one of the leading causes of vertebrate population declines. These declines are thought to be partly due to decreased connectivity and habitat loss reducing animal population sizes in disturbed habitats. With time, this can lead to declines in effective population size and genetic diversity which restrict the ability of wildlife to efficiently cope with environmental change through genetic adaptation. However, it is not well understood whether these effects generally hold across taxa. We address this question by repurposing and synthesizing raw microsatellite data from online repositories for 19 amphibian species sampled at 554 georeferenced sites in North America. For each site, we estimated gene diversity, allelic richness, effective population size, and population differentiation. Using binary urban-rural census designations, and continuous measures of human population density, the Human Footprint Index, and impervious surface cover, we tested for generalizable effects of human land use on amphibian genetic diversity. We found minimal evidence, either positive or negative, for relationships between genetic metrics and urbanization. Together with previous work on focal species that also found varying effects of urbanization on genetic composition, it seems likely that the consequences of urbanization are not easily generalizable within or across amphibian species. Questions about the genetic consequences of urbanization for amphibians should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. This contrasts with general negative effects of urbanization in mammals and consistent, but species-specific, positive and negative effects in birds.

AB  - The effect of anthropogenic activity on animal communication is of increasing ecological concern. Passive acoustic recording offers a robust, minimally disruptive, long-term approach to monitoring species interactions, particularly because many indicator species of environmental health factors such as biodiversity, habitat quality, and pollution produce distinct vocalizations. Machine learning algorithms have been used in recent decades to automatically analyze the large quantities of audio data that result. In this study, a microphone array was used to collect continuous audio data at a site in the Capital Region of New York State for twelve months, resulting in over 8000 h of recordings. A 19-class database containing a variety of bio-and anthrophony was used to train a convolutional neural network in order to generate a reliable record of species-specific calling activity for the entire study period. These results were used to calculate an acoustics-based pseudo-species richness and abundance distribution. Additionally, heatmap plots were used to visualize (i) the time of day (x), sound category (y), and predicted number of sonic events for an average 30-day period and (ii) the day of the year (x), time of day (y), and predicted number of sonic events for each sound category. The correlations between these sonic events and various abiotic factors such as number of daylight hours, temperature, and weather activity were also examined.

AB  - The characteristics of information flow, as represented by the Baidu index, reflect the pattern of tourism flows between different cities. This paper is based on the Baidu index and applies the seasonal concentration index and social network analysis (SNA) methods to study the spatial structure characteristics of tourism flows in China. The results reveal that: (1) both the search volume of the Baidu index in different cities and the online attention to different scenic areas exhibit obvious spatial heterogeneity and seasonal differences; (2) regions with strong tourism flow connections mainly occur in the areas between metropolises or among the inner cities of urban agglomerations, which are largely distributed on the southeast side of the Heihe-Tengchong Line; (3) the development of the whole tourism flow network in China is low, with an unbalanced development between tourism supply and demand, indicating that tourism resources are concentrated in a few cities and that most of the information interaction among cities occurs in core areas, while a weak interaction is observed in peripheral areas; (4) cities like Beijing and Wuhan attain obvious advantages in regard to their tourism resources, whereas other cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, exhibit a high demand for tourism. Moreover, tourism information flow networks are concentrated in several cities with an important role in the Chinese urban system, such as Beijing, Wuhan, and Chengdu, because they contain abundant tourism resources, well-developed transportation systems and advanced economic and societal development levels. (5) Cities such as Beijing, Lhasa, Wuhan, and Zhengzhou possess numerous advantages due to structural holes, and they thus occur at an advantageous position in the tourism flow network.

AB  - The relationship among cities is getting closer, so are housing prices. Based on the sale price of stocking houses in thirty-five large and medium-sized cities in China from 2010 to 2021, this study established the modified gravity model and used the method of social network analysis to explore the spatial linkage of urban housing prices. The results show that: (1) from the overall network structure, the integration degree of housing price network in China is still at a low stage, and the influence of housing price is polarized; (2) from the individual network structure, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Hefei have a higher degree of centrality. Chengdu, Xining, Kunming, Urumqi, and Lanzhou stay in an isolation position every year; (3) from the results of cohesive subgroup analysis, different cities play different roles in the block each year and have different influences on other cities. (4) Emergencies, such as outbreaks of COVID-19, also have an impact on the housing price network. Structural divergence among urban housing prices has become more pronounced, and the diversity of house price network has been somewhat reduced. Based on the above findings, this paper puts forward some recommendations for the healthy development of housing market from the perspective of housing price network.

AB  - Among the most prevalent sources of biodiversity declines, Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) is an emerging threat to global biodiversity. Much knowledge has already been gained to reduce impacts. However, the spatial variation of ALAN effects on biodiversity in interaction with landscape composition remains little studied, though it is of the utmost importance to identify lightscapes most in need of action. Several studies have shown that, at local scale, tree cover can intensify positive or negative effects of ALAN on biodiversity, but none have - at landscape scale - studied a wider range of landscape compositions around lit sites. We hypothesized that the magnitude of ALAN effects will depend on landscape composition and species' tolerance to light. Taking the case of insectivorous bats because of their varying sensitivity to ALAN, we investigated the species-specific activity response to ALAN. Bat activity was recorded along a gradient of light radiance. We ensured a large variability in landscape composition around 253 sampling sites. Among the 13 bat taxa studied, radiance decreased the activity of two groups of the slow-flying gleaner guild (Myotis and Plecotus spp.) and one species of the aerialhawking guild (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), and increased the activity of two species of the aerial-hawking guild (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus pygmaeus). Among these five effects, the magnitude of four of them was driven by landscape composition. For five other species, ALAN effects were only detectable in particular landscape compositions, making the main effect of radiance undetectable without account for interactions with landscape. Specifically, effects were strongest in non-urban habitats, for both guilds. Results highlight the importance to prioritize ALAN reduction efforts in non-urban habitats, and how important is to account for landscape composition when studying ALAN effects on bats to avoid missing effects.

AB  - To date, the provision of ecosystem services has largely been estimated based on spatial patterns of land cover alone, using benefit transfer analysis. Although it is increasingly being recognised that the distribution of the human population affects whether a potential service translates into a realised service, this misses key steps in the process and assumes that everyone accesses ecosystem services in the same way. Here we describe a conceptual approach to ecosystem services in terms of movement and flows. We highlight that ecosystem service flows can be broken down into 'nature to people' (the movement of nature towards beneficiaries) and 'people to nature' (the movement of beneficiaries towards nature). The former has been relatively well described. Here, we explore the latter by reviewing research on human migration, animal foraging and landscape connectivity. We assess if and how existing theories might be useful in describing how people seek out ecosystem services. We consider some of the ways in which flows of people to nature can be measured. Such measurements may reveal which movement theories best represent how people seek out and access ecosystem services. Overall, our review aims to improve the future modelling of ecosystem services by more explicitly considering how people access potential services and therefore realise them.

AB  - This study develops a Geographic Data Science framework that transforms the Foursquare check-in locations and user origin-destination flows data into knowledge about the emerging forms and characteristics of cities' neighbourhoods. We employ a longitudinal mobility dataset describing human interactions with Foursquare venues in ten global cities: Chicago, Istanbul, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo. This social media data provides spatio-temporally referenced digital traces left by human use of urban environments, giving us access to the intangible aspects of urban life, such as people behaviours and preferences. Our framework capitalizes on these new data sources, bringing about a novel Geographic Data Science and human-centered methodological approach. Combining network science - a study area with great promise for the analysis of cities and their structure - with geospatial analysis methods, we model cities as a series of global urban networks. Through a spatially weighted community detection algorithm, we uncover functional neighbourhoods for the ten global cities. Each neighbourhood is linked to hyper-local characterisations of their built environment for the Foursquare venues that compose them, and complemented with a range of measures describing their diversity, morphology and mobility. This information is used in a clustering exercise that uncovers a set of four functional neighbourhood types. Our results enable the profiling and comparison of functional neighbourhoods, based on human dynamics and their contexts, across the sample of global cities. The framework is portable to other geographic contexts where interaction data are available to bind different localities into functional agglomerations, and provide insight into their contextual and human dynamics.

AB  - Many cities around the globe strive for create and maintain urban forests to improve human health, welfare and more positive interactions towards nature. Frequently, the only available land has compacted and degraded soils with an altered soil biota. Studies are needed to address soilborne fungi biodiversity especially that of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), essential for plant development. Our aim was to evaluate the AMF community composition and soil infectivity in four urban sites with different disturbance levels and management histories (C ' ordoba, Argentina). In two urban forests (reference and restored) and two parklands (forested and control), indigenous AMF morphospecies, soil compaction and dominant plant cover were determined together with the soil infectivity in a greenhouse experiment. Results indicated that AMF communities were dominated by Funneliformis geosporum, Glomus brohultii and Rhizophagus intraradices which are considered generalists and resilient to harsh environmental conditions. AMF community composition varied greatly between the undisturbed reference site and the more disturbed parklands. The richness, diversity and soil infectivity were higher in both urban forests compared to parklands and was partially related with the greater variety of plant physiognomies (in restored site), the dominance of arboreal cover (in reference site) and the lowest soil compaction compared to parklands. In the restored forest, AMF richness and diversity were higher compared to the parklands and to the control parkland, respectively. The greater subsoil compaction and the higher percentage of herbaceous cover (mainly monospecific lawn) represented the most disturbed conditions as a consequence of trampling and subsequent soil erosion. We concluded that differences existed between urban forests and parklands sites with variable disturbance intensities and management histories, however, the parameters analysed here do not fully describe the effects of local urban conditions in the composition and infectivity status of AMF in the soil, and hence future research approaches are discussed.

AB  - Land use change can result in complex environments of varying habitat quality and permeability that directly and indirectly influence the effectiveness of natural areas for wildlife conservation. To assess how isolation and degradation of protected natural areas may affect long-term conservation efforts across the range of a sensitive subspecies, we used multiscale occupancy analysis, species distribution modeling, and circuit theory to identify hotspot areas of occurrence and potential landscape connectivity among areas of high quality habitat within and between protected natural areas. Big Cypress fox squirrels (Sciurus niger avicennia: BCFS) are state-threatened subspecies of fox squirrel endemic to forested wetlands in southwest Florida, which have been highly altered by human activities. Probability of occupancy of BCFS among conservation areas varied widely due to differences in environmental features (Hedge's g = 1.4705, 95% CI: 1.074-1.763). Fine-scale features indicative of habitat degradation, such as increasing midstory vegetation cover and decreasing bromeliad cover, negatively influenced BCFS occurrence. Home-range-level tree canopy cover differentially affected probability of occupancy dependent on proximity to urban areas. Additionally, home-range-level high summer temperature differentially affected probability of occupancy dependent on proximity to cypress domes. Habitat was distributed patchily both within and among conservation areas, separated by large areas of unsuitable vegetation communities and urbanized features that were barriers to movement. Considering the threat of increasing isolation of conservation areas due to continued development as well as current and impending degradation caused by land use and climate change within conservation area boundaries, we suggest a strong need for interagency coordination to improve, maintain, and acquire rights for protection of additional remaining habitat.

AB  - Urban resilience, the combinational characteristic of nature and society, that reflects the dynamic accumulation process that is multi-level and multi-dimensional. Particularly, the rational spatial distribution structure of land mixture and compactness is an effective way to improve urban resilience because the evolution of morphology and density of the urban land blocks in the process of land spatial conversion reflect the performance characteristics of complexity, diversity, stability, compactness, and connectivity. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between urban resilience and land use and land cover (LULC) change, to find the keys to resilient urban development for urban land and space planning. In this study, taking the Chinese hilly city of Mianyang as an example, the results show: (1) the complexity of homogeneous patch shape and heterogeneous patch combination leads to the decrease of urban morphology resilience. (2) the development trend of LULC spatial layout and structure ratio were more rational with the increased of land mixing degree. (3) the speed and intensity of urban expansion were basically coordinated with the development of urban resilience. The research provides the new ideas, approaches, and toolkits for solving the intractable problems of urban spatial planning based on coordinating conflicts between urban resilience and urban land evolution.

AB  - Globally, urban expansion and climate change interact to threaten stream ecosystems and are accelerating the loss of aquatic biodiversity. Waterway managers urgently need tools to understand the potential combined impacts of urbanization and climate change and to identify effective mitigating management interventions for protecting freshwater biota. We address this challenge using the semi-aquatic mammal the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) as a focal species. We developed high-resolution environmental spatial data for stream networks and spatially explicit habitat suitability models (HSMs) to explore the impact of threats and to identify the combination of management actions most likely to maintain or improve habitat suitability over the next 50 years in greater Melbourne, Australia. We developed and evaluated platypus HSMs (males-and-females and females-only) including validation using an independent environmental DNA data set. Platypus occurred more commonly in larger, cooler streams with greater catchment-weighted discharge, following periods of greater stream flow. They were positively associated with near-stream forest cover and negatively associated with annual air temperature and urban stormwater runoff. Extensive reductions in suitable platypus habitat are predicted to occur under urbanization and climate change scenarios, with the greatest threat expected from reduced streamflows. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining flow regimes as part of conserving platypus in the region; however, substantial additional benefit is predicted by concurrent riparian revegetation and urban stormwater management efforts (that also have the potential to contribute to the streamflow objectives). Provision of adequate streamflows in a future with increasing water demands and water security requirements will likely require creative integrated water management solutions. Our high-resolution stream network and HSMs have allowed predictions of potential range-shifts due to urban expansion and climate change impacts at management-relevant scales and at the whole-of-landscape scale. This has enabled systematic strategic planning, priority action planning and target setting in strategic policy development.

AB  - There is no doubt that the NATURA 2000 network has been one of the most relevant tools for nature protection. However, the designated areas within the borders of large cities are subjected to many threats. Traffic noise takes on a very important role in this subject, posing the question of whether NATURA 2000 areas should be located in urban areas strongly affected by noise pollution. This particular topic was exposed and analysed at Bielanski Forest NATURA 2000 (PLH140041), located in northern Warsaw, where changes in noise distribution for the years 2007-2017 were examined and described by two types of indicators (Lden and Lnight). The data sources used for the analysis were city road noise maps for 2007, 2012 and 2017. Additionally, sound intensity measurements were taken in two separate groups of hot-spots. The first of these comprised locations determined based on an inventory of avifauna; they represented different habitat types, and were characterized by the highest bird activity. The second group of hot-spots consisted of those designated along roads in order to identify the main sources of traffic noise. The obtained results confirmed the high noise-absorbing ability of the existing vegetation. The avifauna surveys covered 19 forest bird species. Five of them were considered to be the most valuable and rare elements of the local avifauna, whereas 14 appeared to be key species for the functioning of biocenosis and, at the same time, determine the uniqueness of the ecosystem. The study showed that the type of habitat rather than differences in noise levels determines the distribution and abundance of key species. Therefore, there is a necessity to focus on actions that guarantee the maintenance of the existing status in order to counteract habitat deterioration. The investigation confirmed the feasibility of creating these kinds of natural protected areas in large cities, despite their exposure to noise pollution.</p>

AB  - The European honeybee Apis mellifera is a highly successful, abundant species and has been introduced into habitats across the globe. As a supergeneralist species, the European honeybee has the potential to disrupt pollination networks, especially in Australia, whose flora and fauna have co-evolved for millions of years. The role of honeybees in pollination networks in Australia has been little explored and has never been characterised in urban areas, which may favour this exotic species due to the proliferation of similarly exotic plant species which this hyper-generalist can utilise, unlike many native bee taxa. Here, we use a bipartite network approach to compare the roles, in terms of species-level properties, of honeybees with native bee taxa in bee-flower ('pollination') networks in an urbanised biodiversity hotspot. We also assessed whether the abundance of honeybees influences overall network structure. Pollination networks were created from surveys across seven residential gardens and seven urban native vegetation remnants conducted monthly during the spring-summer period over two years. There were consistent differences in species-level properties between bee taxa, with honeybees often differing from all other native bees. Honeybees had significant impacts on network properties, being associated with higher nestedness, extinction slopes of plants, functional complementarity and niche overlap (year two), as well as lower weighted connectance and generalisation. These associations all are indicative that competition is occurring between the introduced honeybee and the native bee taxa in bee-flower networks. In conclusion, the introduced honeybee occupies a dominant, distinct position in bee-flower networks in urban habitats in the southwest Western Australian biodiversity hotspot and has a major, potentially disruptive, influence on plant-pollinator network properties in these areas.

AB  - Accurately locating key nodes and corridors of an urban heat island (UHI) is the basis for effectively mitigating a regional surface UHI. However, we still lack appropriate methods to describe it, especially considering the interaction between UHIs and the role of connectivity (network). Specifically, previous studies paid much attention to the raster and vector perspective-based on standard landscape configuration metrics that only provide an overall statistic over the entire study area without further indicating locations where different types of pattern and fragmentation occur. Therefore, by reverse thinking, here we attempt to propose a new method from the graph perspective which integrates morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA)-which is used to characterize binary patterns with emphasis on connections between their parts as measured at varying analysis scales, and habitat availability indices to evaluate and mitigate regional surface UHI. We selected the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (PRDR), one of the most rapidly urbanized regions in the world as the case study (1995-2015). The results of the case study showed: (1) the core (UHI) type accounts for the vast majority of the MSPA model, with the relative land surface temperature (LST) rises, the proportion of the core type will increase, and it could influence the edge (UHI) type significantly; (2) the branch, bridge, and islet (UHI) types have similar results to the lower temperature (4 < Relative LST <= 6) area and account for the majority, indicating that these types are more susceptible to their surrounding environment; (3) the importance and extreme importance area (node) from 1995 to 2015 have increased significantly and mainly distributed in the urbanized areas, which means cooling measures need to be implemented in these areas in order of priority. Shifting the research logic of UHI evaluation and mitigation from "patch" to "network", we hold the point that the method (reverse thinking) has significant theoretical and practical implications for mitigating regional UHI and urban climate-resilience.

AB  - Ammonia oxidation by ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) is the first and rate-limiting step of nitrification. By providing substrate to the nitrogen-removing denitrification processes, nitrification is an important process for attenuation of allochthonous nitrogen loads in urban rivers, thereby mitigating eutrophication of downstream ecosystems. However, the relative importance of AOA and AOB communities in ammonia oxidation, the distribution and varied patterns of these groups and the underlying mechanisms have received limited study in hypereutrophic urban river networks. To investigate spatial and temporal patterns of particle-attached and free-living ammonia-oxidising microbial communities, we conducted a 2-year study of four different water quality/habitat conditions within a hypereutrophic urban river network of eastern China. The structure and dynamics of ammonia-oxidising microbial communities were determined by high-throughput sequencing based on the AOA and AOB amoA gene. We found significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity of ammonia-oxidising microbial communities, but no significant differences between particle-attached and free-living fractions. Analysis revealed that changes in the diversity and composition of ammonia-oxidising microbial communities were mainly related to substrate availability (e.g., ammonia, nitrite, dissolved oxygen). AOB communities were more complex and had a higher species richness and diversity compared with AOA communities. Our findings indicate that high anthropogenic nitrogen loadings appear to promote higher ammonia-oxidising microbial richness and diversity, and AOB are more adaptable to the hypereutrophic conditions, thereby playing a more important role than AOA in nitrogen transformations in hypereutrophic urban river networks. This study highlights the importance of ammonia-oxidising microorganisms in nutrient-rich river systems and provides valuable insights into ammonia transport and transformations in urban river networks.

AB  - Escherichia coli dynamics in urban watersheds are affected by a complex balance among external inputs, niche modulation and genetic variability. To explore the ecological processes influencing E. coli spatial patterns, we analyzed its abundance and phylogenetic structure in water samples from a stream network with heterogeneous urban infrastructure and environmental conditions. Our results showed that environmental and infrastructure variables, such as macrophyte coverage, DIN and sewerage density, mostly explained E. coli abundance. Moreover, main generalist phylogroups A and B1 were found in high proportion, which, together with an observed negative relationship between E. coli abundance and phylogroup diversity, suggests that their dominance might be due to competitive exclusion. Lower frequency phylogroups were associated with sites of higher ecological disturbance, mainly involving simplified habitats, higher drainage infrastructure and septic tank density. In addition to the strong negative relationship between phylogroup diversity and dominance, the occurrence of these phylogroups would be associated with increased facilitated dispersal. Nutrients also contributed to explaining phylogroup distribution. Our study proposes the differential contribution of distinct ecological processes to the patterns of E. coli in an urban watershed, which is useful for the monitoring and management of fecal pollution.

AB  - In recent decades land cover change resulting from different types of human activity has severely reduced the original area of tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF). Deforested landscapes in neotropical America commonly have a heterogeneous structure (i.e. landscape context) with increasingly small forest patches immersed in an agricultural matrix. Often, this matrix is not completely devoid of trees, but contain numerous and widely spread arboreal elements. Many of these elements are remnants of the original forest, such as arboreal riparian belts. In 14 riparian belts of TMCF in central Veracruz, Mexico, we assessed the relationship between the attributes of the bird community that uses these belts and their vegetation attributes, as well as with landscape structure in their vicinity at four different scales (within 250, 500, 750 and 1000 m). Bird richness and abundance in riparian belts were positively related with mean tree height. Regarding landscape context, the amount of urban area in the vicinity of each belt was positively related with bird abundance at the four scales studied, explaining between 14 and 31% of spatial variation. However, the abundance of forest interior birds was negatively related with urban area, explaining from 46 to 50% of variation. Both, local (tree height) and landscape characteristics (urban and forest cover) influence differentially bird abundance in riparian belts of cloud forest. Thus, both kinds of variables should be relevant for designing management plans aimed at enhancing the conservation of the native avifauna of the cloud forest and its ecosystem services within transformed landscapes.

AB  - The frequency of introductions of non-native species is increasing worldwide, but only a few introduced species undergo rapid population growth and range expansion, and even fewer become invasive, leading to negative impacts on native communities. Predicting which non-native species are likely to become widespread and abundant can be difficult when there is a lack of species' information in the early stages of colonization. Here, we investigate the ecology of a newly introduced butterfly in Canada, the European common blue (Polyommatus icarus (Rottemberg, 1775)), by modelling its local-and landscape-scale habitat suitability in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the surrounding region, and by assessing its dispersal ability using a mark-release-recapture study. At a local scale, we found that P. icarus abundance was highest at sites with moderate levels of habitat disturbance (e.g., mowed every 2-3 years), the presence of their preferred larval host plant and low proportional cover of grasses. At a landscape scale, P. icarus abundance increased with an increasing proportion of urban area and decreasing proportion of forests. We also found that P. icarus is a low to moderate disperser relative to other butterflies. Our results suggest that P. icarus may become widespread in disturbed and urban areas across Canada, but that further investigation into additional potential range-constraining factors (e.g., microclimate), especially larval preferences, and modelling of the trajectory of P. icarus range expansion is needed.

AB  - Digging animals perform many ecosystem functions, including soil turnover and vectoring fungi, particularly mycorrhizal fungi. However, these animals are also susceptible to the impacts of urbanisation, resulting in altered ecosystem processes. Some digging mammals, such as the omnivorous quenda (Isoodon fusciventer), a medium-sized marsupial bandicoot endemic to southwestern Australia, persist in urban landscapes and may play important roles as fungal vectors. This paper examines the fungal community in quenda scats from natural vegetation remnants within a fragmented urban landscape to ask: are quenda acting as vectors for a functionally diverse fungal community?; what fungal functional types are being vectored?; and does remnant size impact fungal species richness and composition vectored by quenda? We sequenced 53 scat samples collected from remnants and found that quenda disperse a functionally diverse fungal community, with 31% of the molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) putatively mycorrhizal. Fungal OTU richness was greatest in scats from smaller remnants due to higher mean relative abundance of saprotrophs, pathogens and yeasts. Fungal OTU richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi, critical for plant growth, were found at a higher abundance in larger remnants. Fungal composition was affected by remnant size, type and condition of vegetation, and soil type. Our results indicate that maintaining digging mammal populations within urban landscapes may assist with dispersal of fungi that facilitate fungal-plant interactions, contributing to ecosystem health. These results are important to understand the complex ecological implications of urbanisation, and how remaining mammals are critical in maintaining ecosystem processes within the urban land-use matrix.

AB  - This essay aims to reflect on Occupational Therapy in guaranteeing the "right to the city" as a fundamental human and social right, directly involved in human occupations. We started this debate with collective occupations as determinants in the construction of the social space of cities. Then, we focus on the asymmetries of power and territorial inequalities, fruits of the commercialization of urban property, which imply injustices and deprivations in occupational involvement in the subject's daily lives. We summarize theoretical and methodological possibilities, new and others already, that we bring to the field of urban studies and public urbanization policies. We defend that Occupational Therapy is an area of significant contributions to the defense and guarantee of the right to the city.

Studying the influence of the tropospheric NO2 vertical column density, and analysis of mountain valley oasis city with developed cities of middle basin system's pollution differences. The results show that: (1) Medium cities of the north slope of Tianshan Mountain cities of daily mean value flow in Urumqi (1 406/5 min) greater than the small and medium-sized cities, medium-sized city Shihezi (203/5 min) and the small city Fukang (185/5 min), there is no significant difference (p>0. 05) , and all kinds of city NO2 VCD overall significant difference (p<0. 05), the daily variation of the peak, Urumqi (22. 613 X 10(15) molec . cm(2)) > Fukang (17. 758 X 10(1)(5) molec . cm(2)) > Shihezi (15. 272 X 10(1)(5) molec . cm(2)). The daily variation trend of traffic flow and NO2 VCD in the three cities is consistent, showing a trend of "high in the morning and evening, low at noon". In the seasonal variation, the traffic flow and NO2 VCD of the three types of cities are: winter and spring>autumn and summer; (2) Although the traffic flow at the monitoring points in the morning and evening is different, the traffic flow of the three types of cities is concentrated near the city center; The movement monitoring data show that the high NO2 VCD value occurs in urban areas with high traffic flow, and when the wind direction is stable in each city, the downwind concentration is greater than the upwind concentration. Due to the differences of living space, people's activities in various functional areas of the city, traffic flow and NO2 VCD are concentrated in the commercial district with dense population, indicating that vehicles have a great contribution to NO2 VCD; (3)2009-2019, ten years north slope of Tianshan Mountain medium cities economic growth rate of GDP over 200% , Urumqi, Shihezi motor vehicle growth rate than developed cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, rapid urban development, and in the valley oasis area, low meteorological terrain north, the winter inversion layer, deep calm wind days more, heating period 6 months long, causing serious pollution in winter. In addition to the anthropogenic pollution discharge, natural factors contribute to the accumulation of pollutants in the north slope of Tianshan Mountain.

AB  - Sound pressure levels (SPL) in dB are the traditional noise measurement, but dB measures alone limit characterization of the complex urban acoustic environment. The aim of this paper is to apply alpha and beta ecoacoustic indices from soundscape ecology at two contrasting locations corresponding to an urban mixed-use corridor and a deciduous forest. Twenty acoustic indices and mean dB(A) are calculated from 2,798 three-minute recordings taken every 26 min over a 28-day period. Acoustic indices are summarized by case with mean hour-of-day plots and 7- and 28-day time series plots to identify temporal patterns. Correlations to assess index relationships for each case separately and combined are presented. Acoustic indices provide complimentary information beyond SPL measures alone, especially in frequency and temporal domains, useful to identify patterns in the acoustic environment. Correlation between specific multiple indices at individual locations is a promising approach to identification of anthrophonic and biophonic dominated sonotopes. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This article draws on ethnography with active supporters of the comunas (communes) in Quito to critically engage with the theory and politics of the right to the city. Communal activists-mostly affiliated with the Indigenous movement-forcefully claim rights to the democratic production and appropriation of space advocated by right to the city theorists, as they promote communal self-management and the authority of communal assemblies over urbanization processes. At the same time, they have had little use for their constitutionally guaranteed right to the city. In carefully laying out the points of convergence between Lefebvrian right to the city theory and communal struggles, I also identify its limits and contradictions, especially: (1) the tension between "the collective power to reshape the process of urbanization" and the fixed forms and meanings of "the city," and (2) the tension between achieving the "right to centrality" through promoting participation in a concentrated urban center or through the multiplication of centers. A critical theory of urbanization should account for these tensions and for the diversity of political responses to them.

AB  - Intensive agriculture and urbanization are putting pressure on natural capital in Aotearoa-New Zealand (NZ), with native ecosystems and water quality suffering degradation. As the population has increased, so development has pushed into the rural-urban fringe. Over the last 30 years, the number of lifestyle properties in NZ has increased dramatically. Many of these properties have been developed on some of NZ's most productive soils, meaning a loss of provisioning services from this land. However, given their location, these developments present new opportunities for the enhancement and protection of other ecosystem services. This paper presents the findings of an exploratory study conducted on lifestyle block residents in peri-urban Palmerston North. The results showed that these residents have a good sense of environmental stewardship and a desire to plant native species, improve connectivity, and protect their land from the invasion of pests and weeds. These residents are also quite community-focused and protective of their special place. This creates an excellent basis from which to encourage greater collaborative action towards protecting and enhancing biodiversity and to put in place land management strategies that can enhance natural capital and assist in other ecosystem service protection serving to improve the landscape ecology of peri-urban environments.

AB  - Collaboration and knowledge networks have been proved to play a crucial role in innovation. From a multilevel network perspective, this study integrates research on the two types of net-works and investigates how city-level collaboration and knowledge networks influence innova-tion in the energy conservation field. To this end, we calculate a city's influence force in its collaboration network based on the weighted PageRank algorithm and propose a novel measure-ment method of network embedding to gauge the embedding depth and embedding breadth of a city's local knowledge network in the whole knowledge network. Empirical results suggest that a city's aggregation index and influential force in the collaboration network are positively related to its innovation, while geographical distance shows an inverted U-shaped effect. The embedding depth and embedding breadth of a city's local knowledge network have a positive effect, and the structural entropy of its knowledge network generates an inverted U-shaped effect on innova-tion. Our research contributes to a better understanding of the impact of city-level collaboration and knowledge networks on innovation and points to several general implications for innovation practice and complex network research.

AB  - At present, in the context of the growing severity of environmental and socio-economic problems, information connectivity, and more frequently occurring crisis phenomena, there is an acute shortage of new ways and tools for understanding and management of increasingly expanding urban systems (urban geosystems). There are still no unified well-established recommendations for building an ideal self-organizing city. However, the previously developed and proven approaches to management of self-organizing systems can be effective tools for stimulating a further progressive development of urban geosystems of any level of complexity and hierarchy and building the city of the future. We examine the general principles of self-organization and self-development of urban landscapes of urbogeosystems in the management system using a large metropolis as an example: Moscow. The concepts of "self-organization of landscapes" and "self-development of landscapes" in the format of modern concepts are analyzed, as well as the application of these concepts to the study of the functioning of urban planning systems. This paper gives examples of the modern practice of the regulation and evolution of urban development to improve the beautification and comfort of living of the population, as well as the potential of a city and individual communities for self-development and self-organization. It is shown that the self-organization processes is closely linked with the structuring of information and the movement of the metropolis to the category of a "smart" city, which contributes to the establishment of new forms of self-government, an increase in population safety in the context of a pandemic of viral diseases, the effective use of budgetary and other funds and the preservation of the historical and cultural heritage and architectural appearance of the city, and, ultimately, the establishment of close ties between authorities and the population. It is found that the specific features in the development of urban geosystems imply that their behavior obeys the achievement of particular goals; in addition, they are able to change their structure in the course of their functioning, i.e., to self-organize. The more effective the processes of self-development are, the more useful information and accumulated experience the urban geosystem uses are by making a purposeful selection.

AB  - Coalitions can be critical to social movement success. This article compares thirty-five Indivisible groups founded after the 2017 Women's March in ten U.S. cities. Through analysis of Facebook pages and interviews with activists, I find that groups that work more often in coalition mobilize more events and are more likely to survive. In cities with long histories of activism, groups tend to engage in more coalitions and a particular type of deep coalition work I call "supercoalitions" that strategically coordinate across a city and work to accumulate and channel resources to pre-existing organizations. In cities without long histories of activism, groups are less likely to engage in coalitions. However, when they do, they tend to organize into broad civil society coalitions that bring together a diversity of political and nonpolitical actors which can be very successful over time. This analysis highlights how coalitions are shaped by local political context.

AB  - The Arab Spring, the Occupy Movement, los Indignados, Gezi Park, the Umbrella Movement, among others, are some of the most representative contemporary social movements that conducted important changes and open debate in fields like politics and economics. However, they are usually not related directly to the transformation of the architectural urban landscape in current cities. During the production of these occupations, dissident practices take place and alter established conditions of urban infrastructures that react as obsolete elements, while collective participation transforms spatial perception, the use and aesthetic of public spaces. This article focuses on the Umbrella Movement, the 2014 Hong Kong occupation, and how protestors modify, on one hand, the architectural urban landscape of the city and generate, on the other, design techniques through the use of quotidian and daily-life objects in dissident means. Pragmatism and immediacy are the main conditions of these occupations for creating spaces that occupiers need, and also for making visible a situation that is implanted deeply in the city: the privatization of public spaces.

AB  - Aim Exploring the biotic homogenization and diversity resistance hypotheses by assessing the effect of non-native black locust canopy on understorey species turnover. Location Berlin, the Venetian metropolitan area, and Rome. Methods We modelled the zeta (zeta) expression of diversity to compare the understorey species turnover between the non-native black locust and native woodland canopies across multiple sites and through predictors of anthropogenic pressure (road and built-up density) and interior conditions (tree basal area and mean height). Results In Rome, black locust showed the lowest survivability and cover and did not produce any homogenization of the understorey. In Berlin and in the Venetian metropolitan area, black locust caused understorey homogenization, although with a lower intensity in Berlin. Under black locust canopies, distance between sites and road density was more consistently associated with species turnover, across urban areas and multiple sites. Under native canopies in Berlin, factors prominently associated with species turnover were road and built-up density and mean tree height, while in the Venetian metropolitan area it was road density. Main conclusions Evidence in support of the biotic homogenization in contrast to the diversity resistance hypothesis varied across urban areas. Species turnover was influenced by land use patterns more evidently under native tree canopies and where the non-native tree had higher survivability. Similar analyses in other urban areas may confirm these relationships with other types of landscapes.

AB  - The Ecological Protection Redline (EPR) is an innovative measure implemented in China to maintain the structural stability and functional security of the ecosystem. By prohibiting large-scale urban and industrial construction activities, EPR is regarded as the "lifeline" to ensure national ecological security. It is of great practical significance to scientifically evaluate the protection effect of EPR and identify the protection vacancies. However, current research has focused only on the protection effects of the EPR on ecosystem services (ESs), and the protection effect of the EPR on ecological connectivity remains poorly understood. Based on an evaluation of ES importance, the circuit model, and hotspot analysis, this paper identified the ecological security pattern in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), analyzed the role of EPR in maintaining ES and ecological connectivity, and identified protection gaps. The results were as follows: (1) The ecological sources were mainly distributed in mountainous areas of the GBA. The ecological sources and ecological corridors constitute a circular ecological shelter surrounding the urban agglomeration of the GBA. (2) The EPR effectively protected water conservation, soil conservation, and biodiversity maintenance services, but the protection efficiency of carbon sequestration service and ecological connectivity were low. In particularly, EPR failed to continuously protect regional large-scale ecological corridors and some important stepping stones. (3) The protection gaps of carbon sequestration service and ecological connectivity in the study area reached 1099.80 km(2) and 2175.77 km(2), respectively, mainly distributed in Qingyuan, Yunfu, and Huizhou. In future EPR adjustments, important areas for carbon sequestration service and ecological connectivity maintenance should be included. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the protection effects of EPR on ecological structure and function, and it has produced significant insights into improvements of the EPR policy. In addition, this paper proposes that the scope of resistance surface should be extended, which would improve the rationality of the ecological corridor simulation.

AB  - The Near Eastern fire salamander (Salamandra infraimmaculata) reaches its southern distribution range in Israel. Although the population structure has been analysed in central Israel and at the southern distribution limit, we lack knowledge on populations in the northern area, such as along Mount Hermon. S. infraimmaculata occurs at Mt. Hermon along an altitudinal gradient and appears to be fragmented by urban and agricultural landscape. We studied the genetic structure of four populations based on microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial D-loop to determine the genetic diversity and connectivity between populations. We observed moderate gene flow at lower parts, i.e. from Tel Dan and Nimrod Castle to Banias indicating extant but limited connectivity. Genetic diversity and gene flow declined along the altitudinal gradient at Mt. Hermon, reaching rock-bottom levels in the highest located population of Nimrod Pool. The observed isolation-by-elevation gradient might induce a higher extinction risk for the highland populations of S. infraimmaculata.

AB  - Regional land use change and ecological security are important fields and have been popular issues in global change research in recent years. Regional habitat quality is also an important embodiment of the service function and health of ecosystems. Taking Shiyan City of Hubei Province as an example, the spatiotemporal differences in habitat quality in Shiyan City were evaluated using the habitat quality module of the InVEST model and GIS spatial analysis method based on DEM and land use data from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. According to the habitat quality index values, the habitats were divided into four levels indicating habitat quality: I (very bad), II (bad), III (good), and IV (excellent), and the topographic gradient effect of habitat quality was studied using the topographic position index. The results show the following. (1) The habitat quality of Shiyan City showed relatively high and obvious spatial heterogeneity overall and, more specifically, was high in the northwest and southwest, moderate in the center, and low in the northeast. The higher quality habitats (levels III, IV) were mainly distributed in mountain and hill areas and water areas, while those with lower quality habitats (levels I, II) were mainly distributed in agricultural urban areas. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the overall average habitat quality of Shiyan City first increased, then decreased, and then increased again. Additionally, the habitat area increased with an improvement in the level. There was a trend in habitat transformation moving from low to high quality level, showing a spatial pattern of "rising in the southwest and falling in the northeast". (3) The habitat quality in the water area and woodland area was the highest, followed by grassland, and that of cultivated land was the lowest. From 2000 to 2020, the habitat quality of cultivated land, woodland, and grassland decreased slightly, while the habitat quality of water increased significantly. (4) The higher the level of the topographic position index, the smaller the change range of land use types with time. The terrain gradient effect of habitat quality was significant. With the increase in terrain level, the average habitat quality correspondingly improved, but the increasing range became smaller and smaller. These results are helpful in revealing the spatiotemporal evolution of habitat quality caused by land use changes in Shiyan City and can provide a scientific basis for the optimization of regional ecosystem patterns and land use planning and management, and they are of great significance for planning the rational and sustainable use of land resources and the construction of an ecological civilization.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Urban green areas are essential for many animals inhabiting cities, including bats. They provide food and shelter, and also facilitate migration. Our aim was to identify bat species inhabiting Planty Park in Cracow and determine how their activity differed depending on the weather and season. We recorded bats' calls on ultrasonic detectors in 2016 and 2017. In total, 2 of 10 observed species were new for this part of Poland: the Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and the Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). We divided all species into groups of similar ecology for further analyses. Myotis bats were the least active group. Bats of genera Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio were the most active in late summer, similarly to Pipistrellus and Hypsugo, although statistics did not back the outcome for the latter two genera. In spring and early summer, Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio bats were more active during warmer nights, while in autumn, they preferred cloudless nights. Interestingly, Pipistrellus and Hypsugo bats decreased their activity at higher temperatures during summer. Our study will lead to a better understanding of bat ecology in urban areas and will contribute to setting urban landscape planning recommendations.
   Municipal greenery can mitigate the negative impact of urbanization on biodiversity, including bats, by providing a migration corridor, food base and roosts. Our study aimed to evaluate the species composition and diversity, test the differences in activity between seasons, and identify the atmospheric conditions influencing the bats' activity in the Planty Park (Cracow). Fieldworks were conducted in 2016 and 2017. We recorded 10 species, two new for this part of Poland: the Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and the Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). Taxa were divided into three ecological guilds. Myotis group's activity was insufficient to perform statistical analyses. The activity of Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio group peaked in late summer. A similar insignificant trend was observed for Pipistrellus and Hypsugo. Temperature enhanced the activity of Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio group in spring and early summer, while cloud cover suppressed their activity in autumn. Temperature also enhanced Pipistrellus and Hypsugo group activity in spring and autumn, but it suppressed their summer activity. Our study is one of the first to investigate temperate urban bats' phenology and may serve as a preface for further research to introduce detailed urban landscape planning recommendations.

AB  - Freshwater lakes are subject to variable degrees of eutrophication. Within lakes, the planktonic bacterial community (PBC) and sediment bacterial community (SBC) are both significant participants in biogeochemical processes of lake ecosystems. However, how the assembly patterns of bacterial communities vary seasonally along a trophic gradient in freshwater lakes is poorly understood.
   Here, we collected and analysed water and sediment samples from 13 shallow lakes located in an urban region of China during summer and winter, the trophic states of which ranged from mesotrophic to middle eutrophic in summer and oligo-mesotrophic to light eutrophic in winter. High-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes was used to determine the diversity and composition of bacterial communities.
   Our results indicated that bacterial communities derived from different habitats and seasons did not exhibit a uniform response to lake trophic states. Linear and nonlinear mixed effect models suggested that the alpha-diversity of PBC and SBC, respectively, showed a unimodal and monotonically decreasing trend with increasing eutrophication in summer, whereas that of PBC and SBC, respectively, exhibited no obvious trend or an increased pattern along the trophic gradient in winter. In addition, the taxonomic compositional dissimilarity of the PBC was most significantly related to lake trophic differences in summer. Phylogenetic structure analysis revealed that mostly environmental selection regulated the SBC and PBC in both seasons. Moreover, dispersal limitation and homogenising dispersal contributed more to the assembly of SBC and PBC in both seasons, respectively. Water temperature, associated with seasonal variability, was the most important variable driving the PBC assembly, while sediment pH overwhelmed nutrients in regulating the seasonal patterns of SBC assemblages.
   Overall, we highlighted that the water and sediments, as well as the seasons, differentiated the diversity patterns and assembly processes of bacterial communities along a trophic gradient of freshwater lakes. Our findings provide novel information for understanding the ecological responses of lacustrine bacterial communities to trophic gradients and seasonal variations. This study also contributes an important reference for predicting the changes of microbial community biodiversity under future scenarios of eutrophication.

AB  - The present study explored the regularities of the path and network structure of surface runoff formed under the influence of urban surface landscapes. We used unmanned aerial vehicle sensors to examine terrain and land use/cover change. The sub-catchments of a typical city, Luohe, China, were evaluated for the effect of landscape on surface runoff. Landscape and topographic parameters from 166 urban sub-catchments in Luohe were obtained by measuring digital surface models and orthophoto maps. The minimum cumulative resistance model was used to simulate potential runoff and 491,820 potential runoff paths, connected upstream and downstream, were obtained in 166 sub-catchments. The chi-square test was used to compare simulation runoff paths and actual runoff depth, with the results showing that they led to the same distribution trend. When the gravity coefficient was greater than 18.93, path disconnection occurred among 166 sub-catchments, with a decrease in channels. The potential runoff distribution appeared in aggregation; as the gravity coefficient increased from low to high, aggregation showed a trend of increasing initially but subsequently decreasing. The initial runoff formed sub-catchments with high gravity coefficients, then accumulated and spread to the others. It is important that proper measures are taken to establish a unified planning of the city's surface landscape in order to produce suitable surface runoff distribution.

AB  - Greenspace ecological networks (GENs) optimization is an effective way to prevent landscape fragmentation and promote ecological processes. Built land sprawl is an important factor affecting this optimization. However, few studies have specifically analyzed the encroachments caused by existing built land on GENs. Given the insights from China's total built land control policy, this study proposed a new idea of linking GENs optimization into urban expansion planning through land transformation. This idea was implemented in the Su-Xi-Chang area and integrated a series of methods, emphasizing the importance of built land encroachments removal for restoring the connectivity and quality of GENs. We identified that the built land encroached on GENs. Furthermore, we proposed to transfer the scattered rural/industrial land, whose amount was set as the land quota for urban expansion planning. Four scenarios of urban expansion were simulated based on China's land use policies/practices and assessed by landscape metrics. The land transformation happened between rural and urban land. The main findings indicated that more inclusive urban expansion planning with consideration of the GENs optimization can be obtained. This study has practical contributions regarding GENs optimization and urban expansion planning for policymakers and our ideas of land transformation provide a reference for similar studies.</p>

AB  - Citization significantly changes original surface properties. City areas can cause surface winds to decrease; furthermore, ground friction can be transferred layer by layer through the momentum exchange of air movement, which affects the air layers above. Precipitation modification by city environments has been an active research area. Under the conditions of high wind speed, the dynamic effects of cities on precipitation are relatively obvious. Generally, the dynamic effects fall into two main categories: (1) for weather systems under weak forcing synoptic backgrounds, such as local convective systems, shorter-lived extreme precipitation events and fronts and city barrier effects can delay the movement of weather systems, directly change the horizontal distribution characteristics and occurrence time for precipitation, change the flow field and structure, cause the bifurcation of weather systems, and change the horizontal distribution characteristics of precipitation; (2) for weather systems under strong forcing synoptic backgrounds, such as extratropical systems (with large-scale moisture transport), monsoon systems, landfalling tropical cyclones, and supercell storms, the impact of the dynamic effects of cities cannot lead to the bifurcation of the weather system, nor can it change the horizontal distribution characteristics of the whole precipitation field, but it can have an impact on the local precipitation intensity and distribution. However, currently, people do not agree on the impact of cities on precipitation, especially regarding tropical cyclones. Hence, we provide a review and provide insights into the dynamic effects of cities on precipitation.

From 2004 onwards, we captured and banded 51 adult tui and fitted radio transmitters to 41 in Waikato urban areas to locate nests. We directly observed 15 nests to determine nesting success and gather evidence of any predation events. Tui moved 5-23 km from urban areas to surrounding native forests at the onset of nesting, but only four (29%) of 14 unmanaged nests fledged young, due mostly to predation by ship rats (Rattus rattus), swamp harriers (Circus approximans), and brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Subsequent effective pest mammal control in forests around Hamilton was associated with greatly increased year-round tui abundance and nesting in Hamilton. These results confirm previous findings that tui move widely in winter; that they readily cross pasture in the absence of forest corridors, and that they will permanently inhabit urban areas. Provided adequate food is available, effective control of ship rats and possums can rapidly (1-4 years) increase tui visits and nesting within 20 km of managed sites, enabling recolonisation of proximate urban habitats by this iconic endemic taxon, despite previous evidence for natal philopatry.

AB  - Dynamics of ecosystem service value (ESV) of various wetlands has been assessed by researchers globally. But the impact of spatio-temporal variation of landscape metrics on ESV in the lower Gangetic plains has not been examined, fully. The present work has established linkages between landscape metrics and ESV in Kolkata urban agglomeration using support vector machine and multivariate regression analysis. Result indicates that wetland area has been reduced by 5.26%, 13.67% and 9.03% during the periods 1990-2000, 2000-2010 and 2010-2020, respectively and the ESV contributed by wetlands has been decreased by $131428, $323674 and $184649, respectively during the same period at an annual rate of 0.85%. Number of patches, mean patch area and edge density are the main determinants of wetland fragmentation and decreased by 44.12%, 10.23% and 8.65%, respectively during the last three decades. A wetland restoration strategy based on dynamic restoration, reactive restoration and wetland creation for the study area has been formulated, which can guide for sustainable management of wetland resources in Kolkata urban agglomeration.

AB  - Seaports are introduction hotspots for invasive alien species (IAS). This is especially true for rodents, which have accompanied humans around the globe since the earliest days of ocean-going voyages. The rapid spread of IAS soon after arrival in a new environment is facilitated by further human-mediated transport or landscape features, like roads. By measuring genetic diversity and structure to investigate dispersal pathways, we gained insight into the transport, spread and establishment stages of a biological invasion, leveraging the most common rodent species (R. norvegicus) in this setting. We characterized the genetic structure of three Norway rat populations along a busy industrial road used by trucks to access the Port area in Paranagua city (Brazil). A total of 71 rats were genotyped using 11 microsatellite markers. The results revealed a pattern of gene flow contrary to the expected stepping-stone model along the linear transect, with the two furthest apart populations being clustered together. We hypothesize that the observed outcome is explained by natural dispersal along the corridor being lower than human-mediated transport. The sampled area furthest from the port is a gas station frequented by trucks which are considered the most likely mode of transportation. In terms of management strategies, we suggest more emphasis should be put on cargo surveillance to lower the risk of Norway rat dispersal, not only for biosecurity, but also for sanitary reasons, as this port is a major grain trading point.

AB  - One of the core values of urban wilderness construction is to restore the structures and functions of biological communities in fragmented urban habitats, and enable the stability and ecological succession of native communities with low human intervention. The paper discusses the design principles and technical methodologies in active urban rewilding by the example of Shanghai Urban Biodiversity Education Base project. Aiming to restore urban biodiversity and enrich the technical and theoretical research of urban wilderness construction and Nature-based Solutions, this project conducted habitat division, native species introduction, natural community construction, ecological benefit assessment, etc. In a year and a half, 260 native plant species, 255 insect species, 7 amphibian and reptile species, 71 bird species, and 6 mammal species were recorded within the 1.7 hm(2) project site, showing higher biodiversity and density of animal populations than unrestored consructed forests surrounding. Along with the spontaneous progressive succession of the plant communities, the project has achieved good results. The technical approaches proposed in the project can be broadly applied in design and construction of country parks, wildlife habitats, ecological corridors / networks, and environmental education bases.

AB  - This paper explores the role of landscape planning as a tool for rural fire prevention. It presents a methodology for a fire resilient and sustainable landscape model (FIRELAN) that articulates the ecological and cultural components in a suitable and multifunction land-use plan. FIRELAN is a conceptual and ecologically based model that recognizes river basin' land morphology, microclimate and species combustibility as the fundamental factors that determine fire behavior and landscape resilience, along with the ecological network (EN) for achieving ecological sustainability of the landscape. The model is constituted by the FIRELAN Network and the Complementary Areas. This network ensures the effectiveness of discontinuities in the landscape with less combustible land-uses. It also functions as a fire-retardant technique and protection of wildland-urban interface (WUI). This model is applied to municipalities from Portugal's center region, a simplified landscape severely damaged by recurrent rural fires. The results show that land-use and tree species composition should change drastically, whereas about 72% of the case study needs transformation actions. This requires a significant increase of native or archaeophytes species, agricultural areas, landscape discontinuities and the restoration of biodiversity in Natura 2000 areas. The EN components are 79% of the FIRELAN N area, whose implementation ensures soil and water conservation, biodiversity and habitats. This paper contributes to the discussion of the Portuguese rural fires planning framework.

AB  - The last decade has witnessed a wealth of studies on characterizing human mobility patterns using movement datasets. Such efforts have highlighted a few salient dimensions of individual travel behavior relevant to urban planning and policy analysis. Despite the fruitful research outcomes, most of the findings are drawn upon urban residents. The behavioral characteristics of other population groups, such as tourists, remain underexplored. In this study, we introduce an analytical framework to gain insights into tourist mobility patterns. By analyzing mobile phone trajectories of international travelers to three different cities in South Korea, we introduce nine mobility indicators to capture different facets of tourist travel behavior (e.g., duration of stay in a city, spatial extent of activities, location visited and trips conducted, and mobility diversity), and examine their statistical properties across cities. An eigendecomposition approach is then introduced to better understand the interdependency of these mobility indicators and inherent variations among individual travelers. Based on the eigendecomposition results, we further employ a dimension reduction technique to describe the key characteristics of each traveler. Since the mobile phone dataset captures the nationality of tourists, we use such information to quantify the behavioral heterogeneity of travelers across countries and regions. Finally, we select a few traveler groups with distinctive mobility patterns in each city and examine the spatial patterns of their activities. Substantial differences are observed among traveler groups in their spatial preferences. The implications for location recommendation and deployment of tourism services (e.g., transportation) are discussed. We hope the study brings a synergy between classic human mobility analysis and the emerging field of tourism big data. The framework can be applied or extended to compatible datasets to understand travel behavior of tourists, residents, and special population groups in cities.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot face immediate threats through habitat loss and species extinction. Systems to monitor ecological status and trends in biodiversity are therefore crucially needed. Myanmar is part of Indo-Burma but with no past experience of biomonitoring in freshwaters. In this study, we aimed to assess the ecological and biodiversity status of a lowland river network in south-central Myanmar by identifying and quantifying pressures using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators. Novel data on water quality (nutrients, sediments and metals), hydromorphology (Morphological Quality Index; MQI), habitat quality (Litter Siltation Index; LSI), land use, and macroinvertebrates were collected from 25 river sites. The dominant pressures on rivers were urban land use, inputs of untreated sewage, in-stream and riparian garbage littering, run-off from agricultural fields and plantations, as well as physical habitat degradation. Water chemistry data indicated inputs of sediments and nutrients to degraded streams, but no obvious metal pollution. The LSI and MQI indices indicated high perturbation in agricultural and urban areas, respectively. Ecological status was assessed using a first version of a modified Average Score per Taxon index (ASPT), while biodiversity was assessed by family richness within the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and Odonata (EPTCO), which was tested against the pressure gradient by principal component regressions. ASPT had high diagnostic capabilities (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.001) and showed that the index can be used to evaluate ecological water quality in this region. Biodiversity, expressed as family richness, also declined along the gradient (R-2 = 0.59, p = 0.041), giving support to the fact that current land-use practices in this area are unsustainable.

AB  - TAMA 38 is a national master plan for reinforcing existing structures against earthquakes and has been Israel's flagship urban renewal policy during the past decade. This study analyzes the effect of TAMA 38 at both the national and local levels. At the national level, we analyze the spatial distribution of TAMA 38 projects and the plan's pace of implementation. At the local level, we examine the influence o extensive TAMA 38 redevelopment on a neighborhood's diversity and the local authority's infrastructure and budget. The research findings and the lessons that can he learned from the Israeli case may assist decisionmakers elsewhere seeking new policy tools for addressing the need to reinforce buildings against earthquakes and the emerging need for urban renewal of city centers.

AB  - Land transformation reduces biodiversity and regional sustainability, with land price being an indicator of the opportunity cost to a landowner of resisting land conversion. However, reliable spatially explicit databases of current land prices are generally lacking in developing countries. We used tools from data science to scrape 1,487 georeferenced land prices in southern Kenya from the internet. Prices were higher for land near cities and in areas of high agricultural productivity, but also around the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Predicted land prices ranged from US$662 to US$4,618,805 per acre. Land speculation associated with expanding urbanization increases the opportunity and acquisition costs of maintaining conservation buffer zones, corridors, and dispersal areas. However, high land values are also found adjacent to a world-famous tourist destination. Profit-driven turnover of ownership, subdivision, and transformation of land is occurring at a rapid pace in southern Kenya, to the detriment of savanna biodiversity and the sustainability of the pastoral social-ecological system.

Its impacts are expected to be especially detrimental when it sprawls into the landscape and reaches sites of high conservation value due to the species and ecosystems they host, such as protected areas. I analyzed the degree of urbanization (i.e., urban cover and growth rate) from 2006 to 2015 in protected sites in the Natura 2000 network, which, according to the Habitats and Birds Directives, harbor species and habitats of high conservation concern in Europe. I used data on the degree of land imperviousness from COPERNICUS to calculate and compare urban covers and growth rates inside and outside Natura 2000. I also analyzed the relationships of urban cover and growth rates with a set of characteristics of Natura sites. Urban cover inside Natura 2000 was 10 times lower than outside (0.4% vs. 4%) throughout the European Union. However, the rates of urban growth were slightly higher inside than outside Natura 2000 (4.8% vs. 3.9%), which indicates an incipient urban sprawl inside the network. In general, Natura sites affected most by urbanization were those surrounded by densely populated areas (i.e., urban clusters) that had a low number of species or habitats of conservation concern, albeit some member states had high urban cover or growth rate or both in protected sites with a large number of species or habitats of high conservation value. Small Natura sites had more urban cover than large sites, but urban growth rates were highest in large Natura sites. Natura 2000 is protected against urbanization to some extent, but there is room for improvement. Member states must enact stricter legal protection and control law enforcement to halt urban sprawl into protected areas under the greatest pressure from urban sprawl (i.e., close to urban clusters). Such actions are particularly needed in Natura sites with high urban cover and growth rates and areas where urbanization is affecting small Natura sites of high conservation value, which are especially vulnerable and concentrated in the Mediterranean region.

AB  - Ticks are increasingly reported in urban and peri-urban areas, such as city parks or peri-urban forests, across Europe. Land use changes, like the transformation of natural ecosystems into residential or recreational areas, and the restoration of natural areas connectivity for biodiversity purposes, facilitate human contact with these vectors. We evaluated the infestation by Ixodid ticks and their infection by zoonotic agents in two natural re-serves (La Mandria and Stupinigi) in the urban area of Turin, northwestern Italy, near to densely inhabited suburbs and consistently frequented by people. We monthly performed dragging in 15 sites during a three-year period (2012-2014).
   Over 4000 ticks were collected, belonging to the species: Ixodes ricinus, I. acuminatus, Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, and Haemaphysalis concinna. The tick burden in La Mandria, a park very rich in wildlife, was higher than in Stupinigi, which is surrounded by a grid of roads and cultivated fields. The occurrence of I. ricinus nymphs was mainly related to habitat diversity and seasonal variation but weakly influenced by wildlife presence. Conversely, the density of I. ricinus nymphs were effectively estimated by vegetation coverage, micro-climatic conditions, and the presence of large wildlife. Molecular analyses showed the infections by Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (24.1 %), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (2.9 %), and Spotted Fever Group rickettsiae (30.4 %) in I. ricinus. Tick-borne encephalitis virus, that is considered so far absent in northwestern Italy, was not detected. In La Mandria, the risk of encountering one I. ricinus nymph infected by Borrelia burgorferi s.l. in 100 m(2) was 59.1 % (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 36.3-83.0), and 71.3 % (95%CI: 44.5-93.0) for Rickettsia spp.
   Educational programs on personal protection and surveillance on tick-borne diseases should be enhanced to face the threat posed by tick vectors in green urban landscapes.

AB  - Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) has created a significant impact on urban development in the core areas of cities throughout the world, and has been running along the movement corridors, especially in and around these areas resulting in a deterioration of the overall urban environment. It has also become evident that, in these core areas of the cities, mostly in the developing countries, like Kolkata, these developments have been largely uncontrolled, sporadic and piecemeal in nature, creating haphazard and chaotic spatial/ physical environment, primarily influenced by unregulated market forces.As a result, these core areas require immediate intervention to rectify the problems, as well as to arrest any further deterioration of the spatial /physical environments. However, in cities like Kolkata, these interventions are based on conventional Urban Planning paradigm, and so far have failed to address the situation properly. Thus an investigation of the impact of MRTS on these core areas is required to understand these developments which are generally occurring in an intermittent manner, thereby formulating necessary recommendations from an urban design viewpoint. Accordingly, in this paper an attempt has been made to thoroughly understand the said impact, primarily from an Urban Design viewpoint in order to guide these developments in the desired direction.

AB  - The "Ecological Value" (EV) term has been spread in the literature since 1860; however, there is no consensus on its definition and the criteria for its assessment. To identify, assess and summarize the main definitions, criteria, indicators and applications behind the EV term, we performed a systematic literature review of 209 articles published over the last 10 years. Methods included documentation of the following data: i) study area, ii) study subject, iii) study object; iv) criteria, indicators and methods used in the analyses, v) applications of the EV term, and vi) if the study was performed in a natural protected area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was conducted to uncover the association among studies regarding the use of EV and to test for homogeneity among the articles publishing research involving EV. A bootstrap technique was used for MCA validation. The main findings exposed the polysemy of the term and the paucity in the definition, mainly derived by the lack of a theoretical framework. Only 74, out of the 209 revised articles, involved numerical analysis to evaluate criteria. The more recurrent criteria were those related with ecological properties (biodiversity, vulnerability) and with functional characteristics (fragmentation, connectivity and resilience). Remote sensing techniques were the more frequent method for the assessment of EV. The main applications in the use of this term were for natural and urban planning, biodiversity conservation and payment for ecosystem services. An explicit heterogeneity among articles, with and without numerical analysis, was denoted by MCA. Finally, we concluded that the EV term is highly related with the intrinsic values of the landscape.

AB  - Integrating a network perspective into multiple-stressor research can reveal indirect stressor effects and simultaneously estimate both taxonomic and functional community characteristics, thus representing a novel approach to stressor paradigms in rivers. Using six years of data from twelve streams of Columbus, Ohio, USA, the effects of nutrients (N:P), impervious surface (%IS), and sedimentation on network properties were quantified. Variability in the strength and distribution of trophic interactions was assessed by incorporating biomass into networks. All stressors impacted some properties of network topology - linkage density (average number of links per species), connectance (fraction of all possible links realized in a network), and compartmentalization (degree to which networks contain discrete sub-webs), including synergistic interactive effects between sedimentation and stream size. We also found support for antagonistic effects between (1) sedimentation and %IS and between %IS and N:P on the weighted index mean link weight, which represents the magnitude of trophic interactions among species in a network, and (2) %IS and stream size on strength standard deviation, a measure of the distribution of total magnitude of all trophic interactions per species in a network. Overall, our results point to the potential for urban stressors such as impervious surfaces and sedimentation - alone and as interactions - to decrease network complexity, compartmentalization, and stability, likely through homogenizing habitat and limiting food resources. The observation that larger streams often buffered the negative effects of these stressors suggests that restoration and other management approaches might be most beneficial in smaller headwater streams of urban catchments.

AB  - Adopting an interdisciplinary approach and framing sustainability issues from a resilience perspective, our paper first aimed to highlight nature-based solutions (NBSs) as levers to foster sustainable cities consistent with Agenda 2030-SDG 11 (2015) and the New Urban Agenda (Habitat III, 2016). Second, we empirically analyzed two Italian municipalities that are experimenting with initiatives of sustainable urban management and planning based on NBSs: the Municipality of Lucca in Tuscany and the Municipality of Latina in the Latium Region. These municipalities present institutional and socioeconomic similarities, making them an interesting study setting that allows us to draw significant lessons. We conducted four research steps: (1) theoretical background analysis, including resilience thinking in sustainable urban management. We investigated the role of NBSs in enabling urban resilience according to the last level of resilience, i.e., the transformative level. (2) We studied the contributions of NBSs to sustainable cities and resilience thinking. (3) We analyzed the NBSs' projects of Lucca and Latina, and (4) we proposed an urban managerial tool: the NBSs' curve, which facilitates the estimation of the NBS ecosystem endowment. The results of the NBS initiatives presented in this study have a two-fold value. First, they aim to combine citizens' well-being with ecological and environmental aspects by better managing urban spaces that facilitate interpersonal relationships and resource sharing. Second, they are developed to meet the needs of local groups by serving as a stimulus (Fridays For Future movement) and as enablers (local associations) of managed actions. The lessons learned about the enhancement of sustainable cities through NBSs were thoroughly debated.

AB  - The relationship between the built environment and walking behavior has been explored extensively. However, little research has been done to either differentiate between walking for transport and walking as activity or that applies urban design tools to walkability improvement based on environment-walking associations. Therefore, this study constructed perceived environment walkability factors to replace unidentified physical environments that varied among individuals and examined their associations with walking to a destination (purposive walking) and walking as activity (discursive walking), using factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Results suggest that residential density, land-use mix diversity, and pedestrian/traffic safety were associated with purposive walking while aesthetics and crime safety were associated with discursive walking. Land-use mix access and street connectivity were common correlates of both walking patterns. This study also explored how to apply urban design tools, including land-use plans, zoning control, and urban design guidelines, to shape a walkable environment based on the environment-walking associations.

AB  - With the rapid development of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and transportation infrastructure, the flows of people between cities have become the cornerstone of shaping regional integration. Although research studies about the movement of people have aroused widespread interest in academia, research about the temporal and spatial dynamics of daily mobility between cities is sparse, which is called the temporal heterogeneity of mobility between cities. This research aims to study the temporal and spatial changes (Heterogeneity) of population mobility between cities, using big data obtained through China Unicom, in terms of mapping the spatial network of population mobility and complex network analysis, from which the following findings emerge: (1) On weekends, the gap between cities in the number of floating population flow and the capacity of transferring population has become smaller, indicating that there is better coordination between cities on weekends. (2) There are huge differences in population flow between cities, which reflects the imbalance of urban development, population is more concentrated in cities with higher level of development. (3) The heterogeneity of population flow between cities at weekdays and weekends is closely related to the city's hierarchy, which can help us study the hierarchical structure of China's cities from a dynamic perspective. The paper emphasizes the importance of researching heterogeneity issues, clarifies the difference between the heterogeneity of weekdays and weekends and the heterogeneity involved in previous population research fields in terms of population flow and deficiencies in research.

AB  - Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) play an important role in reducing methane emissions in nature. Most current researches focus on the natural habitats (e.g., lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, paddy fields, etc.). However, methanotrophs and the methane-oxidizing process remain essentially unclear in artificial habitat, such as the urban water cycle systems. Here, high-throughput sequencing and qPCR were used to analyze the community structure and abundance of MOB. Six different systems were selected from Yunyang City, Chongqing, China, including the raw water system (RW), the water supply pipe network system (SP), the wastewater pipe network system (WP), the hospital wastewater treatment system (HP), the municipal wastewater treatment plant system (WT) and the downstream river system (ST) of a wastewater treatment plant. Results clearly showed that the MOB community structure and network interaction patterns of the urban water cycle system were different from those of natural water bodies. Type I MOB was the dominant Glade in HP. Methylocysis in Type II was the most abundant genus among the whole urban water cycle system, indicating that this genus had a high adaptability to the environment Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and concentration significantly affected the MOB communities in the urban water cycle system. The network of MOB in WT was the most complicated, and there were competitive relationships among species in WP. The structure of the network in HP was unstable, and therefore, it was vulnerable to environmental disturbances. Methylocystis (Type II) and Methylomonas (Type I) were the most important keystone species in the entire urban water cycle system. Overall, these findings broaden the understanding of the distribution and interaction patterns of MOB communities in an urban water cycle system and provide valuable clues for ecosystem restoration and environmental management.

AB  - With the loss of natural and semi-natural habitats, the diversity and the amount of ecosystem services that can be provided in the agricultural landscape are diminishing, and self-regulatory abilities decrease. The aim of the research (72 sample plots, 1 x 1 km squares, mean time span equal to 8 years) was to recognise the changes in the number and length of woody (tree or shrub) linear landscape elements, and the number of solitary trees in Wielkopolska region to verify how rapid development of agriculture in Poland at the beginning of the 21st century affects the landscape structure. The analyses show a decline by 9.3% (from 2.17 to 1.97 km/km(2)) in length of woody linear elements, 7.4% (from 16.5 to 15.0 per km(2)) in number of woody linear elements, and 14.6% (from 28.8 to 24.4 per km(2)) in solitary trees. The loss was significantly faster in the period (2017-2018) of liberalisation of the regulations on tree and shrub removal, mainly due to a high rate of removal in plots located in residential areas. The decrease in length of woody linear elements occurred in all the categories of their location distinguished in the study (by 9-41% in a category). The highest loss occurred in the woody linear elements located along melioration ditches and water courses, along roads, and in the outskirt of towns. These changes are like those occurred in the 20th century in Western Europe. The decrease in the number of woody linear landscape elements and solitary trees can be considered an indicator of the unsustainable agriculture management.

AB  - Excessive land consumption, loss of biodiversity, social lack of cohesion and loss of identity, privatization of the landscape or temporary mobility costs are some of the impacts of urban sprawl. This paper focuses on the analysis of daily mobility in a municipality of the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona, Matadepera. The temporary costs of mobility, by car and on foot, are analyzed using two different network analysis methods: 1) OD cost matrix from each housing portal to basic services and 2) calculation of service areas from different points of interest. The objective is to quantify and map the population's accessibility in order to explain the high level of dependence on private transport. The results demonstrate how urban dispersion, especially in high slope areas, directly affects the mode of transport and hinders the use of more sustainable mobility alternatives.

AB  - We find that the movement of urban house prices in the U.S. has become more synchronized since the early 2000s. The elevated comovement is substantial, widespread, occurring for the majority of city-pairs, and continued even after the housing market turned to bust in 2007. We investigate whether and to what extent the comovement increase can be explained by banking integration following deregulations in the banking industry. Utilizing novel measures of city-level banking integration based on bank deposit data, we find that an increase in banking integration leads to an increase in the comovement of urban house prices. City-pairs that are more connected through national banking system had experienced a greater increase in comovement, after controlling for a variety of explanatory variables. Our findings can be interpreted as spillover effect, rather than substitution effect, of banking integration at work. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - SARS-CoV-2 dynamics
AB  - Properties of city-level commuting networks are expected to influence epidemic potential of cities and modify the speed and spatial trajectory of epidemics when they occur. In this study, we use aggregated mobile phone user data to reconstruct commuter mobility networks for Bangkok (Thailand) and Dhaka (Bangladesh), two megacities in Asia with populations of 16 and 21 million people, respectively. We model the dynamics of directly-transmitted infections (such as SARS-CoV-2) propagating on these commuting networks, and find that differences in network structure between the two cities drive divergent predicted epidemic trajectories: the commuting network in Bangkok is composed of geographically-contiguous modular communities and epidemic dispersal is correlated with geographic distance between locations, whereas the network in Dhaka has less distinct geographic structure and epidemic dispersal is less constrained by geographic distance. We also find that the predicted dynamics of epidemics vary depending on the local topology of the network around the origin of the outbreak. Measuring commuter mobility, and understanding how commuting networks shape epidemic dynamics at the city level, can support surveillance and preparedness efforts in large cities at risk for emerging or imported epidemics.

AB  - Understanding human influence on ecosystems and their services is crucial to achieve sustainable development and ensure the conservation of biodiversity. In this context, the human footprint index (HFI) represents the anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems and the natural environment. Our objective was to characterize the HFI in Southern Patagonia (Argentina) across the landscape, qualifying the differences among the main ecological areas and especially the forested landscapes. We also assessed the potential utility of HFI to identify priority conservation areas according to their wilderness quality and potential biodiversity values. We created a HFI map (scores varied from 0 representing high wilderness quality to 1 representing maximum human impact) using variables related to direct (e.g. infrastructure) and indirect (e.g. derived from economic activities) human impacts, including settlements, accessibility, oil industry, and sheep production. HFI varied significantly across the natural landscapes, being lower (0.07-0.11) in remote ecosystems close to the Andes Mountains and higher (0.38-0.40) in southern areas close to the provincial capital city. Forested landscapes presented different impact values, which were directly related to the economical values of the different forest types. We determined that the current protected area network is not equally distributed across the different ecological areas and forest types. Priority conservation areas were also identified using the fragmentation produced by the human impact, the patch size, and the potential biodiversity values. HFI can present high compatibility with other land-use management decision making tools, acting as a complement to the existing tools for conservation planning or management.

AB  - In recent decades, there has been an intensification of the socioeconomic and environmental drivers of pandemics, including ecosystem conversion, meat consumption, urbanization, and connectivity among cities and countries. This paper reviews how these four systemic drivers help explain the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent emerging infectious diseases, and the policies that can be adopted to mitigate their risks. Land-use change and meat consumption increase the likelihood of pathogen spillover from animals to people. The risk that such zoonotic outbreaks will then spread to become pandemics is magnified by growing urban populations and the networks of trade and travel within and among countries. Zoonotic spillover can be mitigated through habitat protection and restrictions on the wildlife trade. Containing infectious disease spread requires a high degree of coordination among institutions across geographic jurisdictions and economic sectors, all backed by international investment and cooperation.

AB  - Urban areas are associated with high levels of habitat fragmentation. For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human habitation, including residential gardens. 'Hedgehog Street' is a public engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important. Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0% creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8% of non-Champions stated that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring holes: only 11.4% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2% of gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0% of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those householders who are not innately "wildlife-friendly", and to quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of individual movement and, ultimately, populations.

AB  - Mobility monitoring in urban environments provides valuable insights into pedestrian and vehicle movement. Understanding the causes and effects of changing mobility patterns can help city officials and businesses optimize operations and support economic development. In this paper, we introduce MobIntel, a privacy-centric alternative to visual surveillance for mobility monitoring. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the MobIntel sensor network, the associated cloud-based processing system, and the web-based visualization portal. We evaluate system capacity and accuracy based on real-life data collected from a deployment in downtown West Palm Beach, FL, spanning 14 months. We offer sample use cases where pedestrian activity patterns revealed by MobIntel can be helpful to the city government. Finally, we discuss several obstacles that must be overcome to transition from pedestrian counting to trajectory monitoring. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current academic debate suggests that landscape architects have a crucial role in the conservationof engaging of biodiversity within urban and peri-urban contexts. By modulating the visual and physical interaction between humans and wildlife habitats, landscape architecture projects foster an aesthetic experience of biodiversity, contributing to shaping human understanding of its ecological value. This article discusses the relationship between landscape architecture and the promotion of biodiversity in Italy through a critical reading of a variety of design interventions ranging from the enhancement of sites included within nature reserves, to the reconstruction of lost natural habitats, to the inclusion of existing habitats in newly designed urban landscapes. Proposing four different typologies of spatial practices, defined according to the projects' ability to engage visual perception and bodily movement, this paper aims at positioning the Italian context within the current global discussion on the role of landscape architecture in eliciting an aesthetic experience of biodiversity.

AB  - Linear infrastructures (e.g., roads, railways, pipelines, and powerlines) pose a serious threat to wildlife, due to the risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions (roadkills). The placement of mitigation measures, such as crossing structures, should consider species' life cycles and ecological requirements. Such an assessment would require data collection over large areas, which may be possible by employing citizen science. In this study, we aimed to identify spatio-temporal trends of roadkill occurrence using citizen science data from one of the most urbanized and biodiversity-rich regions of Italy. Temporal trends were analyzed using generalized additive models, while landscape patterns were assessed by identifying significant thresholds over land cover gradients, related to increases in relative roadkill abundance, by employing threshold indicator taxa analysis. Our approach recorded a total of 529 roadkills, including 33 different species, comprising 13 mammal, 10 bird, 6 reptile, and 2 amphibian species. Statistical analysis indicated significant temporal trends for the red fox, the European hedgehog, the stone marten and the European badger, with peaks in roadkill occurrence between the winter and spring months. Relative roadkill abundance increased mostly in landscapes with anthropogenic land cover classes, such as complex cultivations, orchards, or urban surfaces. Our results allowed us to develop a map of potential roadkill risk that could assist in planning the placement of mitigation measures. Citizen science contributions from highly populated areas allowed data collection over a large area and a dense road network, and also directly led to the evaluation of management decisional options.

AB  - Among the many concerns for biodiversity in the Anthropocene, recent reports of flying insect loss are particularly alarming, given their importance as pollinators, pest control agents, and as a food source. Few insect monitoring programmes cover the large spatial scales required to provide more generalizable estimates of insect responses to global change drivers. We ask how climate and surrounding habitat affect flying insect biomass using data from the first year of a new monitoring network at 84 locations across Germany comprising a spatial gradient of land cover types from protected to urban and crop areas. Flying insect biomass increased linearly with temperature across Germany. However, the effect of temperature on flying insect biomass flipped to negative in the hot months of June and July when local temperatures most exceeded long-term averages. Land cover explained little variation in insect biomass, but biomass was lowest in forests. Grasslands, pastures, and orchards harboured the highest insect biomass. The date of peak biomass was primarily driven by surrounding land cover, with grasslands especially having earlier insect biomass phenologies. Standardised, large-scale monitoring provides key insights into the underlying processes of insect decline and is pivotal for the development of climate-adapted strategies to promote insect diversity. In a temperate climate region, we find that the positive effects of temperature on flying insect biomass diminish in a German summer at locations where temperatures most exceeded long-term averages. Our results highlight the importance of local adaptation in climate change-driven impacts on insect communities.

AB  - With the rapid development changes and the special land-use patterns, coal-based cities (CBCs) have faced many critical sustainability issues such as the effective use of land resources, the mitigation of land supply-demand contradictions. How does the development of CBCs in China affected local land-use changes and what status does each land type occupy? The relevant mechanisms are not clear. Shuozhou City, a typical growth CBC in China, was therefore selected as the research area to investigate the land use evolution by introducing the theory of land use ecological niche (LUEN). The dynamic changes of land use from 1990 to 2018 were analyzed, and cultivated land played a significant role in the process of land transformation with the highest utilization degree, followed by grassland and construction land. The cultivated land and mining land occupied the economic niche, construction land occupied the social niche, and forest land, grassland, and water area occupied the natural niche. From 2010 to 2015, construction land and mining land occupied the prevailing position of the land-use system. The substantial expansion and compression of the land use ecological niche in Shuozhou City were in the early stage of city development, and there was not a major change in the later stage. In general, the spatial distribution of land use ecological niche was in the east-west direction. Therefore, the production function zone, living function zone, and ecological function zone were delineated. The status, role, and function of land use type should be prioritized when developing land-use planning, considering the mechanisms of land-use change. Governments should actively break through the restrictions of coal resources mining on land use change while giving full play to the role of land resource assets in promoting sustainable development.

AB  - The decline of natural capital resulting from urbanization has triggered phenomena such as landscape fragmentation and loss of biodiversity. European institutions have published documents and strategies with the purpose of counteracting such phenomena. In this regard, in 2020 the European Commission released the European Biodiversity Strategy 2030, which defines biodiversity conservation objectives and promotes the implementation of green infrastructures (GIs) designed to supply ecosystem services, which can increase people's well-being. The scientific literature has scarcely dealt with methods for drafting guidance documents (guidelines) to support public administrations in the implementation of GIs. In this study, we aim at designing and applying a method for drafting GI guidelines. We apply the method to the Metropolitan City of Cagliari, the main urbanized area-which partially includes the former Province of Cagliari-of Sardinia (Italy). According to the findings, a proposal of GI guidelines should be rooted in context analysis and consistency checks and should be tailored to specific geographical and institutional contexts. The preliminary guidelines described in this study are designed to provide public administrations with GI guidelines based on scientific, technical, and cultural considerations, and are aimed at supporting an effective implementation of GIs and a GI network.

AB  - The arboreal ecosystem is vitally important to global and local biogeochemical processes, the maintenance of biodiversity in natural systems, and human health in urban environments. The ability to collect samples, observations, and data to conduct meaningful scientific research is similarly vital. The primary methods and modes of access remain limited and difficult. In an online survey, canopy researchers (n = 219) reported a range of challenges in obtaining adequate samples, including similar to 10% who found it impossible to procure what they needed. Currently, these samples are collected using a combination of four primary methods: (1) sampling from the ground; (2) tree climbing; (3) constructing fixed infrastructure; and (4) using mobile aerial platforms, primarily rotorcraft drones. An important distinction between instantaneous and continuous sampling was identified, allowing more targeted engineering and development strategies. The combination of methods for sampling the arboreal ecosystem provides a range of possibilities and opportunities, particularly in the context of the rapid development of robotics and other engineering advances. In this study, we aim to identify the strategies that would provide the benefits to a broad range of scientists, arborists, and professional climbers and facilitate basic discovery and applied management. Priorities for advancing these efforts are (1) to expand participation, both geographically and professionally; (2) to define 2-3 common needs across the community; (3) to form and motivate focal teams of biologists, tree professionals, and engineers in the development of solutions to these needs; and (4) to establish multidisciplinary communication platforms to share information about innovations and opportunities for studying arboreal ecosystems.

AB  - This study revisits the debate surrounding the definition of neighborhood boundaries by addressing the disconnect between the city's Administrative Neighborhoods and its functional organization. A method is proposed for dividing the city into more meaningful units through the spatial distribution of urban activities by retrieving data from Google Places. The dataset was pre-processed and spatially divided into Functional Clusters. A comparison between functional and administrative subdivisions of the city was undertaken, from which three overall conclusions could be drawn. First, a function-based city partition allows economically active urban areas to become the neighborhood's center, thereby creating a polynuclear neighborhood structure that would potentially encourage greater cross-movement of people throughout the city. Second, the specialization of activities becomes more evident in Functional Clusters than in Administrative Neighborhoods. Third, access to up-to-date data makes possible a timely diagnosis of the quantity and diversity of urban activities-i.e., economic activities, services, and facilities-through Google Places data. The value of this contribution is to inform urban decision-making and policies in order to better balance the provision of a neighborhood's economic activity.

AB  - Competition for land is increasing as demand for multiple land uses and ecosystem services rises. Land regulation of the principles of landscape ecology is necessary to develop more sustainable approaches to land use planning. The research evaluated the present land patterns and determined best practices for its regulation of Dongwang Township in Quyang County, located in the Taihang Mountain area of Hebei Province, China. The research used the landscape ecology theory to construct an index system for landscape pattern analysis based on the GIS and Fragstats 3.3 software. In this study, we examined the specific reasons that landscape ecology is superior to traditional methods in land consolidation planning and design, which is conducive to the comprehensive development of land ecological benefits. Landscape ecological planning can effectively reduce landscape fragmentation and improve intensive management. The result found that the descending order of the Shannon index was current landscape, landscape ecological planning, and traditional planning. Landscape ecological planning could protect the natural diversity than traditional planning. Landscape ecological planning enables the creation of long corridors, with higher densities and connectivity and lower average corridor widths than traditional planning. Besides, it can improve ecological service function values in the study area to varying degrees, thus discouraging residents from limiting themselves to grain production. This research has great potential to improve the visibility of ecosystem services in local land use planning and, thus, to improve the ecological functioning of future landscapes.

AB  - Dark Matter, a research by design thesis, investigates the ecological value of human remains, and their latent agency for advancing biological diversity in urban cemeteries. The project proposes an expedited aboveground decomposition process (Natural Organic Reduction) to convert human tissue and bone into nutrient-rich soil-like materials. Following decomposition, human remains merge with non-human ecologies over time to offer mourners an extended period of ceremony and remembrance. Transference of energy and matter to adjacent non-human life is emphasized in the transition, and a memorial's embodiment in physical space is expanded to include natural systems and ecological productivity. The funerary landscape is thus decentralized from a static site of memorial to an evolving memorial system that invites engagement with the living.
   In an age of pandemic, mass extinction, and deepening climate crises, a commitment to an environmentally ethical funeral practice connects the loss of the individual to global patterns of ecological ruin and environmental decline. These layered scales of grief are experienced at divergent timescales, suggesting the need for a new typology of memorial landscape that positions the human life within larger natural cycles of birth, death, decay, and metamorphosis. Rituals of commemoration, management, and activism would be alchemized to unexpected outcomes when the program of memorial, ecological preserve, and a theater for collective actions are merged. Dark Matter proposes a network of biodiverse public landscapes where bodily death events meaningfully contribute to ecological systems of propulsive regenerative life.

AB  - Accelerated land use change is a current challenge for environmental management worldwide. Given the urgent need to incorporate economic and ecological goals in landscape planning, cost-effective conservation strategies are required. In this study, we validated the benefit of fusing imagery from multiple sensors to assess the impact of landscape changes on ecosystem services (ES) and their economic values in the Long County, Shaanxi Province, China. We applied several landscape metrics to assess the local spatial configuration over 15 years (2004-2019) from fused imageries. Using Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor 3 (IRS LISS 3) imageries fused for 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019, we reclassified land use/land cover (LULC) changes, through the rotation forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm. We proposed an equivalent monetary metric for estimating the ES values, which also could be used in the whole China. Results showed that agriculture farmland and unused land decreased their spatial distribution over time, with an observed increase on woodland, grassland, water bodies and built-up area. Our findings suggested that the patterns of landscape uniformity and connectivity improved, while the distribution of landscape types stabilized, while the landscape diversity had a slight improvement. The overall ES values increased (4.34%) under a benefit transfer approach, mainly concerning woodland and grassland. A sensitivity analysis showed the selected economic value (EV) was relevant and suitable for the study area associated with our ES for LULC changes. We suggested that changes in landscape patterns affected the ESV trends, while the increases on some LULC classes slightly improved the landscape diversity. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we recommend that local authorities and environmental practitioners should balance the economic benefits and ecological gains in different landscapes to achieve a sustainable development from local to regional scales.

AB  - Aim To determine the interplay between climate and land use changes in driving population dynamics in a butterfly species, Coenonympha hero, at the southern limit of its distribution. Location French Jura massif and Europe. Methods We analysed patterns of genetic diversity distribution at 817 loci in 136 butterflies from 31 sites using NGS to infer the genetic structure and population size changes over time, using two methods of demographic inference (SNP frequency spectrum analyses and coalescent ABC inferences). We then characterized the climate and land use descriptors of C. hero geographic distribution using species distribution modelling (SDM) and ordination method and compared demographic changes to changes in climatically suitable areas. Results Coenonympha hero persists in the Jura massif as three core populations that share a common history of decline in two steps: an old decline and a more recent decline that resulted in population fragmentation, the southernmost sites being the most threatened (lowest genetic diversity). Climate change during the Wurm glaciation is presumably the main factor explaining the first demographic decline. The second decline started 2000 years ago possibly under increased human pressure as suggested by recent extinctions in several sites nowadays characterized by urban and agricultural surfaces. Both climate and land use variables are important descriptors of C. hero distribution, as SDM predictions were improved by adding aridity index, altitude and land use to bioclimatic predictors. Its habitats include forests in north-eastern Europe and grasslands in the Jura massif. Main conclusions Using SDM and genetic demographic inferences, we identified a persistent glacial refuge for the species in Europe. We show that although this relictual population has declined and fragmented under the combined effects of climate warming and anthropization, the metapopulation is still functional but requires particular conservation attention to maintain its connectivity, and to favour the local persistence of this highly endangered butterfly species.

AB  - The urban spaces, in which public life occurs, may take place in the cities with different shapes and sizes, ranging from the small activity areas to the big urban squares. Different factors such as introverted or extroverted social life, organic or geometric urban fabric of cities depending on planned or unplanned development may be effective in the formation of the aforementioned urban spaces. Within this context, the question of how the urban spaces in the unplanned cities complete each other in the urban open space network system and which role do they have in the spatial integrity come to the forefront, different from the planned urban spaces. In the present study, it was aimed to conduct the application study for the analysis of the urban integration and morphological components of the issue of squares, which are urban spaces, over the case of Mugla Saburhane Square, which is an unplanned square. The study, in which the analysis methods of the space syntax and morphological components were used together, was conducted in three phases completing each other. In the macro scale phase, the space syntax, serial perception and isovist analysis methods, are used and the open space network system of the city and the level of integration of the square with the city are revealed. In the meso scale phase, analyses are made for the dynamic-static spatial structure, positive-negative space setup, and the material-color-fabric properties in the ground plane of the two-dimensional framework properties of the square. In the micro scale phase, the subjects on the centricity structure of the third dimension of the square, orientation properties, the spatial closeness properties due to horizontal and vertical planes and the spatial components of the square are examined. The square may be defined as an applied study in which analyses suitable for the theoretical content including the macro scale structure of the city and the meso and micro scale detail structuring issues which lead to the formation of the squares were conducted on the case of a square. The study was limited with the Saburhane Square, an historical settlement of Mugla, which has dominant organic urban fabric, is connected to city and the other open spaces of the city, has intense use characteristics and can always reflect the traditional architectural characteristics and square identity. Based on the macro scale analyses, it was observed that organic urban fabric was dominant in historical settlement region that is the Saburhane Square and its surroundings, Karamugla Street, in which the square was located, had an axis role associating the city parts with organic and geometric fabric with each other, Cumhuriyet Square had gathering space characteristics known across the city and Saburhane Square had gathering space characteristics across the neighborhood. Based on the analyses performed with the space syntax method, it was observed that Saburhane Square came into forefront in integrating with the city and it was an important focus in spatial connection and integration. In the isovist analyses based on the square, it was understood that the region is characterized by the corner bakery, monumental green component, mosque, and minaret; and building units on main road axis can be perceived effectively in the arrivals to the square from different directions. It was observed that the empty spaces were 1.
   76 times greater than the full spaces in the organic urban fabric region surrounding the square, the building surfaces and the vertical garden walls were effective in identifying the borders of the square, the existence of the intense and effective green components brought the square a soft space characteristic, the amorphous form in the ground plane of the square reflected negative characteristics due to convex characteristics, it had a dynamic space characteristic in terms of the width-length ratio, the monuments and green components were the components enriching the spatial structure of the square, the square had different centers as secular, otherworldly, geometric and functional, and the fact that the units surrounding the square were opened directly to the square affected the spatial liveliness positively. The present study is considered to be important in revealing the necessity of preparing such guides in the renewal studies for unplanned squares or in the new plannings. The fact that space syntax, isovist, and morphological analyses were used together in the study is considered to contribute to the related studies as it enables integrated analysis and evaluation in different stages ranging from grand urban scale to spot detail scale.

AB  - Urban growth accompanied by sharp environmental changes has degraded ecosystem services (ESs). Green infrastructure (GI) is premised on the various social and ecological benefits of high-quality ESs that humans acquire from natural ecosystems; hence, the conservation of GI can be considered an effective way to safeguard ecological security and contain rapid urban sprawl and outward expansion. Taking Hangzhou, a typical ecologically sensitive but rapidly urbanizing area, as the case study, a GI network was established according to the quantification and mapping of diverse ES values. The equivalent ES value in China based on Xie?s table was adjusted by calculating the priority index and the spatial difference index, and then the adjusted value was applied to obtain the spatial distribution of the comprehensive ES value in Hangzhou. On this basis, the high-level spatial agglomeration area with the highest comprehensive ES value was extracted as a hub using Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis, while the accumulated channel with the lowest cost of comprehensive ES value was generated as a corridor through the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. Both the established GI network and its buffer were delineated as the GI conservation area, which further supported the revision of the construction area in the Hangzhou Urban Master Plan (2020e2040), which was formulated by urban development policy to coordinate the conflicts between rapid urbanization and ecological protection. This study provides a characteristic example of how to establish GI networks based on ES evaluations and provides a strong reference for land-use and environmental planning in other developing countries and regions that are exposed to severe ecological deterioration.

AB  - China's Green Space System Planning (GSSP) research has gradually expanded from central urban areas to municipal and provincial scales in recent years. Besides, the research on the role of green space in the water environment has also attracted much attention. However, the study of green corridors usually ignored hydrological data, which widespread absence especially in the large area scale. And the scale of green corridor construction mainly focused on central urban areas. This paper took China's Fujian province as an example. Based on the DEM elevation data, the article identified blue corridors without hydrological data. In addition, the green corridors were determined based on the land use data. According to the green corridors and blue corridors protection, we identified the ecological networks and nodes by the network analysis method. The results showed that the blue corridors identified by DEM data were consistent with the hydrological status quo. The regional status of the identified ecological networks and nodes were basically in line with their characteristics, proving the value of the planning methods. Finally, based on the identification results, suggestions for Fujian's ecological networks and nodes are put forward.

AB  - Green space is an important part of composite urban spatial systems. Therefore, reasonable planning strategies based on scientifically sound predictions of temporal and spatial changes in green space are critical for maintaining urban ecological environments, ensuring the health of residents, and maintaining social stability. However, existing forecasting models discount the impacts of urban social economy on green space. To address this gap, we constructed a system dynamics and cellular automata (SD-CA) coupling model that integrated the socioeconomic system and generated multiple scenarios. The results showed that at the current pace of socioeconomic development, Beijing's central district will experience an overall reduction in green space and a decline in its integrity and diversity by 2035. If the population of this area reaches 9.29 million by 2035 and the GDP maintains an average growth rate of 6.1%, the areas of various land types will exhibit little change by 2035, and green space will be optimized to a certain extent. However, if the study area's population decreases to 8.59 million by 2035 and the average GDP growth rate drops to 4.9%, the fragmentation, connectivity, and diversity index of green space will all increase significantly by 2035, and green space will be clearly optimized. We propose scientifically grounded strategies for maximizing the ecological functions and economic benefits of green space through optimized green space patterns, considered from a policy-oriented perspective of promoting socioeconomic development.

AB  - The road network in an urban area plays an essential role in mediating the mobility of people and goods and in supporting various social and economic activities. In urban road networks, accessibility is one of the crucial aspects of evaluating their performance. The existing measures from urban science focus on practical user-based accessibility utilizing various data, including human mobility patterns, transport networks, and land use layout. While such measures can present a comprehensive picture of accessibility, they hardly describe how a single factor, essentially the structural and topological patterns of road networks, determines accessibility level. Meanwhile, the random-walk-based accessibility used for various complex networks can effectively analyze structurewise accessibility. However, we claim that the frequently used version of the random-walk-based accessibility only considers the topology of networks, and thus often neglects important geometric information such as the spatial physical distances in road networks. In this study, we modify the existing random-walk-based accessibility method to be more applicable for road networks by including information of geometric distance. To evaluate the effect of the distance information on accessibility, we analyze the empirical road networks of three global metropolitan cities with different structures. We find that our spatial accessibility captures the disparity in spatial and topological structures and highlights spatially accessible areas in different cities. Especially, our methodology brings a dramatic change in the cities with heterogeneous road patterns. We also compare the spatial distribution patterns of our proposed accessibility in the three cities and discuss how road structures are related to the accessibility distributions.

AB  - It is observed that, in contemporaneity, it has been occurred a return movement to the built public space of cities. From the perspective of urban planning, this movement corroborates what is called, in this research, by projectual activism, in contrast to spontaneous movements of occupation of those spaces. Therefore, this article aims to investigate whether what we call projectual activism has defined the interventions that have been proposed for these particular spaces. Thus, the article works with the hypothesis that projectual actions, when arising from this activism, contribute to making the built public space into an object-commodity within the capitalist system. Having as theoretical reference the notion of technical devices and social dispositions, it is argued in the end that projectual activism debates the logic of urban planning, its homogenizing, mediatic and privatizes character in opposition to the space's condition as a place of meeting and debate.

AB  - Even as it promotes economic development, the rapid development of expressways has important effects on its surrounding land use, landscape patterns, and ecological environment. In this study, we took the 10 km buffer zone of the expressways network in Nanping City as the study area with the support of GIS. Changes in land use, landscape patterns, and ecosystem-services value along expressways were analyzed using buffer zone analysis, statistical analysis, model of changes in land use and landscape indices, and ecosystem services value model. The results showed that forest land was the main land-use type along expressways in Nanping City from 2005 to 2015. The construction land area increased significantly when it was closer to the expressways, while the area of cultivated land decreased significantly when it was closer to the expressways. For the temporal changes, the increase in the area of forest land and construction land was mainly due to the transfer of grassland and cultivated land. The patch density and shape of construction land showed increasing and complex trends, respectively, while the patch density and shape of other land types showed decreasing and simple trends. The patch distribution of construction land and forest land was more concentrated, while other land types tended to be scattered, especially unused land. The influence of expressway on the surrounding landscape pattern was about 4 km. Expressway mainly caused the increase of landscape patch density and diversity index, and the decrease of landscape shape index and aggregation index. The value of ecosystem services in forest land and water gradually decreased and increased, respectively when they were closer to the expressways. Four kilometers was the range of influence of the expressway network on ecosystem-services value in Nanping City. The study provides a decision-making reference for regional ecological

AB  - Is an elite consolidating among the leadership of community-based organizations (CBOs) in U.S. cities? Ethnographers identify a privatized turn in urban governance, with some nonprofit civic leaders becoming a cohesive group with enormous influence in local affairs. However, while researchers propose elite consolidation has occurred and created a more hierarchical, technocratic, and unipolar civic field, these structural changes have not been directly assessed. In this paper, I reintroduce an interorganizational network perspective to elite consolidation and evaluate how interlocking directorates among CBOs in Cleveland, OH, and Austin, TX constitute relationships among civic leaders over twenty years. Results indicate boards of directors are constituting a new civic elite, and that hierarchical interlock tendencies doubled in both cities between 1998 and 2016. The core of the networks appear to be organizations traditionally important in urban governance, though, and community analysis reveals power sharing among elite groups in the cities rather than singular dominant communities, indicating as situation of "elitist pluralism." These findings offer a new perspective on the problem of elite consolidation in civil society, and offer a benchmark for future analysis of civic elites.

AB  - Urban mobility is a concept that has been employed in various publications and is used by different areas of knowledge. Urban mobility is indispensable for the consolidation of the right to the city, being a fundamental dimension for the everyday lives understanding of the individuals and groups. This article discusses the possibility of incorporating the concept of everyday urban mobility in occupational therapy. For this purpose, it is presented the concept of urban mobility by different areas of knowledge, such as urban planning, engineering, geography, and social sciences. Based on the construction of an expanded understanding of this concept, we sought to reflect on how the articulation between the concept of urban mobility and practices or fundamentals of the profession has been doing. With support in the literature of the area, four possibilities of articulation between urban mobility and occupational therapy were categorized: urban mobility as (1) a component of the occupational therapy evaluation, (2) an occupational therapeutic resource/tool, (3) the objective of the intervention and (4) the action in urban planning public policies. Considering the dimensions related to urban mobility, such as the social, physical, and attitudinal factors related to its effectiveness, integrated in a relevant way to the everyday life of the people; it is understood that this concept can be incorporated by occupational therapists in their professional practices and their studies for the realization of a critical action that aims the social participation of the individuals with whom the professional work with.

AB  - European rural landscapes contain high nature value farmlands that, in addition to being the main economic activity in many rural areas, host habitats and species of great conservation value. The maintenance of these farming systems largely depends on traditional ecological knowledge and the rural lifestyles of the local populations. However, they have not been sufficiently appreciated and protected, and as a result, they are currently threatened. In this study, which was performed in the Madrid region (central Spain), we analyse the social-ecological changes of the rural landscape after the establishment of a protected natural area network. The obtained results highlight a significant loss of these high nature value farming systems and a marked increase in the rewilding processes characterised by scrub-forest transition and the development of forest systems. These processes are linked to the disruption of the transmission of traditional ecological knowledge, which may imply negative consequences for both the high biocultural diversity that these systems host and the cultural identity and the socioeconomics of the rural populations that live there. A useful methodological tool is provided for social-ecological land planning and the design of effective management strategies for the conservation of rural cultural landscapes.

AB  - Background: Mapping the spatial distribution of the dengue vector Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and accurately predicting its abundance are crucial for designing effective vector control strategies and early warning tools for dengue epidemic prevention. Socio-ecological and landscape factors influence Ae. aegypti abundance. Therefore, we aimed to map the spatial distribution of female adult Ae. aegypti and predict its abundance in northeastern Thailand based on socioeconomic, climate change, and dengue knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) and/or landscape factors using machine learning (ML)-based system.
   Method: A total of 1066 females adult Ae. aegypti were collected from four villages in northeastern Thailand during January-December 2019. Information on household socioeconomics, KAP regarding climate change and dengue, and satellite-based landscape data were also acquired. Geographic information systems (GIS) were used to map the household-based spatial distribution of female adult Ae. aegypti abundance (high/low). Five popular supervised learning models, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF), were used to predict females adult Ae. aegypti abundance (high/low). The predictive accuracy of each modeling technique was calculated and evaluated. Important variables for predicting female adult Ae. aegypti abundance were also identified using the best-fitted model.
   Results: Urban areas had higher abundance of female adult Ae. aegypti compared to rural areas. Overall, study respondents in both urban and rural areas had inadequate KAP regarding climate change and dengue. The average landscape factors per household in urban areas were rice crop (47.4%), natural tree cover (17.8%), built-up area (13.2%), permanent wetlands (21.2%), and rubber plantation (0%), and the corresponding figures for rural areas were 12.1, 2.0, 38.7, 40.1 and 0.1% respectively. Among all assessed models, RF showed the best prediction performance (socioeconomics: area under curve, AUC = 0.93, classification accuracy, CA = 0.86, F1 score = 0.85; KAP: AUC = 0.95, CA = 0.92, F1 = 0.90; landscape: AUC = 0.96, CA = 0.89, F1 = 0.87) for female adult Ae. aegypti abundance. The combined influences of all factors further improved the predictive accuracy in RF model (socioeconomics + KAP + landscape: AUC = 0.99, CA = 0.96 and F1 = 0.95). Dengue prevention practices were shown to be the most important predictor in the RF model for female adult Ae. aegypti abundance in northeastern Thailand.
   Conclusion: The RF model is more suitable for the prediction of Ae. aegypti abundance in northeastern Thailand. Our study exemplifies that the application of GIS and machine learning systems has significant potential for understanding the spatial distribution of dengue vectors and predicting its abundance. The study findings might help optimize vector control strategies, future mosquito suppression, prediction and control strategies of epidemic arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika). Such strategies can be incorporated into One Health approaches applying transdisciplinary approaches considering human-vector and agro-environmental interrelationships.

AB  - Ecological monitoring (EM) is a significant scientific topic recognized for its potential for providing basic, but vital, data for ecosystem assessment to address sustainability issues. However, a monitoring framework that can lead to EM information and data being used accurately in ecosystem management and policy design is currently lacking. China's Ecological Redline Policy (ERP), one of the first national policies utilizing multiple ecosystem service assessment, requires strict monitoring to reveal policy effects on ecosystem services regulation. In this study, we developed a transdisciplinary framework to build up the ecological redline monitoring network in Shanghai metropolitan area, using: biodiversity, landscape structure, ecosystem function, and stakeholder opinions. We suggest that standard monitoring be based on remote sensing monitoring, supplemented by ground truth monitoring, to form a standard 'Space-Sky-Ground' integrated monitoring network. We also present key lessons learnt from EM practices in Shanghai. This work provides new insights on integrating EM into ERP implementation and ecosystem management on city scale, by illustrating the science-policy process and ER monitoring standards from initial design to application in policy.

AB  - Sub-Saharan African crop production largely relies on smallholder farms, located both in urban and agricultural landscapes. In this context, the investigation of plant and pollinator diversity and their interactions is of primary importance since both these factors are threatened by land use intensification and the consequent loss of natural habitats. In this study, we evaluated for the first time how plant and pollinator insect assemblages and interactions in Sub-Saharan farming conditions are shaped by land use intensification. To do that, we complemented biodiversity field surveys in Northern Tanzania with a modern DNA metabarcoding approach to characterize the foraged plants and thus built networks describing plant-pollinator interactions at the individual insect level. Moreover, we coupled this information with quantitative traits of landscape composition and floral availability surrounding each farm. We found that pollinator richness decreased with increasing impervious and agricultural cover in the landscape, whereas the flower density at each farm correlated with pollinator richness. The intensification of agricultural land use and urbanization correlated with a higher foraging niche overlap among pollinators due to convergence of individuals' flower visiting strategies. Furthermore, within farms, the higher availability of floral resources drove lower niche overlap among individuals, while a greater flower visitors abundance shaped higher generalization at the networks level (H2 '), possibly due to increased competition. These mechanistic understandings leading to individuals' foraging niche overlap and generalism at the network level, could imply stability of interactions and of the pollination ecosystem service. Our integrative survey proved that plant-pollinator systems are largely affected by land use intensification and by local factors in smallholder farms of Sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, policies promoting nature-based solutions, among which the introduction of more pollinator-friendly practices by smallholder farmers, could be effective in mitigating the intensification of both urban and rural landscapes in this region, as well as in similar Sub-Saharan contexts.

AB  - Dispersal distance of bobcats (Lynx rufus) can be affected by many factors: age and sex, bobcat density, prey abundance, and landscape permeability. Female offspring typically remain near their natal range, whereas males travel farther distances. Studies report dispersal distances between 10 and 85 km, with distances >= 80 km being rare. We report dispersal distances of two male bobcats in the Southern High Plains of Texas, and one male bobcat from the Rio Grande Plains of South Texas. The two male bobcats of Southern High Plains traveled 63 and 133 km and the male bobcat of Rio Grande Plains traveled 100 km. Severe droughts occurred in both regions during dispersal, which may have influenced distance traveled. In all cases, it is likely that nearby available territories were occupied by older resident bobcats, thus eliciting the need for longer-distanced dispersal to secure a permanent home range.

AB  - Road networks and human density are major factors contributing to habitat fragmentation and loss, isolation of wildlife populations, and reduced genetic diversity. Terrestrial mammals are particularly sensitive to road networks and encroachment by human populations. However, there are limited assessments of the impacts of road networks and human density on population-specific nuclear genetic diversity, and it remains unclear how these impacts are modulated by life-history traits. Using generalized linear mixed models and microsatellite data from 1444 North American terrestrial mammal populations, we show that taxa with large home range sizes, dense populations, and large body sizes had reduced nuclear genetic diversity with increasing road impacts and human density, but the overall influence of life-history traits was generally weak. Instead, we observed a high degree of genus-specific variation in genetic responses to road impacts and human density. Human density negatively affected allelic diversity or heterozygosity more than road networks (13 vs. 5-7 of 25 assessed genera, respectively); increased road networks and human density also positively affected allelic diversity and heterozygosity in 15 and 6-9 genera, respectively. Large-bodied, human-averse species were generally more negatively impacted than small, urban-adapted species. Genus-specific responses to habitat fragmentation by ongoing road development and human encroachment likely depend on the specific capability to (i) navigate roads as either barriers or movement corridors, and (ii) exploit resource-rich urban environments. The nonuniform genetic response to roads and human density highlights the need to implement efforts to mitigate the risk of vehicular collisions, while also facilitating gene flow between populations of particularly vulnerable taxa.

AB  - Invasive species are a growing concern with increasing global connectivity. Feral pigeons (Columba livia) are widespread and invasive, thus their effective control is of keen international interest. The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the impact of a nation-wide Circuit Breaker (restricted human activities) in Singapore on first, the abundance of the feral pigeons and three urban commensals-the Javan myna (Acridotheres javanicus), common myna (A. tristis), and house crow (Corvus splendens) in different food source types; and second, the activity budgets of feral pigeons. A significant and progressive decline in feral pigeon abundance was observed in open food centres and feeding hotspots after the Circuit Breaker was implemented. While the house crow and common myna were less affected, the Javan myna abundance increased moderately at refuse collection centres during the Circuit Breaker and decreased significantly in green spaces after the Circuit Breaker. Changes in food abundance could also predict changes in feral pigeon abundance and its effect was greatest in feeding hotspots. A greater proportion of feral pigeons was observed foraging and moving with a smaller proportion seen resting with probable consequences on their reproductive capacity. Our study also cautions against drawing inferences on biological responses due to similar social restrictions without careful consideration of other ecological factors, like average flock size and time of the day, which also affected the proportion of pigeons foraging on natural versus anthropogenic food. In summary, our results advocate a food limitation approach to control the feral pigeon populations.

AB  - Manor parks are characteristic objects in the agricultural landscape of Poland. Lack of proper management after World War II, however, led to their devastation from a cultural point of view, but may allow the regeneration of rare and endangered species. The aim of our study was to determine if the presence of forests in the vicinity of manor parks will work as an accelerator of the regeneration process of oak-hornbeam and ancient forest species. Phytosociological analyses were conducted in manor parks adjacent to forests and not adjacent to the forest as well as natural forests. The total number of plant species, number and percentage share of ancient forest species, and plant species consistent with oak-hornbeam habitat were analyzed using a GLM model. Characteristic species were identified using detrended correspondence analysis. Parks adjacent to forests and natural forests showed higher numbers of total species, ancient forest species, and oak-hornbeam species compared with parks not adjacent to forests, but there were no differences in percentage shares of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam species. For all three types of studied objects, characteristic species could be identified. We conclude that adjacent forests allow greater regeneration of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam forest species in manor parks.

AB  - The development of urbanization is still expanding on the earth, and the rapid expansion of cities has changed the regional landscape pattern and significantly affected the value of regional ecosystem services in developing countries such as China. Zhongmu County, as the core area of Zhengzhou-Kaifeng integration, studying the temporal and spatial transformations of its landscape pattern and ecosystem service value (ESV) is of great significance to the region's sustainable development. Based on remote sensing images and socioeconomic data, this study aims to explore the landscape pattern of Zhongmu County from 2005 to 2018 and its impact on ESV. Research methods include an ESV equivalent factor method, landscape pattern index, spatial autocorrelation, and other methods. The results showed that: (1) During the study period, the patch density and shape complexity, landscape diversity, and fragmentation of the overall landscape in the study area continued to increase while landscape connectivity decreased. (2) The total amount of ESV increased by 10.05 million USD; ESV had certain differences in spatial distribution: high-value clusters were mainly located at the boundary of the Yellow River in the north, while low-value clusters had a significant eastward expansion trend. (3) ESV increased significantly in areas where cultivated land was transferred to waters and forests, and ESV in areas where waters transferred to construction land and cultivated land was significantly reduced. (4) ESV had a significant positive spatial correlation with patch density, edge density, mean patch fractal dimension, mean patch size, and the landscape shape index, and a spatially negative correlation with the contagion index and cohesion index. The spatial and temporal changes in landscape patterns and ESV were all mainly driven by the regional development "Zhengzhou-Kaifeng integration " policy. Therefore, the ESV can be improved, and the ecological security of the urban integration area can be guaranteed through policy measures such as optimizing the layout of construction land and adjusting the uniform distribution of green areas by the land-use policy.

One of the most pernicious impacts on streams is the release of urban effluents. Accordingly, understanding the fish assemblage patterns as well as the environmental drivers that modulate them in the context of urban streams which also are exposed to other land uses is mandatory. We evaluated the longitudinal patterns of fish assemblages in an urbanised Neotropical prairie stream exposed to downstream patches of different surrounding land uses. Several variables of water quality, in-stream habitat and riparian corridors were measured, and their relationships with fish metrics were explored. A fish metric selection protocol was implemented, and several multivariate analyses were used. Three main patterns of fish response were observed. Assemblage-level attributes as diversity, richness, biomass, number of families and trophic guilds and proportion of Characiformes and intolerant species were responsive to the natural gradient in habitat (pools) and riparian (riparian width) conditions expected in non-impacted lotic ecosystems. Conversely, a downstream continuum of recovery in water quality (dissolved oxygen, conductivity, NO3:NH4 and bacteriological loads) and habitat structure (sediment depth) would influence the distribution of fish species regarding their environmental tolerance and habitat preferences. Finally, local habitat aspects (nitrites, submerged macrophytes, bare soil cover and bank incisions by livestock) seemed relevant for the trophic structure (omnivorous species) of fish assemblages. A complex natural and anthropic longitudinal scenario together with local disruptions imposed by surrounding land uses were directive for fish.

AB  - Forest fragments are increasingly common in the tropics as pristine forests are cleared. Fragments stranded within cities are especially stress-prone due to their greatly altered environment and high human impacts. We review biodiversity and ecological studies from Bukit Timah, a tropical forest fragment in Singapore, to ask how this forest has contributed to our understanding of tropical ecology and fragmentation effects, and list the conservation values of this forest. Evidence from Amazonian fragments predicts that losses in diversity and forest function follow fragmentation, and although Bukit Timah has adhered to some of those predictions, other aspects of the forest appeared remarkably resilient. As might be expected, declines in plant, invertebrate, bird, and mammal diversity occurred not only historically but also across two surveys made about 20 years apart. In other ways Bukit Timah proved surprising. Aboveground biomass fluctuated but did not plummet drastically, and was comparable to levels found in primary forests in the region. The extirpation of large fauna did not appear to reduce the dispersal of large seeded plant species, likely due to continued dispersal by small-mammals and birds. Exotic tree species are confined to recovering secondary forest fringes and do not threaten the primary forest, except for perhaps shade tolerant Par ' a rubber and a handful of cultivated fruit trees. Studies of birds and plants found that life history differences could account for differences in genetic connectivity or isolation for different species, with population genetic implications for other taxa. Despite being a small fragment, new species of plants and animals continue to be discovered or re-discovered. Clearly, there are reasons to celebrate Bukit Timah as a forest fragment that withstood two centuries of human impacts. Nonetheless, many measures can be implemented to better secure its future.

AB  - The question of the contemporary urban periphery occupies a place in the disciplinary debate on the urban form. Not only because the so-called perfical city is dominant facing the historial city, but also because it concentrates results and confluences of various historical models. Collective housing was chosen as an instrument by various European movements such as the Garden City movement or the Siedlung settlements, which would later converge in the proposals of the Modern Movement.
   This combination, which allowed an association between architecture and social reformism, will be present in projects, distant in time, such as the siedlung or the Local Ambulatory Support Service, the S.A.A.L., where some stratagies and formal aspects are recovered to support an intervention in a large spectrum concept of city. In this article, we have tried to confront habitat, social housing, in the form of a neighborhood, based on a set of constructed examples, with a verifiable reality in the contemporary world, which is poor in meaning and fragile in terms of responsiveness.

AB  - This research was conducted to investigate the dynamics of airborne fungi using viable culture collection and in respect to different abiotic variables, including seasonal and intra-diurnal variations. A gravimetric method was used to sample airborne fungal deposition on potato dextrose agar plates on alternate days, for a year between April 2015 to March 2016. From 176 settle plate exposures, a total of 1197 mould and 283 yeast colony-forming units (CFU), 21 genera and 62 species were retrieved. The highest fungal spore count was recorded in February 2016, whereas the lowest count occurred in August 2015. The main constituents of the fungal airspora were attributed to Cladosporium (60.2%), Aspergillus (10.4%), Fusarium (9.4%), Alternaria (8.5%), and Ganoderma spp. (2.3%). Temperature was negatively correlated with total colony count (r = -0.231, p <= 0.05) or species richness (r = -0.267, p <= 0.001), while wind speed was positively correlated with total colony count (r = 0.484, p <= 0.001) or species richness (r = 0.257, p <= -0.001). The highest dispersal of fungal spores was obtained at 18:00, whereas the lowest fungal spores release was recorded at 00:00 (midnight). There were no significant differences in species composition and richness of the airborne fungal population between two study sites, the Industrial area and Qatar University Campus. The count of Alternaria spp. and Fusarium spp. were significantly higher at the Industrial area site, which corresponds to a higher CO2 level than the Qatar University site. This study lays the foundation for future work to assess the implications of such aeromycological data on public health.

AB  - Technology convergence is "the blurring of boundaries" between many sectors of technologies, resulting in the emergence of several new technologies. This phenomenon has been happening in many fields. While technology convergence has been analyzed often on a horizontal level, the whole landscape of technology movement among and within different system levels is still a question. Answers to this question can lead to an improvement of theory as well as new approaches for practitioners working in this field. We select urban innovation with its complex infrastructure as a test-bed in order to answer the question in a case study. We apply the Cooperative Patent Classification co-classification analysis to the USA patent data related to urban innovation in a systematic view from 1976 to 2018. Our study provides some insights into technology convergence in urban innovation based on the analysis of different system levels (vertical convergence) and within the super-system regarding city infrastructures (horizontal convergence). We find that both types of technology convergence occur in parallel. While some technological movements seem to be related to each other, others do not. This leads to the conclusion that at least in the case of related technology movements, researchers should integrate different system levels in their analysis.

AB  - The present paper combines the classification of hedgerows in relation to surface soil moisture with the consideration of drivers of change (environmental, demographic, and policy) affecting the areal extent of hedgerow land cover in central Spain. These landscapes have a high cultural significance and functionality that needs to be preserved and improved. The hedgerow network of a continental Mediterranean mountain was mapped and different levels of surface soil moisture were estimated utilising images of the satellite Sentinel-2. In addition, we analysed the areal extent of hedgerows from 1956 to the present in relation to slope, surface soil moisture and distance from the metropolitan area.
   In the last 70 years there has been a decrease in the surface area of hedgerows in central Spain. In the study area in particular, this decrease represents 48.26% of the total hedgerow network identified in 1956. 51.62% of abandoned hedgerow areas demonstrate a low degree of surface soil moisture and are usually located on slopes greater than 5%. As a result, driest hedgerows -less fertile, accessible and productive- have lost their functionality in many cases. In addition, urban expansion and the proximity to Madrid Metropolitan Area are processes that have caused the loss of 9.33% of the hedgerows in the study area since 1956.
   We integrated an overview of European, national and regional policies related to hedgerow functions involving biodiversity, cultural heritage, rural development and spatial planning. This paper contributes to the knowledge of changing Mediterranean hedgerows and the current status of their protection within the different legislations. We conclude there are legislative tools at a European level of interest for the hedgerow landscape, however its identification and management at regional level are scarce.

AB  - Due to the rapid growth of urban environments, interactions between animals and humans in cities are increasingly common. Large mammals, such as capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), provide benefits to people and biodiversity of urban areas, but can also result in conflicts, such as animal-vehicle collisions or disease transmission. As a consequence, understanding the space use of urban capybara, and the effect of human activity on capybaras, is conducive to the promotion of coexistence. We studied the home range and the role of human disturbance on activity and habitat selection of urban capybaras in the city of Campo Grande (Brazil). We monitored nine groups of capybaras living at four parks: two parks subjected to high human visitation on workdays and two on weekends. Home range of the urban capybaras in the study is larger than those reported in previous studies of wild capybaras. The capybaras under study presented a bimodal activity pattern, which was delayed on days of high human presence, increasing animals' nocturnality. In addition, habitat selection was completely altered on days of high human presence, leading animals to increase avoidance of urban areas and reversing the selectivity patterns for forests, grasslands, and water bodies, that capybaras show on days with low human presence. Even when completely surrounded by an anthropic environment, our results indicate that a mosaic of grasslands near a water body and forested areas will allow capybaras to maintain daily activity and large home ranges. However, human presence significantly altered the daily activity patterns and habitat selection of capybara. Urban planners should account for these data to improve the coexistence of capybaras with humans and thereby minimize the potential for conflicts.

AB  - Developing community capital is widely viewed as a way to address community resilience-related issues toward sustainability. Based on a Taiwanese, peri-urban, Hakka settlement, this article presents findings on the practical factors in the development of community capital via farm-to-table and community care, and their implications for a resilient, healthy community. It shows that community capital arising from the pond farming, pond education, and community service systems can interact to support its diversity and linkability. The pond-based social network is identified as the key to mitigating the impacts of community challenges regarding food safety concerns, environmental degradation, and aging population. It argues that the pond-based food landscape, communal network, and a borderless campus can enhance community capital as well as play significant parts in achieving community sustainability by promoting residents' health and well-being.

AB  - Brazil's City Statute enshrines the "right to the city" and the "social function of property" in its constitution. Brazilian scholars, however, identify barriers to achieving the law's agenda. Broader debates regarding the right to the city suggest the concept has been overextended beyond meaning, and that formalization of the right to the city betrays its radical Lefebvrian roots. This article is based on fieldwork conducted in Rio de Janeiro when widespread forced evictions were being carried out prior to the city's hosting of the 2016 Summer Olympics. Based on observations within eleven housing occupations, and sixty interviews with participants, leaders of social movement organizations, and local politicians, the article argues that the "constitutionalization" of the right to the city and the social function of property formed the basis for the politicization of dispossessed urban residents. The social function of property was a particularly salient concept for capturing the injustice of the planned relocation of the displaced poor to the urban periphery, while countless buildings sat underutilized in the city center.

AB  - From the time of the Renaissance , treaties on architecture , odes to the arts , and the study of their canons through written sources , have served to defend , emphasise , or proclaim the validity of different artistic forms and styles. In this way, programmes and manifestos have reinforced the character of organisations and movements through their fundamental ideas. The artistic Avant-gardes have thus used this literary resource to lay the theoretical foundations for their future artistic contributions, being able to justify without any qualifications their most extravagant occurrences. The Avant-garde manifesto shall therefore be considered a literary contribution written in the first place for the subsequent development of the artistic and creative activity of the group or school. The Surrealist Movement generated a lot of written work because the founders , Andre Breton, Louis Aragon, and Philippe Soupault, were writers. Some of these texts included the Movement's two manifestos, periodicals such as Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution, Litterature, or Minotaure, and individual writings that were penned by Breton and Aragon. This study will relate the Surrealist written work with the Movement's idea of the city and its urban imaginary.

AB  - Anthropocentric defaunation affects critical ecological processes, such as seed dispersal, putting ecosystems and biomes at risk, and leading to habitat impoverishment. Diverse restoration techniques could reverse the process of habitat impoverishment. However, in most of the restoration efforts, only vegetation cover is targeted. Fauna and flora are treated as isolated components, neglecting a key component of ecosystems' functioning, the ecological interactions. We tested whether the resilient frugivorous generalist fauna can improve habitat quality by dispersing native plant species through the use of fruit feeders as in a semideciduous seasonal urban forest fragment. A total of 32 sampling points was selected at a heavily degraded 251-ha urban forest fragment, with feeders installed at two heights monitored by camera-traps. Variable quantities of native fruits of 27 zoochorous species were offered alternately in the feeders. Based on more than 36,000 h of video records, Turdus leucomelas (Class Aves), Sapajus nigritus (Class Mammalia), and Salvator merianae (Class Reptilia) were recorded ingesting the highest fruit species richness. Didelphis albiventris (Class Mammalia) was the most frequent visitor but consumed only pulp in most of the visits. The frugivorous birds were recorded at a high visitation rate and consumed a wider variety of fruits. Our study opens a new avenue to combine the traditional approach of ecosystems recovery and ecological interactions restauration in an urban forest fragment.

AB  - Noise is unwanted sound judged to be unpleasant, loud or disruptive to hearing. Like air pollution, noise pollution is one of the serious matters of concern in urban areas. Noise pollution occurs when noise level exceeds certain limit and has deleterious effects on human health and wellness. The major sources of noise pollution are industries, road traffic, railways, airplane traffic and social celebrations. The traffic noise is notably high in cities due to higher density of population, frequent movement of people, good transport system coupled with increasing numbers of vehicles (on road). In this work, the assessments of traffic noise in Sambalpur city is presented. Twelve important locations were chosen for the assessment. Noise contours were drawn to visualize the spreading of traffic noise into its surroundings. At the same time, the effect of noise pollution on wellness of the exposed people was studied. The study shows that the traffic noise level and its effects, are both in an alarming stage in the city.

AB  - Urban dispersal events occur when an unexpectedly large number of people leave an area in a relatively short period of time. It is beneficial for the city authorities, such as law enforcement and city management, to have an advance knowledge of such events, as it can help them mitigate the safety risks and handle important challenges such as managing traffic, and so forth. Predicting dispersal events is also beneficial to Taxi drivers and/or ride-sharing services, as it will help them respond to an unexpected demand and gain competitive advantage. Large urban datasets such as detailed trip records and point of interest (POI) data make such predictions achievable. The related literature mainly focused on taxi demand prediction. The pattern of the demand was assumed to be repetitive and proposed methods aimed at capturing those patterns. However, dispersal events are, by definition, violations of those patterns and are, understandably, missed by the methods in the literature. We proposed a different approach in our prior work [32]. We showed that dispersal events can be predicted by learning the complex patterns of arrival and other features that precede them in time. We proposed a survival analysis formulation of this problem and proposed a two-stage framework (DILSA), where a deep learning model predicted the survival function at each point in time in the future. We used that prediction to determine the time of the dispersal event in the future, or its non-occurrence. However, DILSA is subject to a few limitations. First, based on evidence from the data, mobility patterns can vary through time at a given location. DILSA does not distinguish between different mobility patterns through time. Second, mobility patterns are also different for different locations. DILSA does not have the capability to directly distinguish between different locations based on their mobility patterns. In this article, we address these limitations by proposing a method to capture the interaction between POIs and mobility patterns and we create vector representations of locations based on their mobility patterns. We call our new method DILSA+. We conduct extensive case studies and experiments on the NYC Yellow taxi dataset from 2014 to 2016. Results show that DILSA+ can predict events in the next 5 hours with an F1-score of 0.66. It is significantly better than DILSA and the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for taxi demand prediction.

AB  - As the artificial defenses often required for urban and industrial development, such as seawalls, breakwaters, and bund walls, directly replace natural habitats, they may produce population fragmentation and a disruption of ecological connectivity, compromising the delivery of ecosystem services. Such problems have increasingly been addressed through "Working with Nature" (WwN) techniques, wherein natural features such as species and habitats are included as additional functional components within the design of built infrastructure. There now exists a convincing body of empirical evidence that WwN techniques can enhance the structural integrity of coastal works, and at the same time promote biodiversity and ecosystem services. While these benefits have often been achieved through modification of the hard surfaces of the coastal defense structures themselves, the desired ecological and engineering goals may often demand the creation of new soft substrates from sediment. Here we discuss the design considerations for creating new sediment habitats in the intertidal zone within new coastal infrastructure works. We focus on the sediment control structures required to satisfy the physiological and ecological requirements of seagrass and mangroves - two keystone intertidal species that are common candidates for restoration - and illustrate the concepts by discussing the case study of soft habitat creation within a major multi-commodity port.

AB  - In this study, an extracurricular observation module is suggested for the purpose of observing the sustainability of biodiversity based on gathering evidence regarding different seed dispersal processes in the natural environment. These observations were made during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, a time when human activity inflicted a minimum level of damage. The location of the observations was a microecosystem discovered on an urban college campus. Observations were made of four different types of seeds (palm, mulberry, linden and laurel) inside this ecosystem as well as of the way they were being carried via three different means (gravity, wind and the birds). The methods of how evidence of these seed-carrying processes was collected are presented here. A systematic and sequential observational technique in three steps is suggested to facilitate understanding the germination, growth and development processes of the different seeds in the microecosystem explored. We propose on the basis of this module that anyone can discover a microecosystem in their immediate environment and that with systematic observations can develop the skills needed to gather evidence on the ways seeds are disseminated and how plants grow. The entire construct of this study has been structured to support this claim.

AB  - Currently, there is a lack of understanding on the variations of the indoor airborne microbiotas of different building types within a city, and how operational taxonomic unit (OTU)- and amplicon sequence variant (ASV)-based analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequences affect interpretation of the indoor airborne microbiota results. Therefore, in this study, the indoor airborne bacterial microbiotas between commercial buildings, residences, and subways within the same city were compared using both OTU- and ASV-based analytic methods. Our findings suggested that indoor airborne bacterial microbiota compositions were significantly different between building types regardless of the bioinformatics method used. The processes of ecological drift and random dispersal consistently played significant roles in the assembly of the indoor microbiota across building types. Abundant taxa tended to be more centralized in the correlation network of each building type, highlighting their importance. Taxonomic changes between the microbiotas of different building types were also linked to changes in their inferred metabolic function capabilities. Overall, the results imply that customized strategies are necessary to manage indoor airborne bacterial microbiotas for each building type or even within each specific building.

AB  - Based on multi-temporal Landsat images from 1996 to 2014, a hierarchical strategy for land use classification has been presented. The land use dynamic index, conversion matrix and spatial center have been used to quantitatively analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of land cover in Binzhou urban area. Per results, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of hierarchical classification method have been found to be 93.82% and 0.92, respectively, indicating that the method used for land cover classification was feasible. Per findings from the urban area under study, during 1996 to 2014, the cropland area decreased constantly, forestland and water body area decreased at first and then increased, while the built-up land area increased constantly. The major pattern emerging from the land cover change was represented by the conversions of cropland to built-up land. As a result of hydraulic and landscape engineering, gains in forestland and water body were more than the corresponding losses. The area gained by forestland reached peak in the period of 2005 to 2009, while the area gained by water body peaked in the period of 2001 to 2005. Moreover, spatial centers of cropland and built-up land had been located on the southwest side and the east side of the city square, respectively. Per findings, spatial center of cropland was moving away from the City Square in southwestern direction by about 634.30 m, while the built-up land extended to the west, and the spatial center of the built-up land moved towards the southwest as well by about 1575.84 m. The movement of built-up land spatial center was closely related to the development and construction of west urban area.

AB  - Free-ranging domestic cats are a detriment to wildlife and humans by preying on native species and transmitting disease. As a result, removing free-ranging cats from the landscape has become a conservation and public health priority. Estimating cat population size with an unbiased sampling design, however, especially in human-dominated areas, is logistically challenging and rarely done. The lack of robust cat population sampling limits our understanding of where cats pose risks, which is important for evaluating management strategies, such as trap-remove or trap-neuter-return. We hypothesized that cat abundance and activity both depend on human land use and demographics. Using a network of sites participating in a community science program, we conducted transect and camera trap surveys to test predictions of cat population abundance and activity across a gradient of residential land use intensity. Both sampling methods determined that cat abundance was greatest in areas with intermediate human population density and lower educational attainment. Transect data also provided evidence that cat abundance was greatest at intermediate levels of impervious surface cover (e.g., road and buildings), while data from camera traps also showed that cat abundance was positively associated with household income. Using counts of cats observed on cameras, we found that the timing of cat activity varied depending on the degree of urban intensity. Cats were more strictly nocturnal in medium and high intensity residential land-use areas, possibly because a greater proportion of these cats are unowned or because they avoid human activity. These results suggest that transect surveys conducted during the day may undercount cats in urban environments where unowned free-ranging cats predominate. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of incorporating human demographics, land use patterns, and urban context in estimating the abundance of free-ranging cats to better inform management decisions and improve conservation outcomes.

AB  - This article focuses on the struggle of a group of street vendors in Belo Horizonte, Brazil - displaced in the run up to the 2014 World Cup - to claim back their traditionally occupied workspace. Their displacement dramatically ruptured their pursuit of dignified livelihoods in the city's informal economy. Using prolonged ethnography between 2014 and 2016, I describe how the workers engaged with an affective governance regime in which narrow avenues of negotiation are opened but promises are never kept, generating a constant state of unpredictability and possibility. This cycle of hope and frustration demobilises their resistance movement while their charismatic leader struggles to produce and maintain the hope that they might achieve relocation. This labour of hope keeps their association alive but also generates frustration and further demobilisation. The article foregrounds the ambiguous role played by hope in the life of political movements and their everyday relationships with states.

AB  - Ecosystems are changing in complex and unpredictable ways, and analysis of these changes is facilitated by coordinated, long-term research. Meeting diverse societal needs requires an understanding of what populations and communities will be dominant in 20, 50, and 100 yr. This paper is a product of a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the LTER core research area of populations and communities. This analysis revealed that each LTER site had at least one compelling story about what their site would look like in 50 or 100 yr. As the stories were prepared, themes emerged, and the stories were grouped into papers along five themes for this special issue: state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the resilience theme and includes stories from the Baltimore (urban), Hubbard Brook (northern hardwood forest), Andrews (temperate rain forest), Moorea (coral reef), Cedar Creek (grassland), and North Temperate Lakes (lakes) sites. The concept of resilience (the capacity of a system to maintain structure and processes in the face of disturbance) is an old topic that has seen a resurgence of interest as the nature and extent of global environmental change have intensified. The stories we present here show the power of long-term manipulation experiments (Cedar Creek), the value of long-term monitoring of forests in both natural (Andrews, Hubbard Brook) and urban settings (Baltimore), and insights that can be gained from modeling and/or experimental approaches paired with long-term observations (North Temperate Lakes, Moorea). Three main conclusions emerge from the analysis: (1) Resilience research has matured over the past 40 yr of the LTER program; (2) there are many examples of high resilience among the ecosystems in the LTER network; (3) there are also many warning signs of declining resilience of the ecosystems we study. These stories highlight the need for long-term studies to address this complex topic and show how the diversity of sites within the LTER network facilitates the emergence of overarching concepts about this important driver of ecosystem structure, function, services, and futures.

AB  - In this paper, we analyzed the similarities and differences between spatially explicit 8- and 18-node models of an urban carbon metabolic network. The results reveal the influence of different divisions of a system on heterogeneity in carbon flows along metabolic pathways within the network. Paths of 18-node network were between 3 and 5 times than those of the 8-node network with 4% or less differences in carbon flows. The 8-node model provided a good overview of the system and revealed the key paths. However, it also concealed some important flows. In contrast, the 18-node model revealed the details of the flows and clarified the amplification effect of the socioeconomic components and the masking of the effect of natural components that occurred in the 8-node model. However, it was too complex to clearly reveal the key interactions. Therefore, we can choose the optimal division of a network model based on the specific problems we are trying to solve and the specific context. The application of 18-node network is suitable for moderately mature cities which are under the pressure of consolidation and urban adjustment. The 8-node model can be used to provide an overview that will reveal where to focus on using the 18-node model, which provides more details and better support for the formulation of concrete measures.

AB  - The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is widely distributed in Europe, from Iberia and Italy to Scandinavia, and in New Zealand. They inhabit a wide range of environments, from natural habitats to urban areas. Finland is the northern edge of the current distribution area, which has expanded from Pleistocene refugia in Europe. Finnish hedgehogs are not only found in the suburbs, but also in urban areas such as the capital city, Helsinki. However, the phylogenetic relationships to other populations and the population structure were unknown for the urban hedgehogs in Helsinki. We reconstructed a molecular phylogeny and analyzed the population structure and genetic diversity from samples of 106 hedgehogs collected around Helsinki in 2017-2019, based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial control region and cytochrome b gene as well as 11 microsatellite loci. Our phylogenetic data indicate that the Helsinki population is closely related to the Estonian population. This means that at least part of the Helsinki population originates from Estonia, due to natural expansion from glacial refugia and anthropogenic introduction for vermin control, as shown in previous reports. The microsatellite data indicated that the Helsinki population is genetically homogeneous, with low genetic diversity. This may be due to the absence of effective geographic barriers to gene flow at present, but it is also possible that the subpopulations formed by migration are concealed by the genetic uniformity resulting from founder effect of natural expansion to the northward or artificial introduction. Further study is necessary to evaluate the effect of urban fragmentation in Helsinki.

AB  - Invasive species pose one of the most serious global threats to biodiversity. Investigations into the interactions of native and non-native species focus on the impacts of single species, despite being embedded in a network of direct and indirect interactions between multiple species and their environments.
   We developed 1-km(2) resolution, single-species and multi-species occupancy models using quantitative camera trap data collected by citizen scientists at 332 sites in a regional survey comprising the 14,130 km(2) of Northern Ireland.
   Recent research suggests that native red and invasive grey squirrels in Britain and Ireland are linked by resource and disease-mediated competition, and by a shared enemy, the European pine marten. We demonstrate that the presence of the pine marten reverses red squirrel replacement by grey squirrels on a regional basis, with red squirrel occupancy positively affected by exposure to pine marten. In contrast, the grey squirrel has a strongly negative response to the presence of pine marten.
   Modelling habitat suitability of pine marten and both squirrel species suggests that, despite the potentially strong effect of a recovering population of pine martens in controlling grey squirrel distribution, the latter is likely to persist in urban refugia that are either inaccessible or avoided by the pine marten.
   Synthesis and applications. Sustainable recovery of both the red squirrel and the pine marten across the wider landscapes of Ireland, Scotland and Northern England seems probable, while in Southern England and Wales, although possible, chances are more remote. Increasing native woodland cover on a landscape scale to facilitate pine marten recovery may assist in realizing this scenario. Despite the ongoing recovery of the pine marten, and resultant declines in grey squirrels, isolated populations are likely to persist in urban areas. Human-lead control of grey squirrel populations in urban refugia requires urgent funding and implementation to avoid the development of novel genotypes in grey squirrel source populations that enable the species to better avoid predation by the pine marten.

AB  - Sediment bacterial communities play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycle of nutrient elements in urban river. However, the distribution of nitrogen cycle genes on bacterial communities in urban rivers sediments is largely unknown. Here, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to analyze the composition, co-occurrence pat-terns and nitrogen cycle process of bacterial communities in urban river sediments under the influence of differ-ent exogenous pollution. The results revealed that bacterial communities had significant spatial heterogeneity in river sediments of different polluted areas, and the input of different exogenous pollutants shaped the abundance and distribution of nitrogen cycle-related genes in the sediments. In addition, denitrification process played a leading role in the nitrogen cycle of river sediments, and the genes associated with the nitrification process were rarely observed in all samples. The important bacterial taxonomic biomarkers of nitrogen cycling-related genes screened by random forest algorithm were Synergistia, WS6_Dojkabacteria and Caldisericia. Meanwhile, dif-ferent co-occurrence patterns observed in different types of polluted areas clarified the impact of environmental filtration and niche differentiation on bacterial communities. In conclusion, this study reveals the nitrogen cycle process and the distribution of related genes mediated by bacterial communities under the impact of different anthropogenic contamination, and provides novel insights for the assembly of bacterial communities in urban river sediments.

AB  - In a context of a rapidly changing livability of towns and countryside, climate change and biodiversity decrease, this paper introduces a landscape-based planning approach to regional spatial policy challenges allowing a regime shift towards a future land system resilient to external pressures. The concept of nature-based solutions and transition theory are combined in this approach, in which co-created normative future visions serve as boundary concepts. Rather than as an object in itself, the landscape is considered as a comprehensive principle, to which all spatial processes are inherently related. We illustrate this approach with three projects in the Netherlands in which landscape-based visions were used to guide the land transition, going beyond the traditional nature-based solutions. The projects studied show that a shared long-term future landscape vision is a powerful boundary concept and a crucial source of inspiration for a coherent design approach to solve today's spatial planning problems. Further, they show that cherishing abiotic differences in the landscape enhances sustainable and resilient landscapes, that co-creation in the social network is a prerequisite for shared solutions, and that a landscape-based approach enhances future-proof land-use transitions to adaptive, circular, and biodiverse landscapes.

AB  - The phyllosphere is considered a key site for the transfer of both naturally and anthropogenically selected antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) to humans. Consequently, the development of green building systems may pose an, as yet, unexplored pathway for ARGs and pathogens to transfer from the environment to outdoor plants. We collected leaves from plants climbing up buildings at 1, 2, 4 and 15 m above ground level and collected associated dust samples from adjacent windowsills to determine the diversity and relative abundance of microbiota and ARGs. Overall, a total of 143 ARGs from 11 major classes and 18 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were detected. The relative abundance of ARGs within the phyllosphere decreased with increasing height above ground level. Fast expectation?maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST) suggested that the contribution of soil and aerosols to the phyllosphere microbiome was limited. A culture-dependent method to isolate bacteria from plant tissues identified a total of 91 genera from root, stem, and leaf samples as well as endophytes isolated from leaves. Of those bacteria, 20 isolates representing 9 genera were known human pathogenic members to humans. Shared bacterial from culture-dependent and culture-independent methods suggest microorganisms may move from soil to plant, potentially through an endophytic mechanism and thus, there is a clear potential for movement of ARGs and human pathogens from the outdoor environment.

AB  - The article aims to discuss how financial capital acts in space urbanites producing urban voids in parallel to the struggle of the social movements for housing in Sao Paulo. The study was conducted from the Historical Center of the same city, especially in the Historic Triangle Se. The methodology is based on the survey of data of "floors" of buildings occupied by housing, commerce, or services, including cultural uses, as in the case of the listed buildings in this region. An ethnographic study was also carried out between 2018 and 2019 in buildings occupied by a population with strong traces of social vulnerability that engage in social housing movements. As results and conclusions, it was found that the urban development, and to some extent also the state legal system, due to rules and interests of the private initiative, belittles the residents of the city excluded from their right to it. However, as resistance practices in recent years in the city of Sao Paulo, the vacant or vacant buildings have been occupied by social movements that question the prevailing order and real estate speculation in the center and its surroundings.

AB  - This article uses an urban intervention in Panama City to discuss fundamental concepts in public space projects from a critical and theoretical perspective.
   First, the functions of the street as a basic structure of public space are illustrated. Its importance is recognized not only as an element of urban connectivity, but also as a place of movement, encounter, support and creation of urban meanings and social identities.
   Secondly, our case study is contextualized: the urban renewal of via Argentina, a street in the urban center whose environment was in a state of degradation like most streets in the city, largely occupied by the presence of vehicles. The intervention is part of a series of urban projects aimed at improving the physical structure of the city.
   The third section begins a critical analysis of the actions on Via Argentina, starting with the redistribution of street space, the relationship between vehicles and pedestrians, and the consolidation of public space.
   Next, we discuss in detail the new primary elements used for the urbanization of the street. Curbs, fords, pavement, rigola, gutters, tree surrounds and bollards become part of a system that must maintain a coherent relationship between all its parts. In addition, emphasis is placed on the design of the ground and the application of the pavement as a tool for the construction of an urban image and identity.
   Finally, the article ends with an analysis of the parameters of accessibility in the project, relating the concept to the use of the pavement and the configuration in some sections of the street as a single platform. The article uses a wide repertoire of documentary photography to contextualize the case study.

AB  - What are patterns, outcomes, and factors emerging from the urban environmental sustainability actions? To what extent do the conditions of action arenas facilitate urban environmental actions? In this research, the community-level public space named 'neighbourhood activity centres' in Taipei City is observed and investigated. Besides the field observation effort, a data set is established with the combination of subjective and objective data sources collected from a questionnaire investigation (255 units of observations) and the governmental open data systems. After employing ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis, the author concludes that environmental friendly facilities (such as aquaponics systems), environmental tendency of the communities, exhibition of policies or regulations and action networks among participants, could facilitate the outcomes of urban environmental sustainability movement. However, the diversity among the participants negatively affects the relationships between some external factors and action outcomes. The divergence in actor preference increases the required transaction costs in the consensus process due to time-consuming communication and compromise. This study thus proposes recommendations, such as benchmark Lis and neighbourhood associations, as policy application that could enhance municipal implementation of sustainability policies.

AB  - Invasive alien plant species (IAPs) in urban areas can have detrimental effects on biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being. Urban areas are complex social management mosaics with high land-use diversity, complex land tenure patterns and many different stakeholder groups, some of which derive benefits from invading species. Urban conservation practitioners face complex decisions about which IAPs require management. Yet most IAPs prioritization frameworks have been designed for and implemented in natural or rural areas and are generally inadequate for guiding effective and sustainable interventions in urbanized areas. We modified an existing prioritization scheme to develop a framework for prioritizing terrestrial IAPs in urban areas which applies evidence-based (data-driven) and stakeholder-based (local knowledge) assessments to score and rank alien plant species in terms of their priority for management using an objective set of criteria. The framework consists of 46 criteria, grouped into eight modules which assess invasion status, habitat requirements, biological characteristics, dispersal ability, distribution, impacts (positive and negative) and potential for control for each alien plant species under consideration. We use the city of Toronto, Canada as a case study to test our framework-a list of 50 IAPs were effectively scored and ranked in order of high to low priority for control. Species with the highest total prioritization scores were Vincetoxicum rossicum (Dog Strangling Vine), Convolvulus arvensis (Field Bindweed) and Taraxacum officinale (Common Dandelion, ranked 1, 2 and 3 respectively). Many of the identified high priority species align with those previously flagged as of management concern by conservation practitioners, but also include those that are not actively managed due to their perceived lower ecological impacts. These species still require high resource investment for other objectives such as aesthetics. This highlights the complexity of alien plant species management in urban areas. Synthesis and applications. Prioritizing invasive alien plants for management in urban areas is particularly challenging due to often conflicting ecological, economic and social objectives. We use available evidence and local stakeholder knowledge to develop an objective and systematic prioritization tool which can assist conservation practitioners in selecting priority species for management action in complex urban landscapes.

AB  - Tropical urban coastal wetland regeneration is complex. Wetland plant biodiversity varies due to past and present land use, nutrient inputs, hydrological conditions, and terrestrial/marine connectivity. The intensity of atmospheric disturbances, such as hurricanes, will determine these systems' level of disturbance and regeneration capacity. On September 20, 2017, category 4 hurricane Maria passed over Puerto Rico, leaving behind a path of destruction across the entire island, especially in coastal ecosystems, from the combined effects of winds, severe storm surges, and urban runoff. Our question was: to what extent do human-influenced coastal urban wetlands regenerate after such a massive event. This study determines the spatio-temporal regeneration dynamics of plant cover and composition during the first 2 years after hurricane Maria in a coastal urban wetland, cienaga Las Cucharillas, located in San Juan Bay. We assessed the distribution of plant functional types using small unmanned aerial vehicles (s-UAV) and monitored climate and environmental data (salinity, phreatic water levels, and precipitation). Wetland vegetation cover had a high recovery rate - 16 months after the hurricane, vegetation cover occupied 87% of the study area. We found a successional pattern of plant regeneration that seemed to be partly explained by the fast-slow continuum. Plants with high specific leaf area (SLA) colonized bare soil spaces first. Plant regeneration also varied according to changes in phreatic water conductivity and waterlogging. Isotopic analyses of plant species signaled high nutrient availability, increasing the system's regeneration speed. After 2 years, the wetland's plant cover and composition of functional plant types proved resilient to the initial hurricane effect and subsequent changes in conductivity and freshwater conditions. Further studies will expand how spatio-temporal conditions will affect long-term plant community dynamics.

AB  - Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) is an essential intermediate step in the nitrogen cycle, and different sediment physicochemical properties can affect the DNRA process. But the detailed research on the environmental nitrogen cycling in urban river networks based on DNRA communities and the functional gene nrfA is lacking. In this study, the flow line of the Huangpu River in Shanghai was analyzed using isotope tracer, quantitative real-time PCR, and high-throughput sequencing techniques to evaluate the role of DNRA on the stability of the river network and marine. The significant positive correlation between the rate of DNRA and sediment organic carbon was identified. At the genus level, Anaeromyxobacter is the most dominant. Notably, both heterotrophic and autotrophic DNRA species were discovered. This study added diversity to the scope of urban freshwater river network ecosystem studies by investigating the distribution of DNRA bacteria along the Huangpu River. It provided new insights into the biological nitrogen cycle of typical urban inland rivers in eastern China.

AB  - Fruit and seed predators determine plant populations dynamics and community structure of tropical forests. Its impact can have drastic consequences on the development of plants and their ability to reproduce. Among the main causes of damage to fruits, and seeds, Coleoptera of the Curculionidae and Bruchidae families and other groups of beetles stand out. The research was carried out in the Metropolitan Natural Park (PNM), considered as the "lung of the City of Panama" which has deciduous trees that reach up to 36 m in height and an average annual temperature of 28 degrees C. The work consisted of collecting samples of fruits and seeds of all plant species encountered in the fruiting condition in the park from August 2015 to July 2016. Additionally, flower buds of Anacardium excelsum L. attacked by two species of Anthonomus Germar, 1817 were also included in the analyses. A total of 797 beetles were collected from 3091 samples (seeds, fruits, flower buds) reared at environmental conditions. The Curculionidae and Bruchidae families presented the highest abundance of individuals and species richness. One species of Hypothenemus Westwood, 1836 (Scolytinae), was the most abundant within the Curculionidae family and in the Bruchidae family one species of Acanthoscelides Schilsky, 1905. Tree species such as Oenocarpus mapora H. Karst. 1857 and Guazuma ulmifolia Lam presented higher predation of their fruits or seeds. On average only 5% of dissected seeds were predated across 32 host plant species. In total, 31 genera of beetles were reared from flower buds, seeds, and fruits of 17 plant species. Host-specificity was moderated, with 47% of flower bud, fruit and seed predator genera associated with just one plant species. Sixty one percent of the coleopterans were collected in the dry season (December to March).

AB  - Widespread degradation across Australia's inland wetland network has contributed to severe declines for many waterbird species. In contrast, breeding colonies of the Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) have increased in urbanised areas along the coast, but the level of dispersal and gene flow between inland and coastal areas remain unknown. This study uses single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to ascertain the variables influencing genetic connectivity among several inland and urban colonies of white ibis across south-eastern Australia between 2015 and 2018. The contemporary effective population size was estimated, and this value was used in simulations to evaluate the impact of various management scenarios on future genetic diversity. We found no significant differences in allele frequencies between localities, or robust evidence of site fidelity, therefore suggesting widespread dispersal and gene flow between inland and urban colonies. Furthermore, effective sizes were large enough to maintain genetic diversity into the future under various realistic management scenarios. However, the lack of genetic partitioning found suggests that urban management of the ibis should not be undertaken in isolation of the conservation requirements of inland colonies.

AB  - Karst caves have recently been demonstrated to act as a sink for atmospheric methane, due in part to consumption by microbes residing in caves that can oxidize methane at atmospheric levels. However, our knowledge about the responsible atmospheric methane-oxidizing bacteria (atmMOB) in this vast habitat remains limited to date. To address this issue, weathered rock samples from three karst caves were collected in Guilin City and subjected to high-throughput sequencing of pmoA and 16S rRNA genes. The results showed that members of the high-affinity upland soil cluster (USC), especially upland soil cluster gamma (USC gamma), with absolute abundances of 10(4) to 10(9) copies . g(-1) dry sample, dominated the atmMOB communities, while Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria dominated the overall bacterial communities. Moreover, USC gamma was a keystone taxon in cooccurrence networks of both the atmMOB and the total bacterial community, whereas keystone taxa in the bacterial network also included Gaiella and Aciditerrimonas. Positive links overwhelmingly dominated the cooccurrence networks of both atmMOB and the total bacterial community, indicating a consistent response to environmental disturbances. Our study shed new insights on the diversity and abundances underlining atmMOB and total bacterial communities and on microbial interactions in subterranean karst caves, which increased our understanding about USC and supported karst caves as a methane sink.
   IMPORTANCE Karst caves have recently been demonstrated to be a potential atmospheric methane sink, presumably due to consumption by methane-oxidizing bacteria. However, the sparse knowledge about the diversity, distribution, and community interactions of methanotrophs requires us to seek further understanding of the ecological significance of methane oxidation in these ecosystems. Our pmoA high-throughput results from weathered rock samples from three karst caves in Guilin City confirm the wide occurrence of atmospheric methane-oxidizing bacteria in this habitat, especially those affiliated with the upland soil cluster, with a gene copy number of 104 to 109 copies per gram dry sample. Methanotrophs and the total bacterial communities had more positive than negative interactions with each other as indicated by the cooccurrence network, suggesting their consistent response to environmental disturbance. Our results solidly support caves as an atmospheric methane sink, and they contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the diversity, distribution, and interactions of microbial communities in subsurface karst caves.

AB  - Many ecosystems have been modified by humans, creating novel habitats that include human-provided resources. Gardens adjacent to native habitats may affect plant-pollinator interactions by altering the determinants of interactions and species specialization. Here, we characterized a network comprising plants and hummingbirds interacting in a birdwatching garden with human-provided resources (nectar feeders and exotic plants) and adjacent Andean cloud forest in Colombia. Specifically, we investigated the proportion of hummingbirds visiting feeders and native/exotic plants to evaluate the connection between the habitats and the ecological determinants of the interaction network. Hummingbirds relied heavily on artificial nectar feeders in the garden, leaving the natural cloud forest for resources. Morphological matching was the single most important predictor of the observed pairwise interactions, for both hummingbirds and plants. At the species level, longer flowering phenology and a higher amount of sugar in nectar led to a higher degree for plants (i.e. the number of visiting hummingbird species). In contrast, a longer floral corolla was associated with lower specialization. Abundance was the best predictor of the number of partners for hummingbirds. The garden created for birdwatching attracted most, but not all, hummingbird species beyond their natural cloud forest habitat. Interestingly, the most frequently visited plants in the garden were native, especially the endemic and endangered tree Zygia lehmannii (Fabaceae). Our results show that some ecological mechanisms determining interactions in natural communities still hold in intensively modified habitats. Furthermore, a compromise between conservation and hummingbirds' attraction to birding lodges/gardens is possible, for instance by favouring native and endemic plant species that are highly attractive for pollinators.

AB  - Residential mobility is a material and symbolic practice that is part of social production in urban space. Physical and social conditions and the representation of the geographic space in which the current and future residents are located are fundamental factors in the decisions that individuals and families make when changing residence. Each social group, differentiated by their nationality, ethnicity, age, or socioeconomic status, appraises the advantages and disadvantages of each location in a different way, and this generates different spatial patterns of residential mobility. We study at various scales the functional and spatial configurations of the changes of residence of a group of Spaniards and foreigners that occurred in the city of Zaragoza (Spain) between 2003 and 2017. This is understood as a relational network of places connected by origin-destination flows of changes of residence. Individual data aggregated in census sections have been used with a methodology that combines spatial analysis procedures and geosocial networks. Results show that the residential mobility networks of both groups have different functional organisations in different spaces. The effects of residential mobility are manifested by variations in the volume of the population and the sociodemographic composition of each area. Finally, the distribution of the distances involved in changes of residence of Spaniards and foreigners was well adjusted to a lognormal model, which enables accurately predicting the location of a residence.

AB  - The concrete channel of the Los Angeles (LA) River is probably one of the most recognizable rivers in the world. Channelized to manage the risk of flooding as the Los Angeles region urbanized, the river today is an architectural and engineering feat in the eyes of some people but an ecological disaster to others. The river flows adjacent to 17 cities and among some of the most environmentally burdened, park poor, and underserved communities of LA County. With over 2,300 acres of largely publicly owned land within the river right-of-way, a reimagined LA River can impact the lives of the one million people that live within a mile of the river.
   The LA River Master Plan, led by Los Angeles County and scheduled to be completed in fall 2021, proposes 51 miles of connected public open space with multi-benefit projects supporting nine goals ranging from flood resilience to housing affordability, to ecological function, and to arts, education, and culture. The data-based plan for the next 25 years includes a watershed-wide research effort to document and understand water quality, water conservation, and flood risk in relation to environmental and social issues. The plan includes traditional and innovative strategies within a "kit of parts," interventions that include over 65 components ranging from habitat bridges to dry arroyo side channels demonstrating opportunities for enhancing ecosystem services to create a thriving urban habitat and connected network of parks along the river.

AB  - Environmental change through habitat fragmentation and urbanization drives biodiversity loss in the Neotropics at an alarming rate. Some individuals and species confined to habitat fragments may develop phenotypic adjustments that allow populations to persist, even in landscapes made harsh by human activities. Behavioral and morphological adjustments may enhance a population's ability to cope with anthropogenic hazards. We examined potential differences in the behavioral and morphological phenotype of populations of the neotropical Wedge-billed Woodcreeper (Glyphorynchus spirurus)-an understory forest specialist insectivorous bird-between populations from urban fragmented forests and continuous preserved forests. We evaluated exploratory behavior and morphological traits using generalized linear models and linear discriminant analysis to quantify phenotypical differences among populations. We used failure time analysis to compare latency to explore and move during exploration in a Novel Environment Test (NET). Our analyses detected differences in certain movement behaviors (latencies to move during NET), indicating that individuals from fragmented forests are slow explorers in relation to individuals from the continuous forest. We also found shorter tarsi and tails in the fragmented forest population which were attributed to an overall reduction in body size in these populations. Our results suggest that environmental change driven by fragmentation in an urban landscape is causing population differentiation, but we cannot ascribe observed variations to evolutionary processes only, as the differences observed may be explained by other processes too. However, we suggest that phenotypic differences may be aiding this small understory forest specialist to persist in an urban fragmented landscape.

AB  - Landscape conversions induced by human activities can affect dispersal patterns of various bird species and, as a result, affect genetic structure of their populations. Genetic differentiation of bird populations may be enhanced by habitat variation, especially in urban-non-urban systems. The majority of population genetic studies focus on single species, which inflicts limitations for direct comparisons of genetic responses of avian populations to urbanization. Here, we used a set of microsatellite markers to examine genetic diversity, gene flow and population structure in two common parid species, great tits Parus major and blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus occupying three sites in habitats with contrasting urbanization level in central Poland. We found low but significant divergence of urban park population with both suburban and non-urban forest great tit populations, while no differentiation was found between suburban forest and non-urban forest populations. In contrast, no evidence for genetic differentiation was found between blue tit populations from the urban park, suburban forest and non-urban forest sites. We conclude that great tits and blue tits respond to urbanization-related changes in a different way, which may be a result of different rates of migration and/or dispersal, likely higher in blue tits. Some impact may be also induced by interspecific competition. We suggest that changing the focus of urban genetic research from single to multiple species may provide novel insights into how natural populations respond to the processes of urbanization.

These changes promoted a new dynamic for the urbanization process and consequently influenced the structuring of the state urban network. In this sense, based on bibliographical research and the survey of secondary data, the objective of this text is to present a synthesis of aspects of urbanization and the structuring of the urban network in the state of Goias between the 1940s and 1980s.

AB  - Natal dispersal plays an important role in connecting individual animal behavior with ecological processes at all levels of biological organization. As urban environments are rapidly increasing in extent and intensity, understanding how urbanization influences these long distance movements is critical for predicting the persistence of species and communities. There is considerable variation in the movement responses of individuals within a species, some of which is attributed to behavioral plasticity which interacts with experience to produce interindividual differences in behavior. For natal dispersers, much of this experience occurs in the natal home range. Using data collected from VHF collared coyotes (Canis latrans) in the Chicago Metropolitan Area we explored the relationship between early life experience with urbanization and departure, transience, and settlement behavior. Additionally, we looked at how early life experience with urbanization influenced survival to adulthood and the likelihood of experiencing a vehicle related mortality. We found that coyotes with more developed habitat in their natal home range were more likely to disperse and tended to disperse farther than individuals with more natural habitat in their natal home range. Interestingly, our analysis produced mixed results for the relationship between natal habitat and habitat selection during settlement. Finally, we found no evidence that early life experience with urbanization influenced survival to adulthood or the likelihood of experiencing vehicular mortality. Our study provides evidence that early life exposure influences dispersal behavior; however, it remains unclear how these differences ultimately affect fitness.

AB  - Urban green spaces have the reputation of limited potential to support biodiversity and public places located in urbanized regions normally sustain low levels of biodiversity. But there is the potential to improve such characteristics using restoration techniques that are easily implemented and cost-effective. In this study we implemented a set of nature-based interventions aiming to boost the local biodiversity of three urban parks in Sorocaba, SP, Brazil. Our interventions were designed to induce local ecological succession. In each park, we prepared nine sampling units (SU) by removing grass in a circle of 1 m diameter each. During the period of the study, three Sus in each park were kept uncovered (control treatment), three received -forest litter collected in an adjacent, well-conserved forest fragment (transposition treatment), and in the other three SUs, we installed a perch (perch treatment). For one year following establishment of the treatment, we monitored each SU biweekly and recorded the number and identity of seedlings that germinated in the circles. We recorded fluctuations in the number of seedlings in all experimental treatments of the three parks, indicating the variable rate of survivorship among species. We recorded a total of 30 different genera, most of which were herbaceous plants of species native to the region. In terms of the category of seed dispersion syndrome, most seedlings were from species dispersed by abiochoric vectors. Asteraceae was the most common botanical family. On one hand, if the experimental techniques we tested did not achieve the expected success in terms of the number of species of shrubs and trees, on the other hand, such interventions were not harmful in that they did not result in a predominance of exotic species. We conclude that this kind of approach has the potential to be successfully implemented in urban green spaces due to the simplicity of elaboration and implementation, respect of the natural structure and functioning (it is a nature-based alternative), and with an appropriate cost-benefit.

AB  - In 2011 the 15 M movement occupied squares across Spain demanding true democracy. Four years later, bottom-up municipalist initiatives won the 2015 local elections in seven medium-size and large cities. In coalition with traditional parties, these initiatives formed new left-wing governments that incorporated former activists as mayors and councilors. This history has sparked debates about the consequences of co-optation, institutional alliances, and state openness to social movements. In this article we aim to contribute to that debate with a discussion of the outcomes of municipalist governments in four cities (Madrid, Barcelona, A Coruna, and Cadiz) during the 2015-2019 mandate. Theoretically, we argue for the necessity to interpret these outcomes against the background of the political and economic contexts that constrain (and enable) a progressive urban agenda. Empirically, our results reveal that municipalist governments only to a certain extent performed as instruments of grassroots movements. Despite favorable alliances and partial achievements, we identify various constraints to the responsiveness of municipalist governments to activist demands. Especially, we conclude that supra-local neoliberal policies, various concerned capitalist interests, and the relative waning of the 15 M protest movement limited the potential benefits of those alliances.

AB  - Background: Aedes albopictus is a vector of major arboviral diseases and a primary pest in tropical and temperate regions of China. In most cities of China, the current monitoring system for the spread of Ae. albopictus is based on the subdistrict scale and does not consider spatial distribution for analysis of species density. Thus, the system is not sufficiently accurate for epidemic investigations, especially in large cities.
   Methods: This study used an improved surveillance program, with the mosquito oviposition trap (MOT) method, integrating the actual monitoring locations to investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of Ae. albopictus abundance in an urban area of Shanghai, China from 2018 to 2019. A total of 133 monitoring units were selected for surveillance of Ae. albopictus density in the study area, which was composed of 14 subdistricts. The vector abundance and spatial structure of Ae. albopictus were predicted using a binomial areal kriging model based on eight MOTs in each unit. Results were compared to the light trap (LT) method of the traditional monitoring scheme.
   Results: A total of 8,192 MOTs were placed in the study area in 2018, and 7917 (96.6%) were retrieved, with a positive rate of 6.45%. In 2019, 22,715 (97.0%) of 23,408 MOTs were recovered, with a positive rate of 5.44%. Using the LT method, 273 (93.5%) and 312 (94.5%) adult female Ae. albopictus were gathered in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The Ae. albopictus populations increased slowly from May, reached a peak in July, and declined gradually from September. The MOT positivity index (MPI) showed significant positive spatial autocorrelation across the study area, whereas LT collections indicated a nonsignificant spatial autocorrelation. The MPI was suitable for spatial interpolation using the binomial areal kriging model and showed different hot spots in different years.
   Conclusions: The improved surveillance system integrated with a geographical information system (GIS) can improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of Ae. albopictus in urban areas and provide a practical method for decision-makers to implement vector control and mosquito management.

AB  - Accelerating urbanization and industrialization have had substantial impacts on economic and social activities, changed the surface environment of the earth, and affected global climate change and biodiversity. If reasonable and effective management measures are not implemented in time, unchecked urbanization and industrialization will damage the structure and function of the ecosystem, endanger human and biological habitats, and ultimately lead to difficulties in achieving sustainable development. This study investigates the habitat quality effect of land use transition and analyzes the cause and mechanism of such changes from an economic-social-ecological complex system perspective in the Henan Water Source (HWS) area of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (MRP). The study comprehensively examines the characteristics of land use transition from 2000 to 2020. The results indicate that the habitat quality of the HWS area of the MRP decreased slowly over the past 20 years, with a more obvious decrease in the past 10 years. Specifically, the proportion of high quality habitat areas is relatively large and stable, and the medium and low quality habitat areas increase significantly. Analyzing the change degree of the proportion of different levels of habitat quality area in each county, revealed that Dengzhou City had the most dramatic change, followed by the Xichuan and Neixiang counties; other counties did not undergo obvious change. The results of habitat quality factor detection by GeoDetector showed that land use transition plays a decisive role in the change of habitat quality. The types of land use with high habitat suitability compared to those with low habitat suitability will inevitably lead to a decrease in habitat quality. Additionally, elevation, slope, landform type, and annual precipitation are important factors affecting the habitat quality in the HWS area of the MRP, indicating that ecological factors determine the background conditions of habitat quality. The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the proportion of agricultural output value, grain yield per unit area in economic factors, population density, and urbanization rate in social factors affect the spatial differentiation of habitat quality to a certain extent. Soil type, annual mean temperature, vegetation type, and NDVI index have weak effects on habitat quality, while road network density and slope aspect have no significant effect on habitat quality. The results of this study provide a basis for the improvement of habitat quality, ecosystem protection and restoration, land resource management, and related policies in the HWS area of the MRP. They also provide references for the research and practice of the habitat quality effects of land use transition in other regions.

KW  - ASSOCIATIONS
AB  - The article deals with public associations, the purpose of which was to provide mutual financial support to their participants. The most active in the creation of economic organizations were representatives of the middle strata of the urban population - officials, employees, workers, artisans, and merchants of the cities. They created cooperatives, mutual insurance and mutual aid societies, and trade unions. The author aims to identify the level of social solidarity in the economic sphere in the Russian province on the example of Tomsk Province. The choice of the territory is explained by the fact that this is the only region in pre-revolutionary Russia that has a chronicle of public life, compiled by Professor O.A. Kharus and published in 2013. The chronicle takes into account Tomsk Province urban public organizations, which had the purpose of providing financial support to their founders and members. The author pays regard to the facts of their creation and functioning according to the information of state departments, periodicals, documents of the organizations themselves, memoirs of participants of the social movement. Legal and illegal organizations, statutory and non-statutory organizations were analyzed. The statistics include organizations from the moment of occurrence (organizational meeting). When compiling the chronicle of the social life of Tomsk Province, Professor Kharus employed the method of compiling a chronicle and statistics of the workers' and social-democratic movement in Russia. The calculation includes the results of research of recent years. The Chronicle of the Public Life of Tomsk Province, compiled by the author of the article and Professor Kharus, included 151 organizations. The article analyzes a more complete version of the chronicle - 167 organizations. The author divides the process of organizing economic communities in Tomsk Province into three periods: (1) 1860-1904: the creation of cash registers and mutual aid societies, consumer societies by employees of Cabinet enterprises and state institutions, trade establishments and printing houses; (2) the period of the First Russian Revolution: trade union construction by workers and employees of state and private institutions and enterprises; (3) the inter-revolutionary period: the cooperative movement in cities and workers' settlements. Of the 167 registered organizations, 18 were workers' production cooperatives, 45 were cash registers and mutual aid societies, 46 were consumer societies, 5 were credit partnerships, 3 were insurance partnerships, and 48 were legal and illegal trade unions of workers and employees. The provincial city Tomsk had 59 of them, the mining center Barnaul had 34, the growing commercial and industrial Novonikolaevsk had 16. The author comes to the conclusion that the organization of economic societies was part of the process of the formation of a civil society and the creation in the cities of the province of the middle urban strata.

AB  - Background: Epidemics of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are occurring more frequently and spreading faster and farther than before in many areas of the world. The present study aimed to assess a long-lasting emerging epidemic (2005-2019) of 5532 cases with anthroponotic CL (ACL) in peri-urban areas of Kerman city in southeastern Iran.
   Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was carried out for 15 years in Kerman province, southeastern Iran. The data were passively obtained through the health surveillance system and the Kerman Leishmaniasis Research Center. Every subject was diagnosed using direct smear microscopy. The representative causative agent was further examined by ITS1-PCR, PCR-RFLP, 7SL RNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. For each subject, a case report form designating demographic and clinical data was recorded.
   Results: A different pattern of ACL incidence was found in peri-urban areas compared to that in the city of Kerman. The incidence rate of ACL cases has significantly increased (P < 0.001) from 2005 to 2016 in new settlements with a gradual decline after that. The overall average risk of contracting the disease was 7.6 times higher in peri-urban areas compared to Kerman city, an old endemic focus. All isolates consisting of six variants were confirmed to be Leishmania tropica. The overall pattern of the ACL infection indicates that the etiological agent of ACL is propagated and transmitted by the bite of female Phlebotomus sergenti sandflies from person to person from dissimilar clones as reflected by the complexity of the migrants' backgrounds in the province.
   Conclusions: The movement of populations and establishment of new settlements in peri-urban areas close to endemic areas are major risk factors for and are directly linked to CL. The underlying factors of this emerging ACL epidemic caused by L. tropica were disasters and droughts, among others. A robust commitment to a multilateral approach is crucial to make improvements in this area. This will require decisive coordinated actions through all governmental factions and non-governmental organizations. Furthermore, active and passive case detection strategies, early diagnosis, and effective treatment could help control the disease.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The presence of carnivores near human settlements is a poorly studied topic that generates concern and perception of risk in some human communities, especially for medium to large felids. Apart from the conflict of the potential predation of livestock, there is the insecurity perception of a potential attack on people. To gain a better understanding of how, when, and how close pumas approached human settlements, we analyze 51 puma records near populated areas over eight years in central Chile. The results show that pumas approached human-populated areas; in 23.5% of the records pumas are found between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement, 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m, and 51% are over 5000 m. We associate puma records with landscape features, such as mountain ranges, land-use, road, and urban infrastructure; and based on previous knowledge of puma biology, behavior, and habitat preference, we identify their area of occupation and the potential biological corridor used for their movements from the Andes Range to the coast. Our results show the adaptability of pumas to human-dominated landscapes, and their capacity to overcome landscape barriers, such as human infrastructure, contributing to a better understanding of the population dynamics in the study area. Studies on human-carnivore coexistence, through formulas that consider local realities and the reduction of implicit risks for humans, are urgently needed, both globally and locally, and likely the only way to secure the long-term conservation of pumas in human-dominated landscapes.
   The wildland-urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes-creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Wildlife sightings near human settlements have appeared to increase in the last years. This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the O'Higgins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km(2) of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range. Our results contribute to the understanding of the presence and movements of P. concolor near urban areas and human settlements, confirming their persistence in and adaptation to human-dominated landscapes. We also provide insights into human-carnivore coexistence in the current global context in the densely populated central Chile.

AB  - In Sao Paulo, squatting movements provide an alternative route to housing for members. At the same time, they highlight the city's housing deficit and high rates of property vacancy. This article analyses the spatio-legal work at one of these squats, known as the Prestes Maia occupation, by one housing movement, the 'Movimento Moradia, Luta e Justica' (Housing Struggle and Justice Movement) under the three rubrics of imaginaries, practices and materiality. The paper argues that the movement is not simply lacking property. Rather they are creating insurgent property relations by imagining property differently through slogans and key terms such as 'luta' (struggle) that permeated interviews with coordinators and residents at the occupation. They practice property differently by creating novel entanglements of private/collective life at the occupation and in seeking state recognition for the occupation. The movement exploits the building's differential materiality to situate their community politically as well as physically. The discussion is based on semi-structured interviews with residents, coordinators, the support network of the occupation and local government officials over a six-month period. The study seeks to contribute to the understanding of property relations beyond narrow parameters of formal state validated property rights.

AB  - Significant steps have been made to expand grid-level electricity access in Maputo, Mozambique. Simultaneously, research highlights the emergence of alternative socio-technical infrastructures that often run parallel or complementary to centralized electricity networks. Approaching energy access across such technologies and practices is crucial to understand the challenge of energy access even in cities where grid connectivity is high. Recently, the concept of heterogeneity has emerged to describe such diverse infrastructural realities. Through 62 household interviews, this article examines the heterogeneity of energy access in Maputo. It contends that heterogeneity is a dynamic landscape of practices and strategies that interface with contested political ideals. By approaching heterogeneity as a cross-cutting dynamic, qualities of sustainable energy access such as increased security, autonomy, and the preservation of valued livelihoods become apparent. It is contended that such qualities offer reference points to better evaluate the sustainability of heterogeneous energy access and guide more coordinated energy governance.

AB  - In some vertebrate species, family units are typically formed when sexually mature individuals delay dispersal and independent breeding to remain as subordinates in a breeding group. This behaviour has been intensively studied in gregarious species but has also been described in non-social species where ecological and evolutionary drivers are less known. Here, we explore factors that favour delayed dispersal and family living and potential benefits associated with this strategy in a non-social, monogamous species (the burrowing owl, Athene cunicularia) occupying urban and rural habitats. Our results show that family units arise when first-year individuals, mainly males, delay their dispersal to stay in their natal nests with their parents. This delayed dispersal, while still uncommon, was more prevalent in urban (7%) than in rural (3%) habitats, and in areas with high conspecific density and productivity. Birds delaying dispersal contributed to the genetic pool of the offspring in 25% of the families analysed, but did not increase the productivity of the nests where they remained. However, their presence was related to an improvement in the body condition of chicks, which was ultimately linked to a slightly positive effect in offspring future survival probabilities. Finally, delayed dispersers were recruited as breeders in high-quality urban territories and closer to their natal nests than individuals dispersing during their first year of life. Thus, our results suggest that delaying dispersal may be mainly related to opportunities to inheriting a good quality territory, especially for males. Our study contributes to understanding the role played by habitat quality in promoting delayed dispersal and family living, not only in social but also non-social species, highlighting its impact in the ecology and evolution of animal populations.

AB  - Stopping invasive species early in the invasion process has the potential to save hundreds of billions of dollars and avert damage to agriculture, natural areas, and human health. While urban areas pose particular challenges to early detection, they also present special opportunities. Urban areas and their ports of entry host higher concentrations of invasive species and, with increasing travel and transport, the number of species introduced to urban areas will increase. Along with many invasive species, urban areas contain many citizens interested in being citizen scientists and the potential for taxonomic experts to be associated with major institutions of learning. Early detection is an effective strategy and citizen scientists are effective data collectors. We present a model called Invader Detectives that harnesses existing data collection by citizen scientists to support early detection of invasive species in urban areas. The data-driven approach is being implemented as a pilot project in the metropolitan Washington DC area but we hope to find partners in urban areas across the country to create a nation-wide network of Invader Detective chapters. The Invader Detectives structure is reviewed and lessons learned are reported.

AB  - Background Urbanization is one of the most influential processes on our globe, putting a great number of species under threat. Some species learn to cope with urbanization, and a few even benefit from it, but we are only starting to understand how they do so. In this study, we GPS tracked Egyptian fruit bats from urban and rural populations to compare their movement and foraging in urban and rural environments. Because fruit trees are distributed differently in these two environments, with a higher diversity in urban environments, we hypothesized that foraging strategies will differ too. Results When foraging in urban environments, bats were much more exploratory than when foraging in rural environments, visiting more sites per hour and switching foraging sites more often on consecutive nights. By doing so, bats foraging in settlements diversified their diet in comparison to rural bats, as was also evident from their choice to often switch fruit species. Interestingly, the location of the roost did not dictate the foraging grounds, and we found that many bats choose to roost in the countryside but nightly commute to and forage in urban environments. Conclusions Bats are unique among small mammals in their ability to move far rapidly. Our study is an excellent example of how animals adjust to environmental changes, and it shows how such mobile mammals might exploit the new urban fragmented environment that is taking over our landscape.

AB  - This article investigates social and spatial changes in the Athens metropolitan area between 1991 and 2011. The main question is whether social polarisation-and the contraction of intermediate occupational categories-unevenly developed across the city is related to the changing of segregation patterns during the examined period. We established that the working-class moved towards the middle and the middle-class moved towards the top, but the relative position of both parts did not change in the overall socio-spatial hierarchy. The broad types of socio-spatial change in Athens (driven by professionalisation, proletarianisation or polarisation) were eventually related to different spatial imprints in the city's social geography. Broad trends identified in other cities, like the centralisation of higher occupations and the peripheralisation of poverty, were not at all present here. In Athens, changes between 1991 and 2011 can be summarised by (1) the relative stability and upward social movement of the traditional working-class and their surrounding areas, accounting for almost half of the city, (2) the expansion of traditional bourgeois strongholds to neighbouring formerly socially mixed areas-25% of the city-and their conversion to more homogeneous middle-class neighbourhoods through professionalisation, (3) the proletarianisation of 10% of the city following a course of perpetual decline in parts of the central municipality and (4) the polarisation and increased social mix of the traditional bourgeois strongholds related to the considerable inflow of poor migrants working for upper-middle-class households.

AB  - Assessing the impacts of invasive predators on the demography and distribution of native species is critical for understanding mechanisms of species persistence and informing the design of recovery programmes. On the oceanic island of Guam, the introduction of the predatory brown treesnake Boiga irregularis after World War II caused the near-total loss of the native forest avifauna. Localised snake control measures have been implemented since the early logos, yet it remains poorly understood how they have impacted Guam's remaining native bird populations. To address this question, we combined intensive area searches of Andersen Air Force Base (AAFB) with islandwide transect surveys and opportunistic sightings to provide a comprehensive update on the distribution and abundance of Sali (Micronesian Starling, Aplonis opaca) - one of Guam's last extant native bird species. Area searches of AAFB, where the largest remnant of the Sali population persists, revealed a 15-fold population increase since the last survey in the early logos, and transect surveys and opportunistic sightings indicate incipient recolonisation of other urbanised areas of northern and central Guam. We estimate the current island-wide population size at similar to 1,400 individuals. The population increase can likely be attributed to a combination of snake control measures and the Sali's ability to exploit urban refugia for nesting and roosting. Although these trends demonstrate some population recovery, a skewed age ratio (>90% adults and subadults) at AAFB and a highly urbanised distribution and low abundance outside AAFB indicate that snake predation continues to strongly impact the population. More intensive snake suppression efforts, particularly in forested areas, may allow for the Sali population to attain its former distribution and abundance on Guam. More broadly, our findings reinforce the importance of urban areas as refugia for some threatened species.

AB  - The middle reaches of the Yangtze River region (MRYRR) are China's first trans-regional urban agglomeration, located in the center of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The MRYRR is an important ecological reserve, and its land cover changes are affected by both socio-economic development and geographical environment. In this paper, Landsat ETM/TM/OLI remote sensing images were used to monitor land use and landscape patterns from 1990 to 2015. Through supervised classification, land use transfer matrix, landscape pattern metrics and correlation analysis, the spatial-temporal patterns of land use change and its relationship with socio-economic in the study area were revealed. The results showed that: (1) the main land use types in the study area were cropland (CL) and forestland (FL), accounting for more than three-quarters of the study area. During the study period, built-up land (BL) increased, CL decreased, FL increased first and then decreased; (2) the BL expanded mainly by occupying CL and FL, and regional landscape pattern was gradually fragmented, with complex patch shape and increasing diversity and heterogeneity. Among them, the BL is gradually gathered, and the FL and CL are gradually fragmented; (3) in the past 25 years, the urbanization process in this region has been obvious, and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has increased by 36 times. The socioeconomic variables were positively correlated with BL, orchard (OL) and Shannon diversity index (SHID), and negatively correlated with CL, Wasteland (WL), mean patch size (MPS) and contagion size (CONTAG). The results showed that the urbanization development has a great impact on the region, and the ecological protection task is still challenging. It is necessary to protect high-quality cropland and draw a red line for ecological protection. We should strengthen the construction of ecological corridors and ecological nodes to adapt to regional sustainable development.

AB  - Photographs by research participants capture the multisensory dimension of encounters in shared public spaces that are often difficult to articulate in words. Rather than freezing the moment in stillness, these images of movement and feeling that fuse vision, sound, touch, taste and smell show how racially differentiated bodies explore the city through practices that are part of their everyday life. This paper draws on photographs and poetry by long-term residents of Aboriginal and ethnic-minority backgrounds who express what touches or happens to their bodies in open-air Asian-style markets of Darwin, a rapidly developing tropical north Australian city. Such attention to bodily encounters is central to more-than-representational and feminist approaches that affirm the diversity, materiality and vitality of urban life. In this paper I argue that Deleuzian thinking on images and Elizabeth Grosz's non-aesthetic philosophy for art contributes to this literature by providing an insight into how sensing bodies use photography and poetry to make imperceptible affective forces and matter expressive. The paper shows that such an approach is productive in thinking about the potentialities of city life for bodies of colour with different histories and geographies of racialisation.

AB  - Understanding the causes of spread of overabundant species plays a key role in deciphering their invasion mechanisms, while providing managers with targeted management actions to control their spread. The objective of this research was to quantify the spread of Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix) in Israel and to elucidate the causes of its spread. Long-term occurrence data of Hooded Crow sightings were used to analyze the species range expansion rate. This dataset was analyzed with a range of climatic, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land-use variables. Analysis of opportunistic presence-only data, corrected for possible sampling biases, illustrated traveling waves of eastward expansion, from the Mediterranean coast into Israel's central mountain range, and a star-like pattern of spread southward into the northwestern Negev desert. A diffusion equation model revealed an expansion rate of 1.60 km year(-1). Land-use analysis revealed an affinity of sighted individuals toward urban and low vegetation land types. Hooded Crow sightings were positively correlated with annual precipitation, with the remaining variation being negatively correlated with precipitation during the wettest quarter. Species distribution modeling suggested that the species has established new populations and is currently expanding its range. The slow rate of dispersal is consistent with a neighborhood diffusion pattern, corresponding to the species life-history traits. Human-managed environments, including low-cover agricultural fields, provide constant available food and nesting trees, allowing the Hooded Crow to thrive all year-round. Precipitation may aid in enhancing Hooded Crow tolerance toward other unfavorable physical conditions. In light of these new findings, management plans ought to recognize centers of Hooded Crow activity as indicators of highly disturbed native wildlife communities. Also, our findings emphasize the need to establish agri-environmental schemes (AES) in such areas, which would raise community resistance to overabundant species. As AES are currently not in place on a national scale, and since their creation has the power to improve landscape connectivity of native species, this last component is especially necessary.

AB  - For urban planning and infrastructural projects, considerable attention has been paid to the relationship between soil biota, especially protists, and edaphic conditions in various land-use types having different plant species in the Xiong'an New Area of China. To elucidate this relationship, we assessed edaphic variables and soil biota compositions and compared them among 5 habitat types: human-made forests, crop cultivations, arid rivers, Baiyangdian (BYD) Lake, and around oil wells. In all, 12 experimental plots from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems were assessed using high-throughput sequencing of environmental DNA, targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer 1, and V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene for bacteria, fungi, and protists, respectively. The abundance of bacterial and protist communities was higher than fungi, possibly because fungi prefer acidic soil conditions and likely have greater susceptibility to anthropogenic activities. Across all experimental plots, land-use types contributed the most to the beta-diversity of soil biota, followed by soil moisture. Diversity and richness were significantly higher at aquatic habitats than at terrestrial habitats. Predictive metagenomic analysis of trophic groups predicted relatively high frequency of functional genes from bacterial metabolism pathways (carbohydrate and amino acid); contrary to expectation, phototrophic protists, but not fungal symbionts and protistan consumers, were the dominant group at the BYD Lake. Geographical coordinates showed significant (P < 0.05) relationships with all microbiome taxa (nodes at network) from all land-use types. Moreover, soil-microbiome relationships were more complex and more intense at crop habitats. Links between protist and fungal taxa were the highest at the petroleum-contaminated sampling sites, indicating the impor-tance of these two soil microbiomes in polluted soil. Thus, our findings suggest that human manipulation and land-use types are crucial factors for soil biota structure and composition across our sampling sites.

AB  - During a time when American cultural institutions and their funders have committed to advancing cultural equity and reverse patterns of white supremacy, this study illustrates a possible scenario of what that might look like. The nonprofit arts and cultural landscape observed in Silicon Valley raises questions of how American cities and regions might look in their movement towards equity. Data on these nonprofit organizations in this California region were examined in 2019 and compared with data from a decade earlier. These included numbers and start-up years of nonprofit arts and cultural organizations, their types, expenditures, and mission-based focus. In addition to a decade of change within this landscape, it was contrasted with nine other U.S. city-regions. We found Silicon Valley decidedly different from its peers. In spite of its large central city of San Jose, and a metropolitan population of over three million, there are comparatively few large institutions representative of Western-European cultures in Silicon Valley. In fact, the number of such organizations and their expenditures declined significantly while in other regions such organizations grew, often substantially. At this same time, smaller, culturally specific organizations in Silicon Valley grew significantly revealing an entrepreneurial region with a high percentage of new organizations more closely aligned with the diversity of the its population.

AB  - Simple Summary The bed bugs, Cimex lectularius and C. hemipterus, have undergone a significant resurgence worldwide since the 1990s. Despite reports of bed bug infestations being on the rise in recent years in France, little is known about the geographical dispersion, species composition, and inter-and intraspecific genetic variation among bed bug populations in the Paris area. The collection of 1211 samples of bed bugs from different infested locations in Paris (15 arrondissements) and its suburb cities (18 cities) allowed us to highlight C. lectularius as the predominant species and to document for the first time the presence of C. hemipterus in four infested locations (15th and 19th arrondissements, Bobigny, and Villejuif) in the Paris area. Successful bidirectional sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) gene for 132 specimens representing processed locations revealed two subpopulations of C. lectularius in Paris by neighbor-joining and network phylogenetic analyses. These results provide essential information for further epidemiological and public health studies and may help control management strategies in this metropolis. Cimex lectularius and C. hemipterus are blood-sucking insects with a long history of presence in human communities. We investigated the molecular diversity of the bed bug population of Paris and its suburb cities using cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) sequencing. A total of 1211 specimens belonging to different life stages were collected from 62 infested human dwellings in Paris (13 out of 20 arrondissements) and the surrounding cities (18 cities). Morphological determination and COI sequencing of 132 specimens demonstrated C. lectularius as the predominant species and, surprisingly, the presence of C. hemipterus in four infested areas of Paris and its suburb cities. Neighbor-joining tree and network analyses depicted the presence of two C. lectularius populations. Most samples from Paris and its suburb cities clustered in a major clade. The second population encompasses specimens from Paris (arrondissements 11 and 19) and its suburb cities (e.g., Bobigny, Pantin, and Montreuil) that clustered with Hungary, Czechia, and Finland. This is the second evidence for C. hemipterus infestation in France and the third in Europe, which challenges the classic pattern of C. hemipterus dispersion and implies sympatric occurrence of C. lectularius and C. hemipterus. Since Paris is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, our observations shed light on bed bugs' dispersal dynamic and may help future vector control strategies.

AB  - In early 2016, the city of New York and the Google-backed consortium CityBridge launched LinkNYC, a communication network that enables residents and visitors to access Wi-Fi, charge their phones, and make domestic calls-all for free. The ten-feet tall kiosks scattered around the city are also equipped with screens, cameras, a tablet, speakers, and a microphone. Almost immediately after its launch, many raised concerns about LinkNYC: noise complaints concerning users listening to loud music, homeless people gathering around the kiosks, outrage regarding users watching pornography, as well as the potential threat to privacy the kiosks present. In this paper, I argue that LinkNYC functions as a neoliberal apparatus of listening and silencing in the public sphere through data collection and restrictions of usage of the kiosk in the name of accessibility. As Google's first attempt at occupying the public space, LinkNYC reveals the aspirations for the neoliberal city. Through an ethnographic socio-technological study of LinkNYC, I engage sound studies in current discussions about surveillance. I theorize the modalities of listening in the neoliberal city and discuss competing notions of the public space in smart/responsive cities. I investigate the ideological difference between the smart city and the responsive city and trace the movement from a listening entity to a responsive one, analyzing the implications for privacy. I theorize unsilencing and its politics, discussing examples of re-appropriation of the kiosks. I conducted fieldwork by observing interactions with the kiosks and by doing interviews with citizens, homeless advocacy groups, CityBridge employees, and experts. In addition, I analyze the discourses of CityBridge, local politicians, activists, journalists, and citizens surrounding LinkNYC. This paper is at the theoretical intersection of sound studies, urban studies, science and technology studies, and surveillance studies. Through this case study, I open a theorization of the listening practices of surveillance to look at how power circulates through sound.

AB  - Vibrancy is indispensable and beneficial for revitalization of historic districts. Hence, identifying built environment predictors for vibrancy is of great interest to urban practitioners and policy makers. However, it is challenging. On the one hand, there is no consensus in selection of appropriate proxy for vibrancy. On the other hand, the built environment is multidimensional, but limited studies examined its impacts on vibrancy from different dimensions simultaneously. The Baitasi Area is a typical historic district in Beijing, China. In this study, on the basis of a long-term repeatedly measured dataset generated from the Citygrid sensors, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of street vibrancy in Baitasi Area and examined its built environment predictors in two seasons (i.e., summer/autumn and winter), with pedestrian volume as the proxy for vibrancy and built environment portrayed from four different dimensions (i.e., morphology, configuration, function, and landscape). We found that (1) the street vibrancy in Baitasi Area is temporally relatively evenly distributed, but with higher spatial concentration; (2) microclimate and built environment are more significant in winter than in summer/autumn; (3) street morphology and configuration features are more significant predictors than street function and landscape features; (4) generally, streets with higher point of interest (POI) diversity, higher buildings, and stronger network connection tend to have higher vibrancy. This study provides decision makers with insights in revitalizing historic districts.

AB  - Because of the complex activities involved in IoT networks of a smart city, an important question arises: What are the core activities of the networks as a whole and its basic information flow structure? Identifying and discovering core activities and information flow is a crucial step that can facilitate the analysis. This is the question we are addressing-that is, to identify the core services as a common core substructure despite the probabilistic nature and the diversity of its activities. If this common substructure can be discovered, a systemic analysis and planning can then be performed and key policies related to the community can be developed. Here, a local IoT network can be represented as an attributed graph. From an ensemble of attributed graphs, identifying the common subgraph pattern is then critical in understanding the complexity. We introduce this as the common random subgraph (CRSG) modeling problem, aiming at identifying a subgraph pattern that is the structural "core" that conveys the probabilistically distributed graph characteristics. Given an ensemble of network samples represented as attributed graphs, the method generates a CRSG model that encompasses both structural and statistical characteristics from the related samples while excluding unrelated networks. In generating a CRSG model, our method using a multiple instance learning algorithm transforms an attributed graph (composed of structural elements as edges and their two endpoints) into a "bag" of instances in a vector space. Common structural components across positively labeled graphs are then identified as the common instance patterns among instances across different bags. The structure of the CRSG arises through the combining of common patterns. The probability distribution of the CRSG can then be estimated based on the connections and distributions from the common elements. Experimental results demonstrate that CRSG models are highly expressive in describing typical network characteristics.

AB  - Dengue virus, the etiological agent of dengue fever (DF) occurs in four genetically distinct serotypes (DENV1-4), being transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes. DF incidence is increasing in Brazil, following vector dispersal, proliferation and DENV serotypes introduction, co-circulation and substitution. Medium- and small-sized cities in Sao Paulo State, such as Marilia (Midwest region), have been affected by huge epidemics. To understand the evolution of DENV epidemics in medium-sized cities, in this study a historical data on DENV incidence (2000-2015) in Marilia, was evaluated. Previous studies disclosed regional and specific DF outcomes associated with 2007 outbreak in that city, when co-circulating DENV1 and DENV3 presented different hematological profiles. In this study, characteristics of 2007 DENV epidemics were compared to the epidemiological, hematological and demographic outlines of the major outbreak of DENV1 in Marilia in 2015. DENV1 genetic diversity was assessed through capsid and pre-membrane junction encoding gene (CprM) sequencing. The results revealed circulation of DENV1 serotype from 2007 to 2015, with epidemics occurring every three-years until 2013 and then, increasing yearly. There were significant differences in hematological profiles of DENV1 patients between 2015 and 2007. CprM showed DENV1 genetic variability in 2015, contrasting with the unique sequence pattern in 2007. These results reinforce the regional and temporal characteristics of DENV epidemics that need local public health research to improve care for people and to limit the spread of new serotypes/genotypes to uninfected areas.

AB  - An increase in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollution poses significant challenges to human and ecosystem health in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) of the Yangtze River. Based on the combination of PAH analysis with qPCR and high-throughput sequencing of bacteria, 32 topsoil samples collected from 16 sites along the TGR were used to investigate the distribution and biodegradation pathways of PAHs in the water-level-fluctuation zone (WLFZ). The results indicated that the concentrations of PAHs were 43.8-228.2 and 30.8-206.3 ng/g soil (dry weight) under the high- and low-water-level (HWL and LWL) conditions, respectively. The PAH concentration in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas. Under both the HWL and LWL conditions, the abundance of the bamA gene, a biomarker of anaerobic PAH biodegradation, was significantly higher than that of the ring-hydroxylating-dioxygenase (RHD) gene, a biomarker of aerobic PAH biodegradation. The abundance of the bamA gene was significantly positively correlated with PAHs (R-2 = 0.8), and the biodegradation percentage of PAHs incubated anaerobically was greater than that in the aerobically incubated microcosm experiments. These data implicated a key role of the anaerobic pathway in PAH biodegradation. Co-occurrence network analysis suggested that anaerobic Anaerolineaceae, Dechloromonas, Bacteroidetes_vadin HA17 and Geobacter were key participants in the biodegradation of PAHs. The diversity analysis of functional bacteria based on the bamA gene and microcosm experiments further demonstrated that nitrate was the primary electron acceptor for PAH biodegradation. These findings provide a new perspective on the mechanism of PAH biodegradation in the TGR and knowledge that can be used to develop strategies for environmental management. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Large destinations such as cities usually offer multiple and diverse attractions, a selection of which will be visited by tourists during their stay. This study analyses the factors influencing the probability of the co-occurrence of visits to attractions in the city of Madrid (Spain). On the basis of five years (2013-2018) of user-generated data, we built a network formed by the attractions visited by the tourists and fitted it to an exponential random graph model. The results show that a tourist's decision to visit a particular attraction was influenced by its popularity and rating. In addition, homophily in popularity, rating and some attraction categories was detected. In the analysis made of the temporal trend of the attraction network, it was found that homophily in the category of museums and theatres strengthened over the study period. Identifying the forces that connect attractions is crucial for their efficient management, promotion, and preservation.

AB  - In this egocentric network study, we explored Chinese collectivism in relation to social network characteristics and sex work-related stigma among mid-age female sex workers (FSWs). Respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit 1245 mid-age FSWs from three cities in China. We found that a one standard deviation (SD) increase in FSWs' collectivism was associated with a 0.18 SD decrease in social support (95% CI - 0.32, - 0.04), a 0.20 SD decrease in network effective size (i.e., the diversity of a social network; 95% CI - 0.30, - 0.10), and a 0.21 SD decrease in network betweenness (i.e., the "bridging potential" of egos within their networks; 95% CI - 0.33, - 0.09). Among participants who perceived more sex work stigma, the association between collectivism and FSWs' network betweenness was attenuated. In a collective culture emphasizing group values and honor, belonging to a less interconnected social network may give FSWs a structural advantage to cope with stigma and secure social support.

AB  - The China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor (CMREC) is the key comprehensive strategic area of the "Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)" that would directly accelerate the impact of human activities on land use and land cover change (LUCC). The study firstly clarified LUCC and environmental and socioeconomic driving factors in the CMREC from 1992 to 2015. It will help face the challenges of multinational sustainable development and take more targeted measures with cooperation. The results showed that the ecological environment deteriorated in the CMREC with increasing cropland, unused land, urban areas and grassland. Forest was the largest source of unused land, and urban areas consistently expanded into other areas. Compared with Mongolia and Russia, China had the highest rate of urbanization (19.68%) and experienced a prominent increase in forest revegetation (0.25%). LUCC mostly occurred along the railways, highways and rivers adjacent to vulnerability gravity centres. Overall, the relative importance of socioeconomic factors was higher than that of the environment, and railway was the most important factor. In the long term, human activity, especially national-level policy, had a direct and even far-reaching impact on LUCC.

AB  - Gulls are ubiquitous in urban areas due to a growing reliance on anthropogenic feeding sites, which has led to changes in their abundance, distribution, and migration ecology, with implications for disease transmission. Gulls offer a valuable model for testing hypotheses regarding the dynamics of influenza A virus (IAV) - for which gulls are a natural reservoir in urban areas. We sampled sympatric populations of Ring-billed (Larus delawarensis), Herring (L. argentatus), and Great Black-backed Gulls (L. marinus) along the densely populated Atlantic rim of North America to understand how IAV transmission is influenced by drivers such as annual cycle, host species, age, habitat type, and their interplay. We found that horizontal transmission, rather than vertical transmission, played an outsized role in the amplification of IAV due to the convergence of gulls from different breeding grounds and age classes. We detected overlapping effects of age and season in our prevalence model, identifying juveniles during autumn as the primary drivers of the seasonal epidemic in gulls. Gulls accumulated immunity over their lifespan, however short-term fluctuations in seroprevalence were observed, suggesting that migration may impose limits on the immune system to maintain circulating antibodies. We found that gulls in coastal urban habitats had higher viral prevalence than gulls captured inland, correlating with higher richness of waterbird species along the coast, a mechanism supported by our movement data. The peak in viral prevalence in newly fledged gulls that are capable of long-distance movement has important implications for the spread of pathogens to novel hosts during the migratory season as well as for human health as gulls increasingly utilize urban habitats.

AB  - The causal pathways of the anthropogenic disturbance effect on the above-ground vegetation, seed bank, and seed rain can provide information to understand the dynamic of natural regeneration in order to predict changes in the community assemblage. However, due to the spatial and temporal complexity of the natural regeneration process, these pathways have rarely been tested empirically. Therefore, to understand these pathways on natural regeneration, we propose the integration of composition, richness and functional diversity as indicators of assemblage vulnerability, and apply them to the above-ground vegetation, seed bank, and seed rain. In an Abies religiosa forest, in Mexico City, we determined anthropogenic disturbance indicators, environmental indicators and indicators of assemblage vulnerability. In order to assess if anthropogenic disturbances increase the abundance of weeds and modify functional diversity, we built linear mixed models (LMMs), generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and structural equation models (SEMs) and selected the best-fitting models according to Akaike's information criterion. We carried out RLQ/Fourth-corner tests in order to determine those regeneration functional traits of weeds that favor their tolerance to anthropogenic disturbances. We found that the anthropogenic disturbances could drive the community into an alternative stable state, in which the presence of weeds could homogenize its functional diversity. Our results showed that the applied indicators reduce the complexity of the study of the natural regeneration process and determine the causal pathways of the anthropogenic disturbance, in order to predict the trends of the community assemblage.

AB  - Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis results from complex interactions between human beings, vectors and the environment. Parasitic species differ in epidemiological and geographical contexts.
   Methods: We studied a retrospective cohort of 696 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis treated at a reference centre in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 2000 and 2015. We analysed displacements due to work, leisure and migrations with identification of Leishmania species.
   Results: The geographic distribution of autochthonous cases showed that >95% of infections occurred in urban areas. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, most cases were concentrated in the cities surrounding forest parks and nature conservation areas. The same applies to the city of Rio de Janeiro, where these infections occurred in the neighbourhoods surrounding some mountain and forest areas. The non-displacement group included 575 (82.6%) patients and the displacement group included 121 (17.4%) patients. Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis predominated in both groups. Other species were found in the displacement group.
   Conclusions: The disordered urbanization of the state of Rio de Janeiro in recent decades has created conditions for the emergence of urban foci of transmission close to forest areas. Changes in the environment, movement of infected individuals and adaptation of sandflies may have contributed to this.

AB  - Landscapes can influence the distribution of harvesting by influencing animal distribution and hunter access. For species like caribou, Rangifer tarandus, decades-long shifts in abundance and distribution might alter such relationships, but few studies have been conducted at such scales. We examined relationships between landscape features and 21,380 harvest records of migratory caribou in Newfoundland during caribou population growth (1980s), cessation of growth (1990s), and decline (2000s). We focused on features hypothesized to influence the distributions of caribou and hunters: lichen landcover, roads, cutblocks, outfitter camps, power lines, and towns. We uncovered larger harvests by resident hunters of male and female caribou among lichen landcover, likely providing preferred caribou forage, and larger harvests by non-resident hunters of male caribou away from towns, reflecting the locations of outfitter camps. Only during later decades, resident harvests occurred nearer power lines and cutblocks, likely providing hunter access and reflecting risk-prone foraging by caribou. We surmise that the harvest was facilitated by open habitats, preferred by caribou, and anthropogenic features leading to hunter access, especially as the caribou population declined. Such knowledge at broad scales is increasingly important in an era of widespread disruption to landscapes.

AB  - The temperate United States has experienced increasing incidence of mosquito-borne diseases. Recent studies conducted in Baltimore, MD have demonstrated a negative relationship between abundances of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Culex mosquitoes and mean neighborhood income level, but have not looked at the presence of pathogens. Mosquitoes collected from five socioeconomically variable neighborhoods were tested for infection by West Nile, chikungunya, and Zika viruses in 2015 and 2016, and again from four of the neighborhoods in 2017. Minimum infection rates of pooled samples were compared among neighborhoods for each year, as well as among individual blocks in 2017. West Nile virus was detected in both Ae. albopictus and Culex pools from all neighborhoods sampled in 2015 and 2017. No infected pools were detected in any year for chikungunya or Zika viruses, and none of the target viruses were detected in 2016. Infection rates were consistently higher for Culex than for Ae. albopictus. Minimum infection rate was negatively associated with mean neighborhood income for both species in 2015. Although earlier work has shown a positive association between block-level abandonment and mosquito abundance, no association was detected in this study. Still, we demonstrate that viral infection in mosquito pools can differ substantially across adjacent urban neighborhoods that vary by income. Though trap security and accessibility often inform city sampling locations, detecting and managing arboviral risk requires surveillance across neighborhoods that vary in socioeconomics, including lower income areas that may be less accessible and secure but have higher infection rates.

AB  - The study aimed to assess the effect of informal tourist trails on the abiotic conditions and floristic composition of deciduous forest undergrowth in an urban area. The study was carried out in the Wolski Forest in Krakow (Poland) in 2020 using a total of 400 plots (1 m x 1m) situated in close (CL) and further (FU) vicinity of informal (<50 cm in width) and formal (>= 150 cm in width) tourist trails in the forest interior and forest edge sites.Agreater content of N-NH4, P, and K occurred in the forest interior sites, while greater light intensity, species number, total plant cover, and stem height were found in the forest edge sites. Greater light intensity and a higher percentage of total and damaged plant cover were recorded in CLplots, while a greater height of plants was seen in FUplots. The number of species was higher in plots located along informal trails than in plots along formal trails. The dominance of therophytes and autochorous species along informal trails in the forest interior sites might be a result of successful diaspore dispersal by people walking, while the substantial share of zoochorous species along formal trails suggests their dissemination by dogs accompanying visitors. The dominance of forest and ruderal taxa in the forest interior sites suggests unfavourable conditions for the germination of meadow and grassland species. The higher cover-abundance of alien plants in CL plots along informal trails and FU plots along formal traits suggests that alien plants growing near the formal trails are more exposed to mechanical damage.

AB  - The impact of global change on biodiversity is commonly assessed in terms of changes in species distributions, community richness and community composition. Whether and how much associations between species are also changing is much less documented. In this study, we quantify changes in large-scale patterns of species associations in bird communities in relation to changes in species composition. We use network approaches to build three community-aggregated indices reflecting complementary aspects of species association networks. We characterise the spatio-temporal dynamics of these indices using a large-scale and high-resolution dataset of bird co-abundances of 109 species monitored for 17 years (2001-2017) from 1969 sites across France. We finally test whether spatial and temporal changes in species association networks are related to species homogenisation estimated as the spatio-temporal dynamics of species turnover (beta-diversity) and community generalism (community generalisation index). The consistency of these relationships is tested across three main habitats, namely woodland, grassland and human settlements. We document a directional change in association-based indices in response to modifications in species turnover and community generalism in space and time. Weaker associations and sparser networks were related to lower spatial species turnover and higher community generalism, suggesting an overlooked aspect of biotic homogenisation affecting species associations and may also have an impact on species interactions. We report that this overall pattern is not constant across habitats, with opposite relationships between biotic homogenisation and change in species association networks in urban versus forest communities suggesting distinct homogenisation processes. Although species associations contain only partial signatures of species interactions, our study highlights that biotic homogenisation translates to finer changes in community structure by affecting the number, strength and type of species associations.

AB  - Given the rapidly evolving landscape of linguistic prevalence, whereby a majority of the world's existing languages are dying out in favor of the adoption of a comparatively fewer set of languages, the factors behind this phenomenon have been the subject of vigorous research. The majority of approaches investigate the temporal evolution of two competing languages in the form of differential equations describing their behavior at a large scale. In contrast, relatively few consider the spatial dimension of the problem. Furthermore while much attention has focused on the phenomena of language shift-the adoption of majority languages in lieu of minority ones-relatively less light has been shed on linguistic coexistence, where two or more languages persist in a geographically contiguous region. Here, we study the geographical component of language spread on a discrete medium to monitor the dispersal of language species at a microscopic level. Language dynamics is modeled through a reaction-diffusion system that occurs on a heterogeneous network of contacts based on population flows between urban centers. We show that our framework accurately reproduces empirical linguistic trends driven by a combination of the Turing instability, a mechanism for spontaneous pattern-formation applicable to many natural systems, the heterogeneous nature of the contact network, and the asymmetries in how people perceive the status of a language. We demonstrate the robustness of our formulation on two datasets corresponding to linguistic coexistence in the northwestern part of Spain and the southern part of Austria.

AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, the disorderly expansion of land use for urban construction has led to increasingly severe spatial dislocations of ecological land and construction land, and the topic of rationally planning the scale of urban land use and controlling urban sprawl from the perspective of ecological security has become a challenge for many countries. This paper considers the Jiaodong Peninsula as the study area. The ecological sources were obtained by integrating the results of an ecological importance assessment and the data on nature reserves, a basic ecological resistance surface was built, and ecological corridors and buffers were identified using a minimum cumulative resistance model. Three development scenarios were designed for 2015-2030 based on future land use simulation (FLUS) model, namely, natural development (ND), core ecological patch protection (CEP) and ecological security pattern restriction (ESPR). The ND scenario followed the land expansion rate from 2005 to 2015; the CEP scenario used the ecological sources as a forbidden conversion area, and the ESPR scenario used the ecological security pattern as a forbidden conversion area. A multiscale evaluation system based on the ecological security index (ESI) and the landscape pattern was established to analyze the three scenarios in detail. The main conclusions were as follows: (1) the area of ecological sources of the Jiaodong Peninsula was 3296.85 km(2), and 13 ecological corridors were identified, and (2) in the multi-scale ecological security evaluation, the ND scenario destroys the original ecosystem structure of the region, which is not conducive to regional ecological conservation; the CEP scenario still has a trend of landscape fragmentation, and the ESPR scenario performs well in all aspects. Based on the landscape pattern, it was observed that the ESPR scenario had the largest landscape diversity and the most uniform distribution pattern, and the landscape dominance and heterogeneity were both the best. This finding indicated that imposing the ecological security pattern could make it possible to effectively control the spatial form of construction land, avoid excessive dispersion of landscape types, and form a stable and secure ecological pattern. This study can provide an important reference for spatial boundary control of urban development and construction and the formulation of related ecological protection policies. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change affects organisms by exposing them to enhanced sensory stimuli that can elicit novel behavioural responses. A pervasive feature of the built environment is artificial nocturnal lighting, and brightly lit urban areas can influence organism abundance, distribution and community structure within proximate landscapes. In some cases, the attractive or disorienting effect of artificial light at night can draw animals into highly unfavourable habitats, acting as a macroscale attractive ecological sink. Despite their significance for animal ecology, identifying cases of these phenomena and determining their effective scales and the number of organisms impacted remains challenging. Using an integrated set of remote-sensing observations, we quantify the effect of a large-scale attractive sink on nocturnal flights of an outbreak insect population in Las Vegas, USA. At the peak of the outbreak, over 45 million grasshoppers took flight across the region, with the greatest numbers concentrating over high-intensity city lighting. Patterns of dusk ascent from vegetated habitat toward urban areas suggest a daily pull toward a time-varying nocturnal attractive sink. The strength of this attractor varies with grasshopper density. These observations provide the first macroscale characterization of the effects of nocturnal urban lighting on the behaviour of regional insect populations and demonstrate the link between insect perception of the built environment and resulting changes in spatial and movement ecology. As human-induced environmental change continues to affect insect populations, understanding the impacts of nocturnal light on insect behaviour and fitness will be vital to developing robust large-scale management and conservation strategies.

AB  - This study is designed to leverage ubiquitous mobile computing techniques on exploring app-based taxi movement patterns in large cities. To study patterns at different scales, we comprehensively explore both occupied and unoccupied vehicle movement characteristics through not only individual trips but also their aggregations. Moran's I and its variations are applied to explore spatial autocorrelations among different rides. PageRank centrality is applied for a functional network representing traffic flows to discover places of interest. Gyration radius measures the scope of passenger mobility and driver passenger searching. Moreover, cumulative distribution and data visualization techniques are adopted for trip level characteristics and features analysis. The results indicate that the app-based taxi services are serving more neighborhoods other than downtown areas by taking large proportion of relatively shorter trips and contributing to net increase in total taxi ridership although net decrease in downtown areas. The spatial autocorrelations are significant not only within each service but also among services. With the smartphone-based applications, app-based taxi services are able to search passengers in a larger area and move more efficiently during both occupied and unoccupied periods. Mining from huge empty trip trajectory by app-based taxis, we also identify the existence of stationary/stops state and circulations.

AB  - Urban seismology has gained scientific interest with the development of seismic ambient noise monitoring techniques and also for being a useful tool to connect society with the Earth sciences. The interpretation of the sources of seismic records generated by sporting events, traffic, or huge agglomerations arouses the population's curiosity and opens up a range of possibilities for new applications of seismology, especially in the area of urban monitoring. In this contribution, we present the analysis of seismic records from a station in the city of Brasilia during unusual episodes of silencing and noisy periods. Usually, cultural noise is observed in high-fequency bands. We showed in our analysis that cultural noise can also be observed in the low-frequency band, when high-frequency signal is attenuated. As examples of noisy periods, we have that of the Soccer World Cup in Brazil in 2014, where changes in noise are related to celebrations of goals and the party held by FIFA in the city, and the political manifestations in the period of the Impeachment trial in 2016, which reached the concentration of about 300,000 protesters. The two most characteristic periods of seismic silence have been the quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and the trucker strike that occurred across the country in 2018, both drastically reducing the movement of people in the city.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to explore the planned urban renewal and re-scripting of Riyadh's downtown as part of the capital's aim to become a globally recognized city. Specifically, this paper examines in how far internationally established values and narratives are leveraged in the creation of an urban mega-destination that seeks to attract a transnational class of knowledge workers and tourists. The question is explored, in how far and to what extent urban heritage sites and iconic architectural projects are used as strategic tools to promote a process of cultural and economic transformation and in how far the resulting symbolic capital is leveraged to create a status of singularization that appeals to a national and international audience. This study investigates several neighborhoods in the area, analyzing how these will be transformed by Riyadh's plan to turn the downtown into a commercially viable mixed-use destination by means of designated heritage destinations and iconic architecture.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper examines the views and experiences of governmental agencies, architects, developers and residents who are directly or indirectly involved with the planned restructuring of Riyadh's historical downtown. In total, 40 semi-structured interviews were drawn from this stakeholder group to investigate their current understanding of the downtown associated with the effort to convert Riyadh's historical downtown into a profitable urban destination. Five of these interviews were conducted with involved planning offices, and 35 with current residents in the area. In addition, a detailed site survey was conducted through a series of maps to reveal existing land uses, building typologies, states of disrepair, activity levels, pedestrian and car circulation patterns, as well as landmarks, and public spaces in each of the areas.
   Findings
   The subsequent data show that despite many positive outcomes in terms of commercial redevelopment, the adaptive reuse of the existing urban fabric is not considered, nor the preservation of underutilized or abandoned buildings along with its resident diverse communities, activities and milieus, many of which carry on evolving traditions.
   Research limitations/implications
   This is significant because this paper presents a massive case study that ties into a larger debate on cultural globalization where similar practices around the world entail a spatial reorientation of urban districts to attract a transnational cosmopolitan middle class along with a simultaneous displacement of diverse and migrant communities, albeit on a much larger scale. While highlighting the rationale and effectiveness of this approach to create a well-packaged commodity, this paper also underscores the ambiguous consequences of this strategy, which entails the loss of a layered urban fabric that documents the city's evolution through different economic periods, along with the dispersal of migrant communities and their vernacular practices.
   Social implications
   Within this context, the current cultural value of the downtown as a heterogeneous, dynamic and multilayered fabric is debated, which documents the socio-economic conditions of the times in which these layers were formed.
   Departing from the UNESCO's 2011 Recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape and globally accepted sustainability standards, this study contrasts the proposed top-down tabula rasa approach proposed by the local authorities with an inclusive bottom-up approach, which would focus on the adaptive reuse of existing structures by taking into consideration the social meanings of belonging that heritage has for contemporary communities while fostering a more inclusive understanding of heritage as an ongoing cultural process.
   Originality/value
   The implications of the planned conversion of Riyadh's historical downtown into an urban destination have not been previously explored and as a result, there is a conflict of interest between the creation of a marketable image, the preservation of heritage values, sustainable urban practices, social inclusion and Riyadh's aim to become a globally recognized city.
   Plain abstract
   This paper explores the employment of urban renewal and city branding within the context of Riyadh's aim to become a world city. Within this framework, the paper examines the capital's plan to convert the historic downtown into a mega-destination for the country's middle class and national and international tourists.

AB  - The dilemma of openness reflects a long-standing ontological debate about public space. The dilemma is between creating boundless spaces that allow for an infinite diversity of uses but lack coherence, and bounding spaces to secure coherence at the cost of diversity. The implications for the theory and practice of public space planning, regulation, management and design are fundamentally different. By analyzing movement, occupation and identity in public spaces in the context of protest, I explore the concept of spaces of becoming: a fluid approach to public space interpretation and an alternative to the 'dilemma of openness.'

AB  - Objectives: Neighborhood built environments (BEs) are increasingly recognized as being associated with late-life depression. However, their pathways are still understudied. This study investigates the mediating effects of physical and social activities (PA and SA) and functional ability (FA) in the relationships between BEs and late-life depression.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis with data from 2,081 community-dwellers aged 65 years and older in Hong Kong in 2014. Two road-network-based service area buffers (200- and 500-m buffers) adjusted by terrain and slope from participants' residences were created to define the scope of neighborhoods. BEs comprised population density in District Council Constituency Areas, urban greenness, land-use diversity, and neighborhood facilities within 200- and 500-m buffers. Multilevel path analysis models were used.
   Results: More urban greenness within both buffers and more commercial facilities within a 500-m buffer were directly associated with fewer depressive symptoms. SA mediated the relationship between the number of community facilities and depressive symptoms within a 200-m buffer. Neighborhood urban greenness and the number of commercial facilities had indirect associations on depressive symptoms within a 500-m buffer, which were mediated by FA.
   Discussion: Our findings have implications for the ecological model of aging. The mediating effects of SA and FA underscore the importance of promoting active social lifestyles and maintaining FA for older adults' mental health in high-density cities. Policy implications on how to build age-friendly communities are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: The current study simultaneously examines the effects of three different characteristics of the built environment based on the theoretical conceptualizations of density, diversity, and design (3D).
   Methods: By using data of 211,155 street segments in the Southern California metropolitan region across 130 cities, we estimated a set of negative binomial regression models including the 3D measures of the built environment, while accounting for the effects of social structural characteristics of place. Furthermore, the current study examines the potential moderating effects of each 3D feature on crime.
   Results: We found that higher levels of business density are consistently associated with higher levels of crime. The diversity measure is associated with moderately higher levels of crime, whereas the design measure consistently exhibited a negative relationship with crime. Furthermore, we found that the diversity and design measures moderated the business density relationship with crime.
   Conclusion: The results of the current study suggest that it is necessary to examine the different types of physical environment simultaneously to understand the effects of physical environment and the spatial patterns of crime.

AB  - Increasing wildfire activity globally has become an urgent issue with enormous ecological and social impacts. In this work, we focus on analyzing and quantifying the influence of landscape topology, understood as the spatial structure and interaction of multiple land-covers in an area, on fire ignition. We propose a deep learning framework, Deep Fire Topology, to estimate and predict wildfire ignition risk. We focus on understanding the impact of these topological attributes and the rationale behind the results to provide interpretable knowledge for territorial planning considering wildfire ignition uncertainty. We demonstrate the high performance and interpretability of the framework in a case study, accurately detecting risky areas by exploiting spatial patterns. This work reveals the strong potential of landscape topology in wildfire occurrence prediction and its implications to develop robust landscape management plans. We discuss potential extensions and applications of the proposed method, available as an open-source software.

AB  - This study shows that an integrated ecological and cultural corridor network can help guide city development strategies to better preserve ecological and cultural assets. Traditionally, protection zones and suitable development areas are often identified by separately considering natural elements of the ecosystem and elements of cultural significance. To achieve the purpose of cohesively protecting areas of ecological and/or cultural significance, we have developed a corridor-based spatial framework by integrating ecological and cultural assets. Ecological sources are identified by combining protection prioritization, nature reserves, and water bodies. Ecological corridors are delineated by using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model on a resistance surface constructed from land-use data to connect ecological sources. Ecologically important areas are then delineated by creating a 5-km buffer zone from ecological sources and ecological corridors. Cultural corridors are historical routes and rivers surrounded by abundant cultural nodes. Like ecologically important areas, culturally important areas are delineated by creating a 5-km buffer zone from cultural corridors. Comprehensive regions are the overlap of ecologically and culturally important areas. Finally, the integrated network connects all comprehensive regions following ecological corridors and cultural corridors in such a way that the largest number of ecological sources and cultural nodes are reached. We applied this framework in Beijing, China, and the results show that there are 2011 km(2) of ecological sources, 30 ecological corridors, 423 cultural nodes, seven cultural corridors, and 10 comprehensive regions covering 2916 km(2) in the integrated network. The framework adds new insights to the methodology of considering ecological and cultural assets together in developing protection and development strategies.

AB  - Collective behaviour is common in bacteria, plants and animals, and therefore occurs across ecosystems, from biofilms to cities. With collective behaviour, social interactions among individuals propagate to affect the behaviour of groups, whereas group-level responses in turn affect individual behaviour. These cross-scale feedback loops between individuals, populations and their environments can provide fitness benefits, such as the efficient exploitation of uncertain resources, as well as costs, such as increased resource competition. Although the social mechanics of collective behaviour are increasingly well-studied, its role in ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here we introduce collective movement into a model of consumer-resource dynamics to demonstrate that collective behaviour can attenuate consumer-resource cycles and promote species coexistence. We focus on collective movement as a particularly well-understood example of collective behaviour. Adding collective movement to canonical unstable ecological scenarios causes emergent social-ecological feedback, which mitigates conditions that would otherwise result in extinction. Collective behaviour could play a key part in the maintenance of biodiversity.
   Collective movements such as flocking or schooling can benefit a single species, but there may also be wider implications of such behaviour. The authors use a theoretical model to show that collective movement of consumer species can promote species coexistence and ecosystem stability.

AB  - The paper presents the results of a study on the attractiveness to tourists and natives of the cultural qualities of coastal towns on The Pomeranian Way of St. James that are members of the Cittaslow network. Attention to the quality of urban life is inscribed in the development policies of towns applying to join the Cittaslow movement. In order to join the network (apart from the size criterion), towns need to meet a minimum of 50% plus one of the 72 criteria grouped into seven categories. One of the category is Quality of Urban Life Policy, so the towns applying to join Cittaslow commit themselves to actions aimed at improving the quality of urban life. The study on the attractiveness of cultural qualities of towns to tourists and natives was conducted using the author's BRB method, whose added value is its universality and the possibility to study small towns regardless of their membership in the Cittaslow network. BRB is an acronym that stands for BUILDINGS, RELATIONSHIPS, BALANCE, and comprises three scopes of activities: BUILDINGS (iconic building and important sites where the inhabitants and the tourists are present); RELATIONSHIPS (the visual effects of the relations between the inhabitants and the town) and BALANCE (solutions that implement modern technologies). This method enables identification of places that are important to the inhabitants, where urban life takes place and which are often created with the involvement of the inhabitants. These are often the same spaces as those that attract tourists and perhaps stimulate them the desire to visit the town again (BRB-be right back). The aim of the BRB method is shown the attractiveness of small towns. The study has shown that the characteristic feature of Polish Cittaslow towns is their diversity: the architectural attractiveness of three towns is high both to tourists and natives. On the other hand, the urban attractiveness of the examined towns is an insufficient.

AB  - Suggesting new venues to be visited by a user in a specific city remains an interesting but challenging problem, partly because of the inherent high sparsity of the data available in location-based social networks (LSBNs). At the same time, in traditional recommender systems, in order to improve their performance in these sparse situations, different techniques have been proposed mainly by augmenting and aggregating the data available in different domains. In this paper, we address the problem of venue recommendation from a novel perspective: we propose two strategies to select a set of candidate cities in order to use their information when performing recommendations for the users in a specific (target) city. In this context, we categorize users into two different groups (tourists and locals) according to their movement patterns and analyze the potential biases in the recommendations received by each of these groups. We provide an experimental comparison of several recommendation algorithms in a temporal split, where we analyze two strategies to select cities and augment the available data: based on the number of interactions and based on the distance with respect to the target city. Our results show that, in general, extending the available data by proximity increases the performance of the majority of the tested recommenders in terms of relevance and coverage, with almost no change in novelty and diversity. We have found that those users belonging to the tourist group tend to obtain better results in terms of relevance. Furthermore, in general, tourists consistently exhibit different performance by some families of recommenders for other evaluation dimensions, evidencing a popularity bias in user behavior and raising potential fairness issues regarding the quality of the received recommendations. We investigate these aspects and provide methods to better understand the problem. We expect these results could provide readers with an overall picture of what can be achieved in a real-world environment.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure (UGI) has gained increasing attention for its potential to provide numerous benefits. Cultural ecosystem services (CES) refers to those non-materials benefits that play an important role in improving the quality of human life and environmental sustainability. However, to date, a comprehensive study on status quo of CES generated by UGI is limited, especially evaluation methods and indicators specific for UGI. In this study, we reviewed 67 empirical studies on this topic in order to identify: the geographic distribution of research; the UGI types that supply CES; the addressed CES subcategories; the effective methods and indicators for assessing CES; and the challenges and directions for future CES and UGI research.
   The results revealed that: (1) the majority of the studies were more focused on certain specific UGI types, such as parks, waters, and gardens, while studies that consider UGI as a network are lacking; (2) the studies tend to focus on recreation and ecotourism, followed by aesthetic values, educational values, and cultural heritage values; (3) they employed various methods and their authors tended to combine different methods in evaluation; and (4) various indicators were developed to assess CES in UGI.
   Based on those findings, we recommend: (1) examining more UGI types and particulars on the UGI network; (2) taking into account all services during evaluation; (3) developing more methods for evaluating CES to address specific UGI situations, especially when dealing with the evaluation boundary and the relationships between CES; and (4) focusing more on increasing the quantity and quality of indicators, which need to communicate UGI characteristics clearly without ambiguity.

AB  - Gulangyu Island is a special case of social development and changes since modern China. In the past, Chinese and foreign people lived together and Chinese and Western cultures coexisted, resulting in an international community with outstanding cultural diversity and modern quality of life. As a functional carrier, space is of great reference significance to the research on the spatial evolution path of the Gulangyu international community with the accelerating globalization and rapid expansion of urbanization. Based on the interpretation of historical maps and the integration of historical geographic information, this paper explores the evolution path of Gulangyu community space in modern times from the perspective of actor-network theory. It is found that: (1) The change of key actors promotes the spatial evolution of the Gulangyu international community. (2) In the stage of foreign culture dissemination (1840-1902), foreign nationals, as key actors, promoted the formation and development of actor-networks through administrative recruitment and other means, and promoted Gulangyu Island to change from a traditional Minnan community to a modern community form, with the embryonic form of an international community beginning to emerge. (3) In the stage of multicultural integration (1903-1940), overseas Chinese returning home became key actors. The concept of a combination of Western cultures was not only embodied in community management but also acted on space practice to promote the multicultural integration of the Gulangyu international community. This paper summarizes the effects of various factors on the evolution of community space, to provide a reference for other coastal cities to rationally develop islands and promote the multicultural integration of local communities.

AB  - Microplastics pollution in nearshore marine environment has become increasingly prominent and has received widespread attention. As a major leisure and entertainment place in coastal cities, bathing beaches not only provide an environment for microplastics to enter the ocean, but also provide a place for the retention of microplastics. In this paper, the distribution, composition and seasonal variation of microplastics in seawater and sediments of six bathing beaches along the coast of Qingdao were studied. The results showed that the average abundance of microplastics in the sediments of the Qingdao bathing beach was 91.11 +/- 26.76 items/m2 (13.77 +/- 4.39 items/kg) in the winter and 147.78 +/- 34.80 items/m2 (21.98 +/- 5.97 items/kg) in the summer. The microplastic abundance in the seawater in the summer (average: 567.50 +/- 101.06 items/m3) was significantly higher than that in the winter (average: 326.11 +/- 49.03 items/m3, p < 0.05). The abundance of microplastics at the six bathing beaches increased from east to west, consistent with the transport direction of coastal currents. The microplastic abundance in the sediment of non-swimming zone of the bathing beach was significantly higher than that in swimming zone (p < 0.05), and the microplastic abundance in the seawater of the swimming zone was slightly higher than that of the non-swimming zone but with no significant difference (p > 0.05). To an extent, it can reflect the correlation between the abundance of microplastics and human recreational activities. The microplastics detected at the bathing beaches were mainly lines (80.5%) and fragments (7.9%) with a size range of 100 to 1000 mu m. Rayon (41.8%) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 16.9%) were the main polymer types. The microplastic characteristics showed significant seasonal differences, more diversity in summer than in winter. These results emphasized that the distribution and movement of microplastics in bathing beaches were affected by seasons, human activities and coastal currents.

AB  - Appreciation for agricultural sustainability and ecosystem services (ESS) has received considerable attention from the scientific community. However, research has not yet systematically and sufficiently considered the spatial dimension of ESS trade-offs as a source of conflicts. Moreover, approaches for ESS management that address a wide range of beneficiaries and their interactions at landscape scale are lacking. Our main research question is how to motivate different beneficiaries of agricultural landscapes to cooperate in reducing supply-demand mismatches and accompanied conflicts, as well as to assess how different scenarios would impact relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We present a novel and conceptual integrated model in which we employ a combination of three methodological tools: participatory geographic information system (PGIS), agent-based modelling (ABM) and a Bayesian belief network (BBN). The objective of our model simulation is to identify and manage site-specific spatial trade-off patterns and to provide decision support for shifting competitive behavior of individual stakeholders in satisfying their demand for ESS to a collective and cooperative scheme, while jointly striving to attain relevant targets outlined in the SDGs. Attached to this work is a short video depicting our conceptual model. We strongly suggest that tackling a complex social-ecological system necessitates a highly integrated modelling approach that fosters the transition from farm- to landscape-scale management, from individualistic to collective action, and from competitive to cooperative behavior.

AB  - Brazilian society has frequently been described as polarized during the country's recent political and economic crisis. In 2018, a wave of opposition to the centre-left Workers' Party culminated in the election of Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist who portrays the political left as a malevolent force in Brazilian society. In this paper I explore this polarization through drawing on ethnographic research with the Homeless Workers' Movement (Movimento de Trablhadores Sem-Teto, MTST), a large urban social movement that develops settlements on underutilized land in the city, and a prominent civil society opponent of Bolsonaro. More specifically, I examine a key site of socio-spatial tension in Sao Paulo, Paulista Avenue, as a new political right came to predominate on the city's main thoroughfare during the campaign to impeach the Workers' Party President, Dilma Rousseff. I show how the perceived intolerance of the mobilized right helped to establish new normative codes that regulated the political symbolism which could be displayed in public spaces. Lastly, I consider how the vilification of the MTST in particular and the political left in general by the new right is embedded in broader structures of stigmatization.

AB  - The Eastern Cape Province harbors almost half of the indigenous forest in South Africa, but these forests are threatened by large-scale agricultural and urban development planned for the coming decade. Additional anthropogenic development is likely to cause further fragmentation and degradation of forests inhabited by the dusky pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus hesperidus). We used eight microsatellite markers to study the genetic diversity, population structure, and migration, of P. hesperidus (n = 120) across 14 sites in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa. We examined the effect of contemporary land cover types on genetic differentiation to assess whether current levels of urbanization and agricultural development affect gene flow. High gene flow and low population structure were evident across sampled sites, apart from genetic discontinuities at the northern (Oribi Gorge Nature Reserve) and southern (Alexandria Forest) ends of the seaboard. Genetic discontinuity at Oribi Gorge may relate to anthropogenic modification of two rivers surrounding the forest, while the Alexandria-linked barrier is a climatic break known as the Bedford gap. Migration rates generally were low between sites except for one Scarp forest, Manubi State Forest, from which individuals dispersed to other sites. The Amatole Mistbelt forests supported high genetic diversity, and likely served as a refugium for P. hesperidus during the Last Glacial Maximum. The composition of land cover classes between sites was a poor predictor of genetic differentiation, although it seems likely that P. hesperidus uses riparian habitats and wetlands for dispersal. Lastly, urban and agricultural development did not have a significant effect on genetic differentiation, which may reflect the wide niche breadth and intermediate distribution range of the species. This study provides insights into genetic diversity and gene flow of P. hesperidus across the study region prior to agricultural intensification and large-scale urbanization.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic entailed varying restrictions on access, movement and social behavior in populations around the world. Knowledge about how people coped with "soft-touch" restrictions can inform urban spatial planning strategies that enhance resilience against future pandemics. We analyzed data from an online place based survey on 2845 places across Sweden that respondents abstained from visiting, visited with similar frequency, or visited more frequently in spring 2020 as compared to before the pandemic. In spatial logistic regression models, we relate geographical and sociodemographic properties of places (fields, forests, water, residential population density and daytime population density) to self-perceived changes in wellbeing from visiting the given place less or more often, respectively. Abstaining from visiting places with natural features located in areas of high residential density was associated with a self-perceived negative influence on wellbeing. Yet, fields, forests and water were strongly associated with places people claimed wellbeing benefits from during pandemic restrictions. The further a visited place was from the respondent's home, the more likely it was to have a positive wellbeing influence. As an illustrative case, we map our models onto the landscape of Stockholm, showing that some neighborhoods are likely more resilient than others when coping with pandemic restrictions. Both the most and least resilient neighborhoods span the socio-economic spectrum. Urban planning will do well to enable equitable, easy access to natural settings by foot or bike, to increase pandemic preparedness as well as support climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection.

AB  - Urban growth and intensification are projected to increase as the global human population increases. Historically, urban areas have been disregarded as suitable wildlife habitat, but it is now known that these areas can be biodiverse and that wildlife species can adapt to the environmental conditions. One such urban-dwelling species is the Eurasian red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, which has suffered population declines in several countries throughout its range in recent decades. The current published literature was systematically reviewed to determine whether or not urban habitats are suitable refugia for red squirrels, through identifying and discussing key topics regarding the urban ecology of red squirrels. Urban environments can support higher population densities of red squirrels than rural areas, probably due to the widespread and reliable provision of anthropogenic supplemental food alongside natural food sources. The availability and quality of urban greenspaces are important determinants of the suitability of urban habitats for red squirrels, as they provide natural food sources and nesting sites. Despite the barriers present in urban landscapes (e.g. roads), red squirrels can still disperse and maintain gene flow at the population level. Road traffic accidents appear to be a significant cause of mortality in some urban red squirrel populations, and seasonal peaks of mortality occur during the autumn months. Diseases (e.g. squirrelpox virus) can also be a significant cause of mortality, although effects differ between populations and depend on whether grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis are present. Many of the predation events that affect red squirrels appear to be due to free-ranging domestic and feral cats Felis catus, although there is currently little evidence to suggest that predation is a limiting factor for urban red squirrel populations. We conclude that urban areas can be suitable refugia for red squirrels, provided that high-quality greenspaces are maintained. Mitigation measures may also be necessary to reduce population mortality and to prevent disease outbreaks.

AB  - The rapid rate of urbanization within the Upper Chattahoochee Watershed (UCW) is threatening the provision of ecosystem services (ESs) for six million residents of the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. This study uses the land cover change model TerrSet to project future land cover from 2016 to 2040. The modular toolset InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) is used to assess the efficacy of four land use policies in maintaining the provision of three ESs (carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and water quality) within the UCW. The Baseline scenario represents past urbanization trends, whereas the Urbanization scenario accounts for a higher urban growth rate. The Plan 2040 scenario includes existing policy guidelines, and the Conservation scenario adds forested riparian buffer areas. Two integrated indexes and an economic valuation of ESs were used to combine all ESs and analyze the overall performance of each policy. The first index uses unequal weights for ESs based on the Analytical Hierarchical Process, whereas the second index uses equal weights. The values of both integrated indexes and economic values were highest in the Conservation scenario and lowest in the Urbanization scenario. No significant differences in the provision of ESs were found between the Baseline and the Plan 2040 scenarios. However, the integrated indexes and economic values for both land use policies declined over time. Our study will feed into the ongoing movement of sustainable watershed management for ensuring the provision of ESs, especially for rapidly urbanizing cities worldwide, in general, and in the United States, in particular.

AB  - Encroaching urban development is a leading cause of habitat loss, replacing natural areas with anthropogenic infrastructure and road networks. Roadways can influence the spatial ecology and survival of mammalian carnivores, particularly felids, thereby threatening longterm persistence and conservation of sensitive populations. Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) are a federally endangered felid in the United States with breeding populations restricted to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, an area of extensive anthropogenic expansion. We evaluated the influence of road networks on ocelot survival using a long-term telemetry dataset (1982-2001, n = 59) and draw comparisons with a spatially referenced historical dataset of ocelot-vehicle collisions in the same area (1982-2020, n = 54). Vehicle collisions accounted for 40% of radio-collared ocelot fatalities. Annual survival rates were 0.90 (95% CI = 0.84-0.95) for resident ocelots and 0.66 (95% CI = 0.45-0.97) for transient ocelots. We evaluated biological and road-related factors that may influence ocelot survival using Cox proportional hazards regression. The top model included density of unpaved, low-volume, and high-volume roads within home ranges and resident-transient status. Mortality risk increased 16% with every 0.07 km/km(2) increase of high-volume roads within annual home range, decreased 45% with every 1.12 km/km(2) increase of unpaved roads, and decreased 276% for residents compared to transients. Further, probability of mortality specifically from vehicle collision increased with greater density of low-volume roads within ocelot home ranges. Within the historical dataset of ocelot-vehicle collisions, 46% occurred on low -volume roads while 39% occurred on high-volume roads. Our results highlight the necessity for mitigation strategies on low-volume roads which cause the most ocelot-vehicle collisions. In addition, continued attention towards high-volume roads is necessary to ocelot conservation. Understanding how road attributes affect the survival of species sensitive to urbanization and habitat fragmentation can aid in their conservation. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

KW  - GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB  - The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a typical combinatorial optimization problem, which is often applied to sensor placement, path planning, etc. In this paper, an improved ACO algorithm based on an adaptive heuristic factor (AHACO) is proposed to deal with the TSP. In the AHACO, three main improvements are proposed to improve the performance of the algorithm. First, the k-means algorithm is introduced to classify cities. The AHACO provides different movement strategies for different city classes, which improves the diversity of the population and improves the search ability of the algorithm. A modified 2-opt local optimizer is proposed to further tune the solution. Finally, a mechanism to jump out of the local optimum is introduced to avoid the stagnation of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested in numerical experiments using 39 TSP instances, and results shows that the solution quality of the AHACO is 83.33% higher than that of the comparison algorithms on average. For large-scale TSP instances, the algorithm is also far better than the comparison algorithms.

AB  - The Eurasian Collared-Dove (Streptopelia decaocto) is one of the most successful invasive bird species across the world. Worryingly, the invasive dove is a known reservoir of many diseases, some of which can potentially infect mammals (including human beings). Additionally, aggressive behaviors have been recorded toward other bird species resulting in territory and nest usurpation. Thus, the presence of this species poses an important risk for native species with similar habits, particularly in insular systems. Based on this, we carried out this study to assess the density and distribution of the Eurasian Collared-Dove in the island of Cozumel, as well as to evaluate the relationship between their abundance and the environmental characteristics of the places they inhabit. We estimated their distance-corrected densities in the island's largest town and performed an inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation to visualize their distribution. We performed a generalized linear model (GLM) to assess relationships between the environmental variables and the abundance of doves using a reduced model procedure. We obtained 137 records of doves present in 94% of all survey sites and an estimated density of 6.8 ind/ha, for a total of 6,670 doves in San Miguel de Cozumel. We did not find a spatial pattern of the dove's distribution on the urban setting, but we found an interaction between their abundances with tree cover and building height. Our findings, together with previous evidence of infection risk and aggressive behavior, make this species a threat to the native species communities of fragile ecosystems such as the island of Cozumel.

AB  - Land-use transformations altering the ecosystem function have impacted the sustenance of natural resources. Implementation of unplanned developmental activities in the ecologically fragile regions has contributed to frequent landslides, conversion of perennial rivers to intermittent or seasonal rivers, reduced water retention capability, etc. Addressing these challenges entails understanding the drivers of land-use change and also their role in altering land uses. Large-scale linear projects such as roads and railways, though contribute to better infrastructure and enhance employment opportunities but severely change the landscape structure affecting peoples' livelihood due to the reduction of ecosystem goods and services. Planned interventions are essential for adopting appropriate land-use trends and shift the trajectory of ecosystem service provision through prior visualization of land-use dynamics with likely impacts. The current study analyses the possible land-use changes in the ecologically fragile central Western Ghats with the proposed railway networks, namely (i) Mysore-Kushalnagar and (ii) Mysore-Thalassery (limited to Karnataka state), using an agent-based model (Fuzzy-AHP-CA-Markov) considering the linear project regions with a buffer of 5 km. The analyses reveal a reduction of forests by 2 and 5%, respectively, during 2010 and 2019. This trend would continue with a significant forest decline by 2026. Areas under built-up have increased over 5% during 2010-2019, which would increase by 7% (2019 and 2026) at the expense of cultivation lands. Major cities such as Mysore and Kushalnagara would witness concentrated urban growth with sprawl in the peripheries, while other towns have undergone leapfrog developments. The spatial distribution of fauna and flora indicates that most parts of the buffer region endow endemic species and serve as foraging grounds. Prediction of likely land uses in 2026 suggests that these regions would undergo large-scale alterations threatening fauna and flora. Implementing linear projects in the ecologically fragile Western Ghats would further destabilize the region, posing a threat with the increased hazard frequencies and the sustenance of natural resources.

AB  - 1. The Amazon basin hosts the Earth's highest diversity of freshwater fish. Fish species have adapted to the basin's size and seasonal dynamics by displaying a broad range of migratory behaviour, but they are under increasing threats; however, no study to date has assessed threats and conservation of Amazonian migratory fishes.
   2. Here, the available knowledge on the diversity of migratory behaviour in Amazonian fishes is synthesized, including the geographical scales at which they occur, their drivers and timing, and life stage at which they are performed.
   3. Migratory fishes are integral components of Amazonian society. They contribute about 93% (range 77-99%) of the fisheries landings in the basin, amounting to -US$436 million annually.
   4. These valuable fish populations are mainly threatened by growing trends of overexploitation, deforestation, climate change, and hydroelectric dam development. Most Amazonian migratory fish have key ecological roles as apex predators, ecological engineers, or seed-dispersal species. Reducing their population sizes could induce cascading effects with implications for ecosystem stability and associated services.
   5. Conserving Amazonian migratory fishes requires a broad portfolio of research, management, and conservation actions, within an ecosystem-based management framework at the basin scale. This would require trans-frontier coordination and recognition of the crucial importance of freshwater ecosystems and their connectivity.
   6. Existing areas where fishing is allowed could be coupled with a chain of freshwater protected areas. Management of commercial and subsistence species also needs fisheries activities to be monitored in the Amazonian cities and in the floodplain communities to allow assessments of the status of target species, and the identification of management units or stocks. Ensuring that existing and future fisheries management rules are effective implies the voluntary participation of fishers, which can be achieved by increasing the effectiveness and coverage of adaptive community-based management schemes.

AB  - Sanitary sewage network is relatively rarely considered as the cause of urban floods. Its hydraulic overload can result not only in flooding, but also sanitary contamination of subcatchments. Stormwater is the main reason for this overload. In contrast to the stormwater or combined sewer system, these waters infiltrate into the network in an uncontrolled way, through ventilation holes of covers or structural faults and lack of tightness of manholes. Part of stormwater infiltrates into the soil, where it leaks into pipelines. This greatly hinders assessing the quantity of stormwater influent into the sanitary sewer system. Standard methods of finding correlation between rainfall and the intensity of stormwater flow are ineffective. This is confirmed, i.a. by the studies performed in an existing network, presented in this paper. Only when residuals analysis was performed using the ARIMA and ARIMAX methods, the authors were able to develop a mathematical model enabling to assess the influence of rainfall depth on the stormwater effluent from the sewage network. Owing to the possibility of using the rainfall depth forecasts, the developed mathematical model enables to prepare the local water and sewerage companies for the occurrence of urban floods as well as hydraulic overload of wastewater treatment plants.

AB  - Influence of land use and population characteristics on solid-liquid partitioning of heavy metals in aquatic ecosystems is little understood. This study hypothesised that the partitioning of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) between water and sediments is influenced by different land use classes, their configuration patterns including patch density, Shannon's diversity index, largest patch index, and splitting index and population density. Relationships between variables were investigated from different distances to the stream network (sub-catchment and riparian scales) and considering land use patterns within individual land use classes and individual sub-catchments as a whole (class and landscape levels, respectively). The study outcomes confirmed that the influence of land use and configuration on metals partitioning is scale independent. However, population density increases metal bioavailability at the riparian scale compared to the sub-catchment scale. Agricultural lands discharge the highest fractions of dissolved metals at both spatial scales (eigenvectors = 0.409 - sub-catchment, and -0.533 - riparian, whilst metals have opposite loadings). Positive relationships between splitting index and metal partitioning confirmed that the division of anthropogenic land uses into smaller patches reduces water pollution. However, high fragmentation of forested areas increases the fraction of soluble metals. Further, high patch density and patch diversity are beneficial for controlling the solubility of some metals. Configuration metrics at the landscape level fundamentally reproduce the patterns of the largest land use type and are not effective for assessing metal partitioning. Therefore, analyses at the class level are preferred. This research investigation contributes essential knowledge to improve land use management strategies and, thereby, help safeguard urban waterways. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to sea-level rise (SLR) but are also valued for their potential to provide effective nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Ecological benefits from these ecosystems can be constrained under urban settings by anthropogenic disturbances and pressures, so restoration activities are promoted as a management approach. Here we report on the potential for restoration of disused commercial salt extraction pans to enhance carbon (C) sequestration in the urban Swartkops Estuary, South Africa. We also considered the impact of SLR to 2100 on the distribution of estuarine habitats, the vulnerability of built infrastructure to tidal flooding, and how C sequestration is projected to change over time using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Potential restoration of all salt pans (320 ha) to estuarine habitat was estimated to result in a gain of 67 850 Mg C. Establishing tidal connectivity was investigated as a potential restoration action, but most of the salt pan area was above the elevation of the current tidal range and would require excavation. Although conversion of the salt pans to estuarine habitat was predicted to occur without intervention under SLR, 44% of the original area would remain unchanged. Restoring hydrological connectivity to the estuary for these salt pans would significantly increase the extent of transitional/floodplain marsh, even under SLR to 2100. C sequestration was predicted to be 15% higher (54 614.8 Mg C) by 2100 if the salt pans could be restored, compared to if no action is taken. Overall, restoration of the salt pans has the potential to enhance C sequestration, but SLR will still cause large losses of supratidal marsh due to 'coastal squeeze' and extensive tidal flooding of developed areas by 2100 in the lower reaches of the estuary. A full-scale restoration approach for the Swartkops Estuary could use C sequestration potential to fund the project through carbon offsetting if the revenue exceeds the cost of the restoration activities, but additional social and ecological goals also need to be incorporated if the outcome is to be holistic and beneficial.

AB  - As our metropolitan zones seek after development and eat up enormous amounts of energy and produce monstrous measures of waste, we are confronted with the test of dealing with the present circumstance in a manner which is both capable and economical. One practical urban waste-to-energy technology is anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic absorption (AD) has been a useful fuel hotspot for more than 100 years and is of now being occupied with nations over the world in rustic territories to create electricity and heat, however it presently can't seem to make an enormous movement to the urban environment how -ever it is a practical and mature process. Applied to the organic waste that is generated in the urban envi-ronments, anaerobic digestion could provide an evaluative solution to the increasing garbage problems while simultaneously decreasing external energy necessities. The cost of transporting waste outskirts of cities to landfills will keep on rising and if a considerable portion of this waste could be held, digested, reduced, and transformed into useable energy in the urban environment, then this is something to be seriously considered. The present paper is to investigate the practicality of power and energy generation through the use of anaerobic digestion of organic waste in the urban environment. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiversity loss has multiple causes, but habitat degradation through land-use change is the predominant driver. We investigated the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 network in preserving the main wetlands of the two largest islands of the Mediterranean region, whose conservation is critical for many avian species at European and global level, in a 23-year period (1990-2012). In Sardinia, the surroundings of 22 wetlands were affected by an increase in artificial areas (+64 ha/year) and decrease in agricultural (-54 ha/year) and natural (-17 ha/year) ones. In Sicily, the surroundings of 16 wetlands were impacted by an increase in agricultural areas (+50 ha/year) and decrease in natural and semi-natural ones (-62 ha/year). Results show that the Natura 2000 policies were effective in preserving wetlands (no shrinkages detected in both regions), but their surroundings experienced intense processes of degradation and artificialization in all the sub-periods considered (1990-2000, 2000-2006, 2006-2012), whose effects are now threatening waterbirds and wetland integrity. The enlargement of the existing Natura 2000 sites, the creation of new ones and the speedup of the application of the rules of the Habitats and Birds Directives seem necessary to counteract the rapid land-use changes around these important stopover sites.

AB  - Understanding the movement of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment is critical to managing their spread. To assess potential ARG transport through the air via urban bioaerosols in cities with poor sanitation, we quantified ARGs and a mobile integron (MI) in ambient air over periods spanning rainy and dry seasons in Kanpur, India (n = 53), where open wastewater canals (OWCs) are prevalent. Gene targets represented major antibiotic groups-tetracyclines (tetA), fluoroquinolines (qnrB), and beta-lactams (blaTEM)-and a class 1 mobile integron (intI1). Over half of air samples located near, and up to 1 km from OWCs with fecal contamination (n = 45) in Kanpur had detectable targets above the experimentally determined limits of detection (LOD): most commonly intI1 and tetA (56% and 51% of samples, respectively), followed by blaTEM (8.9%) and qnrB (0%). ARG and MI densities in these positive air samples ranged from 6.9 x 101 to 5.2 x 103 gene copies/m3 air. Most (7/8) control samples collected 1 km away from OWCs were negative for any targets. In comparing experimental samples with control samples, we found that intI1 and tetA densities in air are significantly higher (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01, respectively, alpha = 0.05) near laboratory-confirmed fecal contaminated waters than at the control site. These data suggest increased densities of ARGs and MIs in bioaerosols in urban environments with inadequate sanitation. In such settings, aerosols may play a role in the spread of AR.

AB  - Structures installed to modify hydrology in waterways such as culverts can cause fragmentation across intertidal and subtidal areas, leading to increased habitat patchiness of previous interconnected habitats. This study aimed to understand the potential impacts of a 268-m culvert on habitat parameters in a large tidal bay and a coastal lagoon in Southern California. We analyzed key habitat characteristics of both sites including water conditions and sediment characteristics as well as biotic communities including zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrate, and fish communities. As compared to the tidal bay, the lagoon had more extreme temperature differences, decreased dissolved oxygen and salinity, and lower zooplankton abundance. The composition of zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, and small fish communities also differed between the two habitats, suggesting higher habitat heterogeneity than might be expected given their proximity. Removing the culvert that connects these habitats and returning it to an earth-lined open channel would decrease fragmentation between the two habitats and improve trophic quality while retaining the estuarine characteristics of the overall system.

AB  - Groundwater variation can cause land-surface movement, which in turn can cause significant and recurrent harm to infrastructure and the water storage capacity of aquifers. The capital cities in the England (London) and India (Delhi) are witnessing an ever-increasing population that has resulted in excess pressure on groundwater resources. Thus, monitoring groundwater-induced land movement in both these cities is very important in terms of understanding the risk posed to assets. Here, Sentinel-1 C-band radar images and the persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) methodology are used to study land movement for London and National Capital Territory (NCT)-Delhi from October 2016 to December 2020. The land movement velocities were found to vary between -24 and +24 mm/year for London and between -18 and +30 mm/year for NCT-Delhi. This land movement was compared with observed groundwater levels, and spatio-temporal variation of groundwater and land movement was studied in conjunction. It was broadly observed that the extraction of a large quantity of groundwater leads to land subsidence, whereas groundwater recharge leads to uplift. A mathematical model was used to quantify land subsidence/uplift which occurred due to groundwater depletion/rebound. This is the first study that compares C-band PSInSAR-derived land subsidence response to observed groundwater change for London and NCT-Delhi during this time-period. The results of this study could be helpful to examine the potential implications of ground-level movement on the resource management, safety, and economics of both these cities.

AB  - Soil microorganisms play a key role in the function of soil ecosystem, yet our knowledge about how microbial communities respond to the typically sandy soil environmental properties along the soil profile is still insufficient. We investigated the soil microbial community patterns from top (0 - 20 cm) to clay-layer (>80 cm) of the typical sandy soils in three regions in China with different levels of precipitation, including Lishu County in Jilin Province (LS), Langfang City in Hebei Province (LF) and Zhengzhou City in Henan Province (ZZ). Our findings showed that small-size aggregates (<0.5 mm) rather than large ones (>= 0.5 mm) dominated the soil profile. The relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Crenarchaeota and Firmicutes were highly related to aggregate proportions of the deep clay-layer soil. The network analysis revealed the distinct community patterns among modules, evidencing niche differentiation along the soil profile. The keystone species OTU_11292 was observed having migrated clearly into the other module of the clay-layer soil. Different roles of the OTU_30 (belonging to Gemmatimonadetes) in soil processes might partly explain the different microbial distribution between top- and clay-layer soils. These findings provided new insights into the candidate mechanisms of microbial diversity maintenance and community patterning of sandy soils, which were necessary for better understanding of ecological rules guiding long-term agricultural practice.

AB  - Migratory birds are subject to many pressures during their life cycle and many are declining as a consequence. Evidence from North America shows that for species that migrate at night, bright artificial light sources associated with urban areas can disrupt natural movement patterns, leading to direct and indirect fitness consequences. Comparable evidence for species and urban areas in Europe is limited. This study aimed to measure the response of nocturnally migrating thrushes to artificial light at night in the UK. We used passive acoustic recorders deployed across a gradient of artificial lighting to record the flight calls of three thrush species, with an expectation of greater call rates over brightly lit areas. We trained a convolutional neural network automatically to locate and identify thrush calls in the audio recordings, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values in withheld validation data of 0.93-0.98, and recall on independent field data of 85-94%, depending on species. Seasonal patterns of call rates were positively correlated across sites but there were large differences in absolute rates between sites. Call rates were up to five times higher over the brightest urban areas compared with darker villages, suggesting a strong phototaxic effect of artificial light at night on migratory thrushes. These results confirm that monitoring of flight calls can provide valuable information on the timing of nocturnal migration, but that the effects of artificial lighting must be taken into account in any comparisons of abundance across sites. European cities are not blighted by mass mortality of migrants striking illuminated buildings; even so, these results show that nocturnal migrants are influenced by light pollution. Ascertaining whether this has fitness consequences is a priority so as to inform the design and illumination of future urban areas.

AB  - The health of urban rivers is threatened by multiple anthropogenic stressors. Bacterial communities in rivers can quickly respond to different types of polluted environments, making them useful for water quality assessments and predictive insights. However, research on river bacterial communities has largely ignored interactions between these communities. Here, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis is used to comprehensively analyze the bacterial communities in the water and sediments in different types of anthropogenically impacted urban river. The results show that distinct differences occur in the bacterial communities in the river sediment and water with different pollution types. The changes in the bacterial communities in sediments were more pronounced than those in the water. A modular analysis further showed that the microbial co-occurrence network under different types of pollution had a nonrandom modular structure, and this structure was mainly driven by classification correlation and bacterial function. Genes identified for nitrogen cycling in all the river water and sediment samples included major functional genes for nitrogen fixation, assimilatory nitrogen reduction, nitrification, denitrification, and ammonification. Carbon degradation genes were mainly observed in the carbon cycle. Taken together, the above findings provide further insights into microbial communities in urban river ecosystems under anthropogenic contamination. (c) 2021 Water Environment Federation

AB  - Dothistroma pini is one of two pathogens causing Dothistroma needle blight (DNB), a foliar disease of pines. The species was redefined in 2004 and subsequently recorded in several European countries. In Slovakia, the first report of the pathogen was in 2013. In this study, the population structure, genetic diversity, and reproductive mode of 105 isolates collected from 10 localities and seven hosts were determined in Slovakia. Species-specific mating type markers, ITS haplotype determination, and 16 microsatellite markers were used to characterize and genotype the isolates. Overall, 15 unique multilocus haplotypes (MLHs) based on microsatellite markers and three ITS haplotypes were identified. Three independent methods (DAPC, STRUCTURE, EDENetwork) separated the isolates into two distinct population clusters corresponding with ITS haplotypes. A high level of clonality was recorded suggesting that conidia are the primary source of pathogen dispersal. The low genetic diversity, predominantly asexual reproductive mode of the pathogen, and the fact that most isolates were collected from introduced tree species and native species in artificially planted urban greenery, supports the hypothesis that D. pini has been recently introduced into Slovakia.

AB  - Chile is a country that depends on the extraction and export of its natural resources. This phenomenon has exacerbated different processes of transformation and disturbance of natural and human ecosystems. Land use change has become a key factor for the transformation of ecosystems, causing consequences for biodiversity conservation. In this study, current and future (2030, 2050 and 2080) land use categories were evaluated. Land use projections were analysed together with models of ecosystem distribution in Chile under different climate scenarios, to finally analyse different dynamics of land use change within the protected areas system. In all the scenarios evaluated, land use projections showed an increase in the areas of industrial forest plantations and urban areas and a decrease in natural and agricultural areas could be expected. In relation to ecosystem modeling, vegetational formations located in the center and south of the country could be expected to decrease, while vegetational formations in the north and center of the country could extend their surface area. Inside Chile's protected area network, anthropic disturbances are currently undergoing expansion, which could have consequences for ecosystems and protected areas located in the central and central-south zones of Chile.

AB  - Despite the huge and growing environmental movement to protect urban forests in Indonesia, the tensions between environmental activists' past engagements with nature and the emerging environmental problems are under-studied. The inner contradiction between the intensive nature of the connections and experiences that the actor maintains and the recent external threat to the environment is the key energizer of an environmental movement. Through Pierre Bourdieu's seminal concept of hysteresis, this article explores how activists' previous experiences with nature suffer disjuncture caused by the threat of urban forest privatization occurring in their neighborhood. Drawn from in-depth interviews with the co-founders of an environmental movement organization, the activist narratives in this article reveal that the development of their current struggles was driven by feelings of disappointment, anxiety, anger and a fear of losing the urban forest. The urban forest, for them, not only constitutes a physical space, but serves social and spiritual purposes, represents local identity and is the basis for everyday life.

AB  - Despite the 'mobility turn' in urban studies, there is surprisingly little research into the role people's everyday movements play in driving urbanisation processes. As this paper discusses, one reason this has not occurred is because understanding this relationship requires both quantitative and qualitative knowledge, including geospatial locations and patterns as well as why people choose to move the way they do. Few studies employ mixed methods to this end; instead, many quantitative approaches focus on the use of big data and many qualitative approaches remain focused on sites themselves rather than the movements between them. This methodological gap can preclude operationalising findings and proves particularly detrimental when research is conducted into areas with high levels of poverty and inequality. In response, this paper presents a mixed-methods approach to studying urbanisation, using volunteered geographic information (VGI) to map regional-scale movements in the Gauteng City-Region (GCR). Exploiting the potential of smartphone technology, this methodology operates at the interstice of quantitative and qualitative research, describing both macro-scale mobility patterns and the micro-scale decisions behind them. Using the case study of the GCR, it highlights movement as a strategy for those living in poverty, who can utilise the entire region as a resource to subvert entrenched inequality. 'Thinking through people' suggests that a new ontology of categories describing urbanisation processes in terms of movement could connect empirical research into poverty and inequality to theory, and be used to create an epistemology of the urban from below. Thus, this paper contributes to advances in urban studies methods as well as to debates on urbanisation, relational poverty and socio-spatial inequality.

AB  - A Rapid Food Security Appraisal among 240 rural and urban dwellers in southern Benin was conducted, using univariate and bivariate analyses, to evaluate the effects of the imposed COVID-19 'cordon sanitaire' on food consumption patterns. As this is one of the first empirical studies on the COVID-19 food security nexus, we found that the raging pandemic has affected the food security pillars (availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability) in both rural and urban areas, within and outside the cordon sanitaire. The steepest decline was observed among respondents who live inside the cordon sanitaire, where rural producers and urban inhabitants without access to allotment gardens were hit hard. Increased food prices, disruptions in food logistics, and inability to work due to movement restrictions were most frequently indicated as reasons for the decline. Access to allotment gardens effectively supported households in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food crisis.

AB  - Studies of laboratory animals demonstrate extensive variation of host gut microbiomes and their functional capabilities across populations, but how does anthropogenic change impact the microbiomes of non-model species? The anthropogenic movement of species to novel environments can drastically alter animals' microbiomes; however, factors that shape invasive species gut microbiota during introduction remain relatively unexplored. Through 16S amplicon sequencing on guttural toad (Sclerophrys gutturalis) faecal samples, we determine that residence time does not impact microbiome variation between source and introduced populations. The youngest population (similar to 20 years in Cape Town) has the most distinct microbiome and associated functional capabilities, whereas longer residence times (similar to 100 years in Reunion and Mauritius) produce less divergent microbial compositional, phylogenetic, and predicted functional diversity and differential abundance from source populations (Durban). Additionally, we show extensive variation of microbial and functional diversity, as well as differential abundance patterns in an expanding introduced population (Cape Town) between core and periphery sites. Contrasting previous studies, we suggest that introduction pathways might be an important factor impacting host microbial divergence. These findings also imply that the microbiome can diverge in accordance with host population dynamics.

AB  - Increasing anthropogenic pressures have affected the status of surface freshwater ecosystems. Eutrophication, water browning, acidification, and several other processes may be channelled through the food web. In this study, we evaluate the role of hydrology impacting anthropogenic pressures, flows from urban, farmland and ditched forest areas, and how they explain the physico-chemical quality of lakes and ponds in the boreal biome of Finland. We study the long-term effect around 445 waterfowl survey sites that had physico-chemical measurements (total phosphorus, total nitrogen, pH, water clarity and colour) produced by Finnish environmental authorities done in years 1986-2020. Furthermore, we investigate whether a long-term national-level citizen science study focusing on rather robust visible habitat structures measured by the volunteers can reveal physicochemical water quality using data from >270 lakes where the waterfowl habitat survey and physico-chemical measurements could be spatio-temporally matched. Farmland occurrence around the lakes was positively associated with pH, colour and nutrient concentrations but negatively associated with water clarity. Furthermore, ditch length was positively associated with nitrogen concentration and water colour, while being negatively associated with pH and water clarity. Overall, the studied lakes showed a negative trend in nutrients and clarity but a positive trend in pH and colour. As expected, nutrient concentration increased and clarity decreased along the gradient from oligotrophic to eutrophic lake habitat classifications, which suggests that the citizen science classification seem to reflect the subsurface physico-chemical status of the lakes. We conclude that farming and forest ditching practices in particular seem to associate with the state of the study lakes and that the ecological impacts of intensified turbidity and brownification in wetland ecosystems should be studied further in the future. Sustainable improvement of water quality rests upon scientific understanding of biogeochemical processes in lake ecosystems and the primary sources of the nutrient and sediment loading.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers opportunities to collect data on the occurrence of vocal species for long periods of time, at multiple locations, and under a range of environmental conditions. Some species emit individually distinctive calls, including bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that produce signature whistles. Our study used PAM to determine the seasonal occurrence of bottlenose dolphins and utilized individually specific signature whistles to (1) track individuals spatially and temporally, (2) assess site fidelity off Maryland (MD), USA, (3) estimate the minimum abundance of dolphins in the study area, and (4) develop a dynamic habitat-based relative abundance model applicable as a real-time dolphin relative abundance prediction tool. Acoustic recorders were deployed at two sites offshore of Ocean City, MD, and at one site in the upper Chesapeake Bay, MD. Acoustic recordings from 2016 to 2018 were analyzed for signature whistles, and re-occurrences of individual whistles were identified using a combination of machine learning and manual verification. A habitat-based density model was created using the number of signature whistles combined with environmental conditions. A total of 1518 unique signature whistles were identified offshore of Maryland and in the upper Chesapeake Bay. There were 184 re-occurrences of 142 whistles, with a mean of 135 d between re-occurrences (range = 1-681 d). These repeated detections of the same individuals occurred most frequently at the site near Ocean City, MD, indicating the highest site fidelity. Re-occurrences were recorded among all three sites, indicating movement of dolphins between the Chesapeake Bay and off the Atlantic coast of Maryland. The weekly number of individual dolphins detected off the Atlantic coast was significantly related to two environmental variables: sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration. This habitat model could be used to predict relative dolphin abundance offshore of Maryland and inform management within the region, including in relation to offshore wind energy development and other stakeholders.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a common result of urbanization and species living in these fragments are at risk of extirpation. We conducted a 12-y (2008-2019) capture-mark-recapture study on snakes living in a 593-m section of Rock Castle Creek flowing through an urban area in central Virginia, USA. Our study site was occupied primarily by Queensnakes (Regina septemvittata). We used data from 168 individual Queensnakes to examine several aspects of their population ecology including survival rates (0.52), reproductive effort (21.3% juvenile to adult ratio), growth rates (68% and 30.6% increase for 1 to 2 y-old and 2 to 3+ y-old snakes, respectively), and sex ratio (1:1). Our population estimates, though with wide confidence intervals, showed that this population of approximately 25 adult snakes has persisted over time despite being in an urban environment. The life-history characteristics of this snake of limited movement, habitat specificity, diet specialization (eating only freshly molted crayfish, Cambarus spp.), and small body size likely reduced risks associated with nearby roads and parking lots. These same life-history characteristics, however, make Queensnakes vulnerable to extirpation should pollution cause declines in crayfish populations or otherwise make their habitat fragment inhospitable.

AB  - Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system, as part of the renewable energy development strategy to guarantee energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas, has received a lot of attention during the last decade. To provide an up-to-date and systematic research landscape of the rooftop PV field, this study conducted the bibliometric analysis, collaboration network analysis, co-citation analysis, and hotspots detection based on 595 articles collected from the core collection database of Web of Science. The results showed that the number of publications per year in this field has increased steadily since 2015. The USA was the most important contributor in this research field in terms of quantity (number of publications) and impact (number of citations). The co-authorship communities were obtained by collaboration network analysis, and the international collaboration is expected to be further strengthened according to the research focuses of each community. The key knowledge base and the main hot topics of the rooftop PV research field were identified from co-citation analysis and keywords co-occurrence network. Furthermore, based on the literature review, a detailed analysis of the main topics was provided for a better understanding of the current research trends and opportunities. This study can be served as a strategic review of the rooftop PV field to help relevant researchers carry out in-depth research in the future. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We bring a practical and comprehensive GIS-based framework to utilize freely available remotely sensed datasets to assess wildfire ignition probability and spreading capacities of vegetated landscapes. The study area consists of the country-level scale of the Romanian territory, characterized by a diversity of vegetated landscapes threatened by climate change. We utilize the Wildfire Ignition Probability/Wildfire Spreading Capacity Index (WIPI/WSCI). WIPI/WSCI models rely on a multi-criteria data mining procedure assessing the study area's social, environmental, geophysical, and fuel properties based on open access remotely sensed data. We utilized the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to weigh each indexing criterion's impact factor and assess the model's overall sensitivity. Introducing ROC analysis at an earlier stage of the workflow elevated the final Area Under the Curve (AUC) of WIPI from 0.705 to 0.778 and WSCI from 0.586 to 0.802. The modeling results enable discussion on the vulnerability of protected areas and the exposure of man-made structures to wildfire risk. Our study shows that within the wildland-urban interface of Bucharest's metropolitan area, there is a remarkable building stock of healthcare, residential and educational functions, which are significantly exposed and vulnerable to wildfire spreading risk.

AB  - The permanent exclusion of flying-foxes from camps (camp dispersal) near human settlements is a management tool commonly used to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. We summarised information on the costs and outcomes of 48 camp dispersals in Australia. Our aim was to improve the information base on which camp management decisions are made. Camp dispersals were largely triggered by impacts on neighbouring residents (75%). A disproportionately high number occurred in 2013-14, associated with changes in Queensland flying-fox management policy following an increase in the number of urban camps. Repeat actions over months or years were typically required to exclude flying-foxes from camps (58%). In 88% of cases, replacement camps formed within 1 km and became sites of transferred conflict. Only 23% of dispersal attempts were successful in resolving conflict for communities, generally after extensive destruction of roost habitat. Costs were poorly documented, although no dispersal attempt costing less than AU$250 000 proved successful. We conclude that camp dispersal is a high-risk, high-cost tool for mitigating human-wildlife conflict, in situ management strategies and tools should be developed, evidence-based information on management options should be made available to stakeholders via a nationally curated resource library, and research is required on impacts of camp management practices on flying-foxes.

AB  - Novel assemblages of biotic, abiotic, and social components resulting from human-induced actions (e.g., climate change, land-use change, species movement) have been labeled as "Novel Ecosystems", or "Novel Urban Ecosystems" when emerging in urban contexts. This concept has been shifting perspectives among some scientists and making them question traditional values about human-nature interactions in a rapidly changing era dominated by anthropogenic actions (Anthropocene). Controversial dimensions surrounding the Novel Ecosystems and Novel Urban Ecosystems terms may be preventing the evolution and further research of these concepts. The environmental problems that our society will soon face support a search for innovative solutions and transdisciplinary efforts. For that reason, this discussion should not cease, rather should expand to other fields of knowledge that can contribute with pertinent insights and collaborations. This way, this short communication aims to reflect on the opportunities from Landscape Architecture to the discussion, research, and application of the novel ecosystems concepts in the real world, particularly in the urban landscape, and also reflect on the opportunities of this debate to the Landscape Architecture field. Ultimately, Landscape Architecture can contribute with innovative and creative perspectives, acceding valuable and advanced tools, facilitating dialogues between fields of knowledge, and bridging gaps between science, people, and nature.

AB  - Presently, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is regarded as an emerging environmental issue, and many studies have illuminated biogeographical patterns of the antibiotic resistome. However, few studies have investigated elevational biogeography and associated assembly mechanisms of ARGs in natural river systems. Accordingly, in the present study, we used metagenomics approaches to analyze the biogeographical pattern of ARGs along the pristine Yarlung Tsangpo River on the Tibetan Plateau. Our study retrieved the baseline profiles of ARGs in the pristine river and showed that the ARGs were dominated by bacA, which was resistant to bacitracin and represented more than 91% of total ARGs. The diversity and abundance of ARGs in the pristine river were lower than those in the human-impacted area, suggesting that the antibiotic resistome evolved and was promoted in a human-impacted envi-ronment. Furthermore, an elevational distance-decay relationship of ARGs was observed along the pristine Yarlung Tsangpo River, which provided strong evidence of ARG dissimilarity under the eleva-tional variation. Elevational gradients could lead to changes in environmental variables and spatial factors, and consequently alter ARG composition. Elevational gradients could influence the assembly processes of ARGs. The deterministic and stochastic assembly processes both played critical roles and equally participated in shaping ARG composition at the watershed scale along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, and with increasing elevational variation along the river, the ecological processes of ARG assembly shifted from deterministic to stochastic. Moreover, abundant and rare ARGs were tentatively separated to investigate the difference and similarity in their distributions. Although abundant and rare ARGs pre-sented similar distance-decay relationships, rare ARGs were more diverse and vulnerable to the dispersal process and mutation. Overall, our study provides valuable ecological insights to profile the large-scale elevational patterns of ARGs in a pristine river system, thereby providing important information for public health and environmental management.

AB  - Although the health of rivers is threatened by multiple anthropogenic stressors with increasing frequency, the impacts of different types of industrial pollution with regard to the structure and diversity of the bacterial community in the river have not been fully recorded. In order to study the composition and interaction of bacterial communities and co-occurrence patterns of bacterial communities in rivers polluted by different industries, we sampled the sewage outfalls of textile factory, food manufacturer, steel plant and lighting factory. The result showed that the bacterial community composition significantly differed in the rivers polluted by distinct types of industrial pollution. In addition, correlation-based network analysis showed that the microbial under different industrial pollution types have a nonrandom modular structure, and the nodes in the different modules perform different functions. In summary, adaptive changes in the composition of bacterial communities in rivers and the occurrence of species interactions are responses to different types of industrial pollution.

AB  - The American Eel Anguilla rostrata is a catadromous fish found in rivers along the East Coast of North America. American Eel populations have declined throughout their range for several reasons, including habitat fragmentation caused by damming, which hinders access to much of their historic lotic habitats. This study examined differences in abundance and size structure across river segments divided by nine dams in the Bronx River, New York, a heavily urbanized system. American Eels were sampled via multipass electrofishing at nine sites over the course of 3 years. American Eels 250 mm TL or larger were implanted with passive integrated transponder tags to estimate survival and movements. Estimates of abundance were calculated for electrofishing data using the Huggins closed-capture model. Density was estimated based on area surveyed, abundance data, and estimated weights of American Eels. Eel mops were used to evaluate the presence and relative abundance of different life stages of American Eels (glass, elver, and small yellow phases). Our results showed decreased abundance in upstream areas, with a corresponding increase in average size. Density, by weight, was consistent among sites. Tagging data showed minimum apparent survival of up to 0.29 and only a single movement between dammed segments, demonstrating high site fidelity. Eel mop sampling revealed that although glass- and elver-stage American Eels were common downstream, relative abundance decreased rapidly above the first dam. These results suggest that the Bronx River American Eel population is structured by physical barriers to passage, density-dependent limitations, high stationariness, and high apparent survival.

AB  - In the Brazilian Pantanal, wildfire occurrence has increased, reaching record highs of over 40,000 km2 in 2020. Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.

AB  - The transmission of airborne antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) loaded on particle is a significant global public health concern. Up to date, the dispersal pattern of airborne ARGs remains unclear despite their critical role in multiregional transmission. In this study, airborne ARGs loaded on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and source tracking based on the airflow trajectories were performed by the potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) model. The results show that the absolute abundance of ARG subtypes were generally twice times higher in the winter season than that in the summer season, which could be attributable to winter haze events with high particulate matter concentrations in Handan. Exogenous input from serious haze events and local release of ARGs loaded on PM2.5 of air masses may cause higher levels of ARGs in the winter. Moreover, based on the positive correlation between the abundance of ARGs and PM2.5 concentration, a source tracing model of airborne ARGs was proposed to the estimate of ARGs release and dissemination. This study highlights airborne ARGs transmission loaded on PM2.5 of air masses, which facilitating the global spread of antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Landscape planning is difficult for designers to be influenced by bad culture. It is easy to ignore the cultural progress of the times and lose the sense of innovation. At the same time, in order to pursue the quick effect, the movement of "transplanting big trees", "lawn hot" and "urban beautification" prevails leads to the problems of regional ecological environment. Therefore, this paper puts forward a kind of urban landscape plant landscape art under the concept of ecological sustainable development based on the improving the plant growth environment, protecting, and transmitting the ecological environment and the participation of the public in the design. At the same time, the design follows the ecological design principles of locality, protection of diversity and natural, social, and sustainable plant landscapes. Finally, the "beauty, greening, and natural" artistry is incorporated into the design to complete the plan for the concept of sustainable development, reflecting the "coordinated" and "comprehensive" beauty of garden plant landscape art.

AB  - Pigeons and doves have highly adaptive nature; they not only thrive stably in urban habitats, contribute to a balanced ecosystem for human settling areas as well. They are valued for food, pollination, and trade though their habitat preference and distribution is different in Sindh province of Pakistan. Their current conservation status was also needed to be confirmed, therefore we aimed to record their diversity, ecological conditions as well as their conservation through surveys in different types of habitats from sun rise to sun set. The species of pigeons: Columba livia (rock pigeon), Columba livia domestica (domestic pigeon), and Columba leuconota (snow pigeon) were found from the study area along with doves including Streptopelia decaocto (Eurasian collared dove) and Streptopelia risoria (barbary dove). It was recorded that pigeon's most preferred habitat was urban areas followed by suburban areas, however dove population was denser in agricultural areas. Roosting and nesting sites were observed in wide variety of human habitations especially in brick or stone buildings. C. livia, was recorded as most abundant species of genus Columba, however C. leuconota, was observed very rare in study area roosting on cliffs. Population density of doves was recorded lower than that of the pigeons and they were often recorded in agricultural areas where their nests were sighted often on trees. Urban areas provide shelter to pigeons and doves where they maintain ecological conditions balanced by controlling pest insects. It was also determined that pigeons and doves are vulnerable due to hunting and illegal trade in the study area.

AB  - By 10 January 2017, activists in the predominately Latina/o working class city of La Puente, California had lobbied the council to declare the city a sanctuary supporting immigrants, people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. The same community members urged the school district to declare itself a sanctuary. While community members rejoiced in pushing elected officials to pass these inclusive resolutions, there were multiple roadblocks reducing the potential for more substantive change. Drawing on city council and school board meetings, resolutions and my own involvement in this sanctuary struggle, I focus on a continuum of three overlapping and interlocking manifestations of white supremacist heteronormative patriarchy: neoliberal diversity discourses, institutionalized policies, and a re-emergence of high-profiled white supremacist activities. Together, these dynamics minimized, contained and absorbed community activism and possibilities of change. They reinforced the status quo by maintaining limits on who belongs and sustaining intersecting hierarchies of race, immigration status, gender, and sexuality. This extended case adds to the scant scholarship on the current sanctuary struggles, including among immigration scholars. It also illustrates how the state co-opts and marginalizes movement language, ideas, and people, providing a cautionary tale about the forces that restrict more transformative change.

AB  - Surface ozone (O-3) is a harmful air pollutant that is created through complex atmospheric photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and various precursors. Its abundance depends on the associated chemical pathways, local environmental conditions, and meteorological factors, the latter of which affects the dispersal of O-3. This research investigates vertical and horizontal variations in NO2 and O-3 in urban and rural areas associated with atmospheric parameters at 13 monitoring locations stretching from greater Bangkok to Ratchaburi Province, Thailand. O-3 and NO2 were measured concurrently with temperature and relative humidity using calibrated portable devices (Aeroqual, Series 500), typically at heights of 1.5, 75, and 110 m. The instruments were mounted on a drone to obtain measurements at elevations of 75 m and 110 m. The data obtained showed that even in the lowest part of the boundary layer, the average concentrations of O-3 in the urban area increased by nearly 21% with altitude from the ground (26.8 +/- 4.7 ppb at 1.5 m) to 110 m. However, in the rural area, the average ground concentrations of O-3 were higher (38.6 +/- 11.8 ppb) but they decreased by approximately 43% at 110 m. Notably, at all monitoring sites, NO2 concentrations exhibited a decreasing trend with height above the ground. As the wind conditions were stagnant, the ground measurements at each station were representative of local conditions. However, modelling of air mass backward trajectories indicated that despite the stagnant conditions at the ground level, there were contributions from long-range transport (even within the shallow atmospheric layers) at elevations as low as 110 m above the ground.

AB  - Invasive alien plants are considered a major driver of global biodiversity loss. Therefore, there is a huge demand of spatial and temporal data on their distribution for investigating possible drivers of species invasions and for predictions of future distributions. We use Google Street View imagery (GSV) as a new source of spatial and temporal data. GSV provides millions of panoramic views along road networks worldwide allowing for the identification of many plant species, including invasive ones. Thus, GSV has a great potential to support ecological research in documenting species distribution, but reliable validation of its precision and accuracy is lacking. Here, we describe and evaluate an approach using GSV to visually track the spread of invasive alien plants, the North American goldenrods (Solidago canadensis and S. gigantea) occurring abundantly along road network in Poland (Central Europe). We determined presence/absence of the species along 160 randomly selected transects of a length of 500 m by visual inspection of GSV images and compared it with field surveys at the same transects. We show that the occurrence of goldenrods in GSV is a reliable predictor of their occurrence in the wild. Sampling parameters, like road width, season when GSV pictures were taken and number of months elapsed since taking the GSV pictures, did not change the correlation between outputs of the two methods (GSV and field sampling). Furthermore, both the occurrence of goldenrods observed in the field and their occurrence in GSV have similar relations to habitat characteristics investigated (the same direction of relationship and similar effect size). We suggest Google Street View images may be an additional tool to be used in the detection and tracking of the spread of invasive alien plants along roadsides. The approach may be useful in assessing temporal changes in roadside vegetation and managing problematic plant species across large spatial scales and may contribute to the further development of more efficient sampling methods in ecological studies.

AB  - A technological system capable of automatically producing damage scenarios at an urban scale, as soon as an earthquake occurs, can help the decision-makers in planning the first post-disaster response, i.e., to prioritize the field activities for checking damage, making a building safe, and supporting rescue and recovery. This system can be even more useful when it works on densely populated areas, as well as on historic urban centers. In the paper, we propose a processing chain on a GIS platform to generate post-earthquake damage scenarios, which are based: (1) on the near real-time processing of the ground motion, that is recorded in different sites by MEMS accelerometric sensor network in order to take into account the local effects, and (2) the current structural characteristics of the built heritage, that can be managed through an information system from the local public administration authority. In the framework of the EU-funded H2020-ARCH project, the components of the system have been developed for the historic area of Camerino (Italy). Currently, some experimental fragility curves in the scientific literature, which are based on the damage observations after Italian earthquakes, are implemented in the platform. These curves allow relating the acceleration peaks obtained by the recordings of the ground motion with the probability to reach a certain damage level, depending on the structural typology. An operational test of the system was performed with reference to an ML3.3 earthquake that occurred 13 km south of Camerino. Acceleration peaks between 1.3 and 4.5 cm/s(2) were recorded by the network, and probabilities lower than 35% for negligible damage (and then about 10% for moderate damage) were calculated for the historical buildings given this low-energy earthquake.

AB  - Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse), the Australian backyard mosquito, is a pestiferous daytime-biting species native to Australia and the surrounding southwestern Pacific region. It is suspected to play a role in the transmission of several arboviruses and is considered a competent vector of dog heartworm, Dirofilaria immitis (Leidy).This highly adaptable mosquito thrives in natural and artificial water-holding containers in both forested and urbanized areas, from tropical to temperate climates, and has benefitted from a close association with humans, increasing in abundance within its native range. It invaded and successfully established in New Zealand as well as in previously unoccupied temperate and arid regions of Australia. Ae. notoscriptus was discovered in Los Angeles County, CA, in 2014, marking the first time this species had been found outside the southwestern Pacific region. By the end of 2019, immature and adult mosquitoes had been collected from 364 unique locations within 44 cities spanning three southern California counties. The discovery, establishment, and rapid spread of this species in urban areas may signal the global movement and advent of a new invasive container-inhabiting species. The biting nuisance, public health, and veterinary health implications associated with the invasion of southern California by this mosquito are discussed.

AB  - Natural landscapes have changed significantly through anthropogenic activities, particularly in areas that are severely impacted by climate change and population expansion, such as countries in Southeast Asia. It is essential for sustainable development, particularly efficient water management practices, to know about the impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing were used for monitoring land use changes, whereas artificial neural network cellular automata (ANN-CA) modeling using quantum geographic information systems (QGIS) was performed for prediction of LULC changes. This study investigated the changes in LULC in the Perak River basin for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020. The study also provides predictions of future changes for the years 2030, 2040, and 2050. Landsat satellite images were utilized to monitor the land use changes. For the classification of Landsat images, maximum-likelihood supervised classification was implemented. The broad classification defines four main classes in the study area, including (i) waterbodies, (ii) agricultural lands, (iii) barren and urban lands, and (iv) dense forests. The outcomes revealed a considerable reduction in dense forests from the year 2000 to 2020, whereas a substantial increase in barren lands (up to 547.39 km(2)) had occurred by the year 2020, while urban land use has seen a rapid rise. The kappa coefficient was used to assess the validity of classified images, with an overall kappa coefficient of 0.86, 0.88, and 0.91 for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively. In addition, ANN-CA simulation results predicted that barren and urban lands will expand in the future at the expense of other classes in the years 2030, 2040, and 2050. However, a considerable decrease will occur in the area of dense forests in the simulated years. The study successfully presents LULC changes and future predictions highlighting significant pattern of land use change in the Perak River basin. This information could be helpful for land use administration and future planning in the region.

AB  - The intensive shift on land cover by anthropogenic activities have led to changes in natural habitats and environmental contamination, which can ultimately impact and threat biodiversity and ecosystem services, such as pollination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of native forest and human-modified land covers on the concentrations of chemical elements accumulated in the neotropical pollinator bee T. angustula. Eight landscapes, within an Ecological Corridor in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, with gradients of forest cover, spatial heterogeneity and varying land covers were used as sampling unities. Bees collected in traps or through actives searches had the concentration of 21 chemical elements determined by ICP-MS. Results show a beneficial effect of forested areas on the concentrations of some well-known toxic elements accumulated in bees, such as Hg, Cd, and Cr. Multivariate Redundancy Analysis (RDA) suggests road as the most important driver for the levels of Cr, Hg, Sb, Al, U, As, Pb and Pt and bare soil, pasture and urban areas as the landscape covers responsible for the concentrations of Zn, Cd, Mn, Mg, Ba and Sr in bees. The results reinforce the potential use of T. angustula bees as bioindicators of environmental quality and also show that these organisms are being directly affected by human land use, offering potential risks for the Neotropical ecosystem. Our study sheds light on how land covers (native forest and human-modified) can influence the levels of contaminants in insects within human-dominated landscapes. The generation of predictions of the levels of toxic metals and metalloids based on land use can both contribute to friendly farming planning as well as to support public policy development on the surrounding of protected areas and biodiversity conservation hotspots.

AB  - Drawing on ethnographic data collected in three informal communities, one in Argentina, one in Mexico, and one in Ecuador, we address the long-standing question posed by Larissa Lomnitz's and Carol Stack's now-classic studies of how impoverished people not only survive but what strategies they adopt in an attempt to build a dignified life. By focusing on the diversity of strategies by which the urban poor solve the everyday problems of individual and collective reproduction, we move beyond the macro-level analysis of structural constraint and material deprivation. Our findings show a remarkable continuity in the difficulties residents of these informal communities confronted and the problem-solving strategies they resorted to. We found that networks of kin and friends continue to play a crucial role in how poor people not only survive but attempt to get ahead. Additionally, we highlight the role of patronage networks and collective action as central to strategies by which the urban poor cope with scarcity and improve their life chances, while also paying close attention to ways in which they deal with pressing issues of insecurity and violence. The paper shows that poor people's survival strategies are deeply imbricated in routine political processes.

AB  - Stasis has reemerged in recent accounts of resistance. In this paper that draws from ethnographic research with a youth antiauthoritarian community in Cyprus and their long-term occupation of a city square, I provide a broader theorization of this multi-semantic concept that has hitherto been missing from accounts on stasis commonly found in literature on the squares movement(s). I argue that stasis constitutes a key form of resistance to modern forms of power by pausing the circulation of capitalism and scheduled time and subverting the production of subjectivities that support such circulation. By drawing on Nicole Loraux's interpretation of stasis as "movement at rest," I overturn the negative connotations often associated with stasis as (unwanted) immobility by showing how stasis can be a desired political action that includes forms of mobility and circulation within it. Developing this theorization further, I analyze stasis as a threshold to critical political subjectivization, as productive of ipostasis (existence) that enables the subjects under stasis to appear in political terms and exercise their right to politics. I thus contribute to recent literature on the political potential and existential necessity of occupying practices that allow for a politicizing of the urban everyday.

AB  - Understanding the home range of animal species can be helpful to biodiversity and habitat conservation. Saunders's Gull (Lams saundersi), one of the vulnerable birds in the world, has become an important indicator species to measure the quality of ecological environment in the coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta. Information about habitat selection of the species has so far been mainly from field survey. In view of the successful application of satellite tracking in animal ecology, two individual birds were tagged for home range identification and habitat disturbance analysis. The gull's home range was confirmed using the Brownian bridge movement model. Habitat disturbances information from anthropogenic activities was analyzed by kernel density estimation as well as buffer zone analysis. Considering the gregariousness of the shorebird, the tracking sample data, though limited, can reflect the species' habitat selection to a certain extent. The results showed that (1) the Saunders's Gull's main home range was located in the northern and eastern coastal areas of Dongying city, the seashore area at the border of Binzhou with Dongying and Cangzhou city, and the Nanpu wetland of Tangshan city; and (2) human activity had a substantial effect on the home range selection, for example, mariculture was an important part of its home range, the Saunders's Gull exhibited an approach-avoidance behavior to wind turbines and oil wells, and activity time varied with different distances to the road. The study provides insights into the behavior of the shorebird and is of great significance to sustainable development of the human-environment relationship in the Yellow River Delta.

AB  - In Australia, bushfires are a natural part of the country's landscape and essential for the regeneration of plant species; however, the 2019-20 bushfires were unprecedented in their extent and intensity. This paper is focused on the 2019-20 Australian bushfires and the resulting surface and column atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) anomalies around Wollongong. Column CO data from the ground-based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) site in Wollongong are used together with surface in situ measurements. A systematic comparison was performed between the surface in situ and column measurements of CO to better understand whether column measurements can be used as an estimate of the surface concentrations. If so, satellite column measurements of CO could be used to estimate the exposure of humans to CO and other fire-related pollutants. We find that the enhancements in the column measurements are not always significantly evident in the corresponding surface measurements. Topographical features play a key role in determining the surface exposures from column abundance especially in a coastal city like Wollongong. The topography at Wollongong, combined with meteorological effects, potentially exacerbates differences in the column and surface. Hence, satellite column amounts are unlikely to provide an accurate reflection of exposure at the ground during major events like the 2019-2020 bushfires.

AB  - Urbanization and seasonality strongly influence the bacterial composition of the soil. However, aquatic environments such as rivers are understudied owing to their high dynamics and therefore rules relating to more static habitats such as lentic or terrestrial environments may be limited. Here, we compared the spatiotemporal patterns of bacterioplankton communities in the Zhangxi river along a gradient of urbanization using 16S ribosomal DNA identification. The alpha and beta diversity of bacterioplankton showed no significant response to watershed urbanization. A significant difference in predicted functional profiles of the bacterioplankton community was also revealed between the wet and dry seasons. The bacterioplankton community assembly was driven by both deterministic and stochastic processes. Stochasticity was one of the most vital processes affecting the bacterioplankton communities in both wet and dry seasons, explaining over 50% variation in the community by the null model analysis. Bacterioplankton co-occurrence patterns in the river changed with the seasons. More notably, the composition of bacterioplankton communities was inconsistent with alternations of the spatial distance offering meaningful implications for interactions between zero-radius operational taxonomic units and the dynamics of the bacterioplankton communities in surface water. In summary, we found clear patterns of seasonal variations in the bacterioplankton community structures.</p>

AB  - Once in aquatic ecosystems, plastics can be easily colonized by diverse microbes, and these microbial communities on plastics?the ?plastisphere??often differ from the communities in the surrounding water and other substrates. However, our knowledge of plastic-associated bacterial and fungal communities on diverse plastics in freshwater is poor, especially for fungal communities. Furthermore, intraspecies interactions among bacterial and fungal communities colonized on diverse plastics are poorly known. Here, we characterized the taxonomic composition and diversity of bacteria and fungi on three types of plastics in a lab-scale incubator with freshwater from an urban river. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the alpha diversity of bacterial communities was higher on polyethylene microplastics (MPs) than on polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) sheets. The structure of bacterial communities on MPs differed from those on plastic sheets. In contrast, no striking differences in alpha diversity and taxonomic composition were observed for fungal communities on different types of plastics. Members of Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Blastocladiomycota and Mucoromycota dominated fungal assemblages on plastics. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the biotic interactions between bacteria and fungi on MPs were less complex than those on PE and PP sheets. The three types of plastics shared no keystone taxa. The functional profiles (KEGG) predicted by Tax4Fun showed that the pathways of alanine, aspartate, glutamate and biotin metabolism were enriched in biofilms on MPs. Nonetheless, the higher complexity of plastic sheet-associated biofilms might make them more resistant to environmental perturbation and facilitate the maintenance of microbial activities.

AB  - Vegetated walls are an important habitat for urban biodiversity. We conducted an analysis of the plant species that grow on the Elbasan, Albania fortress walls. Walls vary in age from 4th to 21st century, and in composition. On 71 walls we assessed 2787 plants of 35 species and recorded plant size, presence of flowers or fruits, height from the ground, crevice depth, wall aspect, wall age and composition, and distance to nearest opposing wall. Eleven species, two of which were ferns, composed 93.8% of the plants. The vast majority of plants flowered and fruited on the walls. Plant density ranged from 0.1-70 plants/m(2). Species distributions varied significantly based on height on the wall, crevice depth, aspect and distance to the opposing wall. These differences may be influenced by dispersal mechanisms, moisture, substrate composition, and other important environmental factors. For example, Antirrhinum majus was generally found high on south facing walls in deep cracks whereas Umbilicus rupestris was found lower on north facing walls in shallower cracks. It is important that older walls colonized by plants be maintained such that a native flora can persist where natural rocky features are lacking.

AB  - Nestedness is an important pattern frequently reported for species assemblages on islands or fragmented systems. However, to date, there are few studies that comprehensively investigated faunal nestedness and underlying processes in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we examined the nestedness of bird assemblages and its underlying causal mechanisms in 37 urban parks in Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds from April 2019 to January 2020. We used the Weighted Nestedness metric based on Overlap and Decreasing Fill (WNODF) to estimate the nestedness of bird assemblages. We applied spearman partial correlation test to examine the relationships between nestedness ranks of sites and park characteristics (area, isolation, anthropogenic noise, number of habitat types, and building index), as well as between nestedness ranks of species and their ecological traits (body size, geographic range size, clutch size, minimum area requirement, dispersal ratio, and habitat specificity). We found that bird assemblages in urban parks were significantly nested. Park area, habitat diversity, building index, habitat specificity, and minimum area requirement of birds were significantly correlated with nestedness. Therefore, the nestedness of bird assemblages was caused by selective extinction, habitat nestedness, and urbanization. However, the nestedness of bird assemblages did not result from passive sampling, selective colonization, or human disturbance. Overall, to maximize the number of species preserved in our system, conservation priority should be given to parks with large area, rich habitat diversity, and less building index. From a species perspective, we should focus on species with large area requirement and high habitat specificity for their effective conservation.

AB  - Registering association between urban features and occurrence of herpetofauna provides useful information to urban planners and wildlife managers. We conducted the present study to see if likelihood of occurrence of various herpetofauna species is explained by land use categories, such as forest, open area, croplands, urban areas or wetlands. We aimed to document changes in the urban extent (from 2006 to 2016) and evaluate perception about herpetofauna in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. We recorded ten species of amphibians and 25 of reptiles including Narrow-headed Soft-shell Turtle (Chitra indica) and Soft-shell Turtle (Nilssonia gangetica), listed as Endangered and Vulnerable in the IUCN list of threatened species, respectively. The binary logistic regression was statistically significant and explained likelihood of occurrence of Murree Hills Frog, Hazara Torrent Frog, Fat-tail Gecko, Striped Grass Skink and Russell's Viper in natural areas such as forest and open land while Brown River Turtle, House Gecko, Black Cobra and Saw-scale Viper in urban features such as roadside, residential areas, urban streams and croplands. The satellite images showed considerable increase in built up and urban areas in Rawalpindi, Gujar Khan, and Islamabad Capital Territory. The univari ate generalized linear model revealed that the change in area of all the other studied land use categories was also significant. Of 251 respondents interviewed from the study area, 76% were interested in the study of birds, 20% in mammals and only 1% in amphibians and reptiles. Interestingly, 58% of the respondents were unaware of significance of herpetofauna such as their role as bio-indicator and role in food chain which might have caused this bias in their perception. The awareness level differed significantly between male and female respondents. The survey data suggested that social media is the best platform to create awareness about amphibians and reptiles.

AB  - With increasingly diversified and personalized lifestyles, visitors' recreation behaviors within urban parks have become more and more active and changeable; meeting this novel change in demand has become a new challenge for effective park design and management. In fact, it has become an urgent task to understand more precisely how visitors flow through parks and in what patterns. This paper used Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking data to quantitatively identify the actual spatial movement and time cost of visitors to Jiefang Park, Wuhan, China. The results show that most recreational flows through the park relied on its major roads. These flows generally follow the distance decay law from the park entrance before reaching the midpoint of the recreation process, and recreational stoppages of these flows also occurred mainly in the first half of the trip, exhibiting three different characteristics. Based on the empirical evidence, this paper summarizes three generalized patterns of recreational flows in order to depict the general recreation behaviors of urban park visitors. These findings could help predict the spatial movement and time budget of park visitors and thus provide support for future park design and management.

TI  - A Double-Edged Pluralism: Paradoxes of Diversity in the International Institute Movement, 1945-1965
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA  - English
KW  - IMMIGRATION
AB  - As a study in US pluralism, this article examines the International Institute movement-an urban network of liberal pluralist social welfare and intercultural agencies-in the early post-1945 era. It argues that the institutes were practitioners of a double-edged, or paradoxical, pluralism, in which progressive and conservative elements coexisted in tension with each other. An assessment of Institute records from the national headquarters and several local affiliates dealing with group and cultural programs and casework methods considers the possibilities, limits, tensions, and ironic implications of institute theories and practices. The analysis highlights the challenge of attaining that ever-elusive "balance" between promoting cultural diversity (and integration) and ensuring a degree of assimilation. It sheds light on a major irony-namely, that the application of modestly relativist cultural insights often generated hypotheses of im/migrant pathology. And, in regard to processes of racialization, it illuminates a paradox: that race could inflect institute "cultural" theory and practice with respect to both ethnic and racialized im/migrants and minoritized Americans. Finally, the authors suggest their framework might be of wider applicability and that critical historical thinking about contemporary multiculturalism and its long roots is both timely and important.

AB  - Landscape features, such as rivers, can act as geographical barriers to dispersal and gene flow and thus influence the population structure of some species. In this study, tissue samples were collected from 73 Hume's Pheasant Syrmaticus humiae, from six localities in Guangxi and Guizhou provinces, China, to examine the influence of rivers in landscape structure on genetic diversity and structure based on 12 microsatellite loci. Results indicated a high genetic diversity in Hume's Pheasant. Individuals from populations in Tianlin, Longlin and Xilin counties (TXL) (three geographically proximate populations) tended to form a genetic cluster, distinct from three other geographically proximate populations 100 km to the west in Pojie town (PJ), Luodian county (LD) and Leye county (LX), which showed more mixing and were less genetically distinct. Using simulated Markov-switching VAR (MSVAR), we found that the median population sizes of the posterior distributions were approximately 3,715 individuals for N-0, and approximately 100,000 for N1, indicating that Hume's Pheasant experienced a significant genetic bottleneck 4,800 years ago, possibly due to human activity. Hume's Pheasant shows female-biased dispersal. The results of STRUCTURE and GENELAND indicate that Nanpan River, Hongshui River and national road G324 act as potential genetic barriers for Hume's Pheasant in Guangxi and Guizhou provinces. In addition, genetic distinctiveness has persisted despite population declines of the Hume's Pheasant due to the bottleneck approximately 5,000 years ago and population declines in the last 100 years.

AB  - In most species, several factors like time of emergence, age at maturation, reproductive life span, survival of males and females, mating behavior, differential resource use, and migration patterns may affect the adult sex ratio. Anthropogenic landscape transformation is known to change diversity, favoring colonization by exotic species but other populational parameters, such as the sex ratio, have not been assessed. The aim of the present study was to describe the sex-ratio patterns of adult necrophagous blow flies captured using carrion-baited traps along habitats representing different levels of human impact. We describe the sex bias for four species: the exotic Chrysomya albiceps, Chrysomya megacephala, Chrysomya putoria, and the native Cochliomyia macellaria. Three types of habitats were selected: highly anthropized (urbanized), moderately anthropized (rural), and native forest (natural) within a humid subtropical ecoregion in Northeastern Argentina. We found an overall trend to female bias among the four species when considering the total number of each sex. However, our study showed a changing sex-ratio pattern along the gradient of human influence. Our results indicate that a higher likelihood of trapping more males in unsuitable habitats seems to be widespread among blow flies. Urban exploiters, such as Ch. megacephala and Ch. putoria, locally shifted their trends, becoming male-biased in natural habitats. The opposite trend was detected in the urban avoider Co. macellaria (which shifted to male-biased in urban habitats). The exception was Ch. albiceps, whose sex proportion did not shift to a male-biased sex ratio. The results of this study highlight the changing sex-ratio patterns displayed by Calliphoridae in response to different conditions along a human-influence gradient. The biological traits and underlying mechanisms promoting the intraspecific changes of the sex ratio are discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary Bioindicators are organisms that react to the quality or characteristics of the environment and their changes. They are vitally important to track environmental alterations and take action to mitigate them. As choosing the right bioindicators has important policy implications, it is crucial to select them to tackle clear goals rather than selling specific organisms as bioindicators for other reasons, such as for improving their public profile and encourage species conservation. Bats are a species-rich mammal group that provide key services such as pest suppression, pollination of plants of economic importance or seed dispersal. Bats show clear reactions to environmental alterations and as such have been proposed as potentially useful bioindicators. Based on the relatively limited number of studies available, bats are likely excellent indicators in habitats such as rivers, forests, and urban sites. However, more testing across broad geographic areas is needed, and establishing research networks is fundamental to reach this goal. Some limitations to using bats as bioindicators exist, such as difficulties in separating cryptic species and identifying bats in flight from their calls. It is often also problematic to establish the environmental factors that influence the distribution and behaviour of bats. Bats show responses to anthropogenic stressors linked to changes in other ecosystem components such as insects, and as K-selected mammals, exhibit fast population declines. This speciose, widespread mammal group shows an impressive trophic diversity and provides key ecosystem services. For these and other reasons, bats might act as suitable bioindicators in many environmental contexts. However, few studies have explicitly tested this potential, and in some cases, stating that bats are useful bioindicators more closely resembles a slogan to support conservation than a well-grounded piece of scientific evidence. Here, we review the available information and highlight the limitations that arise in using bats as bioindicators. Based on the limited number of studies available, the use of bats as bioindicators is highly promising and warrants further investigation in specific contexts such as river quality, urbanisation, farming practices, forestry, bioaccumulation, and climate change. Whether bats may also serve as surrogate taxa remains a controversial yet highly interesting matter. Some limitations to using bats as bioindicators include taxonomical issues, sampling problems, difficulties in associating responses with specific stressors, and geographically biased or delayed responses. Overall, we urge the scientific community to test bat responses to specific stressors in selected ecosystem types and develop research networks to explore the geographic consistency of such responses. The high cost of sampling equipment (ultrasound detectors) is being greatly reduced by technological advances, and the legal obligation to monitor bat populations already existing in many countries such as those in the EU offers an important opportunity to accomplish two objectives (conservation and bioindication) with one action.

AB  - Through empirical and qualitative research, I explore how the occupation of the old hospital of Woodstock (Cape Town) by evicted residents transforms their experiences and practices within the neighbourhood. I hereby answer the following questions: in what sense does this occupation represent a space of resilience at the center of a gentrified neighbourhood? What are the strategies deployed by the inhabitants to live there as serenely as possible, preserving their personal routine while responding at the same time to the demands of the social movement that hosts them? I observe that the occupation fosters the reshaping of local solidarities and allows the inhabitants to revisit their social role. However, I also emphasize the ambivalence of this lodging place by highlighting that the constraints and social norms imposed on the inhabitants can be considered as an additional form of confinement in the urban space.

AB  - Seed removal can result in either seed predation or dispersal and is therefore an indicator of important ecosystem functions. To better understand how these variable processes are affected by environmental changes, rapid and reliable assessments with high temporal and spatial replication are needed. We address this need by testing the application of a rapid ecosystem function assessment (REFA) method to investigate seed removal in habitats with differing land use intensity. We recorded seed removal hourly over eight hours at 301 sites in five habitat types in three urban regions in Germany. We calculated seed removal rates per sampling period, traditionally used in seed removal studies, as well as instantaneous seed removal probabilities based on hourly sampling. Across regions, seed removal probabilities and rates were lowest in arable fields, a habitat type with high land-use intensity. Except in urban sealed areas, temperature had a negative effect on seed removal. Additional Cox hazard regressions suggest invertebrates as the main seed removing animals in arable fields, whereas vertebrates were likely removers in other habitat types. We confirm that seed removal is strongly negatively affected by human disturbance, indicating that the tested method is appropriate in different settings. We were able to recognize patterns in highly variable data and the method also has the advantages of low cost, high replication and high temporal resolution. However, there is a trade-off between the high temporal-resolution of instantaneous seed removal probabilities and the sampling effort, but adjustments in the standardized setup can be made depending on the study. To further utilize the extensive data collection in the REFA method, we propose to combine instantaneous seed removal probabilities, seed removal rates and Cox hazard regressions of seed removal to provide complementary information on the extent and temporal patterns of seed removal and indications about potential seed removing guilds.

AB  - Holistic movement practices (HMPs) are an emerging category of physical activity, contributing to the diversification of physical activity opportunities. Purposefully incorporating not only physical but also mental, social, and/or spiritual elements, HMPs have received limited research attention with respect to participation parameters. The purpose of this study was to begin to map HMPs' participation potential by exploring the provision features of HMPs in Melbourne. Data were collected via internet searches, with a focus on events offered. Event features, including type, cost, duration, venue address, and target groups, were recorded. Associated neighbourhood characteristics were also explored by linking venue locations to selected census information. Provision was documented for Yoga and Pilates in central Melbourne (1011 events), for Tai Chi and Qigong (323 events), and for a range of smaller HMPs (149 events) across Greater Melbourne. Results indicated a wide range in provision features. Affinities with the holistic nature of HMPs were noticeable in venue choices and neighbourhood socio-demographics. Mention of specific target groups was infrequent. Results are discussed in light of implications for uptake. HMPs exemplify the increasing diversity of physical activity opportunities in modern-day societies. Further research to elucidate their place in the landscape of physical activities is warranted.

AB  - Wildfire is an annual threat for many rural communities in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. In some severe events, evacuation is one potential course of action to gain safety from an advancing wildfire. Since most evacuations occur in a personal vehicle along the surrounding road network, the quality of this network is a critical component of a community's vulnerability to wildfire. In this paper, we leverage a high-resolution spatial dataset of wildfire burn probability and mean fireline intensity to conduct a regional-scale screening of wildfire evacuation vulnerability for 696 Oregon and Washington rural towns. We characterize each town's surrounding road network to construct four simple road metrics related to the potential to quickly and safely evacuate: (1) the number of paved lanes leaving town that intersect a fixed-distance circular buffer; (2) the variety of lane directions available for egress; (3) the travel area that can be reached within a minimum distance while constrained only to movement along the paved road network; and (4) the sum of connected lanes at each intersection for the road network within a fixed-distance circular buffer. We then combine the road metrics with two metrics characterizing fire hazard of the surrounding landscape through which evacuation will occur: (1) burn probability and (2) mean fireline intensity. By combining the road and fire metrics, we create a composite score for ranking all towns by their overall evacuation vulnerability. The most vulnerable towns are those where poor road networks overlap with high fire hazard. Often, these towns are located in remote, forested, mountainous terrain, where topographic relief constrains the available road network and high fuel loads increase wildfire hazard. An interactive map of all road quality and fire hazard metrics is available at .

AB  - This paper develops Brazilian geographer Bernardo Mancano Fernandes' notion of "socio-territorial movements" as an analytical category for social movements that have as their central objective the appropriation of space in pursuit of their political project. It does so by contrasting the concept of socio-territorial movement to those of social movement and sociospatial movement, and proposing four axes of analysis for socio-territorial movements: strategy, identity, political sociability and institutions. These axes are considered across three case studies: the MST in Brazil; an urban social movement from North-West Argentina called the "Tupac Amaru Neighborhood Organization"; and the 2011 "Occupy" movement in London. In conclusion, we discuss some key differences between the movements studied, and consider the limits to a socio-territorial analysis.

AB  - Aedes aegypti is adapted to live in close association with human dwellings, where it lays eggs in several man-made container types with a broad range of size, shape, and material. Biotic and abiotic conditions of larval habitats determine the abundance and body size of emerging adult mosquitoes. Here, we estimated the predictive potential of physicochemical water variables for Culicidae immature abundance and Ae. aegypti adult body size in four neighborhoods with distinct urban landscapes in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Domestic water holding containers (N = 240) were inspected for the presence of Culicidae immatures and had several physiochemical parameters measured. Larvae and pupae were counted, and pupae were reared to the adult stage for taxonomic identification. Dry weight and wing size were measured for Ae. aegypti adult mosquitoes (N = 981). The association between larval habitat parameters with Culicidae abundance and Ae. aegypti body size data was estimated through linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models, respectively, with the neighborhood as random effect. The abundance of immature Culicidae in larval habitats (from which >90% of adults emerging from field collected pupae were Ae. aegypti) was positively associated with container volume and the dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC). Female average dry weight and male and female wing lengths were positively associated with larval habitat temperature whereas male average dry weight was positively related to water conductivity. Aedes aegypti originating from larval habitats with Ae. albopictus exhibited no differences in median wing length and dry body weight when compared with specimens collected in containers exclusively colonized by Ae. aegypti. These results demonstrate that container water volume (characteristic easily observed in the field) and DOC (often higher in unmanaged water holding recipients) is related to higher Ae. aegypti immature density. Estimating the effects of physicochemical water variables on immature abundance and adult body size can provide valuable information for predicting arbovirus transmission risk in endemic settings.

AB  - Human milk is the ideal food for infants due to its unique nutritional and immune properties, and more recently human milk has also been recognized as an important source of bacteria for infants. However, a substantial amount of fundamental human milk microbiome information remains unclear, such as the origin, composition and function of the community and its members. There is emerging evidence to suggest that the diversity and composition of the milk microbiome might differ between lactation stages, due to maternal factors and diet, agrarian and urban lifestyles, and geographical location. The evolution of the methods used for studying milk microbiota, transitioning from culture dependent-approaches to include culture-independent approaches, has had an impact on findings and, in particular, primer selection within 16S rRNA gene barcoding studies have led to discrepancies in observed microbiota communities. Here, the current state-of-the-art is reviewed and emerging frontiers essential to improving our understanding of the human milk microbiome are considered. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, the relation between macroscopic parameters (speed, flow, density, occupancy) and microscopic parameters (lateral clearance, average gap, space headway, lateral movement duration, overtaking time, overtaking distance, relative speed) is evaluated by considering vehicle-type-dependent factor using the trajectory data collected at a five-lane urban merge and non-merge sections in Malaysia. Traffic data extractor software is utilized to extract the flow, speed, and trajectory data of the vehicles at both the merge and non-merge sections of urban highway. Both SPSS software and MATLAB software were used to conduct statistical and numerical modeling of the extracted field data. The results show a significant variation in vehicle-type dependant driving behaviors at merge and non-merge section. These parameters are useful in the development of simulation models for the merging part on a multi-lane urban highway. The findings are also useful for estimating the potential collisions under mixed traffic conditions in road safety management.

AB  - This study is intended to increase knowledge and improve understanding of early public accountancy professionalisation in Scotland by applying the prosopographical research method to a community of practitioners in the capital city of Edinburgh in the early-nineteenth century. Using archival data, the study identifies the collective professional and social characteristics of 124 Edinburgh practitioners in 1834 by means of career-related analyses of their origin, education, training, and service-related signals of movement to occupational ascendency prior to the community's later collective organisation. The study makes visible a structured and mature community operating in several occupational jurisdictions involving multi-disciplinary knowledge; maintaining a subordinate but mutually-dependent relationship with the legal profession; having a primary role in emerging insurance services; and achieving individual practitioner status recognition in a class-conscious city. Evidence of signals of movement to occupational ascendency adds to existing knowledge and understanding of the pre-collective organisation phase of public accountancy professionalisation in Scotland.

AB  - Urban Infiltration Basins (UIBs) are used to manage urban runoff transfers and feed aquifers. These UIBs can accumulate urban pollutants and favor the growth of potentially pathogenic biological agents as Nocardia.
   Objectives: To assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogenic Nocardia in UIBs and to stablish phylogenetic relationships between clinical and UIB N. cyriacigeorgica strains. To assess pathogenicity associated with environmental N. cyriacigeorgica using an animal model, and to identify genetic elements that may be associated to its virulence.
   Methods: A well-characterized UIB in terms of chemical pollutants from Lyon area was used in this study during a whole year. Cultural and Next-Generation-Sequencing methods were used for Nocardia detection and typing. Clinical and environmental isolates phylogenetic relationships and virulences were compared with Multilocus-Sequence-Analysis study together with a murine model.
   Results: In autumn, N. cyriacigeorgica and N. nova were the pathogenic most prevalent species in the UIB. The complex N. abscessus/asiatica was also detected together with some other non-pathogenic species. The presence of pathogenic Nocardia was positively correlated to metallic trace elements. Up to 1.0 x 10(3) CFU/g sediment of N. cyriacigeorgica and 6 OTUs splited in two different phylogroups were retrieved and were close to clinical strains. The EML446 tested UIB isolate showed significant infectivity in mice with pulmonary damages similar to clinical clone (GUH-2).
   Conclusion: Hsp65 marker-based metabarcoding approach allowed detecting N. cyriacigeogica as the most abundant Nocardia pathogenic species in a UIB. Metal trace elements-polluted environments can be reservoirs of pathogenic Nocardia which may have a similar virulence to clinical strains. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, we present a systematic methodology for continuous surveying and analysis of 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) abundance and security, based on the passive wireless network scanning technique called wardriving. The objective is to provide an efficient, scalable, and easily accessible methodology for collecting, analysing and storing WLAN survey data. To adhere to these set requirements, the presented survey and analysis processes can be carried out with freely available open-source software and common off-the shelf hardware. While extensive literature has been produced on wardriving and numerous WLAN survey studies have been documented in previous works, to our knowledge, no similar comprehensive methodology for systematic WLAN surveying and analysis has been previously presented. To further rationalise the need for surveying and analysing WLAN networks, an investigation on the related literature and the current state of the WLAN networking landscape has been conducted. Furthermore, as surveying WLAN networks via the wardriving technique undoubtedly raises legal and moral concerns, the legitimacy and ethics of wardriving have been examined. To test the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a primary test and calibration WLAN survey was conducted in three separate locations within a middle-sized city located in Southwest Finland. Based on the survey results, WLAN security in Finland is in a relatively good state. During the test survey, we successfully collected and analysed data from 720 WLAN networks, proving the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. From the 720 detected WLAN networks, 6% used insecure encryption protocols, 12.8% were unencrypted and a clear majority of 81.3% used the WPA2 encryption protocol. Results also show that wireless network device owners in the surveyed areas are not inclined to alter the factory-set default settings of their wireless networks. It was noted that roughly 40% of the surveyed networks used easily identifiable factory-set SSIDs and only 5.4% of the networks had a cloaked SSID. Furthermore, the survey data shows that WLAN devices from 38 different manufacturers were detected. Three of the most popular manufacturers in the surveyed area were Cisco with 28.3%, Huawei with 15.7% and Ruckus Networks with 9.7%.

AB  - Public space is an essential social infrastructure for the continuous negotiation of city life and democracy because it offers (ideally) an interactive platform for people from diverse social and cultural backgrounds and the forms of public life they cherish. This contribution inquires how public space's design and materiality play a fundamental role in popular struggles for social justice. By focusing on the differentiated access of women to public space, the role of gender in its design, and appropriation through a feminist intersectionality lens, this article aims to understand better the complex interplay between urban space and its non-human material agency vis-a-vis citizen mobilizations, movements, and socially engaged art interventions. Drawing from extensive participant observation and spatial analysis, the exemplary public space of Shahbag Chattwar (a public square/plaza) will shed light on the "gendered spatiality" of pivotal popular mobilizations and reclamations from the historical momentum of the 1952 language movement, over the 2013 contemporary Shahbag protests, and to the 2020 anti-metro rail protests at the Dhaka University campus. Analyzing urban space as a "palimpsest," this research reflects on both historic and ongoing scenarios of popular protests as they repeatedly occupy public space and leave spatial traces through spatial design and art. In sum, the article seeks to gain insight into public space as a principal site of contestation and negotiation of juxtaposed layers of gendered dynamics, civil rights, secularism, and fundamentalism.

TI  - Hamster numbers: biopolitics and animal agency in the dutch fields, circa 1870-present
T2  - HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE LIFE SCIENCES
LA  - English
KW  - CONSERVATION
AB  - Numbers of European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) in the Dutch Province of Limburg have been subject to much scrutiny and controversy. In the late nineteenth century, policymakers who considered them too numerous (and invasive) set up eradication programs. In the second half of the twentieth century, even when its domestic relative (Mesocricetus auratus) increasingly circulated as a pet in urban spaces, the numbers of European hamsters in the rural areas collapsed. Large-scale preservation campaigns and reintroduction programs ensued. According to some media, all this has turned the European hamster into the most expensive undomesticated animal of the Netherlands. A whole network of institutions became involved to save the species - ranging from local activist organizations, over zoos and universities, to federal ministries and international organizations. The interactions between the Dutch and 'their' hamsters, this article argues, were inscribed in various forms of biopolitics. The article highlights the changing discursive framings and spatial practices that have shaped the management of Cricetus cricetus over time and calls attention to the diversity of living and non-living agents that produced the multispecies choreographies of the present-day Limburg landscape. Finally, it alerts us to the (sometimes-paradoxical) kinds of agency that reside in the numbers of non-human animals.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread pollutants that are costly to measure with air quality instruments. We used a spatially balanced sample of an epiphytic moss, Orthotrichum lyellii, to develop fine-scale maps of atmospheric PAHs across residential areas of Portland, Oregon. The unusual abundance of this stresstolerant species enabled us to systematically collect a large sample (n = 350) on a 1 x 1km grid across the city. This provided the unique opportunity to investigate potential effects of more than 20 factors on PAH concentrations in moss, including emissions sources, tree canopy cover, relative elevation, short-term weather, and nuance of sample collection. We measured 20 PAHs in moss samples and assigned them to 4 groups for analysis based on molecular weight (MW): the Naphthalene, Low, Medium, and High MW groups. Spatial regression models explained a modest amount of variation in PAH concentrations in moss, with spatial structure increasing as MW increased. Motor vehicle emissions were the only PAH source we detected and was highly significant in all models. Deciduous tree cover correlated with lower PAH concentrations in moss for all except the high MW group. Short-term weather and nuance of sample collection, like height on the sampled tree, tree taxonomic family, and whether sample was primarily collected from a branch or bole, had surprisingly large effects on all groups. Overall, results aligned with expectations based on each group's dispersal potential due to MW. All PAH groups were highest over downtown Portland, along major highways, and lowest in parks and outer neighborhoods, although the details varied. Our results supported two common themes in studies directly measuring PAHs: the importance of roads as an emissions source in residential areas, and the potential for trees to reduce atmospheric concentrations. Moreover, the large effects of weather and sampling nuance have critical implications for the design of future studies.

AB  - Video anomaly recognition in smart cities is an important computer vision task that plays a vital role in smart surveillance and public safety but is challenging due to its diverse, complex, and infrequent occurrence in real-time surveillance environments. Various deep learning models use significant amounts of training data without generalization abilities and with huge time complexity. To overcome these problems, in the current work, we present an efficient light-weight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based anomaly recognition framework that is functional in a surveillance environment with reduced time complexity. We extract spatial CNN features from a series of video frames and feed them to the proposed residual attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which can precisely recognize anomalous activity in surveillance videos. The representative CNN features with the residual blocks concept in LSTM for sequence learning prove to be effective for anomaly detection and recognition, validating our model's effective usage in smart cities video surveillance. Extensive experiments on the real-world benchmark UCF-Crime dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model within complex surveillance environments and demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models with a 1.77%, 0.76%, and 8.62% increase in accuracy on the UCF-Crime, UMN and Avenue datasets, respectively.

AB  - Land-use change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. It is predicted that conversion of land and habitats will increase rapidly over the next few decades in Africa. Over the years, these changes potentially reduced the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production for vertebrates. Ficus species (Moraceae), commonly known as figs, occupy diverse habitats and typically produce large numbers of nutritional fleshy fruits that are important to frugivores. However, a decline in Ficus spp. distribution because of land-use changes may negatively affect frugivores and their ecosystems (e.g. via seed dispersal). We systematically searched for studies on the distribution of Ficus spp. in Africa and their frugivore interactions together with the effects of land-use changes up until 2021. Our search resulted in 70 eligible papers. A total of 124 Ficus spp. were recorded across 30 African countries representing approximately 56% of the African countries. Cameroon had the highest record of 63 species, while Benin, Burundi, Ghana, and Rwanda had two, the least number of Ficus spp. recorded. East Africa had the highest Ficus spp. richness recorded (96 species), followed by southern Africa (74 species), Central and Northern Africa (72 species), and West Africa with the least (31 species) recorded. Information about the effect exerted by anthropogenic land-use changes on Ficus-frugivore interaction in Africa was limited. However, research has been conducted on the impact of anthropogenic land-use changes on plant-frugivore and frugivore feeding ecology. Ficus spp. fruit were identified as significant in the diets of various frugivores across Africa, as it is found globally. However, it is essential to understand the impacts of anthropogenic land-use changes on the mutual interaction between frugivores and Ficus spp. and the attendant consequences for ecosystem service provision.

AB  - English has many words to refer to an adult man (e.g., man, guy, dude), and these are undergoing change in the Ontario dialects. This article analyzes the distribution of these and related forms using data collected in Ontario, Canada. In total, 6,788 tokens for 17 communities were extracted and analyzed with a comparative sociolinguistics methodology for social and geographic factors. The results demonstrate a substantive language change in progress with two striking patterns. First, male speakers in Ontario were the leaders of this change in the past. However, as guy gained prominence across the twentieth century, women started using it as frequently as men. Second, these developments are complicated by the complexity of the sociolinguistic landscape. There is a clear urban versus peripheral division across Ontario communities that also involves both population size and distance from the large urban center, Toronto. Further, social network type and other local influences are also important. In sum, variation in third-person singular male referents in Ontario dialects provides new insight into the co-occurrence and evolution of sociolinguistic factors in the process of language change.

AB  - The commuting behavior of private cars is the main cause of traffic congestion in the morning and evening rush hours. The discovery of stable ride-sharing groups for commuting private car is a necessary work to solve the morning and evening peak traffic congestion, and the discovery of ride-sharing groups is to match similar travelers. But different from the traditional ride sharing service based on passenger request, commuting private car users expect a long-term stable ride sharing service. This paper proposed a commuting private car ride-sharing groups discovery model based on spatio-temporal semantic similarity. The model considers the similarity of commuting time and space, and adds the user feature of commuting workplace's semantics to provide stable sharing matching for commuters of similar occupations, and adds the semantic of commuting place to provide stable ride-sharing matching for commuters with similar occupations. Commuting workplace's semantics refers to the functional area type of commuting workplace, which can reflect the nature of commuters' work. The main research content includes two parts: functional area identification and ride-sharing groups' discovery. In the process of functional area recognition, based on POI and road network data, multi classification support vector machine is used to identify urban functional areas. In the process of ride-sharing groups' discovery, based on the travel data of commuter private cars, DBSCAN clustering algorithm with spatiotemporal semantic distance measurement is used to complete ride-sharing group discovery.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of Avicennia marina, an important mangrove tree species with a wide distribution. Samples were collected from four sampling localities, characterised by different environmental conditions, situated along the coast of Mozambique within southern Africa: Pemba-Metuge, Bons Sinais Estuary, Costa do Sol and Inhaca Island. We used five speciesspecific polymorphic microsatellite loci for screening 20 samples from each of the sampling localities. The overall level of polymorphism observed was relatively high with 3?22 alleles detected at each locus. AMOVA showed the highest level of variation, 96.6 %, was located within populations. Pairwise FST comparisons were non-significant between sampling localities. No isolation by distance was detected. Structure results suggested the presence of one population after independent clustering of all samples. The results showed high levels of gene flow for A. marina along the coast of Mozambique and suggested the absence of barriers to gene flow. The results and information from this study will inform strategies for the conservation of A. marina. We discuss the importance of preserving the mangrove forest, supported by our own result, by managing and reducing anthropogenic activities that can damage the genetic diversity within these localities that are under high pressure due to urban growth. This will positively contribute to how and where effort and resources should be focused on for its conservation and sustainable management and utilisation.

AB  - Comparative studies between different strata of forests in ecological succession are important to understand the forest dynamics. The study evaluated floristic, phytosociological and ecological aspects between the tree and regenerating strata of an urban fragment of semideciduous forest, in Jatai, Goias state. In the last decades, the vegetation that was typically savanna has become a forest. Trees (diameter at breast height, DBH >= 5 cm) were sampled in 12 permanent 200m(2) plots. In each of them, 25m(2) subplots were sampled for the regenerant stratum, which comprised individuals with DBH <5cm and height >= 1m. Regenerants had greater richness (31 species), with two more species than adults. There was low floristic and structural similarity between the strata, indicating a replacement of species over time. Shannon's diversity was significantly lower for the tree stratum (t test), since it presented low equability, with ecological dominance of few species. Both strata had a high proportion of pioneer species, when compared to other studies. Zoochory and species of forest environments were significantly more abundant in the regenerating stratum. The study revealed a fragment in a frank process of secondary succession and vulnerability in the face of anthropic pressures, with care regarding its conservation being important.

AB  - Ecosystem Services (ESs) are bundles of natural processes and functions that are essential for human well-being, subsistence, and livelihoods. The 'Green Revolution' (GR) has substantial impact on the agricultural landscape and ESs in India. However, the effects of GR on ESs have not been adequately documented and analyzed. This leads to the main hypothesis of this work - 'the incremental trend of ESs in India is mainly prompted by GR led agricultural innovations that took place during 1960 1970'. The analysis was carried out through five successive steps. First, the spatiotemporal Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) in Billion US$ for 1985, 1995, and 2005 were estimated using several value transfer approaches. Second, the sensitivity and elasticity of different ESs to land conversion were carried out using coefficient of sensitivity and coefficient of elasticity. Third, the Geographically Weighted Regression model was performed using five explanatory factors, i.e., total crop area, crop production, crop yield, net irrigated area, and cropping intensity, to explore the cumulative and individual effects of these driving factors on ESVs. Fourth, Multi-Layer Perceptron based Artificial Neural Network was employed to estimate the normalized importance of these explanatory factors. Fifth, simple and multiple linear regression modeling was done to assess the linear associations between the driving factors and the ESs. During the observation periods, cropland, forestland and water bodies contributed to 80%-90% of ESVs, followed by grassland, mangrove, wetland and urban built-up. In all three evaluation years, the highest estimated ESVs among the nine ES categories was provided by water regulation, followed by soil formation and soil-water retention, biodiversity maintenance, waste treatment, climate regulation, and greenhouse gas regulation. Among the five explanatory factors, total crop area, crop production, and net irrigated area showed strong positive associations with ESVs, while cropping intensity exhibited a negative association. Therefore, the study reveals a strong association between GR led agricultural expansion and ESVs in India. This study suggests that there should be an urgent need for formulation of rigorous ecosystem management strategies and policies to preserve ecological integrity and flow of uninterrupted ESs and to sustain human well-being.

AB  - Dothistroma needle blight (DNB) is a serious pine disease present worldwide caused by the ascomycetous fungi Dothistroma septosporum and Dothistroma pini. Based on multiplex PCR analysis of 11 microsatellite markers screened on 253 D. septosporum isolates obtained from 32 sites across Slovakia, a total of 137 unique multilocus haplotypes (MLHs) were detected. The majority of MLHs (n = 91) were represented by a single isolate, but 13 MLHs were found at two different sites, and in some cases, these were separated by large distances. Four population clusters were identified using a discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). The genetic clusters obtained from the DAPC were mixed throughout the country and were not restricted to particular host species. Although both mating types of D. septosporum were found to be in an almost perfect 1:1 ratio in both the non-clone-corrected and clone-corrected datasets, random mating was rejected in the entire dataset. Random mating was only supported in the Pinus mugo group planted in urban areas and on a smaller spatial scale in two sites (Kalnica and Litava) using the clone-corrected dataset. These findings suggest a mixed mode of reproduction with an important component of sexual reproduction, although the sexual stage of the fungus (teleomorph) has not been physically observed in Slovakia yet. The examination of spatial relationships using spatial principal component analyses and the presence of isolation-by-distance together with relatively high genetic diversity suggests the pathogen has been long established in Slovakia and spread naturally across the landscape. However, the weak population structure and findings of identical clones at widely separated sites strongly suggests some degree of human assisted dispersal.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to propose that #MeToo is a social movement which has been more effective in changing norms around and increasing understanding about the prevalence and destructiveness of sexual harassment than decades of laws and organizational policies have been.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper uses communication, management and psychology literature on social media, public shaming and social movements to propose that #MeToo is a social movement that has changed perceptions of and knowledge about sexual harassment and assault. #MeToo provides voice to previously silenced targets and incentives for individuals to avoid perpetrating harassment and for organizations to deter sexual harassment at work and sanction it if it occurs.
   Findings
   The paper discusses individuals who have been publicly shamed and terminated for bigoted behavior outside of work, and organizational leaders who have been ousted after social media postings, as organizations attempt to distance themselves from the perpetrators of bigotry and sexual misconduct. Since #MeToo, some cities have passed laws prohibiting organizations from requiring sexual harassment targets to sign non-disclosure agreements.
   Practical implications
   Sexual harassment is associated with high individual costs and organizational costs, including costs of turnover, lost business and reputational damage. The #MeToo movement provides incentives for organizations to be more proactive and vigilant in their attempts to deter sexual harassment, and to appropriately address it when it occurs.
   Social implications
   Sexual harassment has widespread effects on women's daily lives and careers. #MeToo gives voice to harassment targets, changes norms of silencing them, and increases awareness of harassment as unacceptable, harmful behavior.
   Originality/value
   The paper positions #MeToo as a social movement, with the ability to change the seemingly intractable problem of sexual harassment in ways laws have not.

AB  - A risk-based framework for assessing the post-earthquake functional loss and restoration of distributed infrastructure systems is presented. Using an appropriate seismic source model, a stochastic earthquake catalogue is generated for the target region. For each event in the catalogue, the joint distribution of shaking and component-level damage maps are produced. Process-based discrete event simulation is coupled with an appropriate method for linking physical damage to functional impacts to model the restoration for each damage map. By considering all possible events that are impactful to the target region and their associated rates of occurrence, the full probability distribution of the functional recovery trajectory of the system is obtained. Dispersion disaggregation is used to isolate the individual contribution of each random variable to the uncertainty bounds in the restoration trajectory. A case study involving the city of Napa's water system is used to demonstrate how the framework can support resilience-based risk-informed decision-making for distributed infrastructure.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine key parameters of scholarly context and geographic focus and provide an assessment of theoretical underpinnings of studies in the field of social media and visitor mobility. This review also summarised the characteristics of social media data, including how data are collected from different social media platforms and their advantages and limitations. The stocktake of research in this field was completed by examining technologies and applied methods that supported different research questions. Design/methodology/approach This literature review applied a mix of methods to conduct a literature review. This review analysed 82 journal articles on using social media to track visitors' movements between 2014 and November 2020. The literature compared the different social media, discussed current applied theories, available technologies, analysed the current trend and provided advice for future directions. Findings This review provides a state-of-the-art assessment of the research to date on tourist mobility analysed using social media data. The diversity of scales (with a dominant focus on the city-scale), platforms and methods highlight that this field is emerging, but it also reflects the complexity of the tourism phenomenon. This review identified a lack of theory in this field, and it points to ongoing challenges in ensuring appropriate use of data (e.g. differentiating travellers from residents) and the ethics surrounding them. Originality/value The findings guide researchers, especially those with no computer science background, on the different types of approaches, data sources and methods available for tracking tourist mobility by harnessing social media. Depending on the particular research interest, different tools for processing and visualization are available.

AB  - The incidence of tick-borne diseases has increased in recent decades and accounts for the majority of vector-borne disease cases in temperate areas of Europe, North America, and Asia. This emergence has been attributed to multiple and interactive drivers including changes in climate, land use, abundance of key hosts, and people's behaviors affecting the probability of human exposure to infected ticks. In this forum paper, we focus on how land use changes have shaped the eco-epidemiology of Ixodes scapularis-borne pathogens, in particular the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in the eastern United States. We use this as a model system, addressing other tick-borne disease systems as needed to illustrate patterns or processes. We first examine how land use interacts with abiotic conditions (microclimate) and biotic factors (e.g., host community composition) to influence the enzootic hazard, measured as the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.s. We then review the evidence of how specific landscape configuration, in particular forest fragmentation, influences the enzootic hazard and disease risk across spatial scales and urbanization levels. We emphasize the need for a dynamic understanding of landscapes based on tick and pathogen host movement and habitat use in relation to human resource provisioning. We propose a coupled natural-human systems framework for tick-borne diseases that accounts for the multiple interactions, nonlinearities and feedbacks in the system and conclude with a call for standardization of methodology and terminology to help integrate studies conducted at multiple scales.

AB  - The implementation of sustainable spaces and infrastructure can offset environmental damage caused by urban land parceling of coastal plains. However, there is no clear methodology for the analysis and quantification of damage on coastal water bodies. In this paper, we provide a procedure for the identification of degraded urban rivers and the quantification of corresponding environmental damage according to Brazilian law. In Brazil, environmental legislation requires public authorities to consider the recovery or compensation of environmental liabilities in protected areas in the regularization of urban occupations. We use the Jurere<SIC> Coastal Plain located in Southern Brazil as a case study to analyze damage to the river bed and the riparian permanent preservation area (PPA). The suppression of the Meio and Faustino rivers occurred in several stages starting in the 1970s. Our analysis is subdivided into: (i) review of the evolution of environmental legislation protecting streams corridors over time; (ii) spatio-temporal analysis of land use from historical cartographic documents, obtaining accurate topographic data to assist in the identification of the river beds; and (iii) quantification of the suppressed PPA according to the legislation in force at the time of the implementation of urban land parceling. The procedure developed here contributes to the quantification of the environmental liabilities of other urban occupations and may be used to determine the compensatory environmental measures which are effectively bound to the corresponding damaged area.

AB  - Food provisioning can change wildlife pathogen dynamics by altering host susceptibility via nutrition and/or through shifts in foraging behavior and space use. We used the American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), a wading bird increasingly observed in urban parks, as a model to study synergistic relationships between food provisioning and infection risk across an urban gradient in South Florida. We tested whether Salmonella prevalence was associated with changes in ibis diet (stable isotope analysis), space use (site fidelity via GPS tracking), and local density (flock size). We compared the relative importance of these mechanisms by ranking candidate models using logistic regression. We detected Salmonella in 27% of white ibises (n = 233) sampled at 15 sites. Ibises with diets higher in anthropogenic food exhibited higher site fidelity. Salmonella prevalence was higher at sites where ibises exhibited greater site fidelity and Salmonella was more prevalent in soil and water. Overlap in Salmonella serotypes between ibises and soil or water also was more likely at sites where ibises exhibited higher site fidelity. Our results suggest that repeated use of foraging areas may increase Salmonella exposure for birds if foraging areas are contaminated from animal feces, human waste, or other bacterial sources. Limiting wildlife feeding in parks-perhaps best achieved through understanding the motivations for feeding, education, and enforcement-may reduce health risks for wildlife and the public.

AB  - Many species distribution maps indicate the ranges of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) overlap in Florida despite the well-documented range reduction of Ae. aegypti. Within the last 30 yr, competitive displacement of Ae. aegypti by Ae. albopictus has resulted in partial spatial segregation of the two species, with Ae. aegypti persisting primarily in urban refugia. We modeled fine-scale distributions of both species, with the goal of capturing the outcome of interspecific competition across space by building habitat suitability maps. We empirically parameterized models by sampling 59 sites in south and central Florida over time and incorporated climatic, landscape, and human population data to identify predictors of habitat suitability for both species. Our results show human density, precipitation, and urban land cover drive Ae. aegypti habitat suitability, compared with exclusively climatic variables driving Ae. albopictus habitat suitability. Remotely sensed variables (macrohabitat) were more predictive than locally collected metrics (microhabitat), although recorded minimum daily temperature showed significant, inverse relationships with both species. We detected minor Aedes habitat segregation; some periurban areas that were highly suitable for Ae. albopictus were unsuitable for Ae. aegypti. Fine-scale empirical models like those presented here have the potential for precise risk assessment and the improvement of operational applications to control container-breeding Aedes mosquitoes.

AB  - Greater Sydney is the largest coastal city in Australia and is where bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) are present every summer and autumn. A decade of acoustic telemetry data was used to identify drivers of space use for bull sharks and their potential prey, according to standardised 6-h intervals using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models. Influences of environmental, physical, and biological variables on the areas of space use, location, and predator-prey co-occurrence were investigated with generalised additive mixed models. Rainfall in the catchment affected space use for all animals (i.e. teleost species and both sexes of sharks), with varying temporal responses. Male sharks responded most promptly to high rainfall moving upstream in < 1 day, followed by teleosts (2 to 7 days), and female bull sharks after 4 days. Environmental luminosity affected male shark dispersal and space use, possibly indicating use of visual cues for foraging. Physical characteristics of habitat were important factors driving spatial overlaps between predator and prey in estuarine areas. In sandy embayments < 10-m deep, males and female bull sharks overlapped with different species, whereas males and silver trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus) co-occurred in deep holes (> 30 m). Shark size influenced overlap between sexes, with smaller females less likely to co-occur with larger males (similar to 50 cm). Variability in space use suggests spatial segregation by sex and size in bull sharks, with individuals targeting similar prey, yet either in different areas or at different times, ultimately enabling them to exploit different resources when in the same habitats.

AB  - Throughout the history of humankind, people have settled along seashores. The gradual accumulation of population and industrial activity in coastal areas has created preconditions for coastalisation - the movement of people and socio-economic activity to marine coasts. To date, coastal areas have a higher rate of economic development, fostering migration and an influx of capital across the globe. Scholars and policymakers voice concerns about the asymmetry of regional development and the increasing anthropogenic impact on the coastal ecosystem. It reinforces the importance of coastal zone management. In this study, we use an example of the Baltic region to identify the coastalisation patterns in the Baltic region and answer the question, whether there can be a single defi- nition of the coastal zone of the Baltic region. According to a broad definition, the Baltic macro-region is nearly all coastal and, consequently, all settlements are influenced by the coastalisation effect. We have studied urban population dynamics in 128 cities of 45 coastal regions through the lens of various characteristics of a coastal city - the distance from the sea (10, 50, 100, and 150 km), location in a coastal region (NUTS 2), availability of a port and its primary maritime activity (tankers, cargo, fishing, passenger, recreation- al vessels and others). The research results suggest that despite the strong coherence of the Baltic region countries, there should not be a single delimitation approach to defining the coastal zone. Overall, the most active marine economic processes occur in the zone up to 10 km from the seacoast and 30 km from ports and port infrastructure. However, in the case of Sweden, Poland, and Latvia, the coastal zone can be extended to 50 km, and in Germany - up to 150 km inland.

AB  - Historically, the city of Guadalajara has been affected not only by great regional earthquakes (M > 7.0) associated with the subduction process and regional crustal structures but also by local seismic sequences, that caused moderate to severe structural damage to buildings, whose source is not clear. Between December 2015 and May 2016, two seismic sequences occurred, affecting the city of Guadalajara. Both seismic sequences were recorded by the Jalisco Seismic Accelerometric Telemetric Network. The preliminary locations for May 2016 sequence estimated by the Antelope automatic system show alignment with an NNE-SSW trend, west of the city of Guadalajara. The subsequent relocations of theses earthquakes show two N-S alignments at the west of the city of Guadalajara, which agree with December 2015 hypocenters. The focal mechanisms analysis of the earthquakes shows that most of them correspond to normal fault mechanisms that are parallel to the hypocentral alignments suggesting the existence of two active faults responsible for the seismic sequences. Furthermore, these structures might constitute a graben, which we refer to as Zapopan Graben. Additionally, we calculated that these faults are 21 and 28 km length, respectively, which indicates that could have the potential to generate shallow earthquakes that reach magnitudes of 6.2 and 6.5, and could cause significant damages in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Zone.

AB  - The regulations implemented by governments in response to COVID-19 to limit the movement of people affected the nature of consumer spending. Consumption behaviour change, resulting from disasters or government-enforced regulation, is visible through spending displacement and response to fast-moving changes in circumstances. This study examines student spending in the host cities of universities and how a pandemic, such as COVID-19, may reduce or eliminate the spending injections into the economy through displaced spending.
   The value associated with the spending displacement is derived from a pre-Covid student survey conducted at the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University, South Africa. It reflects on the types of consumer spending that occur and also quantifies the value of spending lost to the city's businesses as a result of the transition to a predominant eLearning model in response to lock-down regulations imposed by Govenment.
   The university campuses in South Africa are known for their important role in both the development of the workforce's skills and the benefit this provides to the economy. A university campus attracts students from outside the confines of the city which supports spending injection to the local businesses. This benefit is of more value to the host city when it is situated in a rural setting and able to attract students from outside the local area, which has been the case with the Potchefstroom Campus.
   The Campus experienced an increase in the enrolment of on-campus contact learning over the past decade, a trend that has been beneficial to the local business community and led to continued investment in various property markets. A student survey provides insight into the spending patterns of students and is used to identify the retail spending benefit thereof, as well as the negative effects of its subsequent displacement, to the local retail industry. The introduction of a lockdown and a move to online learning by universities raise the question as to how this might affect the value of student spending and how this displacement in spending will impact the local economy. Some researchers indicate that various forms of spending displacement can be associated with COVID-19, while this research paper investigates how such displacement is relevant to the student population and the host economy.
   Three forms of displacement are identified in the literature related to the COVID-19 environment, and the results from the survey are aligned with these displacements. Considering the spatial aspect of consumption in the economic process, it was found that the value of student spending is not distributed evenly between retailers in the host economy. The survey results highlight the fact that mobility plays a role in spending patterns and that retail spending occurs throughout the host city. Within the context of COVID-19, the measures that restrict mobility and enforce social distancing, force trade to occur close to consumers' homes. This implies that student spending shifts from the host city to their hometown residence as a result of the change to online studies.
   The pre-Covid-19 student survey spending results revealed that 81 per cent of students' monthly retail spending takes place inside the host city with the rest spent outside. The Covid-19 enforced move towards online learning, and the potentially longer-term shifts from contact to online learning, will have a significant spending displacement effect on the host city.
   Concerning the type of consumption that occurs, the research revealed that students tend to spend on a variety of goods and services. The largest monthly spending takes place on retail goods, which represents an average monthly value of R3 146 or 46.5 % of their monthly expenses, followed by accommodation at 31%. In the case of COVID-19, the government regulations which limited contact education resulted in monthly losses in spending within the local economy on the purchase of retail-related services such as groceries and other goods, clothes and footwear, entertainment and hospitality services.
   Considering the time aspect of consumption, it was found that spending preferences related to time do exist. The results show that students are indifferent to spending during the week or on weekends and that most students are content to stay within the host city during weekends. No obvious time preference between the week and weekend for spending was found.
   The results show that student spending represents significant spending in the host city and for the time the COVID-19 restrictions remain in place, the spending displacement and loss of income for local businesses will be significant. The loss of student spending amounts to approximately R2 million daily.
   This not only highlights the cost of enforced lockdown measures, but also provides important indicators to university management upon considering replacing the existing tuition model of contact learning with one of online learning. Such a decision will lead to a significant negative impact on the economic activity of the Potchefstroom business community with farreaching implications for employment, income generation and wealth disbursement in this university city.

AB  - Biological invasions are a major driver of biodiversity loss and socioeconomic burden globally. As invasion rates accelerate worldwide, understanding past invasion dynamics is essential to inform predictions of future invaders and impacts. Owing to a high diversity of pathways and current biosecurity gaps, aquatic systems near urban centres are especially susceptible to alien species establishments. Here, we compiled and compared alien species lists for three different aquatic recipient regions spanning the North Atlantic: Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River and North and Baltic Seas. Each system is a major trade centre, with a history of invasions, and characterized by a strong natural salinity gradient. Our goal was to compare the alien species across systems, to test for similarities in the taxonomic composition and geographic origin as well as species overlap among the three regions. We selected specific macroinvertebrate, algal and fish taxa for analysis, to control for uneven taxonomic and biogeographic resolution across regions. Cumulatively, we identified 326 individual alien species established in these aquatic systems, with the North and Baltic Seas most invaded overall (163), followed by Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River (84) and Chesapeake Bay (79). Most invasions were from Ponto-Caspian, Eurasian, Northwest Pacific, Northwest Atlantic and North American origins, and mostly comprised Arthropoda, Chordata, Mollusca and Annelida. However, origins and taxonomies differed significantly among destinations, with Ponto-Caspian species particularly successful invaders to the North and Baltic Seas then Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River, but less so to Chesapeake Bay. Nevertheless, approximately eight-tenths of invaders established in only one region, indicating disparate invasion patterns and a high potential for future aliens to accrue from increasingly diverse source pools and pathways. These results support biosecurity strategies that consider a broad range of geographic origins and taxonomic groups to limit the translocation, arrival and spread of alien species worldwide.

AB  - Public transit (PT) has a positive impact on social and environment development in any society. This paper was carried out to analyze the role of GIS in utilizing destination identification as a way to help accomplish a sustainable landscape. The work focused on enhancing work availability considering the transport network. Areas with a higher offer of zero-vehicle lodging units have a better employment availability by travel. Furthermore, areas with a higher offer of single-parent families are at a disadvantage in general occupation openness. In this paper, GIS-based employment availabilities by walking, transit, and automobile were processed for the metropolitan territory. The same was done for work availability among neighboring square gatherings, while regulating built-environment and socio-economic variables. Understanding public travel openness is imperative for encouraging mode movements to reduce auto dependence and is fundamental for the prosperity of non-car households. Also, it is important to know the distribution of facilities such as schools, universities, malls, and other socio-economic places, which helps in rearranging these places in a better way to have effective transit and to reduce road traffic. The accessibility analysis is done through three steps: identifying the spatial distribution in the area, creating buffers around each alternative, and calculating the total number of population and services served by the network. The overall results of this study show that the proposed network will cover more than 50% of school places and workplaces in the area. It will also serve about 840,000 inhabitants, which is 34% of the total population. The previous results make the network accessible to a large number of the area's residents and will connect them with the main attraction points in the city.

AB  - BackgroundAs COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, understanding how patterns of human mobility and connectivity affect outbreak dynamics, especially before outbreaks establish locally, is critical for informing response efforts. In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases.MethodsIn collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we characterized changes in movement patterns in Taiwan since February 2020, and built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data to identify the high risk areas of disease spread and assess the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan.ResultsWe found that mobility changed with the number of local cases in Taiwan in the past few months. For each city, we identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. We showed that the risk of an outbreak in Taiwan is enhanced if initial infections occur around holidays. Intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on the risk of an outbreak than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact.ConclusionsTo prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook's aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. We developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions and shows the spatial spread of the disease and the impact of intercity and intracity travel reduction under different initial conditions. Our results can be used readily if local transmission occurs in Taiwan after relaxation of border control, providing important insights into future disease surveillance and policies for travel restrictions.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments has attracted considerable concerns due to their potential threat to public health. For reducing environmental risk of ARGs, it is crucial to identify the pathogenic resistant bacteria, determine the driving forces governing the ARG community and apportion their sources, which is yet remained to explore. In this study, we developed a framework integrating high-throughput sequencing (HTS) analyses, null-model-based methods and machine-learning classification tool for understanding the environmental resistome risk and the ecological processes that control the ARG profile in aquatic sediments, and applied to two urban lakes (Lake Tai and Lake Baiyang) in China. The HTS-based metagenomic analyses revealed abundant and diverse resistome, mobilome and virulome in the two lakes, including some emerging ARGs such as mcr and carbapenemases types. Relatively, the diversities for ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and virulence factor genes in Lake Baiyang were significantly higher than those in Lake Tai (p < 0.05). The metagenomic assembly and binning approaches tracked a number of potential pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria and found the co-occurrence of ARGs, MGEs and human bacterial pathogens in similar to 50% of the sediment samples, indicating a substantial resistome risk in the lakes. Comparison of multiple-site beta-diversity dissimilarity indexes suggested the ARG diversity was mainly explained by the spatial turnover rather than nestedness and exhibited significant distance-decay pattern. The results of using a novel null-model-based stochasticity ratio showed the stochastic processes made a higher contribution than the deterministic processes on the ARG profile in the environment, especially for Lake Baiyang (>65%). This was confirmed by the determination analyses of various ecological processes on ARG community by utilizing the null-model-based statistical framework for quantifying community assembly. That is, homogenizing dispersal (40%) dominated in Lake Baiyang, followed by homogeneous selection (32%) and ecological drift (15%), while ecological drift (33%) and homogenizing dispersal (31%) were the dominators in Lake Baiyang. SourceTracker analysis showed human sewage-associated sources were the largest contributor (similar to 62%) of ARGs in the environment. The findings shed light on the dissemination risk and driver dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in the aquatic environment, which may help to make effective management strategies for controlling pollution of ARGs.

AB  - In recent years, urban population growth and the diversity of vehicles have increased. Location prediction in VANETs is extremely necessary for consumer applications such as routing, network management, knowledge dissemination protocols, and road cognition, among others. This could increase the performance of VANETs. In this paper a Kalman filter is used to predict the vehicle's future location. We conducted experiments exploitation each vehicle quality traces and model-driven traces. We quantitatively compare the prediction performance of a Kalman filter and neural network-based methods. This paper proposes a location prediction algorithm for nonlinear vehicular movement using an Extended Kalman filter (EKF). Evaluation of the ESCL-VNET algorithm with EKF assess the given better results. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With more and more large-scale activities conducted in the cities, the issue how to evaluate risk in activities has attracted a lot of researchers to investigate. Bidirectional flow can be commonly observed in mass gathering events, therefore it is of great importance to gain deeper insights into this kind of movement. In this manuscript, three kinds of entropy are introduced and used in order to measure the disorder and risk of bidirectional movement, namely position entropy, angle entropy and speed entropy. Larger entropy means more uncertainty and risk in the system. Entropy is applied in two counter-flow experiments in order to describe the level of randomness. It is found when the number of lanes transits from 4 to 3, there is a sharp increase in respect of entropy because occupants compete for the space to move forward. In order to testify the effect of position entropy, another scenario is calculated and small position entropy means steady bidirectional movement, which is in accordance with the realistic movement in experiment. The speed entropy is measured and similar trend can be observed by comparing with speed variance proposed by previous researchers. Furthermore, angle entropy is also investigated and relation between angle entropy and density is obtained. The proposed entropy can help quantify randomness of counter-flow movement and be beneficial forfor the managers to better deal with potential abnormal activities. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many biological invasions occur within and between urban areas. If native species adapted to anthropogenically altered habitats are subsequently moved from an urban area in their native range to one within a novel region, then their urban-specialized phenotypes may provide them an advantage via prior adaptation. Here we examine if urban-derived behavioral traits are present within native guttural toad, Sclerophrys gutturalis, populations (Durban, South Africa) and investigate whether these localized phenotypes persisted within their invasive populations in Mauritius and Reunion. In our study, we measured boldness and exploration in populations along the toad's invasion route and found that toads were significantly bolder in urban populations, within both native and invasive ranges. This suggests boldness increased when toads transitioned to urban living in their native range and these heightened levels of boldness were maintained within invaded urban areas. This provides evidence that a bolder phenotype was a prior adaptation that likely increased guttural toad's invasion success. Interestingly, toad boldness returned to pre-urbanization levels within invasive populations that spread into natural areas, replicated on both islands. Exploration, on the other hand, was not increased above pre-urbanization, or pre-invasion, levels for any of the populations, and was lower in toads from Mauritius. Overall, our findings suggest that increased boldness is favored in urban habitats and that urban-derived behavioral traits may provide individuals an advantage when invading new urban landscapes. Significance statement Species adapting to anthropogenic landscapes have the ability to increase their invasive potential if the altered phenotypes they accrue can provide them advantages once they are transported outside their native range. Our study examined differences in behavioral traits, boldness, and exploration, along the invasion route of guttural toads, Sclerophrys gutturalis, between natural and urban sites from their native origin populations around Durban, South Africa, to their invasive populations in Mauritius and Reunion. We determined that populations were bolder in urban areas in their native range and that this increased boldness persisted in the other anthropogenic habitats within their invasive ranges, but reverted back to natural-native levels within populations that had spread into natural areas on both islands. Our findings support the growing trend that anthropogenically altered landscapes favor bolder individuals, as well as the assertion that urban-derived traits may bolster a species' ability to establish and spread within novel landscapes.

AB  - The solidarity economy in North America has received growing attention at multiple scales in the past ten years. As worker cooperatives in New York City enjoy newfound municipal support, narrative struggles emerge between actors within the solidarity economy space. The solidarity economy may be theorized as capitalism's feminized 'other': malleable, unfixed, local, and difficult to quantify. This feminization extends to both its workforce, a majority of whom are women, and the labor it produces, primarily domestic work. It is for these reasons that solidarity economy work is often overlooked as a political economy capable of structural transformation, and the discomfort with its breadth has lead movement leaders to uphold and advocate for more 'formal' models like cooperatives and deploy 'poverty alleviation' and entrepreneurship narratives to stabilize the fluid field. I argue that this project blanches the radical edges of a movement, minimizing not only those whose labor accounts for the majority of solidarity economy work, but ignoring the transformative potential of sites where such work happens. Based on a series of qualitative interviews with solidarity economy practitioners, this paper argues that the dominant narrative of solidarity economy work in New York City ignores where most of this work occurs and by whom, erasing and undermining those efforts. Counter-narratives emerge in those 'forgotten' spaces and thus transform them into sites of radical, anti-capitalist organizing. In so doing, this paper poses a question for geographers about how movements may continue to challenge our assumptions about space.

AB  - Coyotes (Canis latrans) have established populations in most major urban centers across North America. While the risk of attacks on humans or their pets is low, the presence of carnivores in areas with high human use has resulted in increased public concern. Having a clearer understanding of which animals are more likely to interact with humans and when interactions are more likely to occur will help mitigate human-carnivore conflicts. Despite clear broad-scale patterns of human avoidance, human-coyote interactions occur most frequently in residential areas. Our purpose was to determine if use of residential areas varied consistently across individuals or time. We used locations from GPS collars deployed on 14 coyotes in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada from 2012 to 2017 to fit a step selection function. Average (+/- SE) home range size estimates were 17.3 +/- 4.6 km(2) for resident coyotes and 102.8 +/- 32.9 km(2) for non-residents. We found that coyotes used natural areas more (beta = 0.07, SE = 0.02, p < 0.0001), and roads (beta = -0.50, SE = 0.13, p < 0.0001) and residential areas (beta = -0.79, SE = 0.21, p = 0.0001) less during the day than at night. We also found that coyotes were more likely to use residential areas in the breeding season from January to April (beta = 0.69, SE = 0.20, p = 0.0007) and the pup rearing season from May to August (beta = 0.54, SE = 0.13, p < 0.0001) than in the dispersal season from September to December. Lastly, we found that resident coyotes were less likely to use residential areas than non-resident coyotes (beta = -1.13, SE = 0.26, p < 0.0001). As far as we are aware, our study is the first to identify the seasons when coyotes are more likely to use residential areas. The seasonal patterns in habitat use that we observed reflect patterns that have been previously reported for human-coyote conflicts. Our results demonstrate that reducing the availability of anthropogenic food sources in residential areas, particularly in the winter and spring, should be a priority for managers aiming to reduce human-coyote conflict in urban areas.

AB  - The physicochemical and textural characteristics of river sediments and, essentially, their clays, are at the center of a network of biological and geochemical factors that are mutually modifying. Therefore, the contamination, the characteristics of the clays, and the associated microorganisms strongly influence each other. In this work, sediments from two sites of the urban Reconquista River, near Buenos Aires City, Argentina, exposed to different environmental contexts were characterized. The huge differences in the organic matter content in the vertical profile between both sediments strongly evidenced the polluted status of San Francisco (SF) site as opposed to the Dique Roggero (DR) site. Thorough physicochemical and textural characterization of the sediments and their clay fraction performed by pH, Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), spectrophotometry, XRD, laser diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, EDS, and SEM measurements revealed that organic matter (DR: 41 +/- 5 g kg(-1); SF: 150 +/- 30 g kg(-1)) intervened in the retention of heavy metals (DR: 5.6 mg kg(-1) Zn, 7 mg kg(-1) Cu, 3.1 kg(-1) Cr; SF: 240 mg kg(-1) Zn, 60 mg kg(-1) Cu, 270 mg kg(-1) Cr) and affected the level of association and the formation of mineral-organic aggregates (DR: 15 +/- 3 mu m; SF: 23 +/- 4 mu m). This can be decisive in the surface interaction required for the establishment of bacterial assemblages, which determine the biogeochemical processes occurring in sediments and have a key role in the fate of contaminants in situ and in the remediation processes that need to be applied to restore the anoxic contaminated sediments.

AB  - Live animal markets are known hotspots of zoonotic disease emergence. To mitigate those risks, we need to understand how networks shaped by trading practices influence disease spread. Yet, those practices are rarely recorded in high-risk settings. Through a large cross-sectional study, we assessed the potential impact of live poultry trading networks' structures on avian influenza transmission dynamics in Bangladesh. Networks promoted mixing between chickens sourced from different farming systems and geographical locations, fostering co-circulation of viral strains of diverse origins in markets. Viral transmission models suggested that the observed rise in viral prevalence from farms to markets was unlikely explained by intra-market transmission alone, but substantially influenced by transmission occurring in upstream network nodes. Disease control interventions should therefore alter the entire network structures. However, as networks differed between chicken types and city supplied, standardised interventions are unlikely to be effective, and should be tailored to local structural characteristics.

AB  - Land speculation accompanies public policy planning in infrastructure planning and development in urban and peri-urban areas. The aim of this paper is to assess how the planning of (Greater) Eastern Bypass in the peri-urban Nairobi led to an increase in speculative activities by examining land subdivision and transfer before and after public notification of the bypass development. Land subdivision data for the period 2005 and 2018 are analysed to establish change in land size, subdivision, transfer and ownership. Findings reveal that normal land specu-lation occur after public notification; whereas structural speculation occurs during preliminary and design re-view. Land speculation circumvents subdivision process leading to approval without due process. Infrastructure planning is both a political and institutional process where political class and government bureaucrats influence road alignment. There is therefore need for coupling transport-oriented development planning with overarching land use plan; backed by enforcement.

AB  - Background: Soil and aerial seed banks directly affect recruitment in plant populations. Soil banks result as the balance between seed inputs and outputs. Seed bank dynamics vary by species and environmental conditions. Few records on cacti seed banks are available.
   Questions: What types of seed banks do two cacti genera form in a lava-field reserve? Does seasonality influence the seed bank dynamics? Are inputs and outputs associated to the microenvironment?
   Studied species: Opuntia tomentasa, O. lassiacantha, Mammillaria haageana subsp. san-angelensis, M. magnimamma.
   Study site and dates: Xerophytic shrubland in the "Reserva Ecologica del Pedregal de San Angel" in Mexico City. 2016 to 2018.
   Methods: We collected soil samples from four microenvironments during the rainy and the dry seasons, searched for seeds and tested their viability. We compared the number of inputs, outputs and viable seed by microenvironment and season. For M. magnimamma, each month we registered fruit maturation and searched for seeds remaining between tubercles.
   Results: Opuntia seed bank inputs occurred in all microenvironments and in both seasons. Rain favored inputs in hollows by secondary seed dispersal. We registered a large number of outputs caused by germination, granivory and loss of viability. Opuntia seed bank was developed in headland, plain and slope. No Mammillaria seed inputs were found, neither an aerial bank in Al magnimamma.
   Conclusion: Opuntia seed banks were restricted to microenvironments that provided "safe sites" which stored viable seeds. Mammillaria seed dynamics may hinders recruitment for their populations.

AB  - Social movements occur not only because of political opportunities but also due to a perceived threat to citizens. Popular contention has remained an important mode of political participation in Hong Kong since 1997 when its sovereignty was handed over to China. Many influential collective actions in Hong Kong occurred when residents felt a threat had arisen from policies made by the city government or Beijing. By examining the Anti-Extradition-Bill movement in Hong Kong, this paper explores how threat triggers and sustains social movements. It finds that threat both facilitates the mobilization of social movements and sustains them. Threat strengthens solidarity among movement supporters because of their shared concerns and goals. It sustains a movement when government responses confirm participants' belief in the continual existence of the threat. The Anti-Extradition-Bill movement deepened the distrust between local residents and Beijing, resulting in the promulgation of the National Security Law by Beijing in May 2020.

AB  - Predicting the travel demand plays an indispensable role in urban transportation planning. Data collection methods for estimating the origin-destination (OD) demand matrix are being extensively shifted from traditional survey techniques to the pre-collected data from intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). This shift is partly due to the high cost of conducting traditional surveys and partly due to the diversity of scattered data produced by ITSs and the opportunity to derive extra benefits out of this big data. This study attempts to predict the OD matrix of Tehran metropolis using a set of ITS data, including the data extracted from automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, smart fare cards, loop detectors at intersections, global positioning systems (GPS) of navigation software, socio-economic and demographic characteristics as well as land-use features of zones. For this purpose, five models based on machine learning (ML) techniques are developed for training and test. In evaluating the performance of the models, the statistical methods show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to the best performance in terms of accuracy in predicting the OD matrix and has the lowest error in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Moreover, the predicted OD matrix was structurally compared with the ground truth matrix, and the CNN model also shows the highest structural similarity with the ground truth OD matrix in the presented case.

AB  - At the beginning of 2020, a suddenly appearing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) rapidly spread around the world. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in China occurred during the Spring Festival when a large number of migrants traveled between cities, which greatly increased the infection risk of COVID-19 across the country. Financially supported by the Wuhan government, and based on cellphone signaling data from Unicom (a mobile phone carrier) and Baidu location-based data, this paper analyzed the effects that city dwellers, non-commuters, commuters, and people seeking medical services had on the transmission risk of COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan. The paper also evaluated the effects of the city lockdown policy on the spread of the pandemic outside and inside Wuhan. The results show that although the daily business activities in the South China Seafood Wholesale Market and nearby commuters' travel behaviors concentrated in the Hankou area, a certain proportion of these people were distributed in the Wuchang and Hanyang areas. The areas with relatively high infection risks of COVID-19 were scattered across Wuhan during the early outbreak of the pandemic. The lockdown in Wuhan closed the passageways of external transport at the very beginning, largely decreasing migrant population and effectively preventing the spread of the pandemic to the outside. However, the Wuhan lockdown had little effect on preventing the spread of the pandemic within Wuhan at that time. During this period, a large amount of patients who went to hospitals for medical services were exposed to a high risk of cross-infection without precaution awareness. The pandemic kept dispersing in three towns until the improvement of the capacity of medical treatment, the management of closed communities, the national support to Wuhan, and the implementation of a series of emergency responses at the same time. The findings in this paper reveal the spatiotemporal features of the dispersal of infection risk of COVID-19 and the effects of the prevention and control measures during the early days of the pandemic. The findings were adopted by the Wuhan government to make corresponding policies and could also provide supports to the control of the pandemic in the other regions and countries.

AB  - Railways transformed inland transport during the nineteenth century. In this paper, we study how railways led to local population change and divergence in England and Wales as it underwent dramatic urbanization. We make use of detailed data on railway stations, population, and occupational structure in more than 9000 spatial units. A network of least cost paths based on major towns and the length of the 1851 rail network is also created to address endogeneity. Our instrumental variable estimates show that having a railway station in a locality by 1851 led to significantly higher population growth from 1851 to 1891 and shifted the male occupational structure out of agriculture. Moreover, we estimate that having stations increased population growth more if localities had greater initial population density and for those 3-15 km from stations, they had less growth compared to localities more distant from stations. Overall, we find that railways reinforced the population hierarchy of the early nineteenth century and contributed to further spatial divergence. Their implications for the geographic distribution of population were large.

In this respect, the study is constructed on an alternative spatial reading of counterspaces (LGBTI-friendly spaces, political spaces, and resistance spaces) in the capital of Turkey, Ankara, benefiting from Henri Lefebvre's theory on the production of space and The Situationist International's mapping techniques. It is realized that these public spaces appropriated or occupied by marginalized groups in society because of their gender, sexual orientation, beliefs, or ethnicity have a strong socio-spatial network in the city as a result of ontological approximation as the necessity of solidarity, which is defined as a habitat of the public assembly of otherness. The existence of different identities in the same area of the city for the same spatial practices is a manifestation of similar subjective formations and spatial representations of vulnerability within power relations. In this context, the aim of this study is the mapping of counterspaces in Ankara within a theoretical ground to contemplate the relationship between subject, power, and space. This article, thereby, analyzes the ontological basis of this psychogeography by questioning the reasons for the spatial proximity or superimposition of spaces used to socialize, organize, and resist the power of the other.

AB  - Regenerative farming offers the promise of rapid carbon sequestration at global scale. Also called regenerative agriculture, it is largely absent in social science environmental discussions. Learning and teaching about regenerative farming has been left outside educational channels at many levels until now. Pastoral farmers themselves have been at the forefront of a renewal movement educating other land users how to farm beyond conventional Western modern systems. Regenerative farming challenges 'industrial' or 'capitalist farming' models that continue to degrade natural systems across the world's pasturelands. This article describes ground-up learning processes and value propositions of farmers involved in regenerative farming. They see it as a solution to the normative shift in recent decades positioning farmers as 'bad guys': reducing biodiversity, degrading land systems by erosion and excess fertilisers, over-using water catchments and lowering water quality for urban communities. Understanding the claims and potential of regenerative farming enables environmental educators to be more specific in identifying potential strengths, without neglecting academic evaluation and critique to bear on this strategic climate innovation.

AB  - Place leadership has recently emerged as a key theme in regional development and with it a call for practical guidance for implementation in practice. Drawing on the experience of a number of novel environmental partnership initiatives in North West England in the 1980s that introduced new ideas, new ways of working and an energised popular movement relevant to all, this article outlines the history of two of these partnerships: Groundwork and the Mersey Basin Campaign from 1980 to 2010. The authors, who were involved at the time, consider a number of key factors for place leadership: vertical and horizontal partnerships; scale in landscape; the sustainability of outcomes; institutional context; and leadership itself. Some challenges of the approach are also briefly considered. We suggest that this experience has a wider relevance to current challenges in place leadership - decarbonisation, climate change adaptation and the conservation of biodiversity-offering lessons for mobilising practical and lasting change.

AB  - Literature on mobility justice suggest that socially disadvantaged people experience uneven access to movement. The theme of diversity in terms of gender and its interplay with mobility and leisure have attracted some scholarly attention. However, research into transgender and gender diverse mobilities and its impact to leisure access remains limited, particularly from non-Western perspectives. This paper endeavors to fill this gap by investigating transgender and gender diverse mobilities in Istanbul, Turkey. Drawing upon 49 qualitative interviews with gender diverse and transgender public transport users in Istanbul, this study contributes to a scholarly discussion exploring the relationship between gender diversity, mobility, and their access to leisure. As such, it furthers the field of gender-oriented leisure. Transgender and gender diverse individuals continue to face significant issues, such as violence, discrimination, and harassment, when using public transport. Based on the experiences of the respondents, this paper concludes that driver training and education, and proactive educational messaging around gender minorities in public spaces could significantly improve the comfort and safety of transgender and gender diverse public transport users.

AB  - Frugivory interactions between birds and fruit-bearing plants are shaped by the abundance of its interacting species, their temporal overlap, the matching of their morphologies, as well as fruit and seed characteristics. Our study evaluates the role of seven factors of fruits and plants in determining the frequency of whole-fruit consumption by birds. We studied the frugivory network of a Neotropical periurban park in Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico, and quantified relative abundance and phenology of birds and fruit, as well as fruit morphology, chromatic and achromatic contrast, and nutritional content. Using a maximum likelihood approach, we compared the observed interaction network with 62 single- and multiple-variable probabilistic models. Our network is composed of 11 plants and 17 birds involved in 81 frugivory interactions. This network is nested, modular, and relatively specialized. However, the frequency of pairwise interactions is not explained by the variables examined in our probabilistic models and found the null model has the best performance. This indicates that no single predictor or combination of them is better at explaining the observed frequency of pairwise interactions than the null model. The subsequent four top-ranking models, with Delta AIC values < 100, are single-variable ones: carbohydrate content, lipid content, chromatic contrast, and morphology. Two- and three-variable models show the poorest fit to observed data. The lack of a deterministic pattern does not support any of our predictions nor neutral- or niche-based processes shaping the observed pattern of fruit consumption in our interaction network. It may also mean that fruit consumption by birds in this periurban park is a random process. Although our study failed to find a pattern, our work exemplifies how investigations done in urban settings, poor in species and interactions, can help us understand the role of disturbance in the organization of frugivory networks and the processes governing their structure.</p>

AB  - Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex and surprising ways. Ongoing demand for critical ecosystem services requires an understanding of the populations and communities in these ecosystems in the future. This paper represents a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the core research area of "populations and communities." The objective of this effort was to show the importance of long-term data collection and experiments for addressing the hardest questions in scientific ecology that have significant implications for environmental policy and management. Each LTER site developed at least one compelling case study about what their site could look like in 50-100 yr as human and environmental drivers influencing specific ecosystems change. As the case studies were prepared, five themes emerged, and the studies were grouped into papers in this LTER Futures Special Feature addressing state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the "connectivity" theme and has examples from the Phoenix (urban), Niwot Ridge (alpine tundra), McMurdo Dry Valleys (polar desert), Plum Island (coastal), Santa Barbara Coastal (coastal), and Jornada (arid grassland and shrubland) sites. Connectivity has multiple dimensions, ranging from multi-scalar interactions in space to complex interactions over time that govern the transport of materials and the distribution and movement of organisms. The case studies presented here range widely, showing how land-use legacies interact with climate to alter the structure and function of arid ecosystems and flows of resources and organisms in Antarctic polar desert, alpine, urban, and coastal marine ecosystems. Long-term ecological research demonstrates that connectivity can, in some circumstances, sustain valuable ecosystem functions, such as the persistence of foundation species and their associated biodiversity or, it can be an agent of state change, as when it increases wind and water erosion. Increased connectivity due to warming can also lead to species range expansions or contractions and the introduction of undesirable species. Continued long-term studies are essential for addressing the complexities of connectivity. The diversity of ecosystems within the LTER network is a strong platform for these studies.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has become the focus of attention in the field of urban geography. Built environment, such as the layout of public spaces like transportation hubs and urban open spaces, is an important factor affecting the spread of the epidemic. However, due to the different behavior patterns of different age groups, the intensity and frequency of their use of various built environment spaces may vary. Based on this, we selected patients that were infected, with a non-manipulated time period, and the classification of human behavior patterns; we then conducted a regression analysis study on the spatial distribution and building environment of these COVID-19 patients. The results showed that the spatial distribution of young and middle-aged patients (18-59 years old) was more homogeneous, while the spatial distribution of elderly patients (60 years old and above) had a strong clustering characteristic. Moreover, the significant built environment factors exhibited in the two populations were extremely different. More diverse urban facilities and public spaces exhibited influential properties for older patients, while middle-aged and young adults were more influenced by commuting facilities. It can be said that the built environment shows different influences and mechanisms on the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in different populations. Therefore, the results of this paper can inform decision makers who expect to reduce the occurrence of urban respiratory infectious diseases by improving the urban built environment.

AB  - Under rising insecurity and precarity in the neoliberal labor market, Korean workers have protested mass job cuts and deteriorating working conditions. Although their grievances originate from the regions and workplaces where they are employed or laid off, the protest sites often move to major political landmarks in Seoul, the nation's capital, with demands for political redress. These labor protests in the capital demonstrate two distinctive features of Korean labor movements in the 2000s: protests go on for a protracted period of time with few tangible results and take extreme forms of resistance.
   Approaching Seoul as a site of contentious politics, this study analyses the mutual nexus between labor protests and urban spaces with cases that appropriate various sites, such as Kwanghwamun (Gwanghwamun) Square, the Blue House, and the National Assembly, involving diverse tactics like long-term camp-ins, sambo ilbae (SIC) marches, and the occupation of structurally perilous structures. It examines which layers of inequality and injustice in the labor market, or in Korean society at large, are articulated through protest methods that spatially engage with specific urban locations in Seoul. With this investigation, the paper argues that the labor movement practices novel repertoires of resistance to neoliberal precarity by choosing the urban sites with metaphoric significance and by publicly displaying bodily torment. These new forms of contention, in turn, redefine the sense and political implication of the protest site and make the space part of the new protest repertoire.

AB  - Sewers are a critical part of the urban water system and represent a considerable investment due to the presence of extensive networks in many cities. Consequently, excess sewer sediment deposition, from changed inflow conditions or lack of appropriate sewer infrastructure, can lead to significantly increased maintenance and operational costs. The main aim of this manuscript is to quantify the potential impacts of reduced inflow and increased sediment concentrations from the implementation of sustainable water practices, such as Decentralized Water Recycling and Water Demand Management, on excess sediment deposition in gravity sewers. Experiments in a sewer pilot plant, with municipal wastewater, and modelling using a comprehensive local-scale sewer sediment model were used in conjunction to address this aim. Results from both these methods indicated that a reduction in inflows from the moderate implementation of sustainable water practices had a large impact on the quantity of sediment deposited in gravity sewers. However, further modelling showed that the reduction in bed erosion during peak flows for the same implementations of sustainable water practices occurred more gradually. Overall, our findings showed that in existing gravity sewer mains with reasonable slope and flow velocities, a moderate decrease in peak flow velocity of around 15% due to the implementation of Decentralized Water Recycling and Water Demand Management was unlikely to result in a net increase of sediment deposition. Future work in this area could focus on confirming these findings through case studies in the field or on long-term pilot studies with detailed bed height and density measurements.

AB  - Biosphere Reserves face huge challenges worldwide, especially those located in metropolitan areas such as La Campana-Penuelas Biosphere Reserve in central Chile. As well as direct threats, such as urban sprawl and wildfires, such reserves face a less evident threat in the form of weak community engagement and awareness of the value, opportunities and challenges that the name biosphere reserve offers. Since 2015, environmental conflicts have intensified in this area of Chile, and counter-movements towards re-territorialization have arisen under the slogan "We are biosphere reserve". This implies a deep understanding of the imbrications of the lives of humans and more-than-humans in a common territory which face common challenges with regard to the preservation of life and regenerative actions and pathways. In Chile, this local social / political / spiritual movement now converges with a national movement towards recovering sovereignty over common goods through a new Constitution. In this article, we describe a fruitful academia-community dialogue of knowledges created through a series of open-access courses, collaborative mapping, and artistic initiatives developed by citizens, such as textile-making and handcrafts using natural pigments. All of these initiatives come together within the framework of very local geopolitical actions for the preservation of the biocultural landscapes found within the biosphere reserve. We discuss these initiatives as forms of biocultural resistance and re-existence.

AB  - The adverse effects of Chile's neoliberal social housing policy have been evident for years. The housing deficit, amount of informal housing and pressure from citizen groups have increased in recent years. Numerous stop-gap strategies have been devised in order to contain its adverse effects, many of which can be classified as "exceptional" policy responses, as opposed to "standard" policy responses. Such strategies may include tailormade rights and arbitrary flexibility, the results of which are radically different from those of the "standard" policy. Our hypothesis is that exception is a government strategy to face the deficiencies and conflicts that the policy brings about. A qualitative study was carried out to study the origins, characteristic and repercussions of exception. The results showed four dimensions of this government strategy. First, the application of exception amid the occurrence of environmental emergencies. Second, the use of exception for economic and political purposes and interests. Third, when inhabitants demand exceptional measures. Fourth, when exceptional targeting mechanisms are created to deal with a population whose characteristics are so particular that they are beyond the sphere of political action. It is concluded that exceptions become the norm in a context of neoliberal governance of social housing policy.

AB  - The resilience of historic areas is highly threatened by natural sudden onset events such as earthquakes. Major weak points of an urban environment, widely debated in the past literature, concern mainly masonry buildings. However, also the complex urban paths system could be prone to lose its functionality in the aftermath of a seismic event. Urban paths alterations due to earthquake effects can be attributed to extrinsic (i.e.: ruins formation from buildings) and intrinsic (e.g.: ground instability due to landslide or underground cavities) vulnerability; these factors jointly combined with exposure condition of hosted population in urban areas and with the local seismic hazard represent a possible impediment to evacuation process and at the same time, an obstacle to rescuers' teams occupied in offering a first aid response. Therefore, the work aim is to apply a tool for preliminary evaluation of risk, strictly related to urban paths system considering all abovementioned aspects from a holistic point of view. This goal is achieved by a simplified methodology applicable to a wide-scale on a whole historic centre that takes advantages from a series of easy-to-detect parameters influencing the risk with limited availability of resources. Parameters grouped by topics (i.e.: path use and exposure; geometric features; physical-structural features; extrinsic vulnerability; seismic hazard) are assigned to scores and weights according to a multi-criteria decision-making process generating a numerical index. A typical Italian urban centre made by historical masonry constructions is assumed as a case study to implement the existing method. The detected risk indexes are then graphically provided through risk maps, a chromatic scale indicates which areas are more prone to possible unavailability of paths rather than others. Evacuation planners and emergency managers could embody this tool in their studies to prevent the high number of losses by guiding evacuees toward assembly points through the risk lower paths and to direct risk-reduction interventions punctually where critical condition emerges with different priority levels. Paths accessibility evaluation through a risk characterization could also result useful as a tool for rescuers' activities optimization and for inhabitant disaster preparedness in terms of being familiar with safest and alternatives paths in emergency conditions.

AB  - Problem statement: Recognizing and examining the relationship between space, behavior and or environment and community in urban studies is always important and valuable. The main issue of behavioral studies understands the relationship between humans and their needs and the formation of behavior in the environment. In this study, two different neighborhoods based on morphological structure (Zargandeh neighborhood with irregular-organic texture and Daroos neighborhood with regular-grid texture) were studied to investigate the effects of different structure of neighborhood texture and the roles of urban planners and designers on the formation of behavioral patterns which can be affected on the formation of the desired behavioral patterns.
   In the present study, the main question is about understanding the difference between the occurrence and emergence of behavioral patterns in two different irregular-organic and regular-grid textures. This research is not hypothetical and seeks to describe and analyze the relationship between behavioral patterns and these two different urban structures.
   Research objectives: The goal of this study is detection of behavioral pattern changes in different urban textures in order to prepare a suitable planning according to the goals of urban planners and designers.
   Research method: The above research is descriptive-analytical. Because it has adapted or compared case studies and also it is comparative due to the comparison of the outputs of the two Agraph and Depth software. Type of this research is mix-method (quantitative and qualitative).
   Conclusion: The formation of behavioral patterns in different urban spaces of neighborhoods is due to human relations. Existence of regular pattern in the passages has been lead to the high level of access, integration and strengthens the movement patterns. Wide field of view facilitates movement and increases security. Due to proper access of the neighborhood texture, the land-use patterns have been dotted and scattered. The presence of an organic physical form has strengthened walking and increased the sense of search. Parts of the neighborhood have been separated from other parts due to low integration and the existence of multiple dead ends and reduced sense of security because of the presence of many corners, cozy and limited visibility and have become spaces with no or limited visits.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) and its associated biological impacts have regularly been characterized as predominantly urban issues. Although far from trivial, this would imply that these impacts only affect ecosystems that arc already heavily modified by humans and are relatively limited in their spatial extent, at least as compared with some key anthropogenic pressures on the environment that attract much more scientific and public attention, such as dimate change or plastic pollution. However, there are a number of reasons to believe that ALAN and its impacts are more pervasive, and therefore need to be viewed from a broader geographic perspective rather than an essentially urban one. Here we address, in turn, 11 key issues when considering the degree of spatial pervasiveness of the biological impacts of ALAN. First, the global extent of ALAN is likely itself commonly underestimated, as a consequence of limitations of available remote sensing data sources and how these are processed. Second and third, more isolated (rural) and mobile (e.g., vehicle headlight) sources of ALAN may have both very widespread and important biological influences. Fourth and fifth, the occurrence and impacts of ALAN in marine systems and other remote settings, need much greater consideration. Sixth, seventh, and eighth, there is growing evidence for important biological impacts of ALAN at low light levels, from skyglow, and over long distances (because of the altitudes from which it may be viewed by some organisms), all of which would increase the areas over which impacts are occurring. Ninth and tenth, ALAN may exert indirect biological effects that may further expand these areas, because it has a landscape ecology (modifying movement and dispersal and so hence with effects beyond the direct extent of ALAN), and because ALAN interacts with other anthropogenic pressures on the environment. Finally, ALAN is not stable, but increasing rapidly in global extent, and shifting toward wavelengths of light that often have greater biological impacts.

AB  - Provo was a revolutionary movement that developed its activity in Amsterdam between 1965 and 1967. One of its strategies for occupying the public space was to gather around different civic monuments of the city in order to appropriate and subvert its symbolism. This paper reviews the history of the movement in relation to three Amsterdam monuments that played a decisive role in Provo's protests and actions: Het Lieverdje, the place of the anti-smoking campaign and the consolidation of Provo, the General Van Heutsz monument, where the critical questioning of Dutch colonial past took place, and the Dokwerker, where the revolts of 10 March 1966 and 14 June 1966 began.

AB  - The topography and landforms of Guizhou Province in China are complicated, and the climatic conditions of heavy precipitation make landslide disasters in Guizhou Province occur frequently. To avoid damage to people's lives and economic property caused by disasters, a reliable early landslide identification method and landslide monitoring method are urgently needed. Traditional landslide identification and monitoring methods have limitations. InSAR technology has unique advantages in large-scale landslide identification and monitoring, but landslide identification results based on a single deformation value are one-sided. Therefore, this paper uses Sentinel-1A radar satellite image data and uses InSAR technology and optical remote sensing technology to carry out large-scale surface deformation monitoring and identification of dangerous deformation areas in Liupanshui City, Tongren City, Guiyang City and other regions in Guizhou Province. The potential landslide identification methods based on the time series normalized difference vegetation index and landslide development environment elements are combined to investigate hidden landslide hazards in the study area. In this paper, time series InSAR technology is used to monitor three key landslides in Jichang Town, Yujiaying and Fana, to grasp the movement status of the landslide in time. The method of landslide identification and monitoring in this paper is of great significance for disaster prevention and management in Guizhou Province.

AB  - How structural segment boundaries modulate earthquake behavior is an important scientific and societal question, especially for the Wasatch fault zone (WFZ) where urban areas lie along multiple fault segments. The extent to which segment boundaries arrest ruptures, host moderate magnitude earthquakes, or transmit ruptures to adjacent fault segments is critical for understanding seismic hazard. To help address this outstanding issue, we conducted a paleoseismic investigation at the Traverse Ridge paleoseismic site (TR site) along the similar to 7-km-long Fort Canyon segment boundary, which links the Provo (59 km) and Salt Lake City (40 km) segments of the WFZ. At the TR site, we logged two trenches which were cut across sub-parallel traces of the fault, separated by similar to 175 m. Evidence from these exposures leads us to infer that at least 3 to 4 earthquakes have ruptured across the segment boundary in the Holocene. Radiocarbon dating of soil material developed below and above fault scarp colluvial packages and within a filled fissure constrains the age of the events. The most recent event ruptured the southern fault trace between 0.2 and 0.4 ka, the penultimate event ruptured the northern fault trace between 0.6 and 3.4 ka, and two prior events occurred between 1.4 and 6.2 ka (on the southern fault trace) and 7.2 and 8.1 ka (northern fault trace). Colluvial wedge heights of these events ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 m, indicating the segment boundary experiences surface ruptures with more than 1 m of vertical displacement. Given these estimates, we infer that these events were greater than Mw 6.7, with rupture extending across the entire segment boundary and portions of one or both adjacent fault segments. The Holocene recurrence of events at the TR site is lower than the closest paleoseismic sites at the adjacent fault segment endpoints. The contrasts in recurrence rates observed within 15 km of the Fort Canyon fault segment boundary may be explained conceptually by a leaky segment boundary model which permits spillover events, ruptures centered on the segment boundary, and segmented ruptures. The TR site demonstrates the utility of paleoseismology within segment boundaries which, through corroboration of displacement data, can demonstrate rupture connectivity between fault segments and test the validity of rupture models.

AB  - The Campeche Bank and Yucatan Peninsula coastal-wetland ecosystem (CYCWE) comprises marine, brackish, and freshwater communities. Two biogeographic regions converge on its coast, the subtropical and the Caribbean. Coastal environments are experiencing degradation by local and global factors, a first approach for their protection is to know their inhabitants and define their distribution. In this study, the CYCWE ichthyofauna was analyzed (1) to determine if the defined biogeographic regions influence its distribution, (2) to establish ichthyological sections, and (3) to analyze the ecological and conservation status of the ichthyofauna in each section. The CYCWE presents a dynamic and connected community of 703 species segregated into 11 ichthyological sections (S). The biogeographic regions affect the distribution of coastal and oceanic ichthyofauna, where three coastal sections, S2, S8, and S3 in Campeche and Yucatan belong to the subtropical region, and S1 located mainly on the coast of Quintana Roo, but it extends following the reef formations, including the three states, belongs to the Caribbean region. A similar pattern was not observed for the brackish and freshwater fish communities. The paleogeographic development of the Yucatan Peninsula and the dispersal of the species along the Gulf slope shaped the current brackish and freshwater diversity, producing a differentiated ichthyofauna to the north (S7, S9, and S10) in Yucatan, south (S11) in Campeche and (S4) Quintana Roo, and northeast (S5 and S6) in Quintana Roo. Local threats to the CYCWE are urban developments, lack of ecological information of the species populations, a significant number of species in the IUCN vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered categories, and introduced and invasive species. Collaborations between researchers and institutions are needed to jointly focus on least studied, endangered, and non-native species, as well as urban development plans made from a holistic perspective to reduce the stress over the environment.

AB  - The presence of large carnivores close to people poses unique challenges for wildlife managers working to maintain fully functioning ecosystems while simultaneously minimizing potential risks to public safety and private property. In western North America, cougar (Puma concolor) use of residential areas is relatively commonplace and has contributed to undesirable interactions with people. A common assumption is that cougar population growth translates into greater proximity to people and more interactions, but to our knowledge, direct evaluation of this assumption has not occurred. We used GPS telemetry locations and confirmed cougar-human interaction reports to construct single-sex Leslie matrices, utilization distributions, and a two-stage hurdle model within a Bayesian framework to investigate the effects of population trajectory on cougar use of residential areas and interactions with people in the wildland-urban interface of western Washington. We collected data during two time periods with different expected population growth rates, anticipating greater cougar use of residential areas and interaction levels during the period of increased growth. Contrary to our initial expectations, we did not detect meaningful differences in cougar presence in residential areas or number of interactions with humans between study periods. Instead, we documented consistent space use patterns by all demographic classes that seemed to be governed by different life-history strategies. Interactions with humans were largely a function of individual cougar behaviors during both study periods. The consistent presence of abundant, well-connected wildlands coupled with cougar dispersal likely mitigated the potential effects of population trajectory as the increased expected growth rate in Period 2 manifested primarily as subadult emigration via wildlands. We found that a source population does not necessarily translate into greater proximity to people and more interactions. Cougar management in wildland-urban environments would benefit from the application of strategies that address the complex interplay of biological and anthropogenic factors that contribute to cougar presence in residential areas and their likelihood of interacting with people.

AB  - Desmodus rotundus is a transmitter of zoonotic and emerging diseases to humans and livestock, such as rabies. Most infectious diseases are spatially limited by the presence of the transmitter, whose abundance and survival are influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of food sources. A tool that facilitates its study is the use of Geographic Information Systems. The objective of this study was to analyze the interaction of populations of hematophagous bats and humans, through the development of a probable model of dispersal of D. rotundus based on known shelters and different environmental variables, in addition to analyzing the relationship between shelters identified for three years and their proximity to human settlements, as a process of coexistence. The study was conducted in the state of San Luis Potosi from 2014 to 2016. A total of 180 shelters of D. rotundus distributed towards the Huasteca region were identified, 80 % of these were built by man and 57 % were inhabited. A buffer of 5 km around from the location of each shelter was calculated, finding inside a total of 976 rural communities and 15 cities, with 337,836 inhabitants. The average distance from shelters to the first human settlement was 518.65 +/- 11.33 m. It is necessary to continue studying the association between urbanization and the emergence of zoonoses, through the understanding of the interactions between wild animalslivestock-humans.

AB  - The Petalodontiformes are a small intriguing group of Permo-Carboniferous chondrichthyans. Petalodus is the longest known petalodont genus generally considered representative of the order. The first definite fossil record of seven well-preserved Petalodus teeth has been found in the Qianshi limestone in the Lower Permian (Cisuralian) middle-upper Taiyuan Formation in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, North China. The specimens are characterized by petal-shaped teeth with a spade-like crown, and a long, tongue-shaped root; the crown is circled with a band or cingulum composed of imbricated ridges at the base. All seven teeth are assigned to the species P. ohioenesis because of their vertically narrow cingulum and much longer root. Petalodus is a worldwide genus, with fossil localities mainly concentrated in the Laurussia supercontinent. The occurrence of Petalodus teeth in Yangquan not only is the first fossil record in China, but also only the second record in Asia. The Yangquan fossil site was part of the paleoequatorial North China Craton during the Early Permian, and was isolated from Laurusia and East Gondwana by the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. The successful dispersal of Petalodus from Laurusia to the North China Block along Paleo-Tethys may support the possibility that Petalodus taxa were active free-swimmers rather than bottom dwellers. The new finding increases the petalodont diversity in eastern Asia, and also sheds new light on the distribution and stratigraphic range.

AB  - Simple Summary: Populations of western monarch butterflies, which formerly populated coastal overwintering sites in California in numbers exceeding one million, dwindled to less than 2000 in 2020/21. In the same winter, breeding populations of monarchs occurred commonly in the San Francisco Bay urban area for the first time. The urgent conservation need to understand this possible shift in overwintering strategy prompted this first study of the viability and ecology of monarch breeding populations in the South Bay urban area of San Francisco during January-June 2021. Adult monarchs along with eggs and larvae were common during winter and most of spring, utilizing non-native ornamental milkweed and multiple nectar sources from native and ornamental plants. Evidence from weekly counts and tagged butterflies indicated increased dispersal to the north and east during late April-mid-May, possibly representing spring migration to the Pacific Northwest and eastern California. Infection of reared adult monarchs with a protozoan parasite was high. Winter breeding of monarchs in the San Francisco urban area as an alternative and sustainable overwintering strategy for the western US population will likely depend on the continued presence of ornamental milkweeds, sustainable co-existence of monarchs and protozoan parasites, and successful migration to the greater western US during spring.<br></p>

   The western North American monarch butterfly population assessed by counts of non-reproductive overwintering butterflies at coastal sites in California declined to less than 2000 in 2020/21. Simultaneously, reports of reproductive monarchs increased in San Francisco urban areas, perhaps representing a shift in overwintering strategy. To better understand monarch winter breeding in the Bay area, we studied adult and immature populations in Santa Clara County during January-June 2021. Adult monarchs were common with numbers ranging from 0.23-1.54/min during ~30 min weekly surveys at one site, with lowest numbers late April to mid-May. Eggs and larvae, primarily on ornamental milkweeds, were found on nearly all survey dates with lowest numbers mid-late April to mid-May. Levels of infection of adults by the parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha were consistently high during the study (69.3-77.5%). From 499 monarchs tagged post-eclosion, recovery rates of 19.2-23.6% occurred from releases in January-February and May-June but only 11.9-13.0% from March-April releases. Although distances were small, butterflies tagged in April were recovered from greater distances than other months. Tagged monarchs flew primarily north or east. There were reduced numbers of adult monarchs during late April-mid-May with some evidence of northerly and easterly emigration at the same time from tagged butterflies, suggesting some movement out of the South Bay area, perhaps representing spring migration. We conclude that monarchs can successfully breed and maintain populations on ornamental milkweeds during winter at urban sites in the South Bay of San Francisco and may still migrate during spring to remain part of the wider western population.</p>

AB  - We examine the spatial distribution of Hispanic children and analyze its relationship to the geography of opportunity. We describe the spatial distribution of Hispanic children across all U.S. counties, document their exposure to salutary and deleterious conditions, and compare exposure to these conditions among children living in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties that represent traditional and new destinations for immigrants. We find clear evidence of racial and geographic differences in opportunity, at least as defined by spatially uneven patterns of intergenerational mobility. We show that the typical Hispanic child is highly isolated, living in a county with a majority-minority population, high rates of poverty, low levels of education, and poor public health. Opportunities are limited in metropolitan core counties, where the large majority of Hispanic children live, and the movement of immigrant families from traditional gateways to new destinations provides little to children in terms of exposure to more opportunity.

AB  - Landslides are a worldwide occurring hazard that can produce economic impact and even fatalities. The collection and monitoring of data regarding active landslides are important for predicting future landslides in that region, and is critical to minimize the losses caused. In the expanding metropolitan area of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, drastic changes of land use and increasement of construction zones represent a current evolution issue. The urban sprawl phenomenon imposed the expansion of the city limits and outside the old built-up area, and due to the hilly terrain and geomorphology, natural hazards such as landslides and erosion processes are susceptible to appearance or reactivation. The study incorporates interdisciplinary research composed of evaluation of a landslide susceptible hotspot located in an area of interest to the municipality by means of geodetic and topographic precise measurements, combined with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) monitoring of surface movement and GIS spatial analysis. The data obtained in a span of over two years reveal that the investigated slope is subjected to a shallow active landslide of a few centimeters per year, and based on the 64 individual placed landmarks the highest displacement value was 67 mm. Through geomatic tools the exchange rate of the slope surface was evaluated with comprehensive volume calculations, such as displacement, erosion, and accumulation that illustrate a volume of material displaced of 107.2 m(3) and the accumulated one of 55.7 m(3). The results provide valuable insight into the complex landslide and erosion dynamics that are crucial when predicting future movements and prevention measures.

AB  - Riverine bacterioplankton are highly responsive to river alterations and their abundant and rare subcommunities may have different roles in biogeochemical cycling. However, with the rapid development of dam constructions, our knowledge on adaptation mechanism of these sub-communities in regulated river ecosystem was still limited, especially with regard to their functional traits. Here, our study was conducted in the 2800 km Yarlung Tsangpo River on the Tibetan Plateau to address the question of how abundant and rare bacterioplankton would respond taxonomically and functionally to river damming using 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with Geochip microarray technique. Our results showed that abundant sub-community dominated taxonomic composition while rare sub-community largely determined functional composition. It is also observed that taxonomic diversity of abundant sub-community was significantly stimulated in the reservoir while that of rare sub-community was markedly inhibited. Moreover, abundant sub-community exhibited functional redundancy under damming disturbances since altered taxonomic composition and unaltered functional composition co-occurred simultaneously. Meanwhile, due to portfolio effect, rare sub-community maintained a greater stability under damming disturbances with little variation in taxonomic and functional compositions. In addition, the Stegen null model analysis revealed that stochastic process governed community assembly in both abundant and rare sub-communities. However, according to source tracking analysis, the taxonomic dispersion of abundant sub-community was less significantly impeded by the dam while the functional dispersion of rare sub-community was less strongly interrupted, indicating that the dispersal process in the dominated sub-community was less susceptible to damming. Therefore, by considering bacterioplankton functional traits, our study provided comprehensive evidences for the distinct strategies of abundant and rare subcommunities in response to damming.

AB  - In the urban traffic research field, taxi detour behavior analysis can he regarded as one of the most crucial and challenging topics accounting for real-world routing network dynamics with complicated external inducement such as "avoiding congestion sections", "unfamiliarity with road maps" or just "earning more fee under a longer travel path". We carried out an interdisciplinary research framework to build a more holistic and profound view of the spatio-temporal distribution of the taxi detour behavior at directional road segment (DRS) level. First, a map matching based detour clustering method was proposed to deal with one week of taxi GPS tracing (divided into 3.4 million occupied trips). Then we employed an established multi-layer road index system in Shenzhen, China, to illustrate the spatio-temporal distribution variation of taxi detour features and statistics. Furthermore, three categories of DRS factors related to road structural attributes, traffic dynamics and pointof-interests (POIs) were defined to fit a selected-sample-based binary logit model. Some remarkable findings include: (i) in Shenzhen on average, 23.5 percent of taxi trips made a detour larger than 2.1 kilometers, which could be astonishingly high considering that only a very few trips yielded formal complaints for fraudulent detouring; (ii) both the level of detour intensity and ratio are affected by road features and dynamics in different spatio-temporal interaction patterns.

AB  - Objectives
   To evaluate the impact of anti-malaria biological larviciding with Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis on non-primary target mosquito species in a rural African setting.
   Methods
   A total of 127 villages were distributed in three study arms, each with different larviciding options in public spaces: i) no treatment, ii) full or iii) guided intervention. Geographically close villages were grouped in clusters to avoid contamination between treated and untreated villages. Adult mosquitoes were captured in light traps inside and outside houses during the rainy seasons of a baseline and an intervention year. After enumeration, a negative binomial regression was used to determine the reductions achieved in the different mosquito species through larviciding.
   Results
   Malaria larviciding interventions showed only limited or no impact against Culex mosquitoes; by contrast, reductions of up to 34% were achieved against Aedes when all detected breeding sites were treated. Culex mosquitoes were captured in high abundance in semi-urban settings while more Aedes were found in rural villages.
   Conclusions
   Future malaria larviciding programs should consider expanding onto the breeding habitats of other disease vectors, such as Aedes and Culex and evaluate their potential impact. Since the major cost components of such interventions are labor and transport, other disease vectors could be targeted at little additional cost.

AB  - The Borderlands Earth Care Youth (BECY) Institute is an example of hands-on environmental education where high school students engage with restoration. BECY inspires and trains the next generation of land stewards by hiring borderland youth to restore their home watersheds. The 12-person youth crews, currently located in two rural communities just north of the U.S./Mexico border, are paid to implement hands-on restoration, utilizing science-based techniques, to return biodiversity to the landscape and urban binational communities. During its 8-year program, BECY interns have been hired to refill plummeting groundwater tables, stabilize dwindling native pollinator populations, revegetate barren landscapes, arrest erosion, link fragmented wildlife corridors, and support sustainable food systems. Each BECY crew is led by two young adults, ages 21 to 26, who are graduates of the program. Restoration projects are completed in collaboration with local conservation professionals working in careers accessible to local youth. Along with tiered near-peer mentorship, BECY crews develop leadership and team-building skills while learning critical concepts in watershed, ecosystem, and food system restoration. Youth interns graduate from the BECY crew by completing independent restoration projects and presenting a report of their project at a community graduation ceremony. Through prolonged contact with restoration professionals across the Sky Island Restoration Collaborative, BECY has bridged a gap in establishing viable restoration-based economies in multiple underserved rural border communities, with the goal of catalyzing an ethic of cross-border land stewardship for generations into the future.

AB  - Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is an invasive wood-boring pest of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in the United States. It is responsible for catastrophic decline of ash in urban and forested ecosystems, resulting in millions of dollars in economic losses. Biological control is one of the most promising management options available to reduce A. planipennis spread and impact. From 2015 to 2017, two larval parasitoids from the native range of A. planipennis, Spathius galinae Belokobylskij & Strazenac (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), were released in forested areas in New York and Connecticut. The purpose of this study was to measure the spread and seasonal phenology of these introduced parasitoids. From May to September 2020, sentinel ash logs containing EAB larvae were deployed in naturally occurring A. planipennis infested trees at each release site and at 2 km intervals up to 14 km away from the release site. Logs were replaced every two weeks and the parasitization rate was recorded. Each month, three trees from each release area were also cut and debarked to record A. planipennis infestation levels, natural parasitization rates, and A. planipennis and parasitoid phenology. We observed that both S. galinae and T. planipennisi emerged from the logs first deployed from the end of May to early June. Parasitization peaked in late July and mid-August, with sentinel logs deployed at each distance producing both species throughout the summer until mid-September. Both S. galinae and T. planipennisi were detected 14 km away from the release sites, the greatest distance away from the release sites sampled. Debarked trees produced similar seasonal patterns of parasitism. Our results indicate that the classical biological control program initiated several years ago has successfully produced a self-sustaining population of both S. galinae and T. planipennisi, which have been spreading widely and attacking the borer throughout the growing season. These findings strongly suggest that future release efforts may allow for wider temporal release windows and larger strategic spacing of release points across geographic regions.

AB  - Arboviruses including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya are amongst the most significant public health concerns worldwide. Arbovirus control relies on the use of insecticides to control the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus), the success of which is threatened by widespread insecticide resistance.The work presented here profiled the gene expression of Ae. aegypti larvae from field populations of Ae. aegypti with differential susceptibility to temephos originating from two Colombian urban locations, Bello and Ciicuta, previously reported to have distinctive disease incidence, socioeconomics, and climate. We demonstrated that an exclusive fieldto-lab (Ae. aegypti strain New Orleans) comparison generates an over estimation of differential gene expression (DGE) and that the inclusion of a geographically relevant field control yields a more discrete, and likely, more specific set of genes. The composition of the obtained DGE profiles is varied, with commonly reported resistance associated genes including detoxifying enzymes having only a small representation. We identify cuticle biosynthesis, ion exchange homeostasis, an extensive number of long noncoding RNAs, and chromatin modelling among the differentially expressed genes in field resistant Ae. aegypti larvae. It was also shown that temephos resistant larvae undertake further gene expression responses when temporarily exposed to temephos. The results from the sampling triangulation approach here contribute a discrete DGE profiling with reduced noise that permitted the observation of a greater gene diversity, increasing the number of potential targets for the control of insecticide resistant mosquitoes and widening our knowledge base on the complex phenotypic network of the Ae. aegypti response to insecticides.

AB  - Rivers are assumed to be one of the major conduits for plastics entering the sea, but little is known about the interchange of plastic litter between rivers and coastal waters. We measured the amount of litter stranding on the beach around the mouth of a seasonal river in Cape Town, South Africa, to infer litter dispersal distances. Prior to the mouth opening, litter was fairly uniformly distributed along the 2.4 km study beach. Once the mouth was opened for the first major winter storm, most litter stranded within 0.5 km of the river mouth. Beach litter loads peaked during rain events and decreased after the first rainfall event, presumably due to flushing of accumulated litter in the coastal wetland. However, litter loads within the wetland remained high, indicating that only a proportion of litter flushes during floods. Experimental deployments of marked litter items confirmed that most floating litter strands close to the mouth, although less buoyant items travelled farther than more buoyant items. Exchanges occurred in both directions, with marine litter found up to 1.2 km inland in the estuary. On a rising tide, more litter items moved into the estuary than into the sea, despite strong offshore winds. Our results illustrate the complex interplay of litter between rivers and the sea, and suggest that a large proportion of floating litter carried down small rivers washes ashore shortly after entering the sea. Cleaning beaches around river mouths, especially after rain events, will help to reduce leakage of plastic from land-based sources into the sea.

AB  - Over the past few years, studies in political ecology and environmental justice have been increasingly connecting the commons and social movements empirically, giving shape to a new, distinctive body of research on commons movements. In our review, we first organize and synthesize empirical lessons from this body of literature. We then highlight recent theoretical efforts made by scholars to both bridge and transcend the gap between the theory of the commons and social movement theory. As we illustrate, movements can help create and strengthen commons institutions and discourses, as well as rescale them horizontally and vertically. This is particularly evident in the context of rural community-rights movements in the global South, as well as in new water and food commons movements and community energy movements in both the global South and North. Commons institutions, in turn, can serve as the basis of social mobilization and become a key frame for social movements, as shown in the context of local environmental justice and livelihoods conflicts and anti-privatization struggles. Tensions and contradictions of commons-movement dynamics also exist and reflect trade-offs between diversity versus uniformization and organizational closure versus expansion of discourses and practices. Theoretically, there is an opportunity to cross boundaries from the theory of the commons to social movement theory and vice versa, e.g., by highlighting the role of political opportunities and framing, and biophysical factors and polycentricity, respectively. More importantly, a new commons movements theory is emerging focusing on cross-scalar organizations, the virtuous cycles between commons projects and mobilization, and the processes of commons-making.

AB  - Underground coal mining activities and ground movement are directly correlated, and coal mining-induced ground movement can cause damage to property and resources, thus its monitoring is essential for the safety and economics of a city. Fangezhuang coal mine is one of the largest coalfields in operation in Tangshan, China. The enormous amount of coal extraction has resulted in significant ground movement over the years. These phenomena have produced severe damages to the local infrastructure. This paper uses the finite difference method (FDM) 3D model and the stacking interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method to monitor the ground movement in Fangezhuang coalfield during 2016. The FDM 3D model used calibrated Fangezhuang geological parameters and the satellite InSAR analysis involved the use of ascending C-band Sentinel-1A interferometric wide (IW) data for 2016. The results show that the most prominent subsidence signal occurs in mining panel 2553N and the area between panel 2553N and fault F0 with subsidence up to 57 cm. The subsidence observed for the FDM 3D model and stacking InSAR to monitor land deformation under the influence of fault are in close agreement and were verified using a two-sample t-test. It was observed that the maximum subsidence point shifted towards the fault location from the centre of the mining panel. The tectonic fault F0 was found to be reactivated by the coal mining and controls the spatial extent of the observed ground movement. The impact of dominant geological faults on local subsidence boundaries is investigated in details. It is concluded that ground movement in the study area was mainly induced by mining activities, with its spatial pattern being controlled by geological faults. These results highlight that the two methods are capable of measuring mining induced ground movement in fault dominated areas. The study will improve the understanding of subsidence control, and aid in developing preventive measures in Fangezhuang coalfield with fault reactivation.

AB  - Objectives: To assess prevalence and perception of sleep paralysis and its relationship with socioeconomic determinants, and risk factors in a cross-sectional sample of Saudi general population from Al-Ahsa city.
   Methods: A cross-sectional sampling survey was conducted during 2020 to 2021. The targets were aged above 18 and belonged to Al-Ahsa. Patients were sent self-reported anonymous questionnaires to complete.
   Results: A total of 524 participants, whose ages ranged from 18 to 60 years, were analyzed. Among 85.7% of participants aged 55 years and over, compared to 65.8% of those who were aged under 35, 379 (72.3%) respondents were females. Moreover, 438 (83.6%) participants were university graduates, 271 (51.7%) were students and 40.8% had psychological disorders including anxiety (25.2%) and depression (5.7%). Family history of sleep paralysis was reported by 369 (70.4%) participants. A total of 97.5% study participants were aware of sleep paralysis.
   Conclusion: Sleep paralysis is a common occurrence in people residing in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. A considerable number of the society held wrong beliefs regarding sleep paralysis. Therefore, raising public of identity of sleep paralysis is crucial. We recommend applying the study in other cities within Saudi Arabia to identify common risk factors and perceptions among the society.

AB  - Background
   Dengue is the most rapidly spreading vector-borne disease globally, with a 30-fold increase in global incidence over the last 50 years. In Bhutan, dengue incidence has been on the rise since 2004, with numerous outbreaks reported across the country. The aim of this study was to identify and map areas that are vulnerable to dengue in Bhutan.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We conducted a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) using a weighted linear combination (WLC) to obtain a vulnerability map of dengue. Risk factors (criteria) were identified and assigned with membership values for vulnerability according to the available literature. Sensitivity analysis and validation of the model was conducted to improve the robustness and predictive ability of the map. Our study revealed marked differences in geographical vulnerability to dengue by location and season. Low-lying areas and those located along the southern border were consistently found to be at higher risk of dengue. The vulnerability extended to higher elevation areas including some areas in the Capital city Thimphu during the summer season. The higher risk was mostly associated with relatively high population density, agricultural and built-up landscapes and relatively good road connectivity.
   Conclusions
   Using MCDA, our study identified vulnerable areas in Bhutan during specific seasons when and where the transmission of dengue is most likely to occur. This study provides evidence for the National Vector-borne Disease Control programme to optimize the use of limited public health resources for surveillance and vector control, to mitigate the public health threat of dengue.
   Author summary
   Dengue is an important vector-borne viral disease affecting humans. In Bhutan, dengue incidence is on the rise with increased frequency of outbreaks and spread to new areas. Outbreaks were reported from places as high as above 900m above sea level in recent years. However, dengue control activities in Bhutan are usually initiated at the time of outbreaks. This often leads to a large number of cases and overburden the health system. To address these issues, we developed dengue risk maps at a fine spatial resolution by combining risk factors that mediate the transmission of dengue using a weighted linear combination. Vulnerability to dengue was spatially heterogeneous and varied by season. Dengue is highly vulnerable in low-lying areas throughout the season. However, the vulnerability extended to higher geographical elevations including the nation's capital during the summer season. The study provides a firm evidence-base to prioritize areas and seasons for dengue control strategies in Bhutan.

AB  - Plastic litter is accumulating in ecosystems worldwide. Rivers are a major source of plastic litter to oceans. However, rivers also retain and transform plastic pollution. While methods for calculating particle transport dynamics in rivers are well established, they are infrequently used to quantify the transport and retention of microplastics (i.e., particles < 5 mm) in flowing waters. Measurements of microplastic movement in rivers are needed for a greater understanding of the fate of plastic litter at watershed and global scales, and to inform pollution prevention strategies. Our objectives were to (1) quantify the abundance of microplastics within different river habitats and (2) adapt organic matter "spiraling" metrics to measure microplastic transport concurrent with fine particulate organic matter (FPOM). We quantified microplastic and FPOM abundance across urban river habitats (i.e., surface water, water column, benthos), and calculated downstream particle velocity, index of retention, turnover rate, and spiraling length for both particle types. Microplastic standing stock was assessed using a habitat-specific approach, and estimates were scaled up to encompass the study reach. Spatial distribution of particles demonstrated that microplastics and FPOM were retained together, likely by hydrodynamic forces that facilitate particle sinking or resuspension. Microplastic particles had a higher downstream particle velocity and lower index of retention relative to FPOM, suggesting that microplastics were retained to a lesser degree than FPOM in the study reaches. Microplastics also showed lower turnover rates and longer spiraling lengths relative to FPOM, attributed to the slow rates of plastic degradation. Thus, rivers are less retentive of microplastics than FPOM, although both particles are retained in similar locations. Because microplastics are resistant to degradation, individual particles can be transported longer distances prior to mineralization than FPOM, making it likely that microplastic particles will encounter larger bodies of water and interact with various aquatic biota in the process. These empirical assessments of particle transport will be valuable for understanding the fate and transformation of microplastic particles in freshwater resources and ultimately contribute to the refinement of global plastic budgets.

AB  - This paper addresses the sector of VFR tourism: visiting friends and relatives (VFR). The hypothesis is that tourism based on social ties facilitates integration in terms of social interaction and social identification in the destination, in this case the city of Buenos Aires. The concept itself of VFR tourism is dealt with together with a description and attempted characterisation of the exact movement of this type of tourism over the last few years as a result of migratory movements with emphasis on social ties and practices. The emphasis is on the degree of social integration and identification occurring in this type of tourism. The methodology used is qualitative, based on semi-structured interviews of key agents and is complemented with statistics designed to give fuller access to the comprehension of the context.

AB  - In Urban Planning (UP), it is necessary to take under serious consideration the inhibitors of the spread of a settlement in a specific direction. This means that all those parameters for which serious problems may arise in the future should be considered. Among these parameters are geo-hazards, such as floods, landslides, mud movement, etc. This study deals with UP taking into account the possibility of widespread flooding in settlement expansion areas. There is a large flooding history in Greece, which is accompanied by a significant number of disasters in different types of land use/land cover, with a large financial cost of compensation and/or rehabilitation. The study area is the drainage basin of Erasinos River in the Attica Region, where many and frequent flood events have been recorded. The main goal of this study is to determine the flood susceptibility of the study area, taking into account possible factors that are decisive in flood occurrence. Furthermore, the flood susceptibility is also determined, taking into account the scenarios of precipitation and the urban sprawl scenario in the area of reference. The study of flood events uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model and the urban sprawl model SLEUTH, which calibrates historical urban growth, using open and cost-free data and software. Eventually, flood susceptibility maps were overlaid with future urban areas to find the vulnerable areas. Following, three scenarios of flood susceptibility with the corresponding susceptibility maps and vulnerability maps, which measure the flood susceptibility of the current and future urban space of the study area, are presented. The results have shown significant peaks in the moderate class of flood susceptibility, while, in the third scenario, high values of flood susceptibility seem to appear. The proposed methodology and specifically the output maps can serve as a decision support tool to assist urban planners and hazard managers in making informed decisions towards sustainable urban planning.

AB  - The emergence of the Occupy movements along with other social movements in 2011 elevated the idea of radically decentralized "leaderless" social movement organizations. We argue that looking at such an alternative, horizontalist form of organizing presents an opportunity to reframe how we understand leadership. This paper illustrates how the coordination of the Occupy London movement was accomplished horizontally in the absence of formal organization, leadership, or authority structures. Using an ethnographic approach, we show how this movement generated a "multimodal" repertoire of protest that included (1) the politically effective occupation of urban space; (2) the ability to deploy symbols as compelling forms of aesthetic questioning; and (3) the creation of politically charged spectacles that allowed the movement to appropriate the news agendas of established broadcast media. The findings of this paper challenge the language of leadership and contribute to understandings of feminist forms of leadership and leaderless organizing by explaining one way that "leadership" occurs in horizontal organizational structures such as social movements. Namely we demonstrate how the modes of space, symbols, and spectacles effectively replace the role of "leader" in the absence of formal organizational structures.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to focus on the structural integrity of the rainwater propeller pumps installed in the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WTP). Design/methodology/approach A numerical analysis is performed to determine the maximum shear stress on the fasten bolts. The rainwater propeller pump is examined in operation at normal conditions and when one blade is progressively blocked. Findings The failure mechanism of the rainwater pump impeller is determined. Research limitations/implications The fibbers and wastes are discharged together with rainwater during storms with these types of pumps to avoid the flood of the WTP. Several catastrophic events have occurred in service due to the fibbers clog the gap between the impeller blades and the pump casing. The clogging process is partially understood so actual technical solutions deal with effects rather the main causes. Practical implications The operation time of all seven rainwater pumps installed in Timisoara's WTP is investigated. Climate changes in Banat region and new waste properties found in the wastewater require appropriate technical solutions. A technical solution is proposed based on these investigations to extend the operation time and to diminish the operation and maintenance costs. Social implications These large pumps are installed in the urban sewage centralised system implemented in the most cities. The access to the sewerage network is a requirement of any community, regardless of the social status. Originality/value The fracture surfaces of both fastening bolts of the rainwater pump impellers produced in service are examined. As a result, it has been identified that the catastrophic events are due to the brittle fracture of both fasten bolts between the impeller blades and the pump hub, respectively. The catastrophic events of the rainwater propeller pumps are directly correlated to the clog level of the impeller. The numerical simulation is performed to determine the maximum shear stress on the fasten bolts. The case with pump operating at normal conditions is performed identifying its vulnerabilities to clog conditions. Next, one impeller blade is progressively blocked considering three time stop scenarios associated with different clog levels. Conclusively, the operating time of the rainwater pump up to the catastrophic failure is correlated to the clog level of the impeller.

AB  - On 21 October 2016, an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 (determined using the Japan Meteorological Agency's [JMA] seismic network) occurred in the center of Japan's Tottori Prefecture. In the city of Kurayoshi and in the towns of Yurihama and Hokuei, JMA seismic intensities of lower 6.0 were observed, and structural damage to housing was concentrated in a limited number of areas. This research conducted microtremor observations around damaged areas and used previous studies to estimate subsurface structures and ground motion characteristics. Low-velocity layers with an S-wave velocity of between 80 and 200 m/s were estimated at all observation sites and a tendency is present for the thickness to increase towards the coastal plains and decrease inland. In an evaluation of the relationship between ground motion characteristics and earthquake damage, researchers found that the occurrence of damage correlated to significant changes in layer thickness. Researchers believed that the damage correlates to the 2-D or 3-D effects of subsurface structures.

AB  - The planning of public transport operations is an essential component of urban transport management systems that aims to provide the most efficient, safe and effective way to support movement of people. Improving the customer journey experience is a key focus, as cities grow and sustainable public transport becomes more critical. This has led to an increased interest in Automatic Passenger Counting (APC) technologies that provide real-time estimates of occupancy in order to support better planning and customer information. The proliferation of sensors and power-efficient miniaturized computing capabilities offer a range of low-cost and versatile APC choices. However, it is important to understand the various design and implementation considerations and trade-offs of the APC technologies in the context of transport operation scenarios they are deployed in. In this paper, we present outcomes of a field study that evaluated the four APC solutions video, floor-based sensing, WiFi and Infrared sensing. We present an evaluations methodology that authentically captures operating conditions while providing a robust way to assess APC solutions. While most technologies achieve over 70% accuracy in some settings, the differences between weekend trips with longer legs and weekday services with short distances between stops lead to stark variations in the performances.

AB  - The radical revolution 1910-1917 in Mexico, gave rise to a powerful conservative movement, supported by the masses in regions where revolutionary changes had conflicting results, contributing to the formation of a kind of Mexican "Vendee". Such a region was the center of the country - Bajio, which became the scene of sharp clashes in the 1920s, which resulted in the civil war of the cristeros, who raised their arms after the adoption of anti-church legislation. After the defeat of the cristeros, the leadership in confronting the revolutionary government shifted to the Synarchist movement, which rejected violence as a form of political struggle. Synarchism in the 1930s - 1940s turned into the most influential and massive political force of the opposition, representing integralist Catholicism, hispanism, traditionalism in ideology and a combination of totalitarian practices with the rejection of the struggle for power. The movement declared itself a "crusade" against world Jewry, liberalism and communism, felt itself a messianic asceticism. It was able to mobilize, under millenarian slogans, the masses of the peasant and urban population of Mexico. The Synarchists embarked on their utopian social project for a truly Catholic society through the creation of the colony "Maria Auxiliadora" in Baja California. More than a thousand Synarchists took part in this venture. The collapse of this project and changes in the political situation in the country at the end of the 1940s led to the decline of the movement, and then its ban by the authorities. This work is devoted to the analysis of the ideology and political practice of Synarchismo, which occupied an important place in the history of the conservative popular movement in Latin America, and in Mexico in particular, in the 20th century.

AB  - Author summary
   Chikungunya is an emerging mosquito-borne disease in many parts of the world, with a high morbidity burden. Fluctuations in human density and mobility are important drivers of epidemics, particularly in the context of large cities in low- and middle-income countries, which can act to amplify and spread local epidemics. Here, we first describe the epidemiology of chikungunya in Dhaka, Bangladesh, one of the largest megacities in the world, during an outbreak in 2017. Using data from a household survey, we estimate a much higher attack rate than suggested by official case counts. We then use estimates of population movement from mobile phone data for over 4 million subscribers, to understand the role of human mobility on the spatial spread of chikungunya. We show that regular population fluxes around Dhaka city played a significant role in determining disease risk, and that travel during the Eid holidays likely spread the infection to the rest of the country. Our results show the impact of large-scale population movements, particularly during holidays, on the spread of infectious diseases, and highlight the value of real-time data from mobile phones for outbreak analysis and forecasting.
   Background
   Several large outbreaks of chikungunya have been reported in the Indian Ocean region in the last decade. In 2017, an outbreak occurred in Dhaka, Bangladesh, one of the largest and densest megacities in the world. Population mobility and fluctuations in population density are important drivers of epidemics. Measuring population mobility during outbreaks is challenging but is a particularly important goal in the context of rapidly growing and highly connected cities in low- and middle-income countries, which can act to amplify and spread local epidemics nationally and internationally.
   Methods
   We first describe the epidemiology of the 2017 chikungunya outbreak in Dhaka and estimate incidence using a mechanistic model of chikungunya transmission parametrized with epidemiological data from a household survey. We combine the modeled dynamics of chikungunya in Dhaka, with mobility estimates derived from mobile phone data for over 4 million subscribers, to understand the role of population mobility on the spatial spread of chikungunya within and outside Dhaka during the 2017 outbreak.
   Results
   We estimate a much higher incidence of chikungunya in Dhaka than suggested by official case counts. Vector abundance, local demographics, and population mobility were associated with spatial heterogeneities in incidence in Dhaka. The peak of the outbreak in Dhaka coincided with the annual Eid holidays, during which large numbers of people traveled from Dhaka to other parts of the country. We show that travel during Eid likely resulted in the spread of the infection to the rest of the country.
   Conclusions
   Our results highlight the impact of large-scale population movements, for example during holidays, on the spread of infectious diseases. These dynamics are difficult to capture using traditional approaches, and we compare our results to a standard diffusion model, to highlight the value of real-time data from mobile phones for outbreak analysis, forecasting, and surveillance.

AB  - Satellite images taken on the earth's surface are analyzed to identify the spatial and temporal changes that have occurred naturally or manmade. Real-time prediction of change provides an understanding related to the land cover, environmental changes, habitat fragmentation, coastal alteration, urban sprawl, etc. In the current study, various digital change detection approaches and their constituent methods are presented. It was found that (i) change vector analysis method provides better accuracy among the algebra-based change detection approach, (ii) discrete wavelet transformation is better among transformation techniques, (iii) considering the artificial neural network and fuzzy-based approaches to analyze the prediction performance over the traditional state-ofthe-art approaches, (iv) analyzing the promising outcomes generated by deep learning techniques for difference analysis related to the images captured at a different instance of time. The brief outlines of different change detection approaches are discussed in this study and addressed the need for improvement in the methods that are developed for the detection of a change in the remote sensing community.

AB  - Wildlife strongly alter behaviour in response to human disturbance; however, fundamental questions remain regarding the influence of human infrastructure and activity on animal movement. The Covid-19 pandemic created a natural experiment providing an opportunity to evaluate wildlife movement during a period of greatly reduced human activity. Speculation in scientific reviews and the media suggested that wildlife might be increasing movement and colonizing urban landscapes during pandemic slowdowns. However, theory predicts that animals should move and use space as efficiently as possible, suggesting that movement might actually be reduced relative to decreased human activity. We quantified space use, movement, and resource-selection of 12 GPS-collared mountain lions (eight females, four males) occupying parklands in greater Los Angeles during the Spring 2020 California stay-at-home order when human activity was far below normal. We also tested the hypothesis that reduced traffic on Los Angeles area roadways increased permeability of these barriers to animal movement. Contrary to expectations that wildlife roamed more widely during pandemic shutdowns, resident mountain lions used smaller areas and moved shorter distances relative to their historical behaviour in greater Los Angeles. They also relaxed avoidance of anthropogenic landscape features such as trails and development, which likely facilitated increased travelling efficiency. However, there was no detectable change in road-crossing, despite reduced traffic volume. Our results support the theoretical prediction that animals maximize movement efficiency and suggest that carnivores incur energetic costs while avoiding humans. While mountain lions may restrict movement at the landscape level relative to barriers, they appear to increase distances moved at finer scales when avoiding human activity - highlighting the scale-dependent nature of animal responses to human disturbance. Avoiding humans can reduce direct mortality of large carnivores and is often suggested to be an important mechanism promoting coexistence in shared landscapes. However, energetic costs incurred by increased movement and space-use while avoiding human activity may have important consequences for population viability, predator-prey interactions, community structure, and human-wildlife conflict. Management providing sufficient wild prey and education regarding best practices for protection of domestic animals are important for conserving large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - As one of the most populated metropolitan areas in the world, the Tokyo Metropolitan Area (TMA) has experienced severe climatic modifications and pressure due to densified human activities and urban expansion. The surface urban heat island (SUHI) phenomenon particularly constitutes a significant threat to human comfort and geo-environmental health in TMA. This study aimed to profile the spatial interconnections between land surface temperature (LST) and land cover/use in TMA from 2001 to 2015 using multi-source spatial data. To this end, the thermal gradients between the urban and non-urban fabric areas in TMA were examined by joint analysis of land cover/use and LST. The spatiotemporal aggregation patterns, variations, and movement trajectories of SUHI intensity in TMA were identified and delineated. The spatial relationship between SUHI and the potential driving forces in TMA was clarified using geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis. The results show that the thermal environment of TMA exhibited a polynucleated spatial structure with multiple thermal island cores. Overall, the magnitude and extent of SUHI in TMA increased and expanded from 2001 to 2015. During that time, SUHIs clustered in the compact residential quarters and redevelopment/renovation areas rather than downtown. The GWR models showed better performance than ordinary least squares (OLS) models, with Adj R-2 > 0.9, indicating that the magnitude of SUHI significantly depended on its neighboring geographical setting, including land cover composition and configuration, population size, and terrain. We suggest that UHI mitigation in Tokyo should be focused on alleviating the magnitude of persistent thermal cores and controlling unstable SUHI occurrence based on partitioned or location-specific landscape design. This study's findings have immense implications for SUHI mitigation in metropolitan areas situated in bay regions.

AB  - Conventional approaches for modeling human mobility pattern often focus on human activity and movement dynamics in their regular daily lives and cannot capture changes in human movement dynamics in response to large-scale events. With the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies, many researchers have adopted alternative data sources (e.g., cell phone records, GPS trajectory data) from private data vendors to study human movement dynamics in response to large-scale natural or societal events. Big geosocial data such as georeferenced tweets are publicly available and dynamically evolving as real-world events are happening, making it more likely to capture the real-time sentiments and responses of populations. However, precisely-geolocated geosocial data is scarce and biased toward urban population centers. In this research, we developed a big geosocial data analytical framework for extracting human movement dynamics in response to large-scale events from publicly available georeferenced tweets. The framework includes a two-stage data collection module that collects data in a more targeted fashion in order to mitigate the data scarcity issue of georeferenced tweets; in addition, a variable bandwidth kernel density estimation(VB-KDE) approach was adopted to fuse georeference information at different spatial scales, further augmenting the signals of human movement dynamics contained in georeferenced tweets. To correct for the sampling bias of georeferenced tweets, we adjusted the number of tweets for different spatial units (e.g., county, state) by population. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed analytic framework, we chose an astronomical event that occurred nationwide across the United States, i.e., the 2017 Great American Eclipse, as an example event and studied the human movement dynamics in response to this event. However, this analytic framework can easily be applied to other types of large-scale events such as hurricanes or earthquakes.

AB  - In the present work the youth activism in the place of the Platform of Affected by the Mortgage of Lleida between the years 2014 and 2017 is analysed. It seeks to understand, on the one hand, how the increase in youth participation modifies the movement itself. Observe how the mobilization dynamics that emerge from the 15M are contested in the PAH through the young people studied who promote an increase in actions and an increase in direct action as a form of protest. With this, they seek to (re)signify the forms of protest made hegemonic through the 15M and recover other political practices. On the other hand, the internal changes that are taking place in the PAH show the presence of power relations and groups in conflict within the movement, which change depending on the different accumulations of militant capital. Finally, the movement, as a consequence of the increase in youth participation and the change in the mobilization dynamics, comes to occupy a less central place within the space of the city's social movements.

AB  - Built in Nancy (Meurthe-et-Moselle French department) between 1925 and 1934 by the architect Jean-Frederic Wielhorski (1874-1942), the current lycee Paul-Louis Cyffle originally housed an upper primary school for boys before it became, much later on, a vocational high school that prepared students for occupations in the graphic industry. Established in 1833 by the Guizot Law, the upper primary schools, dedicated to general and vocational education, did not flourished until the 1880's within the context of the votes on the Ferry Laws. The municipality of Nancy, in a movement of urban renewal, decided in the aftermath of the First World War to build a new school specialised in technical education on the convent of the Visitation site located in a poor neighbourhood at the doorstep of the city centre. At the time, it was a period of Art Deco-style major construction projects in Nancy, many of the private sponsors chose that new style. Influenced by the designs that came from the Exposition des arts decoratifs, "the decorative arts Exhibition" held in Paris in 1925, the future city architect Jean-Frederic Wielhorski, keen on collages and mixtures of styles peculiar to the eclectic spirit, set up a project that claimed to be ambitious in its scale and modern in its decor. The hybrid architecture, with its tempered modernity consistent with the post-war conservatism of a provincial municipality, has made the lycee Paul-Louis Cyffle a singular building in the architectural production of the inter-war period in Nancy, as well as one of the rare examples of Art Deco school architecture in the Grand-Est region, for whose quality it received the "Outstanding contemporary architecture" label in 2015.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to assess whether Tukad Bindu, Bali, Indonesia is a good example of ecotourism or practice in greenwashing. Design/methodology/approach The characteristics of ecotourism to assess Tukad Bindu were identified through a review of the existing literature. This study used Honey's argument to determine these characteristics and supplemented them with other experts' views to understand the global and local contexts of ecotourism. Primary data were collected from interviews with stakeholders and observations. The Tukad Bindu Foundation provided secondary data. Findings This study reveals that Tukad Bindu is a good example of ecotourism because it involves travelling to natural destinations. It reduces the negative effects of tourism activities - specifically environmental - thereby raising environmental awareness among local communities, tourists and the public at large. Tukad Bindu produces direct financial benefits for conservation, for empowering local communities and providing financial benefits, reverence for local cultures and positively influences the democratic movement, especially strengthening stakeholders' participation in ecotourism. Research limitations/implications To accelerate the development of Tukad Bindu as an ecotourism destination, research on factors that enable and obstruct ecotourism development is required. This will help the foundation and stakeholders to develop strategies that can achieve the goals of conservation, local communities' livelihoods and environmental education. Practical implications This study also has practical implications in terms of managing environmental activities, enriching Tukad Bindu's biodiversity and attractions, and maintaining ecotourism sustainability. Originality/value Tukad Bindu has applied unique ecotourism practices, in terms of developing and ownership of protected areas. While Honey's framework of ecotourism is beneficial to elaborate on the nature of ecotourism, the characteristics in this framework are not mutually exclusive in the case of Tukad Bindu. This study also has practical implications in terms of managing environmental activities, enriching Tukad Bindu's biodiversity and attractions, and maintaining ecotourism sustainability.

AB  - Road construction fragments the landscape, reduces connectivity, and drives land use changes. To our knowledge, little is known about the scope and intensity of the effects of cross-border roads on changes in land use. Here, with the land use data products provided by the US Agency for International Development's SERVIR Mekong project, using the GIS-based spatial analysis to quantitatively analyze and compare the effects of the cross-border road on land use changes within a 30 km buffer area along the Kunming-Bangkok Highway between Laos and Thailand. The results show the following: The greater the distance was from the highway, the smaller were the overall changes in land use within the buffer zone. A comparison of the situation before and after the road was opened in 2013 revealed significant differences in the most influential land use types of agricultural expansion, i.e., from 47.07% to 52.07% (the buffer zone was 1 km). In particular, 57.32% (1381.93 ha) and 40.08% (966.46 ha) of the land occupied by forests had been converted into land for plantation and agriculture, respectively, from 2013 to 2018. The scope of the impact of the operational route on the dynamics of land use was inconsistent. The largest impact before the road became operational was within 4 km of the buffer zone (0.26 to 0.24). Once the road had been opened, the range of its impact was beyond 10 km (0.63 to 0.57). The work here can provide a scientific basis for regional transportation planning and the sustainable use of land resources.

AB  - To better understand the ecology of coldwater fishes in urban-dominated landscapes, factors influencing seasonal brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) habitat use were assessed using backpack electrofishing surveys in three urban groundwater-fed streams in central Ontario. Generalised additive models revealed that yearling brook trout (<100 mm TL) were primarily influenced by water quality (stream temperature, conductivity), while older brook trout (>= 100 mm TL) were primarily influenced by stream morphology (water depth, undercut bank volume). Colder stream temperatures were preferred by yearlings in summer, whereas they occupied the warmest temperatures available in winter and spring. Yearlings were never found in sites with high stream conductivity (>= 900 mu s/cm), regardless of season, which may be attributed to poor water quality in stream sections with stormwater influence. Older brook trout were found mainly at intermediate pool depths in spring and summer, while there was a greater range of depths used during the spawning season. Undercut banks were important for older brook trout occupancy at all times of year. The protection of groundwater aquifers in urban watersheds is recommended to maintain optimal temperature regimes for the persistence and successful recruitment of native brook trout.

AB  - COVID'19 Pandemic i.e. Novel Coronavirus Global Epidemic resulted in nearly shut down of overall business fraternity in both organised and unorganised segments globally. As there was no immediate relief for the illness governments all across globe had no other options than putting restrictions on movement of people which gradually forced for complete lockdown in high density regions especially the urban and semi-urban regions. As the business vis-a-vis logistics is symbiotic for remote villages / towns on urban infrastructure for all allied industries it also brought gradual business shutdown in villages and town. Furthermore certain cases were found in secluded areas as well henceWorld Health Organisation (WHO)gave guidelines to governments to take immediate steps to stop the outbreak, hence Indian Government called for complete Lockdown of the nation. India being an agrarian economy wherein majority business set-ups are still under private unorganised sector, The Fishery sector which comprises of widely artisanal and small scale occupational aboriginal communities those are furthermore disorganised. The Lockdown imposed had stopped all the activities of Fishery related business. The impact of same was on income and overall livelihood of fishers as well as fishing allied ecosystem. Once the government started gradually opening up the markets and activities the business seems to be getting back to normal. The study directed towards the lockdown and post lockdown business of Fishery Industry that is severely impacted due to Pandemic.

AB  - Profound biogeochemical responses of anoxic sediments to the fluctuation of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in overlaying water are often observed, despite oxygen having a limited permeability in sediments. This contradiction is indicative of previously unrecognized mechanism that bridges the oxic and anoxic sediment layers. Using sediments from an urban river suffering from long-term polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contamination, we analyzed the physicochemical and microbial responses to artificially elevated DO (eDO) in the overlying water over 9 weeks of incubation. Significant changes in key environmental parameters and microbial diversity were detected over the 0-6 cm sediment depth, along with accelerated degradation of PAHs, despite that eDO only increased the porewater DO in the millimeter subfacial layer. The dynamics of physicochemical and microbial properties coincided well with significantly increased presence of centimeter-long sulfide-oxidizing cable bacteria filaments under eDO, and were predominantly driven by cable bacteria metabolic activities. Phylogenetic ecological network analyses further revealed that eDO reinforced cable bacteria associated interspecific interactions with functional microorganisms such as sulfate reducers, PAHs degraders, and electroactive microbes, suggesting enhanced microbial syntrophy taking advantage of cable bacteria metabolism for the regeneration of SO42- and long-distance electron transfer. Together, our results suggest cable bacteria may mediate the impacts of eDO in anaerobic sediments by altering sediment physiochemical properties and by reinforcing community interactions. Our findings highlight the ecological importance of cable bacteria in sediments.

AB  - Species introduced by human activities can alter the normal functioning of ecosystems promoting negative impacts on native biodiversity, as they can rapidly expand their population size, demonstrating phenotypic plasticity and possible adaptive capacity to novel environments. Twenty years ago, the guttural toad, Sclerophrys gutturalis, was introduced to a peri-urban area of Cape Town, with cooler and drier climatic characteristics than its native source population, Durban, South Africa. Our goal was to understand the phenotypic changes, in terms of physiology and immunity, of populations in native and novel environments. We evaluated body index (BI), field hydration level, plasma corticosterone levels (CORT), proportion of neutrophils: lymphocytes (N: L), plasma bacterial killing ability (BKA), and hematocrit (HTC) in the field, and after standardized stressors (dehydration and movement restriction) in males from the native and invasive populations. Toads from the invasive population presented lower BI and tended to show a lower field hydration state, which is consistent with living in the drier environmental conditions of Cape Town. Additionally, invasive toads also showed higher BKA and N:L ratio under field conditions. After exposure to stressors, invasive animals presented higher BKA than the natives. Individuals from both populations showed increased CORT after dehydration, an intense stressor for these animals. The highest BKA and N:L ratio in the field and after submission to stressors in the laboratory shows that the invasive population has a phenotype that might increase their fitness, leading to adaptive responses in the novel environment and, thus, favoring successful dispersion and population increase.

AB  - Migration as an economic, social, and political phenomenon that indicates continuity, movement, and mobility has led to revolutionary development in museology as increased interest in different voices has enacted change. Migration has become a key concern in museums as it specifies their type or context by changing their perspectives. This paper examines the current situation of the migration concept in several countries and museums in Turkey, which are based on global examples, and compares them with contemporary equivalents. This allows the international museum community to monitor and discuss developments related to migration museums in Turkey. In Turkey, types of global migration concepts in line with contemporary museology approaches and their reflections are discussed, and types of migration museums will be classified, determined, and compared with global samples. This paper includes an overview how the approach is discussed the stories and objects which are related to migration in the scope of the migration phenomenon in the history of migration museums in Turkey. The scope of Turkey's migration museums to be built on different migration routes are also located in different regions are discussed in the research.

AB  - The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the world's most widespread member of the order Carnivora, occurring across a large range of latitudes and inhabiting multiple habitat types. There is no comprehensive study of how the diets of this flexible generalist vary across the whole Asian continent. We conducted a meta-analysis of red fox diets in Japan, examining the patterns in food type selection and their associations with seasonality, regional climate, vegetation productivity, and human influences at the national scale. Using linear mixed models, we revealed significant seasonal effects on the frequency of occurrence of mammals in general, ungulate carcasses, birds, and invertebrates in the diets of red foxes. Furthermore, the frequency of occurrence of mammals significantly decreased with mean annual temperature and increased with vegetation productivity. The frequency of invertebrate occurrences increased with temperature, and that of anthropogenic foods increased with human population density. Trophic diversity and dietary niche breadth increased with annual temperature but decreased with vegetation productivity and population density. These results suggest that the red fox is a flexible predator in Japan that adapts its foraging patterns according to variations in resource availability and abiotic conditions, while persistently consuming a certain ratio of animal prey to meet its metabolic requirements. Modifications of predators' trophic niches can influence structures of prey communities and interactions with sympatric competitors. Our findings are important for informing ecosystem management practices under ongoing environmental and social changes in Japan.

AB  - Strong historical and predicted future warming over high-latitudes prompt significant effects on agricultural and forest ecosystems. Thus, there is an urgent need for spatially-detailed information of current thermal growing season (GS) conditions and their past changes. Here, we deployed a large network of weather stations, high-resolution geospatial environmental data and semi-parametric regression to model the spatial variation in multiple GS variables (i.e. beginning, end, length, degree day sum [GDDS, base temperature + 5 degrees C]) and their intra-annual variability and temporal trends in respect to geographical location, topography, water and forest cover, and urban land use variables over northern Europe. Our analyses revealed substantial spatial variability in average GS conditions (1990-2019) and consistent temporal trends (1950-2019). We showed that there have been significant changes in thermal GS towards earlier beginnings (on average 15 days over the study period), increased length (23 days) and GDDS (287 degrees C days). By using a spatial interpolation of weather station data to a regular grid we predicted current GS conditions at high resolution (100 m x 100 m) and with high accuracy (correlation >= 0.92 between observed and predicted mean GS values), whereas spatial variation in temporal trends and interannual variability were more demanding to predict. The spatial variation in GS variables was mostly driven by latitudinal and elevational gradients, albeit they were constrained by local scale variables. The proximity of sea and lakes, and high forest cover suppressed temporal trends and inter-annual variability potentially indicating local climate buffering. The produced high-resolution datasets showcased the diversity in thermal GS conditions and impacts of climate change over northern Europe. They are valuable in various forest management and ecosystem applications, and in adaptation to climate change.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article is to underscore postcolonial approaches that undercut racial inequities as they foster racial equality and inclusivity at higher institutions of learning, especially in racialised spaces in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach This article dwells on whistleblowing as a channel of demythologising Whiteness in South African universities. While the #RhodesMustFall movement at University of Cape Town enjoyed much critical attention, concurrent movements in other universities such as Open Stellenbosch movement did not. This could be attributable to the methods used, especially whistleblowing, an unorthodox method employed to radically question university symbols, to disrupt racial superiority. In revisiting the movement's campaigns, the article specifically highlights Kylie Thomas' whistleblowing to underscore the role of humanities in fostering social transformation beginning with spaces of knowledge production such as universities. Findings The research found that challenging apartheid murals and monuments on South African institutions of higher learning required aggressive but creative approaches. This called for unmasking foundations of White supremacism. Whistle blowing and activism against White supremacism boldly confronted apartheid legacies that appear to be well preserved. Research limitations/implications The research is limited to the 2015 South African student movements. The emphasis is on Open Stellenbosch movement which has received lesser critical attention compared to #RhodesMustFall. It envisions equality, diversity and inclusion in learning institutions which is achievable only through robust activist approaches to institutional/systemic racism in the institutions, rather than armchair theorising. Originality/value This article examines ways in which unorthodox methods such as whistlelowing and activism work to disrupt regimented White supremacism in an institution of higher learning founded on racist ethos.

AB  - The article discusses the way in which a Helsinki-based flow art community negotiates resistance in terms of hippie culture, shared and embodied conventions and reclaiming the urban space. Flow art is a form of youth culture, urban creativity, community-building and spatial occupation. It is an umbrella term for different movement-based disciplines, such as juggling, dance, object manipulation (doing tricks with props such as poi, hula hoops, contact balls and dragon staffs), acrobatics, and fire-spinning. In terms of theory, the article revisits the concepts of hippie culture and resistance in youth cultural studies and discusses them in a Finnish context. In the flow art community, resistance was actualised primarily as socially shared, fluid and embodied conventions such as peer learning and teaching as well as physical closeness and hugging. The article is informed by ethnographic fieldwork done together with flow artists in Helsinki, Finland in 2017-2018.

AB  - The Olympic Charter is the binding document that rules the Olympic Movement which, among other things, has the role of managing the organization of the biggest and most complex sporting event in the world - the Olympic games. The multi-disciplinary nature of this event implies the involvement of diverse stakeholders, including hosts and respective communities that, besides having different interests, rely on each other to fulfil them. As the owner of the event, the International Olympic Committee has the role of managing these interests through the update and modification of the Olympic Charter. This paper explores the evolution of this document, taking special consideration of the influence that occurrences related with stakeholder's governance and urban strategies of hosts had on its rules. A cross-referenced review between the historical events within these two fields of study is compared to a systematic review of the Charter's evolution. The results include a timeline with eight periods identifying the progress of those relationships, showing that the Olympic Charter has had a more reactive than pro-active character: it was highly influenced by hosts and other internal and external governance issues that, together, were responsible for the addition of new rules.

AB  - Roads pose an imminent threat to wildlife directly through mortality and changes in individual behavior, and also indirectly through modification of the amount and configuration of wildlife habitat. However, few studies have addressed how these mechanisms interact to determine species response to roads. We used structural equation modeling to assess direct and indirect effects (via landscape modification) of roads on space use by jaguars in Brazil, using radio-tracking data available from the literature. We fit path models that directly link jaguars' space use to roads and to land cover, and indirectly link jaguars' space use to roads through the same land cover categories. Our findings show that space use by jaguars was not directly affected by roads, but indirect effects occurred through reductions in natural areas on which jaguars depend, and through urban sprawl. Males ' space use, however, was not negatively influenced by urban areas. Since jaguars seem to ignore roads, mitigation should be directed to road fencing and promoting safe crossings. We argue that planners and managers need to much more seriously take into account the deforestation and the unbridled urban expansion from roads to ensure jaguar conservation in Brazil.

AB  - We examine the transition in household environment condition (HEC) in India during 2004-2012 by using panel data of the India Human Development Survey. In particular, this study documents the movement of households into and out of poor HEC. We found that a higher proportion of socially deprived classes, namely, Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, and Other Backward Castes, were continued to be in or fall into poor HEC than the General Castes. The movement out of poor HEC (to middle and better-off HEC) was least observed among the underprivileged Castes than the General Castes. Similarly, households in economically poor condition and those with illiterate and primary occupation household heads were entering into or remaining more in poor HEC than their counterparts. By regions, Central and Eastern regions were either continued to be more in poor HEC or experienced the least upward movement from poor HEC to the middle and better-off condition than other regions. Findings based on multivariate logistic regression models have reinforced the results from the bivariate analyses. From a policy perspective, the findings advance that socially disadvantaged population needs greater emphasis on ongoing programs to improve household living and environmental conditions in India.

AB  - The latest encampments in public spaces, such as Occupy Wall Street, Taksim Square and Syntagma Square, have highlighted the significance of public space in shaping social, economic and political struggles around the world. In this paper, drawing on a qualitative study of Syntagma Square in Athens, Greece, we confirm that spontaneous, self-organised movements, such as the Aganaktismenoi (Indignant) movement, could function as intermediaries between protest and resistance, leading to the institution of urban practices of commoning. We argue that the innovative attributes of such movements inspire and trigger the introduction of new decision-making mechanisms, social relationships and political subjectivities and the institution of solidarity and collective forms of social reproduction. We conclude that these initiatives constitute a radicalization of political struggles and have a positive effect both in terms of increased civic participation and the emergence of new collective identities and political subjectivities.

AB  - Dengue is steadily increasing worldwide and expanding into higher latitudes. Current non-endemic areas are prone to become endemic soon. To improve understanding of dengue transmission in these settings, we assessed the spatiotemporal dynamics of the hitherto largest outbreak in the non-endemic metropolis of Buenos Aires, Argentina, based on detailed information on the 5,104 georeferenced cases registered during summer-autumn of 2016. The highly seasonal dengue transmission in Buenos Aires was modulated by temperature and triggered by imported cases coming from regions with ongoing outbreaks. However, local transmission was made possible and consolidated heterogeneously in the city due to housing and socioeconomic characteristics of the population, with 32.8% of autochthonous cases occurring in slums, which held only 6.4% of the city population. A hierarchical spatiotemporal model accounting for imperfect detection of cases showed that, outside slums, less-affluent neighborhoods of houses (vs. apartments) favored transmission. Global and local spatiotemporal point-pattern analyses demonstrated that most transmission occurred at or close to home. Additionally, based on these results, a point-pattern analysis was assessed for early identification of transmission foci during the outbreak while accounting for population spatial distribution. Altogether, our results reveal how social, physical, and biological processes shape dengue transmission in Buenos Aires and, likely, other non-endemic cities, and suggest multiple opportunities for control interventions.
   Author summary Dengue fever is mainly transmitted by a mosquito species that is highly urbanized, and lays eggs and develops mostly in artificial water containers. Dengue transmission is sustained year-round in most tropical regions of the world, but in many subtropical/temperate regions it occurs only in the warmest months. To improve understanding of dengue transmission in these regions, we analyzed one of the largest outbreaks in Buenos Aires city, a subtropical metropolis. Based on information on 5,104 georeferenced cases during summer-autumn 2016, we found that most transmission occurred in or near home, that slums had the highest risk of transmission, and that, outside slums, less-affluent neighborhoods of houses (vs. apartments) favored transmission. We showed that the cumulative effects of temperature over the previous few weeks set the temporal limits for transmission to occur, and that the outbreak was sparked by infected people arriving from regions with ongoing outbreaks. Additionally, we implemented a statistical method to identify transmission foci in real-time that improves targeting control interventions. Our results deepen the understanding of dengue transmission as a result of social, physical, and biological processes, and pose multiple opportunities for improving control of dengue and other mosquito-borne viruses such as Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever.

AB  - The yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762), is the most aggressive invasive mosquito species with worldwide distribution. In addition to being a notorious nuisance species, it can pose significant public health concern because of its ability to transmit various viral pathogens. The first adult capture in the West Valley area of San Bernardino County, CA, occurred in September 2015 in Montclair. A strategic surveillance plan was implemented accordingly by the West Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District to document the infestation. The Biogent Sentinel (BG-2) trap augmented with BG-Lure and carbon dioxide (CO2) was deployed as a routine surveillance tool during 2017-2019. Extensive trapping revealed an expanding infestation, when positive trap nights (TN) increased from 14.2% in 2017 to 23.9% in 2018 and 55.6% in 2019. The average counts/TN increased from 0.65 in 2017 and 0.90 in 2018 to 3.83 in 2019. The cities of Montclair, Chino, and Ontario had much higher infestation than other cities in the district with the highest positive TN of 46.0% in Montclair, and highest average trap count of 3.23/TN in Chino. It was interesting to note that males coincided with females with more profound trend during warmer months of July to October when ratios of males ranged 28.4-35.0%. The BG-2 trap significantly outperformed the CO2 trap and gravid trap. The establishment of this invasive species in semiarid inland Southern California was further confirmed by concurrent larval collections.

AB  - Melioidosis is a disease of significant public health importance that is being increasingly recognized globally. The majority of cases arise through direct percutaneous exposure to its etiological agent, Burkholderia pseudomallei. In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos), the presence and environmental distribution of B. pseudomallei are not well characterized, though recent epidemiological surveys of the bacterium have indicated that B. pseudomallei is widespread throughout the environment in the center and south of the country and that rivers can act as carriers and potential sentinels for the bacterium. The spatial and genetic distribution of B. pseudomallei strains within Vientiane Capital, where the majority of cases diagnosed to date have originated, remains an important knowledge gap. We sampled surface runoff from drain catchment areas throughout urban Vientiane to determine the presence and local population structure of the bacterium. B. pseudomallei was detected in drainage areas throughout the capital, indicating that it is widespread in the environment and that exposure rates in urban Vientiane are likely higher than previously thought. Whole-genome comparative analysis demonstrated that Lao B. pseudomallei isolates are highly genetically diverse, suggesting that the bacterium is well established and not a recent introduction. Despite the wide genome diversity, one environmental survey isolate was highly genetically related to a Lao melioidosis patient isolate collected 13 years prior to the study. Knowledge gained from this study will augment understanding of B. pseudomallei phylogeography in Asia and enhance public health awareness and future implementation of infection control measures within Laos.
   IMPORTANCE The environmental bacterium B. pseudomallei is the etiological agent of melioidosis, a tropical disease with one model estimating a global annual incidence of 165,000 cases and 89,000 deaths. In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos), the environmental distribution and population structure of B. pseudomallei remain relatively undefined, particularly in Vientiane Capital, where most diagnosed cases have originated. We used surface runoff as a proxy for B. pseudomallei dispersal in the environment and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to examine the local population structure. Our data confirmed that B. pseudomallei is widespread throughout Vientiane and that surface runoff might be useful for future environmental monitoring of the bacterium. B. pseudomallei isolates were also highly genetically diverse, suggesting that the bacterium is well established and endemic in Laos. These findings can be used to improve awareness of B. pseudomallei in the Lao environment and demonstrate the epidemiological and phylogeographical insights that can be gained from WGS.

AB  - Simple Summary Sustainable wildlife management (SWM), based on traditional practice supported with advances in scientific knowledge and evolving economic and social circumstances, has shaped the global approach to wildlife management and policy. In this paper, we report the findings of a large semi-structured questionnaire in China which investigated the attitude of the urban public toward sustainable wildlife management and wildlife conservation across a range of issues and identified the key socio-economic and demographic factor drivers for those attitudes. The survey was conducted from November 2018 to October 2020, across 15 cities randomly selected among China's seven administrative geographic regions. The survey was initially conducted through face-to-face interviews, but later, due to COVID-19 restrictions, was completed via online questionnaires. The results show that the public are broadly supportive of the theory of SWM, but their enthusiasm is issue- and context-dependent. For example, on issues of "Animal Welfare and Rights," "Wildlife Utilization and Captive Breeding," and "Trophy Hunting", the public demonstrate antagonistic views about SWM, demonstrating an affinity for "Compassionate Conservation". We also found that demographic characteristics of the public can significantly influence attitude, with those respondents who are not vegetarian or religious, who have higher levels of education, or are younger in age being more likely to appreciate the rational science approach of SWM. Our research suggests that conservation organisations may need to adapt their management aims and practices to avoid direct conflict with the rising tide of animal rights sentiment. Furthermore, significant investment will be required to promote science-based conservation in social marketing on all social media platforms to help educate and engage the public with the science behind conservation management. Sustainable wildlife management (SWM) is based on a synergy of traditional/local knowledge, advances in scientific knowledge, and fast-evolving economic and social circumstances. A widely accepted cornerstone of SWM globally is that conservation and utilization need to be effectively integrated, emphasizing the benefits humans can derive from biodiversity, thereby further encouraging people to protect and value wildlife though its management. However, with demand from biological resources growing at an unprecedented rate and the emergence of social media, conservationists must respond quickly to new challenges and conflicts associated with species management and public policy. For example, the rise of the "Compassionate Conservation" (CC) movement, fueled by social marketing and media, which promotes the welfare of individual animals, has introduced a set of challenges for conventional conservation management as it opposes most or all forms of wildlife utilization and hunting. CC advocates are increasingly influential at global and national policy levels; hence, it is imperative that conservationists are informed and aware of the future challenges from a rapidly changing global society. In this paper, we report the findings of a large semi-structured questionnaire in China which investigated the attitude of the urban public toward sustainable wildlife management (SWM) and wildlife conservation across a range of issues and identified the key socio-economic and demographic factor drivers for those attitudes.
   The survey was conducted from November 2018 to October 2020, across 15 cities randomly selected among China's seven administrative geographic regions. The survey was initially conducted through face-to-face interviews, but later, due to COVID-19 restrictions, was completed via online questionnaires. A Likert seven-point scale method was used to score the public's degree of agreement or disagreement for each question; a multivariate stepwise linear regression method was used to analyze whether the overall attitude of the respondents toward SWM and wildlife conservation was affected by their demographic characteristics; and a classification and regression tree (CART) was used to conduct an in-depth analysis of the issues with negative scores in the questionnaire, so as to understand how the respondents' demographic characteristics affected the public's attitude about such issues, which could supplement results obtained from the multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis. The results show that the public are broadly supportive of SWM, but only moderately so. On issues of "Animal Welfare and Rights," "Wildlife Utilization and Captive Breeding," and "Trophy Hunting", the core concerns of the "Compassionate Conservation" movement and the overall public view are more antagonistic to conventional SWM. We also find specific demographic characteristics significantly influence attitudes about SWM, with vegetarians, those with religious beliefs, and with lower educational standards demonstrating weaker support for SWM. For younger people, "Animal Welfare and Rights" is a special concern, hence, we identify this as a key issue to be addressed for SWM and conservation in the future. Our research suggests that conservation organisations may need to adapt their management aims and practices to avoid direct conflict with the rising tide of animal rights sentiment, especially among the young. Furthermore, significant investment will be required to promote science-based conservation in social marketing on all social media platforms to help educate and engage the public with the science behind conservation management.

AB  - Introduction: Safety performance functions (SPF) are employed to predict crash counts at the different roadway elements. Several SPFs were developed for the various roadway elements based on different classifications such as functional classification and area type. Since a more detailed classification of roadway elements leads to more accurate crash predictions, multiple states have developed new classification systems to classify roads based on a comprehensive classification. In Florida, the new roadway context classification system incorporates geographic, demographic, and road characteristics information. Method: In this study, SPFs were developed in the framework of the FDOT roadway context classification system at three levels of modeling, context classification (CC-SPFs), area type (AT-SPFs), and statewide (SW-SPF) levels. Crash and traffic data from 2015-2019 were obtained. Road characteristics and road environment information have also been gathered along Florida roads for the SPF development. Results: The developed SPFs showed that there are several variables that influence the frequency of crashes, such as annual average daily traffic (AADT), signalized intersections and access point densities, speed limit, and shoulder width. However, there are other variables that did not have an influence in crash occurrence such as concrete surface and the presence of bicycle slots. CC-SPFs had the best performance among others. Moreover, network screening to determine the most problematic road segments has been accomplished. The results of the network screening indicated that the most problematic roads in Florida are the suburban commercial and the urban general roads. Practical Applications: This research provides a solid reference for decision-makers regarding crash prediction and safety improvement along Florida roads.

AB  - Contemporary early childhood classrooms in the United States are becoming even more diverse with increasing cultural, linguistic, and developmental complexity. Given the movement toward implementing universal early education and care and the changes in educational policy toward inclusive education, early childhood classrooms have become important sites for inclusion of diverse young children with and without disabilities. However, it is not uncommon to witness exclusionary practices that marginalize young children, especially those with immigrant backgrounds. Situated in a prekindergarten classroom in New York City, this study aims to counter common narratives in exclusionary practices that dehumanizes young children on the margins and to build evidence of inclusive practice from teachers' lived experiences in the classroom. Grounded in Freire's notion of humanization and framed by Salazar's tenets of humanizing pedagogy, this study highlights one immigrant teacher's perspective and her inclusive practice of humanization for immigrant students with and without disabilities. Through qualitative research methods, this study presents an emic view of incidences in her classroom that illuminate the meaning of inclusion and the critical role of the teacher as a mediator, facilitator, and visionary worker. Implications for future research and teacher education are discussed.

AB  - As the middle of the 20th century approached, during the time the world got tense with the imperialist discourses, Japan started an invasion movement by moving towards China in July 1937. The silence of Western countries and the inability of the League of Nations to take a deterrent decision about this attempt caused Japan to spread over China and to commit violent incidents that were gradually became even more violent. Beijing, Shanghai and then Nanking, which was the capital of China of that time were occupied by Japan. During the invasion of Nanking, many civilians were tortured and raped by the Japanese armies, and this event went down in history as the Nanking Massacre. The Turkish press, along with the world, closely followed the events in the Far East since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War and made evaluations about the issue. Considering this invasion movement as a step before Soviet Russia, which is the main target of Japan, the Turkish press predicted that it would bring a world war providing that Europe and America intervened. The Turkish press, which detailed the Japanese army's entrance through the Nanking gates and the fall of the city, is of the opinion that the occupation movements will not end after the fall of the capital. While the military dimension of the occupation and its impact on international relations was widely covered in the Turkish press, the situation of the people living in the city was rarely mentioned. In this study, the reflections of the events from the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war to the occupation of Nanking and the civilian deaths during the occupation on the selected newspapers in the Turkish press will be followed and evaluated.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic that began in the city of Wuhan in China has caused a huge number of deaths worldwide. Countries have introduced spatial restrictions on movement and social distancing in response to the rapid rate of SARS-Cov-2 transmission among its populations. Research originality lies in the taken global perspective revealing indication of significant relationships between changes in mobility and the number of Covid-19 cases. The study uncovers a time offset between the two applied databases, Google Mobility and John Hopkins University, influencing correlations between mobility and pandemic development. Analyses reveals a link between the introduction of lockdown and the number of new Covid-19 cases. Types of mobility with the most significant impact on the development of the pandemic are "retail and recreation areas", "transit stations", "workplaces" "groceries and pharmacies". The difference in the correlation between the lockdown introduced and the number of SARS-COV-2 cases is 81%, when using a 14-day weighted average compared to the 7-day average. Moreover, the study reveals a strong geographical diversity in human mobility and its impact on the number of new Covid-19 cases.

AB  - Sarcosaprophagous flies (Diptera) rank among the most common insects associated with human-trans-formed environments all over the world. Synanthropic species of the families Calliphoridae, Muscidae, Sarcophagidae and Phoridae, in particular, have tremendous forensic importance due to their ability to colonize human cadavers and thus provide information on minimum post-mortem interval. Recently, cases of flies colonizing cadavers inside buildings of different heights drew attention to the vertical dispersal abilities of these flies, a subject that has received little attention. We investigated the vertical distribution of sarcosaprophagous flies in an urban environment, using uninhabited buildings as experimental models in Northeastern Brazil. To assess the vertical stratification of flies, one in every three floors of nine buildings was sampled using traps baited with bovine spleen, from the ground to the 27th floor. Calliphoridae was the most abundant family (52.9%), followed by Muscidae (41.2%), Sarcophagidae (3.2%) and Phoridae (2.7%). Most of the insects were collected at ground level (78.8%), with a decreasing abundance registered on the higher floors. Nevertheless, adults of the four families tested here were able to reach substrates as high as the 15th floor, which corresponds to approximately 48 m in height. Regarding calliphorids, seven species were identified, of which Chrysomya albiceps (30.4%) and C. megacephala (68.3%) were the most abundant. This is, to our knowledge, the first detailed, replicated study on vertical resource localization of sarcosaprophagous flies. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scattered cultivated lands in the agro-pastoral areas on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) cause pressure on the structure, function and evolvement of landscape and affect regional ecological sustainability. Based on niche theory, this study is the first to apply the niche breadth, niche entropy and niche overlap model to explore how the cultivated land expansion and development forms affect ecological roles from ecosystem interaction aspects from 1990 to 2015 at regional scales on the QTP. The results showed that: (1) Grassland was overall dominant in most counties, while the interface between the cultivated land and grassland showed great spatial variability and the main land use conversion occurred between them. From 1990 to 2015, the transfer percentage of grassland into cultivated land was 0.27%. (2) Results of cultivated land niche breadth and entropy indicated that at provincial scale, the occupancy rates of cultivated lands in Tibet and Xinjiang were lower than Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai. (3) Cultivated land niche overlap exhibited by network graph revealed that Gansu, Sichuan and Qinghai had a high niche overlap over 0.994 at provincial scale. At city scale, the maximum overlap was HaibeiGuoluo and Lanzhou-Wuwei (0.999) while the minimum was Bayingol-Kizilsu Kirghiz (0.243), indicating that the development forms and competition of cultivated land between each two regions were quite different. (4) The driving forces derived by niche difference of different ecosystems showed that cultivated land niche was affected the evolution of grassland niche, and the social benefit was the leading benefit of cultivated land change. Overall, this study can assist local government in building the cultivated land management system. Moreover, the results of this study contribute to understand the characteristics and driving forces of the cultivated land evolution on the QTP, thus providing valuable decision reference for ecological protection, land use structure regulation and policy formulation.

AB  - Autonomous driving support systems and self-driving cars require the determination of reliable vehicle positions with high accuracy. The real time kinematic (RTK) algorithm with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is generally employed to obtain highly accurate position information. Because RTK can estimate the fix solution, which is a centimeter-level positioning solution, it is also used as an indicator of the position reliability. However, in urban areas, the degradation of the GNSS signal environment poses a challenge. Multipath noise caused by surrounding tall buildings degrades the positioning accuracy. This leads to large errors in the fix solution, which is used as a measure of reliability. We propose a novel position reliability estimation method by considering two factors; one is that GNSS errors are more likely to occur in the height than in the plane direction; the other is that the height variation of the actual vehicle travel path is small compared to the amount of movement in the horizontal directions. Based on these considerations, we proposed a method to detect a reliable fix solution by estimating the height variation during driving. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, an evaluation test was conducted in an urban area of Tokyo. According to the evaluation test, a reliability judgment rate of 99% was achieved in an urban environment, and a plane accuracy of less than 0.3 m in RMS was achieved. The results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed method is higher than that of the conventional fix solution, demonstratingits effectiveness.

AB  - Medium sized opossums (Didelphis spp.) are among the most fascinating mammals of the Americas, playing important ecological roles (e.g., dispersal of seeds and control of insect populations) in the environment they inhabit. Nevertheless, as synanthropic animals, they are well adapted to human dwellings, occupying shelters within the cities, peripheral areas, and rural settings. These marsupials can harbor numerous pathogens, which may affect people, pets, and livestock. Among those, some protozoa (e.g., Leishmania infantum, Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii), helminths (e.g., Ancylostoma caninum, Trichinella spiralis, Alaria marcianae, Paragonimus spp.) and arthropods (e.g., ticks, fleas) present substantial public health and veterinary importance, due to their capacity to cause disease in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Here, we reviewed the role played by opossums on the spreading of zoonotic parasites, vectors, and vector-borne pathogens, highlighting the risks of pathogens transmission due to the direct and indirect interaction of humans and domestic animals with Didelphis spp. in the Americas.

AB  - Leptospirosis is an endemic zoonoses of global proportions. Stray dogs have been postulated to play a role in disease transmission; however, supporting information are still limited. Roaming behavior may not only predispose the dogs to infection, but could also contribute to disease spread. In this study, the susceptibility of urban stray dogs in shedding Leptospira spp. was determined. Blood, urine, and tissue samples of kidney and liver were collected from 100 dogs from 2 animal control facilities. Serological testing using microscopic agglutination test (MAT) were performed on blood against 20 leptospiral serovars with a cut-off titre of > 1:100. Samples were cultured onto semi-solid Ellinghausen and McCullough modified by Johnson and Harris (EMJH) media. Isolates were identified using molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 2 primers (16s rRNA and LipL32) and hyperimmune serum (HIS) MAT. The seroprevalence for the dogs positive for leptospirosis was 32% (n=32/100) with the following detected serovars: Javanica (n=13), Bataviae (n=10), Icterohaemorrhagiae (n=3), Autumnalis (n=2), Canicola (n=1), Pyrogenes (n=1), Copenhageni (n=1), and Australis (n=1). Six Leptospira spp. isolated were procured from urine (n=2), kidney (n=2) and liver (n=2). All 6 isolates belonged to L. interrogans, a pathogenic variant of Leptospira spp. Serotyping and phylogenetic analysis suggested serovar Bataviae (n=5) and serovar Canicola (n=1). Presence of vaccinal serovars (Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola) suggested potential post-vaccination antibodies but the predominance of non-vaccinal serovars (Javanica and Bataviae) indicate the possibility of current infection or post-exposure. Isolation of Leptospira spp. directly from urine sample not only suggested an active infection but highlighted the potential shedding capability among these stray dogs. These findings further strengthen speculations that urban stray dogs could play a role in transmission and dissemination of leptospirosis through their constant movement. The urine of infected dogs may contaminate the environment, posing a major public health threat. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to clarify the applied indicator of "dynamic vehicle dimensions" characterizing the size of a section of a city street occupied by a car during its movement. This indicator directly affects the value of the "dynamic passenger size". In the case of relatively free traffic during between-peak times and when driving during rush hour, the indicators change quite a lot due to changes in average speed, deceleration during braking and the distance between cars. For the above cases, the specific values of energy consumption, travel time and financial costs for the movement of a conventional passenger by different modes of transport were calculated: a car, a bus on traditional fuel, a trolleybus, an electric bus, a bicycle and an electric scooter. The total contribution to environmental pollution with the current structure of the traffic flow has been determined and a forecast calculation has been made when it changes with an increase in the share of electric transport. The resulting refined mathematical model of energy consumption for the movement of one passenger, with refined variables, makes it possible to predict the effect of changing the structure of the traffic flow and its characteristics to assess promising approaches to reduce energy consumption in transport and improve the environmental situation.

AB  - The social justice model of recognition has acquired particular connotation in the framework of contemporary social movements, especially in those groups traditionally invisibilized, such as indigenous, rural, and marginal urban communities, among many others. Enlazador de mundos is a Chilean social movement that organizes itself in this type of social contexts, through dialogic community classrooms, in order to overcome the undervaluation of the cultural heritage of these communities in the official curricula. It is of interest to know how these collectives organize themselves to overcome the injustices in these classrooms. Through participatory action research, the forms of injustice/contempt and justice/recognition produced in the organizational dynamics adopted by the social collectives that are part of these community classrooms were identified. For this purpose, three research communities were constituted in three schools in a diversity of cultural contexts: peasant, mining, Mapuche, in different geographical regions of the country. The results show, on one hand, that the organizational dynamics of the collectives that mobilize the community classrooms are capable of generating social justice attributable to different forms of recognition, and on the other hand, that the injustices identified as forms of contempt, turned out to be the triggers of the dialogic transforming process that manages to produce the justice of social recognition.

AB  - Following the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and so many others, recent protest in Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, DC, LA, Portland and a host of other locations, both, stateside and abroad are being framed in the public discourse as everything from radical resistance to public madness and everything in between. From the Black Lives Matter movement activist to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion advocates, one of the key components in, both, radical resistance strategies or public expressions of cultural madness, is a ground swelling of rage!
   But what is rage? How can we recognize it? Historically, what has been the consequences of Black rage? And in this unique, historical moment, what if anything can be done to leverage it?
   Mining August Wilson's work for definitions, instances, and consequences of Black rage, this paper interrogates August Wilson's narratives on rage as a way to talk about the historiography and commodifying of Black rage as a way of victimizing and disposing of Black bodies in America. In this way, we hope to offer suggestions in this historical moment on how to leverage Black rage, rather than to be snared by it.

AB  - The article presents some research results, which takes as a background the MST's experience of "agroecological transition" and its implications for the debate on rural development and rural education. Thus, we aim to analyze the role and impact that this experience of agroecological transition of the MST has been producing in its proposal for rural development and rural education within the scope of rural settlements in the Amazon. The research took as a theoretical reference the studies of the Epistemologies of the South of Boaventura de Sousa Santos and was guided by a qualitative approach. The fieldwork took place in two rural settlements, one on the Mosqueiro Island in the city of Belem, and the other in the city of Castanhal, both in the State of Para. As a result, it was possible to identify that the MST's agroecological transition experience occurs in a contradictory and conflicting way, presenting advances and problems of an internal and external order to the Movement to materialize in its proposal for rural development and rural education and to reproduce socially in Amazonian settlements.

AB  - This work performed by considering two complementary approaches for investigating the Karst system of Ras El Ma source: (1) The structural approach based on field studies, (2) The functional approach requiring inputs data (precipitations) as well as output data at the exit of the karstic system. The choice of the Ras El Ma source is justified by the fact that it constitutes the main outlet of the Liassic aquifer at the Southwest of Taza town. The structural approach highlighted that the impact of South Rifan and North Middle Atlas faults, oriented mainly NE-SW to ENE-WSW and NW-SE, tectonically linked to the Hercynian and late-Hercynian phases; these faults compartmentalized the karst into panels. The functioning of this karst system is based on the coupling of inputs and outputs, the analysis of interannual hydrograph, flood hydrographs, the recession curves and the analysis of hydro-geochemical results. Respectively, the obtained results are presented as follows: A close relationship between flow rates and precipitation, interannual hydrographs marked by a contrasting variation in flow rates and a periodicity that occurs between low water and high-water years. Concerning flood hydrographs, there are two types, a unit modal hydrographs type which generally occurs following time concentrated rainfall and a second multi modal hydrographs type which follows the repetitive rainfall in the basin. The study of recession curves reveals a clear complexity of the systems supplying the source. However, due to the low drying-off coefficients (7.66.10(-4)), the aquifer seems to have a poorly developed drainage network in a flooded area. According to the Mangin method [1975], this karstic system is classified in the category of poor or complex karst systems taking into accounts two parameters (i) and (K), which characterize the functioning of the infiltration zone and the volume of flooded karst, respectively. The physicochemical parameters study highlighted the nature of drained rock by the sources. The correlation between conductivity and different chemical elements shows that bicarbonates and calcium are responsible for the mineralization of the waters of this source. It can be concluded that the low values of mineralization occur during the winter and spring floods. The spring regains its normal mineralization during the summer period.

AB  - In May 2020, populations of Eriophyid mites were detected on tree of heaven,Ailanthusaltissima Mill., in a recreative park in the city of Colombes, near Paris, and later in August and September in four locations, in Southern France. Morphological examination supplemented with sequencing data for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) assigned all collected mites to a single species, Aculusmosoniensis (Ripka) (Acari; Prostigmata; Eriophyoidea). This is the first record of this species in France and the first insights into its intraspecific variability based on a barcode dataset. In Europe, this species is considered one of the most promising biological control agents of tree of heaven. This new record provides encouraging evidence that the geographic occurrence of this species is expanding in Europe which may be indicative of its dispersal and establishment abilities, two key factors for a future biological control program.

AB  - Author summaryMosquitoes represent a nuisance as well as public health risk due to their ability to transmit pathogens to humans. The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is an invasive species nowadays established in all Mediterranean countries, reaching highest abundance in Italy. Innovative control approaches have been proposed to complement conventional ones and to increase the success of the fight against this aggressive day-biting species, but still need to be validated in the field. Small islands are ideal places for these validation experiments as they are naturally protected by the spill over of mosquitoes from neighbouring untreated areas. The island of Procida, in the gulf of Naples (Italy), has the right ecological characteristics (e.g., homogeneous landscape and high densities of human and Ae. albopictus populations) to represent an ideal experimental site. In collaboration with the Municipality and the residents we obtained relevant data on the mosquito distribution and seasonality on the island and performed preliminary experiments, creating an instrumental baseline information which will facilitate the effective testing of novel control schemes.
   In the last decades, the colonization of Mediterranean Europe and of other temperate regions by Aedes albopictus created an unprecedented nuisance problem in highly infested areas and new public health threats due to the vector competence of the species. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) and the Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) are insecticide-free mosquito-control methods, relying on mass release of irradiated/manipulated males, able to complement existing and only partially effective control tools. The validation of these approaches in the field requires appropriate experimental settings, possibly isolated to avoid mosquito immigration from other infested areas, and preliminary ecological and entomological data. We carried out a 4-year study in the island of Procida (Gulf of Naples, Italy) in strict collaboration with local administrators and citizens to estimate the temporal dynamics, spatial distribution, and population size of Ae. albopictus and the dispersal and survival of irradiated males. We applied ovitrap monitoring, geo-spatial analyses, mark-release-recapture technique, and a citizen-science approach. Results allow to predict the seasonal (from April to October, with peaks of 928-9,757 males/ha) and spatial distribution of the species, highlighting the capacity of Ae. albopictus population of Procida to colonize and maintain high frequencies in urban as well as in sylvatic inhabited environments. Irradiated males shown limited ability to disperse (mean daily distance travelled <60m) and daily survival estimates ranging between 0.80 and 0.95. Overall, the ecological characteristics of the island, the acquired knowledge on Ae. albopictus spatial and temporal distribution, the high human and Ae. albopictus densities and the positive attitude of the resident population in being active parts in innovative mosquito control projects provide the ground for evidence-based planning of the interventions and for the assessment of their effectiveness. In addition, the results highlight the value of creating synergies between research groups, local administrators, and citizens for affordable monitoring (and, in the future, control) of mosquito populations.

AB  - We are currently living in a state of uncertainty due to the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are several factors involved in the epidemic spreading, such as the individual characteristics of each city/country. The true shape of the epidemic dynamics is a large, complex system, considerably hard to predict. In this context, Complex networks are a great candidate for analyzing these systems due to their ability to tackle structural and dynamic properties. Therefore, this study presents a new approach to model the COVID-19 epidemic using a multi-layer complex network, where nodes represent people, edges are social contacts, and layers represent different social activities. The model improves the traditional SIR, and it is applied to study the Brazilian epidemic considering data up to 05/26/2020, and analyzing possible future actions and their consequences. The network is characterized using statistics of infection, death, and hospitalization time. To simulate isolation, social distancing, or precautionary measures, we remove layers and reduce social contact's intensity. Results show that even taking various optimistic assumptions, the current isolation levels in Brazil still may lead to a critical scenario for the healthcare system and a considerable death toll (average of 149,000). If all activities return to normal, the epidemic growth may suffer a steep increase, and the demand for ICU beds may surpass three times the country's capacity. This situation would surely lead to a catastrophic scenario, as our estimation reaches an average of 212,000 deaths, even considering that all cases are effectively treated. The increase of isolation (up to a lockdown) shows to be the best option to keep the situation under the healthcare system capacity, aside from ensuring a faster decrease of new case occurrences (months of difference), and a significantly smaller death toll (average of 87,000).

AB  - 22 :55 on June 17, 2019, a magnitude 6. 0 earthquake (28. 34 degrees N, 104. 90 degrees E) occurred in Changning County, Yibin City, Sichuan Province, China. The deep seismogenic environment and potential earthquake risk in the inner and marginal areas of Sichuan Basin have once again attracted the close attention of seismologists and scholars at home and abroad. In order to reveal the characteristics of the deep medium structure and the seismogenic environment of the Changning M(s)6. 0 earthquake area, and to interpret the tectonic background and genesis of the earthquake activities comprehensively, In this paper, we fully collected a total of 35 sets of observation seismic equipment which deployed in the Changning earthquake area in Southeast Sichuan and its surrounding areas, including Sichuan digital seismological network, Yibin local seismological network and new mobile seismological stations in Yibin after 2016, P -wave arrival data of 17305 earthquakes recorded from January 2013 to July 2019. Double-difference seismic tomography method was used to invert the three-dimensional P-wave velocity structure characteristics of the upper crust around the Changning earthquake area, combined with the three-dimensional magnetotelluric array sounding and gravity intensive measurements obtained in the earthquake region by the postearthquake scientific research, we comprehensively analyzed and discussed the scientific issues such as the relationship between the velocity structure characteristics and seismic activity in the Changning earthquake area, the deep tectonic environment and the seismic risk. The results show that the P -wave velocity structure of the upper crust around the Changning earthquake zone shows obvious lateral inhomogeneity, the physical properties of the sedimentary layer in the earthquake zone are obviously different, and there is a high-velocity anomaly distribution in the sedimentary layer where the Changning anticline is located, There is a clear difference between the velocity structure of the periphery around Shuanghe anticline and its east. The spatial distribution characteristics of the relocated Changning M(s)6. 0 earthquake sequence are closely related to the velocity structure of the upper crust. The sequence generally spread in the NW-SE direction along the boundary of high-low velocity anomaly, and terminate near the east section of the Baixiangyan-Shizitan anticline, The inhomogeneous variation of the velocity structure of the Changning earthquake area and its surrounding medium is the deep structural factor controlling the spatial distribution of the mainshock and its sequence. The three-dimensional P-wave velocity structure also shows that there are different deep-shallow structural backgrounds near the Shuanghe folds in Changning M(s)6. 0 earthquake. The different activities of local structures in the earthquake region not only cause the variety of fold structure axial and associated fault strike, but also cause the obvious differences between coupling relationship of deep and shallow structures and physical characteristics of sedimentary cover in the earthquake area. The epicenter of the Changning M(s)6. 0 earthquake was located near the boundary zone where the velocity structure changes. This boundary zone of physical property change may be a favorable location for earthquake preparation and occurrence of moderate-strong earthquakes. The Changning M(s)6.
   0 earthquake and most of its sequence occurred above the basement detachment zone, due to the joint action of the regional NE-SW principal compressive stress and the NW-SE present stress field transmitted through the Huayingshan structural belt, the following earthquakes with magnitude 5. 1 in Gongxian, magnitude 5. 3 in Changning, magnitude 5. 4 and magnitude 5. 6 in Gongxian, as well as a large number of small and medium-sized earthquake events, were triggered by the Changning M(s)6. 0 earthquake. The P-wave velocity structure also reveals that there are different shallow velocity structures on both sides of Shuanghe fold, Dadiwan fault and Dafuya fault in NW direction. Combined with the ground geological survey results, such as the relatively developed NW fault structure associated with the axis of Changning-Shuanghe anticline, and the strike of associated faults of the east fold structure also shows diversity and complexity. The results show that in addition to the influence of regional tectonic movement, the differential activities of local structures in the Changning earthquake area are also prominent. The axial structures and associated faults in the Changning-Shuanghe anticline structural area have certain earthquake generating capacity and deep seismogenic background, this may also be the main reason for the large aftershock intensity and long duration of Changning earthquake. The seismicity trend and potential seismic risk in southeast Sichuan still deserve further attention.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate domestication effects on the genetic structure of two dioecious species Brosimum alicastrum Sw. (Moraceae) and Spondias purpurea L. (Anacardiaceae), and a heterostylous one Cordia dodecandra A. DC. (Cordiaceae), growing in remnant forests and homegardens within two climatic regions of the Peninsula of Yucatan. The trees of B. alicastrum and C. dodecandra are propagated by seeds in both population types, while those of S. purpurea are propagated asexually in the homegardens. ISSRs genetic markers were amplified from foliar tissue of 18 to 21 plants per population type/region combination for each species. Genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and genetic structure estimators were obtained and compared among species at the regional and population level. We found higher polymorphism (37.5-41), but lower private alleles (4-4.4) and similar heterozygosity (0.1-0.12) in the species with sexual reproduction compared to S. purpurea (34, 8, and 0.11, respectively). Genetic diversity in B. alicastrum populations varied with the region; in C. dodecandra, to the population type; and in S. purpurea, to both the population type and the region. Unrestricted gene flow among regions was suggested by low phi(RT) in C. dodecandra and S. purpurea (-0.006 and 0.002) but not for B. alicastrum (0.1). Gene flow between populations within the regions for the sexually reproducing species was suggested by lower theta(II) (0.005-0.07 and 0.008-0.1) estimates than those of S. purpurea (0.09 and 0.13). Even though the lowest paired F-ST (0.002-0.05) and phi(ST) (0.002-0.12) values were found between the northeastern forest and homegarden populations for the three species, the dendrogram, Bayesian assignment, and K-Means analyses suggest that the least differentiated populations are southwestern forest and homegarden populations of B. alicastrum and S. purpurea, and the southwestern forest and northeastern homegarden of C. dodecandra. The sexual reproduction, biotic interactions, and extensive management of B. alicastrum and C. dodecandra in the agroforestry and the urban systems may contribute to connectivity between wild and domesticated populations, while in S. purpurea this connectivity is interrupted by the clonal propagation of the species in the homegardens.

AB  - This article explores the sociospatial underpinnings of cosmopolitan place-marketing narratives and their impacts on British migrants living in Sitges, an affluent tourist town in Spain. Sitges' place-marketing suggests that moving there automatically fosters a cosmopolitan identity. For British migrants in Sitges, this was understood to be exemplified through integration into the local community. Yet the vast majority found such integration impossible, not least because this conceptualization of cosmopolitanism overlooked the subjectivity of locals themselves, by whom they were most often rejected. It is argued that this mismatch between British migrants' experiences and Sitges' cosmopolitan place-marketing occurs because it relies on an understanding of subjective identity as generated locationally, enacted via movement to a specific "type" of place that incorporates particular understandings of space, place, and culture in relation to that identity. This overrides the necessity of relationality, undermining the ideal of reflexive identity-making on which cosmopolitan place-marketing narratives rely.

AB  - Changes in use of the urban and rural areas are increasing each passing day based on the rapid population growth and urbanization along with the developments in industry and technology. Direction and rate of this change can be detected through the calculation of the changes by the virtue of developments in technology and science. In this study, it is aimed to detect the changes which have occurred in usage of the areas between the years 1985 and 2020 in Ayvalik district, Turkey with the aid of remote sensing and geographical information systems. The land use changes calculated as the results of the study indicated that 668.6 % of the increase took place in the highway transportation network of the district, 420.7 % of which in tourism and entertainment areas, 152 % of which in the residential areas covering both the district center and villages, 133.8 % of which in the industrial areas and 32.2 % of which in the ports areas in a period of 35 years. The land use change results also showed that there has been a decrease of 19.3% in the total amount of forests that covered the landscape. Regarding the examination of the land use change on the agricultural basis, it was found out that the irrigated agricultural areas have increased by 33.4 % whereas the dry agricultural areas and the cultivated agricultural areas have decreased by %38.1 and 20.1 %, respectively.

AB  - Manuel de Tavares (c. 1585-1638) was a Portuguese composer who accomplished his professional career in several Spanish cathedrals and occupied the position of Master of chapel in Las Palmas, in Gran Canaria between 1631 and 1638. In this city the composer developed and reinforced the polychoral style. From this core of pieces which remain till the present days we can find a polychoral mass. So, this paper is about the characterization of this mass according to the following items: codicological analysis and from the musical contents and its normal framing; and between text and music and polychoral writing: type of voices and combination of clefs, movement of parts from bass and harmonical independence in tutti passage and antiformal change.

AB  - To understand patterns of genetic and morphological variability, population structure and dispersal dynamics of the invasive bivalve Pinctada imbricata radiata (Leach, 1814) in Tunisian waters, we studied 200 individuals from five different sites (natural, polluted and/or subjected to environmental and anthropogenic pressures) using 10 enzymatic systems and six shell measurements. In this study, we attempt to elucidate the relationship between the spreading ability and the adaptive potential of the species under various environmental stresses. Fourteen putative enzyme-coding loci were resolved, six of which were polymorphic at the level of 99%. P. imbricata radiata maintains a relatively consistent level of polymorphism at the genetic markers studied, since 10% of individuals were heterozygous. The mean F-IS value was positive and significant in two samples. However, the remaining samples collected from the disturbed marine sites (polluted, urban and lagoon areas) were at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Highly significant genetic (mean F-ST=0.022, P<0.001) and morphological (Wilks' lambda=0.0814, approximate F-20,F- 627=35.484, P<0.001) differentiations between samples were observed, with no evidence of isolation caused by geographic distance. However, the Mantel test performed between genetic and morphological distances revealed a significant correlation. Our results indicate that natural selection seems to have a greater influence on genetic differentiation in P. imbricata radiata than genetic drift. The combination of genetic and morphological data provided important theoretical information for determining the invasion mechanisms of the species.

AB  - One of the most complex mesoscale atmospheric phenomena is the supercell. In most cases it is associated with violent convective processes such as: wind intensifications that can exceed 100 km/h, high electrical activity, large hail and torrential rains in short periods of time. Such an extremely severe convective phenomenon occurred on June 19, 2016, over the city of Targu Mure., being the subject of this analysis. For the analysis of synoptic and mesoscale phenomena were consulted: ground and altitude maps of Global Forecast System (GFS) models, European Center for Mid-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Zentraanstalt fur Meterologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), COSMO, ESTOFEX, Targu Mure. Skew - T diagram, observation data from the local meteorological station, satellite images (Meteosat 08) and meteorological data from the archive of the National Meteorological Administration (ANM) and images captured by the WSR 98D Bobohalma meteorological radar. The aim of this study is to identify aspects of the structure, evolution and movement of the supercell in order to understand the synoptic and mesoscale conditions to identify the characteristic features of severe phenomena that could contribute to the effectiveness of nowcasting warnings.

AB  - A trend to increase the vote acquisition of Islamic parties has occurred since the 2014 Election. Likewise, in the 2019 Election the Islamic parties namely the Partai Keadilan Sejahtera (PKS) and the Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa (PKB) receive again significantly votes. The purpose of this study is to determine the branding strategy of PKS and PKB political parties in raising the votes of voters in the 2019 Legislative Election of Regency / City DPRDs in the election district of Kecamatan Kiaracondong City of Bandung. The research use qualitative with the case study method. Data collection techniques is carried out by observation, interview, and documentation. The results reveal that the branding strategy of PKS and PKB-based Islamic political parties in raising voters' votes in the 2019 Legislative Election is through a clear vision and mission, and the flagship program of Partai Keadilan Sejahtera (PKS) is to abolish motor taxes and impose a lifetime SIM. The community hopes that through the program can help ease the economic burden. Whereas Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa (PKB) through the da'wah program strategy is through the Nandlatul Ulama citizen movement. The increase in voters is also supported by the militancy of legislative candidate members or cadres from each party. (C) 2021 Published by European Publisher.

KW  - linguistic landscaping
KW  - multi-site ethnography

AB  - The Chinese are one of the earliest established immigrant communities in the Netherlands and they are part of the new 'superdiversity' of metropolitan societies around the world, where the relative clarity of previous migration patterns is overlaid by vastly more complex, multilayered and less stable trajectories of movement. Understanding globalization as superdiversity (i.e. as a diversification of diversity instead of a homogenization of global culture in local language and culture practices), this paper aims to disentangle the complexities of being and knowing Chinese in the Netherlands, with respect to internal diversities within Chineseness and its relation to changing Chinese language ideologies.
   The empirical starting point for this contribution is an ethnographic project among young people of Chinese heritage living in the Netherlands in and around the setting of a complementary Chinese language school in the city of Eindhoven. The paper focuses on the polycentricity of Chinese, the transformations that occur in the linguistic culinary landscape and the discursive identity construction of Chinese-Dutch youth. Using a multi-site ethnographic methodology data are collected through structured observations, interviews with Chinese community members, linguistic landscaping and online ethnography.
   Overall, the paper argues that an ongoing shift along with demographic, economic and political changes in China has altered migration patterns, language ideologies and linguistic landscapes in the Chinese diaspora in the Netherlands. Young people of Chinese heritage articulate a whole repertoire of inhabited and ascribed identities, and they do so by means of a complex display and deployment of the ensemble of linguistic and communicative resources at their disposal.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the atmospheric conditions associated with an event of intense precipitation caused by Easterly Wave Disturbances (EWDs), as well as the environmental conditions related to the mass gravitational movement that occurred between 14th June and 15th June of 2014, in the district of Mae Luiza, Natal/RN/Brazil. The synoptic conditions, the vertical integrated moisture flux and the energetic behavior in the EWD's performance phases were analyzed. In addition to these factors, local environmental aspects were assessed, classifying the vulnerability to disaster events in the affected area. Over the days of the operation of the atmospheric system, the daily accumulation of precipitation was greater than 100 mm, with precipitation accumulated in 3 h in the order of 60 mm for the stages of maturation of the disturbance. The main synoptic conditions associated with EWDs were exhibited by the intense anomalies of wind speed and high humidity flux on the east coast of the Northeast, which intensified the influx of moisture into the continent over the period of the operation of the system. Conditions of high to very high vulnerability were identified in the area where the event took place and also in other expressive parts of the district.

AB  - While the focus of plant virology has been mainly on horticultural and field crops as well as fruit trees, little information is available on viruses that infect forest trees. Utilization of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies has revealed a significant number of viruses in forest trees and urban parks. In the present study, the full-length genome of a novel Emaravirus has been identified and characterized from sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) - a tree species of significant importance in urban and forest areas - showing leaf mottle symptoms. RNA-Seq was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500 system using RNA preparations from a symptomatic and a symptomless maple tree. The sequence assembly and analysis revealed the presence of six genomic RNA segments in the symptomatic sample (RNA1: 7,074 nt-long encoding the viral replicase; RNA2: 2,289 nt-long encoding the glycoprotein precursor; RNA3: 1,525 nt-long encoding the nucleocapsid protein; RNA4: 1,533 nt-long encoding the putative movement protein; RNA5: 1,825 nt-long encoding a hypothetical protein P5; RNA6: 1,179 nt-long encoding a hypothetical protein P6). Two independent NGS sequencing runs from the same symptomatic maple tree detected the same genome segments. For one of these sequencing runs the cDNA library was prepared using a primer targeting the conserved genome terminal region, known to be shared between emaraviruses genome segments. We suggest, therefore, that the six identified genome segments represent the complete genome of a novel emaravirus from maple, which we tentatively name maple mottle-associated virus (MaMaV). Phylogenetic and sequence homology analyses place this virus on the distinct "subgroup a" clade within the Emaravirus genus along with - among others - rose rosette virus, Actinidia emaravirus 2, and fig mosaic virus. Validation RT-PCR assays performed on symptomatic and non-symptomatic trees suggest that MaMaV may be the symptom-inducing virus in the diseased trees. To our knowledge, this is the first time an Emaravirus is described from maple and is fully genetically characterized. With the discovery of MaMaV, the genus Emaravirus comprising negative-sense single-stranded viruses with very divergent genomes - that were until recently overlooked - has substantially increased counting 22 established and putative members.

AB  - Laranjeiras, in Sergipe, a city that emanates from an Afroculture, has a relationship of symbology and safeguard with its cultural heritage and memories that form a black topography of terreiros of memories, occupied by African nations, folguedos and griot poetry. Thus, the objectives of this article seek to identify, systematize and analyze habits, customs and traditions that challenge the petrification's inheritances of black communities. Through decolonial black paths elaborated by a Historical Anthropology, there are nuances, hues and multiform that subvert the symmetries of the past. Far from a deformer syncretism, exercise an "anthropophagic" movement through which de-ruminate, assimilate and deglutinate and transfigure the European culture so that it can take on the local character of afrolaranjeirense identity.

AB  - This article analyzes the interventions of monuments that occurred in conjunction with the mass 2019-2020 anti-neoliberal protests in Chile where almost 400 monuments representing Spanish conquerors and colonial and nineteenth-century national heroes were pulled down, contested, or transformed. The article illustrates how a social movement against social injustices and inequalities enacted and engaged with decolonial repertoires of action. It analyzes two performative cases of toppled monuments to Pedro de Valdivia, the leading Spanish conqueror, in the southern cities of Concepcion and Valdivia. It then examines recent debate about the anti-racist and decolonial de-monumentalization trend seen around the world and discusses some particularities of the Latin American case. It concludes by arguing that, although the monument interventions involved spontaneous and effervescent ritualistic affects, they are expressive of decolonial challenges to intertwined and long-standing national memories, calling for reconsideration of our national identities.

AB  - Human activities can accelerate the antibiotic resistome prevalence and pose threats to ecological safety and public health globally. However, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) mobility and dissemination into bacterial pathogens under anthropogenic disturbances are still poorly understood. Here, we used a metagenomic approach to profile the biogeography of ARGs and pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria (PARB) under anthropogenic disturbances along the Yarlung Tsangpo River. Results showed the ARGs was dominated by bacA gene along the Yarlung Tsangpo River on the Tibetan Plateau. The ARG composition was differently impacted by rapid urbanization and dam construction, which urbanization could promote ARGs resistant to sulfonamide and tetracycline, whereas dam construction could elevate the resistance to chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside. Land use pattern was identified as a critical factor influencing ARG composition under anthropogenic disturbances, as it could directly reflect the land degradation level and indicate the inputs of ARG-selective chemicals of different human activities. Moreover, despite of the lack of variation in ARG relative abundance, PARB were highly promoted by anthropogenic activities, indicating increasing ARG dissemination to pathogen. We found that human-impacted environments harbored high proportion of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and the MGE carrying ARGs also increased under anthropogenic disturbances in the pathogenic hosts, which confirmed that anthropogenic activities could promote ARG horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, anthropogenic activities could influence PARB assembly processes. Basically, stochastic processes dominated PARB assembly along the river, and with increasing level of anthropogenic activities, these processes shifted from undominated stochastic processes to dispersal limitation. In summary, this study provides useful strategies in watershed resistome management and reduction of ARG dissemination to pathogens, which should consider the mode and intensity of human activity and its potential influence on horizontal gene transfer and assembly processes.

AB  - To contain transmission of COVID-19, lockdowns or strict restrictions of people's mobility outside their residences were instituted in a majority of countries worldwide, including Nepal, where the first phase of nationwide lockdown was observed from 24 March to 21 July 2020. This sudden halt in human outdoor activities brought positive and negative impacts on forests and wildlife. We undertook a study to learn the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on wildlife and forests in the protected areas (PAs) of Nepal. Between July and September 2020, data on illegal activities recorded by the staff of PAs and also those reported by media were collected and analyzed. Key informant interviews (KII) were done with the park officers and security personnel by virtual communication (telephone, messenger app, and video call) to collect detailed information and for corroboration. The collected data were categorized into four groups: (a) wildlife killed, (b) wildlife injured, (c) arrest incidents related to forest crime, and (d) arrest incidents related to wildlife crime. Data from the fiscal year 2019-2020 were analyzed, comparing before lockdown and after. Among 20 PAs investigated during the lockdown, the study found substantial increases in wildlife death in two PAs, Banke National Park, and Bardia National Park. Similarly, Chitwan National Park (CNP) and Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park (SNNP) witnessed a rise in wildlife poaching. CNP and SNNP are located close to densely populated cities and also have human settlements in their peripheries. Wildlife was sighted freely roaming inside PAs during the lockdown, presumably because the absence of visitors and human activities during the lockdown decreased disturbance. Thus, the wildlife was enjoying the freedom of movement on the one hand, and on the other hand was threatened by poachers, many of whom were laid off from other activities and were taking advantage of the lapse in security.

AB  - Throughout the process of transformation since 1999 known as the Bolivarian Revolution, harsh class and food system contradictions have unfolded in Venezuela, pitting against one another the forces of the pervasive consumer culture favoring imported foods, the input-intensive Green Revolution agricultural model that represents a state-led push toward food self-sufficiency, and an emerging agroecological paradigm pushed forward by grassroots movements who have seized political openings through the largely supportive policy environment. The Bolivarian University of Venezuela, itself a product of the revolutionary process, founded the Program Degree in Agroecology in 2004 to expand agroecological practices and knowledge, based on alternative pedagogical approaches. Over the next decade, over a thousand PFG graduates have come to occupy institutional spaces and productive projects in urban and rural areas, contributing to vertical and horizontal agroecological scaling. PDA graduates and educators play a key role in the growing movement of urban agriculture that confronts the economic crisis. The PDA has created key mediators in the form of human talent for territorializing agroecology and institutionalizing pro-peasant policy in Venezuela. As a political outlier, Venezuela is an important case for studying the strategies for territorializing what we refer to as socially committed, situated agroecology.

AB  - Conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles are one of the common safety issues at signalized intersections. Pedestrian Flashing GREEN (FG), a time interval for pedestrians on crosswalks to safely finish crossing before the next phase occurs, may fail to clear the crosswalk in the allotted time, due to significant pedestrian non-compliant behavior. In this manner, probability of pedestrian-vehicle exposures increases when non-compatible vehicle flows are released at the next immediate phase. This paper seeks to address this issue by presenting a traffic signal control strategy for urban traffic networks that aims to minimize vehicle traveling delay (increase efficiency) as well as pedestrian crossing risk (increase safety). First, a macroscopic model for pedestrian-vehicle mixed-flow networks is proposed. Considering the high-incidence rate of pedestrian violations during FG, an additional Dynamic All RED (DAR) phase is introduced at the end of each FG period, whose duration is adaptively adjusted according to the number of non-compliant pedestrians. With computational complexity being a concern for our model, an evolutionary algorithm with repairing mechanism (EARM), is proposed to solve our problem. Case studies are provided to illustrate the potential impact of the pedestrian movement to the vehicle traffic networks when pedestrian safety is considered in the system, as well as the efficacy of our traffic light control strategy for pedestrians and vehicles on risk reduction.

AB  - Global concerns have been observed due to the outbreak and lockdown causal-based COVID-19, and hence, a global pandemic was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. The Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia acts to moderate the spread of COVID-19 through the enacted measures. Furthermore, massive industrial, agricultural activities and human encroachment were significantly reduced following the MCO guidelines. In this study, first, a reconnaissance survey was carried out on the effects of MCO on the health conditions of two urban rivers (i.e., Rivers of Klang and Penang) in Malaysia. Secondly, the effect of MCO lockdown on the water quality index (WQI) of a lake (Putrajaya Lake) in Malaysia is considered in this study. Finally, four machine learning algorithms have been investigated to predict WQI and the class in Putrajaya Lake. The main observations based on the analysis showed that noticeable enhancements of varying degrees in the WQI had occurred in the two investigated rivers. With regard to Putrajaya Lake, there is a significant increase in the WQI Class I, from 24% in February 2020 to 94% during the MCO month of March 2020. For WQI prediction, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) outperformed other models in predicting the changes in the index with a high level of accuracy. For sensitivity analysis results, it is shown that NH3-N and COD play vital rule and contributing significantly to predicting the class of WQI, followed by BOD, while the remaining three parameters (i.e. pH, DO, and TSS) exhibit a low level of importance.

AB  - The visibility of young people in climate change debates has risen significantly since the inception of the Fridays for Future movement, but little is known about the diversity of positions, perspectives and experiences of young people in Ireland, especially with respect to climate change adaptation planning. To close this knowledge gap, this article first interrogates key emergent spaces of public participation within the arena of climate action in Ireland in order to identify the extent of young people's participation and whether any specific consideration is given to disadvantaged groups. It then tests the impacts of workshops specifically designed to support disadvantaged young people's engagement with climate change adaptation which were rolled out with a designated Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) school in inner-city Dublin, Ireland. We found limited attention to public participation in climate change adaptation planning generally, with even less consideration given to engaging young people from disadvantaged communities. However, positive impacts with respect to enhanced knowledge of climate change science and policy processes emerged following participation in the workshops, providing the bedrock for a greater sense of self-efficacy around future engagement with climate action amongst the young people involved. We conclude that what is needed to help ensure procedural justice around climate action in Ireland are specific, relevant and interactive educational interventions on the issue of climate change adaptation; interventions which are sensitive to matters of place and difference.

AB  - This is a case study of the movement of noble elites in the Iberian kingdoms during the late Middle Ages. By the end of the fourteenth century, many Portuguese nobles sought exile in the kingdom of Castile where they achieved successful careers and advanced socially and politically. The aim of this article is to examine a case study of this process, focussing on a middle rank noble family, that of the Fonsecas, that took residence in the city of Toro, after the exile in Castile of Queen Beatriz. One curious aspect of this family is that many of its members were successful ecclesiastics, that occupied numerous episcopal sees in the kingdom of Castile, and were also influential in the papal court. This case study will centre on one of the lesser famous of these ecclesiastics, Alonso de Fonseca, who was bishop of Avila, Cuenca and Osma. Special attention is given to the political aspects of his career in the city of Toro, and to his project of social and political promotion of his bastard son, Gutierre de Fonseca who became one of the most influential members of the noble oligarchy of Toro, especially after the defeat of the Comuneros, against which he fought.

AB  - Air movement affects thermal comfort both by increasing evaporative loss through the skin and heat transfer between the body and surrounding environment through convection. Generally, in cold climates, it is best to avoid wind to better control the thermal environment. However, crafted passive airflow is essential for providing fresh air and natural ventilation at certain times of year. The use of a window of the right size and location in a cold climate is also indispensable. In this study, the wind speed was calculated for the height of a residential building in the city of Tabriz. A computational fluid dynamics simulation was used to calculate the inflow air speed for each window and the comfort conditions were compared. The findings determined the months where window openings can be used to enhance thermal comfort. The analysis shows how the direction and shape of the window play a major role in directing outdoor air flow indoors at the right time in the right quantity. East- and west-facing windows are most favorable and north- and south-facing windows can only be used in some months. This shows how building designers can quantify the effect of window design in each climate for the occupant's comfort.

AB  - Urbanization and automobile-oriented development have resulted in a significant increase in vehicular trips towards central business district (CBD) areas, consequently increasing the demand for on-street parking. In many Indian cities, on-street parking demand is regulated by an odd-even date on-street parking scheme. Under this scheme, sidewalks are subjected to fully and partially confined boundaries, affecting pedestrian movement and the level of service (LOS). Therefore, it becomes imperative to study the influence of on-street parking on pedestrian characteristics to design efficient pedestrian facilities. Pedestrian flow data were collected at three study sites in the CBD areas of three major metropolitan cities of Gujarat, India, using a videography technique. Investigation revealed an 18% reduction in walking speed for parking sidewalk face (PSF) compared to non-parking sidewalk face (NPSF), attributed to the variation in density and presence of parked vehicles. The influence of parked vehicles probed for a similar set of pedestrian densities revealed a 14% reduction in walking speed for PSF compared to NPSF. For the same geometric attributes of the sidewalk, PSF had a deteriorated pedestrian LOS at a given average condition, promulgating the need to develop separate LOS thresholds for PSF and NPSF. Based on the developed speed-density relationships for PSF and NPSF, the Monte-Carlo simulation was performed to facilitate the development of LOS thresholds. Based on the developed LOS thresholds and cumulative percentile plots, the study recommends LOS B as the design service level for sidewalks in the CBD area characterized by on-street parking.

The capital of the Eastern Province was occupied by Portuguese troops in 1817 and formally incorporated in 1821, by means of an Extraordinary Congress, into the territory of the Portuguese Braganza Monarchy. Because of this, when the Second Liberal Revolution triumphed in Spain in 1820, and the first Portuguese one in August of the same year, the province joined the Portuguese constitutionalist movement and became the Cisplatine Province. In these pages we will see how the process of incorporation into the Brigantine Monarchy took place and how Montevideo experienced the disputes between King Joao VI and the Prince Regent, while the latter was planning the Brazilian declaration of independence throughout the year 1822.

AB  - The Philippines is a highly Christianized country where religious events, such as the Black Nazarene procession, are celebrated on a massive scale. The annual procession, characterized by devotees pushing the carriage of the Black Nazarene, in the city of Manila attracts thousands of devotees. The 2019 procession took 21.35 h to traverse a 6.94-km route at an average speed of 0.33 km per hour. The extreme size and density of attending crowds make injuries and fatalities a common occurrence. Despite the usual risks that similar events entail, limited studies have been conducted to characterize and evaluate big crowds. This study developed methods and policies that aim to improve risk management planning for the event. Using video graphics, a static grid analysis was performed to systematically evaluate and capture actual participants' density and speed. The aggressiveness, density, and group formation of devotees at varying road widths were found to significantly influence the procession's movement throughout its duration; at least 56 pedestrians are needed to push the carriage from behind for smoother forward movement. Finally, proper allocation of human resources by local government departments involved in event management was recommended to potentially minimize the incidence of related injuries and deaths.

AB  - The West Sumatra region is an earthquake-prone region with a high-intensity scale. One of the earthquakes occurred on September 28, 2009. The earthquake triggered a ground movement in the form of surface faults and liquefaction phenomena. Surface fault structures are challenging to detect due to tropical climatic conditions with high weathering and dense settlements. Several measurements of Ground Penetrating Radar are carried out to study the geological structure below the surface after an earthquake. The study was conducted around the city of Padang. Data processing is performed using MATGPR software. Based on the results of the GPR analysis, several subsurface structures were found due to the Padang earthquake that were continuously and detected up to the surface. Some subsurface structures detected by GPR are not continuous to the surface. There is a possible relationship between the phenomenon of surface faults and liquefaction.

AB  - Thermal retrofitting implementations are crucial for safeguarding the functional sustainability of historical buildings as they can improve the thermal performance of these buildings while maintaining thermal comfort for their occupants. This study aims to examine the thermal behavior of a common historical building type in Anatolia / Turkey, the traditional houses with exterior hall (sofa), and to determine enhancement potentials of possible thermal interventions. Research method consists of on-site thermal measurements, laboratory analyses on traditional construction materials and transient thermal analyses utilizing simulations on DesignBuilder software. Study cases were selected from both urban and rural sub settlements. The results demonstrated that the thermal insulation works within floor assemblies, airtightness measures, adding secondary glazing to windows and suggesting transparent circulation corridors provide significant energy improvements. These interventions would save 26.5% of building energy consumption in the urban and 30.4% in the rural sub-settlements when applied together. Furthermore, when the integration of a modern HVAC system, ground-source heat pump is implemented, these improvement rates can be increased to more than 60%. Consequently, it was determined that the cases have significant potentials for thermal enhancements which renders the application of thermal interventions as a capable conservation tool.

AB  - In recent years, two apparently different and unconnected problems have received repeated attention from global news outlets, namely the opioid crisis and the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. The opioid crisis, which is especially catastrophic in the United States, involves the over-prescription and abuse of synthetic opioid painkillers such as oxycontin and fentanyl (Felter, 2020). The pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong involves legions of protesters, many of them university students, taking to the streets against what they see as the erosion of their civil liberties at the hands of the mainland Chinese government (Perper, 2019). How can these two issues possibly be connected? This paper tells the story of how the world's first great opioid crisis occurred in nineteenth-century China, and how the drug trafficking British thwarted the Chinese government's attempts to stop drug imports, fighting two wars in the process. Upon conclusion of the first of these wars, China was forced to cede the territory of Hong Kong. This British colonial outpost became the principle entrepot for British opium entering the Chinese market. Over the next century and a half, Hong Kong grew into one of the world's most dynamic commercial cities, and its citizens enjoyed liberties under British rule that were not available to the mainland Chinese population. Thus, the legacy of the opium wars and the British opium trade to China is still very much with us today.

AB  - There was an outbreak of Dengue fever on September 5, 2019, in Hainan Province, which has not been endemic for 28 years. We aim to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of the 2019 outbreak in Hainan Province and identify the cause. All type 1 Dengue fever cases that occurred in this outbreak of Hainan exhibited mild clinical symptoms. The epidemiological investigations indicate that the outbreak might originate from workers in the Xiuying area, Haikou City, form a concentrated outbreak, and then spread out. Bayesian phylogenies results and epidemiological data were used to infer a likely series of events for the dengue virus's potential spread and trace the possible sources. The strains' sequences were close to a sequence from the nearby Guangdong province, supporting the hypothesis that the dengue virus was imported from Guangdong province and then spread across Hainan province. Furthermore, it is interesting that two other strains didn't group with this cluster, suggesting that additional introduction pathways might exist. The study indicated that the dengue fever epidemic presented two important modes in Hainan. Firstly, epidemics prevalence was caused by imported cases, and then endogenous epidemics broke out in the natural epidemic focus.

AB  - The social dynamics that emerged at the beginning of the twentieth century began to change and diversify in the middle. This change, which produced similar reflections in different working disciplines, was reflected in the form pluralism of architecture. Just as in the theory of knowledge, there were processes leading to poststructuralism, neoliberalism in politics, and globalization in the economy; also, pluralism, i.e. postmodernism has been experienced in architecture. This process began in the 1950s, and was clearly seen between 1970s and 1980s. Postmodernism is a movement that is rooted in modernism, nourished by the state of modernism being new to what is old. However, post-modernism advances have now shown that new things need to be done for the environment, which is shaped according to the conditions of the period, and that the old one was no longer valid. During the same period, disciplines that made their self-enquiries, including architecture, began to establish analogies with language. This was reflected in architecture as formal pluralism, but also as an architectural object, a product of discourse and the basis of new discourses. As a result, form pluralism was achieved in architectural shaping by indirect form references. These references take advantage of the characteristics of anything historical or non-historical. The City's Nisantasi Shopping Center, which makes references to the past to give "the feeling of always being there" in line with design decisions, was examined as a commercial, social and architectural object. The (shopping) center has tried to find a place within the old commercial fictions with a number of formulas developed. For this purpose, as a result of design decisions and some administrative decisions, diversification has occurred in the region's user base. This has had important impacts to the use of the area and (shopping) center in terms of social relations. In the article, after examining the social environment created by the location of the center, which in many respects links between the old and the new, the (shopping) center was examined as an architectural object. In the area where luxury mansions were built during the first settlement period and luxury apartments and shops were shaped after the architectural trends developed in the country; references to the former were made in order to make the center accepted as an architectural object. Of these references, the 1st National Architectural Movement was consciously applied. This concept of design leads us to the postmodern architectural trend in terms of style. However, the monumental, rationalist and unadorned appearance of the structure also refers to the 2nd National Architectural Movement. Therefore, the results of contemporary architecture designed in the old settlement center were analyzed in different areas.

AB  - Increasing background salinity in watersheds has largely been attributed to road salt retention in groundwaters due to their long residence times. However, laboratory studies demonstrate that soils temporarily store salts, either in porewater or adsorbed onto particles. Field studies of road salt retention in soils are nevertheless rare, and mechanisms of salt transport across multiple hydrological reservoirs (e.g., from soil to groundwater) are unknown. Thus, we collected roadside soil porewater and karst spring water weekly for similar to 1.5 yr to determine salt transport through the vadose zone into the phreatic zone. We observed dual retention mechanisms of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) in soils due to slow porewater movement, causing ion movement through the soil as slow as 1.3 cm/day, and cation exchange processes, leading to initial Na+ retention followed by later release months after application. Cation exchange processes also caused base cation loss fromexchange sites intomobile porewater. RapidNa(+) and Cl- delivery to groundwater occurred through karst conduits during thewinter. However, elevated background levels of salt ions in groundwater during the non-saltingmonths indicated accumulation in the catchment due to slower porewater flow in the soil and rock matrix and delayed Na+ release fromsoil exchange sites.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has induced unprecedented reductions in human mobility and social contacts throughout the world. Because dengue virus (DENV) transmission is strongly driven by human mobility, behavioral changes associated with the pandemic have been hypothesized to impact dengue incidence. By discouraging human contact, COVID-19 control measures have also disrupted dengue vector control interventions, the most effective of which require entry into homes. We sought to investigate how and why dengue incidence could differ under a lockdown scenario with a proportion of the population sheltered at home. Methodology & principal findings We used an agent-based model with a realistic treatment of human mobility and vector control. We found that a lockdown in which 70% of the population sheltered at home and which occurred in a season when a new serotype invaded could lead to a small average increase in cumulative DENV infections of up to 10%, depending on the time of year lockdown occurred. Lockdown had a more pronounced effect on the spatial distribution of DENV infections, with higher incidence under lockdown in regions with higher mosquito abundance. Transmission was also more focused in homes following lockdown. The proportion of people infected in their own home rose from 54% under normal conditions to 66% under lockdown, and the household secondary attack rate rose from 0.109 to 0.128, a 17% increase. When we considered that lockdown measures could disrupt regular, city-wide vector control campaigns, the increase in incidence was more pronounced than with lockdown alone, especially if lockdown occurred at the optimal time for vector control. Conclusions & significance Our results indicate that an unintended outcome of lockdown measures may be to adversely alter the epidemiology of dengue. This observation has important implications for an improved understanding of dengue epidemiology and effective application of dengue vector control. When coordinating public health responses during a syndemic, it is important to monitor multiple infections and understand that an intervention against one disease may exacerbate another.
   Author summary Dengue virus causes substantial suffering in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, with roughly 400 million infections and 40,000 deaths each year. In 2020, we witnessed unprecedented changes in human movement as the world tried to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including in countries that regularly experience dengue epidemics, such as Thailand and Peru. These changes could affect transmission of dengue virus, though it is unclear whether transmission will decrease, as people reduce their movements between houses, or increase, as people spend more time at home and campaigns to control the mosquito vector of dengue virus are interrupted. We used a simulation model to estimate the impact of these changes on dengue virus transmission. Our model describes the locations of buildings and the movement of people between them, allowing us to directly estimate what happens when human movement patterns change. We found that as people spend more time at home, transmission is likely to increase moderately. If these changes also lead to disruption to vector control, the magnitude of the increase is greater. Our results reinforce concerns about the complexity of public health responses to multiple overlapping epidemics and support the need for policy makers and health authorities to think holistically in their intervention planning.

AB  - Humanity is currently confronted with a new, unknown, highly contagious virus, where social isolation and increased personal hygiene seem to be the main means in preventing its spread. The world economy is very threatened by the new situation, which has not bypassed the energy sector either. The mortality rate is relatively high, people are not leaving their homes, which is directly reflected in the increase of the energy consumption in the residential sector. The same is valid for water consumption. For a household located in Kragujevac (Central Serbia), 4 simulation scenarios were analyzed (S1 - reference case, S2 - mild protection measures, S3 - semi-quarantine measures, S4 - complete quarantine) to assess the link between people's behavior (on the one hand) and the consumption of natural gas, electricity and water (on the other hand), in the residential sector, in unforeseen circumstances, such as the COVID-19 virus pandemic. The analysis was conducted numerically for the month of March 2020, using EnergyPlus software packages. In defining the above scenarios, a one-minute time step schedule of people's behavior was used, taking into account the number of family members in the household, their age, occupation, lifestyle, habits (all in accordance with cultural and socio-economic circumstances), as well as the measures taken by the Government of the Republic of Serbia to fight the pandemic. Also, an analysis of energy consumption at the level of the city of Kragujevac for the past three years was made, based on data obtained from public companies - distributors (thermal energy, natural gas, electricity, water). In this paper, an analysis of air quality for the same time period was conducted, which is closely related to energy consumption and limited population movement. The simulatinos show that the consumption of natural gas can increase by 21.26% (S2), electricity by 58.39% (S4), and the consumption of water from the city water supply network by 25.45% (S3) compared to the reference case (S1). On the other hand, based on the invoice for payment of services to distributors, the actual energy consumption that was made on the analyzed house during the month of March 2020 was: natural gas (260.36 Sm-3), electricity (1418 kWh), and water (22.5 m(3)). The conducted economic analysis showed that the largest funds at the level of the entire facility were allocated in S3 (27.33% more than in S1), and that the actual costs were 15.09% higher than in S1, and 16.41% lower than in S2.

TI  - An Online Semisupervised Learning Model for Pedestrians' Crossing Intention Recognition of Connected Autonomous Vehicle Based on Mobile Edge Computing Applications
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA  - English
AB  - One of the major challenges that connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are facing today is driving in urban environments. To achieve this goal, CAVs need to have the ability to understand the crossing intention of pedestrians. However, for autonomous vehicles, it is quite challenging to understand pedestrians' crossing intentions. Because the pedestrian is a very complex individual, their intention to cross the street is affected by the weather, the surrounding traffic environment, and even his own emotions. If the established street crossing intention recognition model cannot be updated in real time according to the diversity of samples, the efficiency of human-machine interaction and the interaction safety will be greatly affected. Based on the above problems, this paper established a pedestrian crossing intention model based on the online semisupervised support vector machine algorithm ((OSVM)-V-3). In order to verify the effectiveness of the model, this paper collects a large amount of pedestrian crossing data and vehicle movement data based on laser scanner, and determines the main feature components of the model input through feature extraction and principal component analysis (PCA). The comparison results of recognition accuracy of SVM, (SVM)-V-3, and (OSVM)-V-3 indicate that the proposed (OSVM)-V-3 model exhibits a better ability to recognize pedestrian crossing intentions than the SVM and (SVM)-V-3 models, and the accuracy achieves 94.83%. Therefore, the (OSVM)-V-3 model can reduce the number of labeled samples for training the classifier and improve the recognition accuracy.

AB  - This article addresses one of the least studied issues of the Great Patriotic War - German special services and collaborative security agencies using their agent assets in the occupied territory of the Kursk region. The chronological frameworks of the study cover the period from the seizure of the Kursk region by German troops to its liberation by the Red Army units. The corpus of sources on the subject is extremely limited. The authors draw on the materials of archival investigatory records on former active accomplices of the German occupiers from among Soviet citizens, who throughout the post-war period were actively sought out by the Soviet state security organs. Among the defendants in this category of cases were former leaders, their assistants, senior investigators of the city and district departments of the Russian auxiliary police, created under direct supervision of the German occupation authorities in the territory. Analysis of archival investigatory records shows that the vast majority of heads of collaborative repressive bodies (police, gendarmerie, prisons) joined the German invaders consciously and voluntarily. This circumstance contributed to their zealous service to German invaders. In order to prove their allegiance to the German command and to avoid punishment for failure, these officials actively recruited secret informants - their agents. These agents were mostly recruited from local residents who, for various reasons, agreed to cooperate with the leaders of Russian police agencies. The tasks of the agents included timely information on the anti-Nazi underground, Soviet intelligence, leaders of and participants in the partisan movement in the occupied territory of the Kursk region in 1941-43. Quite often, agents were used by the directors of city and district prisons, which were opened by the German occupational commandant's offices in the region. Information about secret agents was carefully guarded. All agents were on allowance from the territorial bodies of the Russian auxiliary police. Due to scope and activity levels of the partisan movement in the occupied territory of the Kursk region, pro-Nazi agents were most active in the Valuyki, Grayvoron, Dmitriev, Rylsk, Sudzha, Shchigry, Shebekino districts.

AB  - Biodiversity and economic losses resulting from invasive plant pests and pathogens are increasing globally. For these impacts and threats to be managed effectively, appropriate methods of surveillance, detection and identification are required. Botanical gardens provide a unique opportunity for biosecurity as they accommodate diverse collections of exotic and native plant species. These gardens are also often located close to high-risk sites of accidental invasions such as ports and urban areas. This, coupled with routine activities such as the movement of plants and plant material, and visits by millions of people each year, place botanical gardens at risk to the arrival and establishment of pests and pathogens. Consequently, botanical gardens can pose substantial biosecurity risks to the environment, by acting as bridgeheads for pest and pathogen invasions. Here we review the role of botanical gardens in biosecurity on a global scale. The role of botanical gardens has changed over time. Initially, they were established as physic gardens (gardens with medicinal plants), and their links with academic institutions led to their crucial role in the accumulation and dissemination of botanical knowledge. During the second half of the 20th century, botanical gardens developed a strong focus on plant conservation, and in recent years there has been a growing acknowledgement of their value in biosecurity research as sentinel sites to identify pest and pathogen risks (novel pest-host associations); for early detection and eradication of pests and pathogens; and for host range studies. We identify eight specific biosecurity hazards associated with botanical gardens and note potential management interventions and the opportunities these provide for improving biosecurity. We highlight the value of botanical gardens for biosecurity and plant health research in general, and the need for strategic thinking, resources, and capacity development to make them models for best practices in plant health.

AB  - Salento Peninsula (Apulia, southern Italy) is characterised by many active sinkholes, which represent the main geological hazard. The stretch of coastline between the village of Casalabate and Le Cesine wildlife reserve is highly affected, with a system of dunes separating the low beach from extensive wetlands, which were subject to uncontrolled urban development after reclamation. The overall morphology is characterized by flat topography, whilst from a hydrogeological standpoint, the mixing of inland freshwater with advancing brackish water favours the higher aggressivity with respect to soluble rocks, and the development of enhanced dissolution (hyperkarst). The relict landscapes within the protected areas still allow for the recognition of actively occurring sinkholes, which cause damage to houses, the road network and infrastructures. In this article the case of Aquatina di Frigole is described, where in the last 15 years numerous sinkholes have formed, with the processes still in rapid evolution. Detailed surveys allow for to identification of the mechanisms of sinkhole formation (suffusion sinkholes), the deriving cluster, and the main hydrogeological links among the different water bodies in the area. Acquatina di Frigole provides an excellent natural laboratory to observe development and evolution of sinkholes, and their relationships with the stratigraphic and hydrogeological elements.

AB  - Based on hourly high-density precipitation data in Guangdong Province, China, 134 warm-sector heavy rainfall (WSHR) events were selected from 2016 to 2018. The synoptic weather patterns of these WSHR events were objectively classified using T-mode principal component analysis. Six WSHR weather patterns were identified, as follows: Type 1-southwest (T1-SW), Type 2-southeast (T2-SE), Type 3-coastal jets I (T3-CJI), Type 4-coastal jets II (T4-CJ II), Type 5-western low vortex (T5-WL), and Type 6-high-pressure (T6-HP). Three high-occurrence WSHR centers were finally extracted: the areas of Yangjiang and Shanwei, and the urban agglomeration of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Compared with the other five patterns, T6-HP is a newly identified WSHR weather pattern, which is related to a local/small-scale weather system in the context of anomalous northward movement of the western Pacific subtropical high. Notably, the precipitation area of the T6-HP type of WSHR event is smaller, which can only be captured by high-density observations. In addition, the occurrence locations of six large-scale extreme precipitation events were closely associated with the urban agglomerations in GBA, implying that urbanization plays an important role in extreme magnitudes of large-scale WSHR events and their occurrence centers.

AB  - The Regional Connector Transit Corridor (RCTC) project consists of an 89-m long, 17.7-m wide, and 11-m high span crossover cavern constructed beneath critical infrastructure using the sequential excavation method (SEM) at relatively shallow depth (15 m below ground surface) in downtown Los Angeles. The cavern construction involved a complex three-drift, two-sidewall configuration and was excavated in the Fernando formation, a weak clayey siltstone. This paper presents a comprehensive case study of the cavern excavation and initial support construction. The performance of the urban SEM was assessed and complex ground behavior was examined once per excavation step during the construction process. The overall average surface settlement was 20 mm and the largest single-stage incremental movements occurred in the center bench and invert excavation, accounting for 30%-40% of the total deformation. The subsurface experienced less differential settlement during the side drift excavations due to the ovate excavation profile and the restriction from surrounding infrastructure. The measured center crown vertical displacement varied between 5 and 10 mm and the center invert initial support was recorded to heave 8-12 mm. A systematic procedure was developed to apply a deliberate observational method. The lessons learned support that appropriate real-time analysis improves the quality of regular data review, continuously updating the knowledge of risk and enabling prompt adaptions and optimizations of the design and construction along the SEM tunneling process.

AB  - Formation of the inversion layer causes a lack of vertical movement of the atmosphere and the occurrence of long-lasting high concentrations of pollution. The new invention makes use of shock waves, created by explosions of a mixture of flammable gases and air. These shock waves destroy the structure of the temperature inversion layer in the atmosphere and restore natural convection. Restoring vertical movements within the atmosphere causes a reduction in air pollution at the ground level. The system was tested at full technical scale in the environment. Preliminary effects indicate an average 24% reduction in PM10 concentration in the smog layer at ground level up to 20 m, with the device operating in 11-min series consisting of 66 explosions. It was also shown that the device is able to affect a larger area, at least 4 km(2).

AB  - The common radionuclide Cs-137 is a gamma-ray source term for nuclear reactor accidents, nuclear detonations, and potential radionuclide dispersal devices. For wide-area contamination events, one remediation option integrates water washing activities with on-site treatment of water for its immediate reuse. This remediation option includes washing building and roadways via firehose, collecting the wash water, and passing the contaminated water through chemical filtration beds. The primary objective of this study was to quantify the dose incurred to workers performing a remediation recovery effort for roadways and buildings following a wide-area release event. MicroShield (R) was employed to calculate the dose to workers at the roadway level and to calculate total dose rates while performing washing activities. This study finds that for a realistic contamination scenario for a wide area of a large urban environment, decontamination crews would be subjected to <220 mu Sv per person, much less than the 50,000 mu Sv limit for occupational dose. By extrapolation, one decontamination team of 48 people could continue washing operations on a total of 2.8 km(2) before reaching their incurred annual dose limits. Though it is unrealistic to assign one team that entire area, we can conclude external dose will not limit worker deployment given the range of contamination levels adopted in this study.

AB  - Background Fatal overdoses from opioid use and substance disorders are increasing at an alarming rate. One proposed harm reduction strategy for reducing overdose fatalities is to place overdose prevention sites-commonly known as safe injection facilities-in proximity of locations with the highest rates of overdose. As urban centers in the USA are tackling legal hurdles and community skepticism around the introduction and location of these sites, it becomes increasingly important to assess the magnitude of the effect that these services might have on public health. Methods We developed a mathematical model to describe the movement of people who used opioids to an overdose prevention site in order to understand the impact that the facility would have on overdoses, fatalities, and user education and treatment/recovery. The discrete-time, stochastic model is able to describe a range of user behaviors, including the effects from how far they need to travel to the site. We calibrated the model to overdose data from Philadelphia and ran simulations to describe the effect of placing a site in the Kensington neighborhood. Results In Philadelphia, which has a non-uniform racial population distribution, choice of site placement can determine which demographic groups are most helped. In our simulations, placement of the site in the Kensington neighborhood resulted in White opioid users being more likely to benefit from the site's services. Overdoses that occur onsite can be reversed. Our results predict that for every 30 stations in the overdose prevention site, 6 per year of these would have resulted in fatalities if they had occurred outside of the overdose prevention site. Additionally, we estimate that fatalities will decrease further when referrals from the OPS to treatment are considered. Conclusions Mathematical modeling was used to predict the impact of placing an overdose prevention site in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. To fully understand the impact of site placement, both direct and indirect effects must be included in the analysis. Introducing more than one site and distributing sites equally across neighborhoods with different racial and demographic characteristics would have the broadest public health impact. Cities and locales can use mathematical modeling to help quantify the predicted impact of placing an overdose prevention site in a particular location.

AB  - Background: The recent detection of the South Asian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi in the Horn of Africa (HOA) raises concerns about the impact of this mosquito on malaria transmission in the region. Analysis of An. stephensi genetic diversity and population structure can provide insight into the history of the mosquito in the HOA to improve predictions of future spread. We investigated the genetic diversity of An. stephensi in eastern Ethiopia, where detection suggests a range expansion into this region, in order to understand the history of this invasive population.
   Methods: We sequenced the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome B gene (CytB) in 187 An. stephensi collected from 10 sites in Ethiopia in 2018. Population genetic, phylogenetic, and minimum spanning network analyses were conducted for Ethiopian sequences. Molecular identification of blood meal sources was also performed using universal vertebrate CytB sequencing.
   Results: Six An. stephensi COI-CytB haplotypes were observed, with the highest number of haplotypes in the northeastern sites (Semera, Bati, and Gewana towns) relative to the southeastern sites (Kebridehar, Godey, and Degehabur) in eastern Ethiopia. We observed population differentiation, with the highest differentiation between the northeastern sites compared to central sites (Erer Gota, Dire Dawa, and Awash Sebat Kilo) and the southeastern sites. Phylogenetic and network analysis revealed that the HOA An. stephensi are more genetically similar to An. stephensi from southern Asia than from the Arabian Peninsula. Finally, molecular blood meal analysis revealed evidence of feeding on cows, goats, dogs, and humans, as well as evidence of multiple (mixed) blood meals.
   Conclusion: We show that An. stephensi is genetically diverse in Ethiopia and with evidence of geographical structure. Variation in the level of diversity supports the hypothesis for a more recent introduction of An. stephensi into southeastern Ethiopia relative to the northeastern region. We also find evidence that supports the hypothesis that HOA An. stephensi populations originate from South Asia rather than the Arabian Peninsula. The evidence of both zoophagic and anthropophagic feeding support the need for additional investigation into the potential for livestock movement to play a role in vector spread in this region.

TI  - The changes of the number and regional distribution of dentists and dental institutions 9 years after the implementation of postgraduate year training program for dentists in Taiwan
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL SCIENCES

KW  - Surplus of dentists
KW  - Uneven regional distribution
KW  - Postgraduate year training program for dentists
AB  - Background/purpose: In Taiwan, there are three major dentist occupation problems: a surplus of dentists, an uneven regional distribution of dentists, and a concentration of dentists in the metropolitan areas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distributions of the population and dentists in each city or county in 2001, 2010 and 2019 to further analyze the changes of regional distributions of dentists 9 years after the implementation of postgraduate year training program for dentists (PGYD) in 2010 in Taiwan.
   Materials and methods: This study collected the data of population, the number of dentists in each city or county in 2001, 2010 and 2019, and the numbers of dentists and dental institutions from 2001 to 2019 for evaluating the changes of regional distributions of dentists 9 years after the PGYD implementation in Taiwan.
   Results: Nine years after the PGYD implementation, the uneven distribution of dentists persisted. The number of dentists still increased and dentists were more concentrated in municipalities than in non-municipalities in Taiwan. Moreover, the number of dental institutions increased slowly, but dental institutions tended to become larger.
   Conclusion: Because the PGYD system is not mandatory, dentists choose their practice locations as driven by the market factors. The increase in the average number of dentists in dental institutions is also driven by the market factors. The market-driven movement of dentists to the people-concentrated municipalities finally persist the imbalance of dentist distribution in Taiwan. This situation also enables the development of large-scale dental institutions in municipalities in Taiwan. (C) 2020 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China.

AB  - The population at risk from sudden hazards, such as volcanic eruptions, is often estimated based on the location of the residents. Crisis management tools, such as evacuation and emergency plans, are usually based on this information. Therefore, they often do not reflect over- and underpopulation in areas where the present population is different from the resident population at the time of the crisis. In the context of data scarcity that characterises Goma city (North Kivu, DRC), the results of the spatial analysis presented in this paper allowed the population to be located hour by hour on each day of the week. The dual movement of those leaving and those arriving in Goma made it possible to establish the temporal variations of the total population located in Goma. The variations are similar on all weekdays but differ for Sundays. Moreover, the spatio-temporal location of the population over time appeared to be strongly influenced by the activity rhythm of the city's vital infrastructures. In other words, areas where commercial activities, employment, and schools are concentrated, are crowded during working hours, while areas with a predominantly residential character become depopulated at these times. Therefore, the various areas of Goma could be impacted differently by sudden natural hazards. If their occupancy is poorly known, the safety of the population and the satisfaction of their expectations are difficult to predict accurately. Modelling these spatio-temporal variations of the population is crucial information for quantifying the resources needed to manage a future sudden crisis in Goma.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a study of the Novosibirsk Tin Plant influence on the level of tin content in the environment in the southern Western Siberia. Based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and the tin content in the atmospheric precipitation that falls in 2014-2018 at the radius of 200 km from the emission source, it has been found that 90% of the precipitation events with an increased tin content and 75% and 82% of all Sn fluxes fallen, respectively, in warm and cold seasons were brought to the study area by air masses previously passed over the territory of the Novosibirsk Tin Plant. During the period of observation (from April 2014 to October 2018), the mean, median and weighted mean values of tin concentrations in atmospheric precipitation in the Southern Western Siberia were 0.25; 0.11 and 0.17 mu g L-1, respectively. A significantly higher volume-weighted mean concentration of Sn was in cold period due to high sorption activity of snowflakes, but atmospheric deposition fluxes of tin were slightly higher in the warm period due to the more abundant precipitation and the larger number of events. The contamination factor calculated relative to the background territory (Valdai National Park, European part of Russia) showed that atmospheric precipitation collected at the southern Western Siberia is moderately contaminated with Sn. The main factors controlling the fluxes of Sn (emitted from the Novosibirsk Tin Plant) on the territory of the south of Western Siberia are the direction of the surface air masses movement, the frequency and abundance of precipitation, as well as the seasonal features of tin distribution in the system air-precipitation.

CP  - 1st International Seminar on Civil and Environmental Engineering (ISCEE) - Robust Infrastructure Resilient to Natural Disaster
AB  - Liquefaction is a rare natural disaster and is very closely related to geotechnical engineering, where it occurred i\n the city of Palu in 2018 ago. One of the Palu liquefaction areas is Lolu Village, which experiences a sizeable lateral movement of up to 150 m. The research aims to identify the potential liquefaction in Lolu Village using the Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data and grain size distribution test. In evaluating liquefaction potential, the CPT data is processed with the Idriss-Boulanger method, referring to the value of soil safety factors based on the ratio between ground resistance to liquefaction (CRR) and earthquake (CSR). Whereas grain size distribution tests are carried out based on ASTM, referring to soil type composition's influence on the level of liquefaction potential. The results from eight CPT in Lolu village shows that liquefaction potential occurs at a depth of 5 to 10 m with varying end resistance and friction ratio values of the soil. Likewise, grain size distribution tests indicate that soil types are dominated by sandy soils vulnerable to liquefaction.

AB  - Refugeeness is defined not only by displacement, whether of individuals or of groups, but also by complex everyday social practices, aimed at building up social relations, developing networks and redefining identities. In this sense, refugeeness amounts to taking place and occupying space. Based on a detailed ethnography of Keezhputhupattu refugee camp, located just a few kilometres away from Pondicherry, this study will analyse the ways Sri Lankan refugees confront and invest the various spaces they occupy. This will enable us to rethink the classic vision of refugee camps as spaces of exception offered by Agamben, as well as to reflect on the sociospatial effects of a triple dynamic of displacement, emplacement and replacement. Poor living conditions, inadequate dole, and restriction of movement made camp life unbearable for the refugees. Nevertheless, this threefold dynamic reveals ordinary acts of resistance, as well as the agency of the refugees that make it possible to transgress daily hegemonies and allows us to think about their belonging to the city, i.e. their urbanity, in the best possible way.

AB  - Through a multi-method qualitative case study, I examine the failed 2016 ballot campaign of the Committee for Professional Policing (CfPP), a police accountability group in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In attempting to make Minneapolis the first city nationwide to require police to carry professional liability insurance, the CfPP turned the logic of Malcolm M. Feeley and Jonathan Simon's "new penology" paradigm onto police. Their thesis argues that a contemporary penal shift occurred away from rehabilitation toward managing aggregates of dangerous criminal categories through risk management approaches. I extend their thesis in a new direction by examining how-in the emerging age of "algorithmic risk governance"-social movement organizations, like the CfPP, are starting to invert the new penology onto criminal justice personnel. In flipping the script, the CfPP called for a new private insurance market using mandatory police misconduct insurance to manage aggregates of dangerous police officers. After highlighting how the CfPP developed new penological objectives, discourses, and technologies, I discuss the implications of grassroots groups adopting and redefining traditional penal logics and propose future research avenues.

The results were as follows: 1) Securing expandable space is highly beneficial for households with young children, especially when they utilize mostly the extended space for daily living. And asouth-facing arrangement is important to ensure comfort. 2) In plans for child-rearing households, it is necessary to secure enough storage space in consideration of the increase in the amount of necessary storage due to the children's growth. 3) Restricted arrangement of household spaces to reduce movement is effective in supporting childcare. 4) It is desirable to design aspace to support residents so that they can utilize and modify it according to their needs, which change over time according to the age of their children.

AB  - The Jalpatagua fault in Guatemala accommodates dextral movement of the Central America forearc. We present new global positioning system (GPS) data, minor fault analysis, geochronological analyses, and analysis of lineaments to characterize deformation along the fault and near its terminations. Our data indicate that the Jalpatagua fault terminates at both ends into extensional regions. The western termination occurs near the Amatitlan caldera and the southern extension of the Guatemala City graben, as no through-going structures were observed to continue west into the active volcanic arc. Along the Jalpatagua fault, new and updated GPS site velocities are consistent with a slip rate of 7.1 +/- 1.8 mm yr(-1). Minor faulting along the central section of the fault includes: (1) N-S-striking normal faults accommodating E-W elongation; and (2) four sets of strike-slip faults (oriented 330 degrees, 020 degrees, 055 degrees, and 295 degrees, parallel to the Jalpatagua fault trace). Minor fault arrays support dextral movement along a major fault in the orientation of the Jalpatagua fault. GPS and fault data indicate that the Jalpatagua fault terminates to the east near the Guatemala-El Salvador border. Data delineate a pull-apart basin southeast of the fault termination, which is undergoing transtension as the Jalpatagua fault transitions into the El Salvador fault system to the east. Within the basin, minor faulting and lineations trend to the NW and accommodate NE-directed elongation. This faulting differs from E-W elongation observed along the Jalpatagua fault and is more similar to minor faults within the El Salvador fault system.

AB  - Researchers of museum collections owe a great debt of gratitude to those responsible for curating the collections; however, staff may frequently remain innocently unaware of significant contents within the accessions. Such is a group of flint artefacts in Salisbury Museum, Wiltshire, which were found in 1860 on the outskirts of the city. The collection was rediscovered during unrelated archaeological research and comprises a series of blades, which include refitting components, demonstrating that the artefacts came from undisturbed prehistoric contexts. The blade blanks had been removed from opposed platform cores, using careful core preparation and soft hammer percussion. These characteristics can be most closely paralleled by Upper Palaeolithic Federmesser industries in Europe, which date from the end of the Last Glaciation. The existence of the Upper Palaeolithic was unrecognised at the time the artefacts were found, since when two other contemporary sites have been identified in the River Avon valley as well as others across the country. The newly recognised addition extends the distribution of Upper Palaeolithic activity further up the River Avon valley to Salisbury, where five rivers congregate, providing a convenient point for further dispersal. The finding also mirrors patterns of occupation on well-drained terrace bluffs overlooking the floodplain. Research results have yielded significant data, 160 years after the collection's discovery, expanding current knowledge of the Upper Palaeolithic in the River Avon valley and demonstrating the continued value and potential of collections in our museums.

AB  - Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in humans, primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. We conducted a descriptive analysis of dengue cases from 2009 to 2017 in Medelli ' n, Colombia, using data available from the Secretariat of Health. We analyzed the burden of outbreak years on the healthcare system, risk of cases exhibiting severe illness, potential disease surveillance problems, gender and age as risk factors, and spatio-temporal patterns of disease occurrence. Our data consisted of 50,083 cases, separated based on whether they were diagnostic test negative, diagnostic test positive (primarily IgM ELISA), clinically confirmed, epidemiologically linked, or probable. We used dengue incidence to analyze epidemiological trends between our study years, related to human movement patterns, between gender and age-groups, and spatiotemporally. We used risk to analyze the severity of dengue cases between the study years. We identified human movement could contributed to dengue spread, and male individuals (incidence rate: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76-0.96) and individuals younger than 15 years (incidence rate: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.13-1.34) have higher incidence of dengue and located critical parts of the city where dengue incidence was high. Analysis was limited by participant diagnostic information, data concerning circulating strains, and a lack of phylogenetic information. Understanding the characteristics of dengue is a fundamental part of improving the health outcomes of at-risk populations. This analysis will be useful to support studies and initiatives to counteract dengue and provide context to the surveillance data collected by the health authorities in Medelli ' n.

AB  - Air carries a diverse load of particulate microscopic biological matter in suspension, either aerosolized or aggregated with dust particles, the aerobiome, which is dispersed by winds from sources to sinks. The aerobiome is known to contain microbes, including pathogens, as well as debris or small-sized propagules from plants and animals, but its variability and composition has not been studied comprehensibly. To gain a dynamic insight into the aerobiome existing over a mixed-use dryland setting, we conducted a biologically comprehensive, year-long survey of its composition and dynamics for particles less than 10 mu m in diameter based on quantitative analyses of DNA content coupled to genomic sequencing. Airborne biological loads were more dependent on seasonal events than on meteorological conditions and only weakly correlated with dust loads. Core aerobiome species could be understood as a mixture of high elevation (e.g. Microbacteriaceae, Micrococcaceae, Deinococci), and local plant and soil sources (e.g. Sphingomonas, Streptomyces, Acinetobacter). Despite the mixed used of the land surrounding the sampling site, taxa that contributed to high load events were largely traceable to proximal agricultural practices like cotton and livestock farming. This included not only the predominance of specific crop plant signals over those of native vegetation, but also that of their pathogens (bacterial, viral and eukaryotic). Faecal bacterial loads were also seasonally important, possibly sourced in intensive animal husbandry or manure fertilization activity, and this microbial load was enriched in tetracycline resistance genes. The presence of the native opportunistic pathogen, Coccidioides spp., by contrast, was detected only with highly sensitive techniques, and only rarely. We conclude that agricultural activity exerts a much stronger influence that the native vegetation as a mass loss factor to the land system and as an input to dryland aerobiomes, including in the dispersal of plant, animal and human pathogens and their genetic resistance characteristics.

AB  - The development of a re-understanding or re-investigation of body pedagogy is currently prominent in the field of physical education (PE) and sport pedagogy. This goes for the learning of movement capability and health but also in relation to outdoor education (OE). The latter a criticized area for having a one-size-fits-all approach to curriculum, with less attention to what to learn in OE, including aspects of everyday practices of being outdoors. The aim of this study was to explore students aged 15 years, and their meaning making of being outdoors expressed in written stories about a favorite place. Two school year eight classes in a Swedish compulsory school situated in an area with high diversity participated. Through this theory-generated empirical study, written stories were explored as one way of evaluating students' meaning making of outdoor places. By using practical epistemology analysis (PEA) to examine experience operationalized through aesthetic judgements attention is paid to the relation between the student and the situation (their favorite place). The analysis make it possible to discern a sense and meaning making of "being" outdoors as an embodied experience, as a relational whole of the self, others and the environment. Descriptions of aesthetic experiences were analyzed leading to dimensions of environing described as "calm and privacy," "community and togetherness" and "feelings and senses." A favorite place was by all students described as a very local and nearby place accessible in everyday life. The analysis generated understandings of feelings of "fulfillment" and different embodied experiences of what an encounter with an outdoor place or being outdoors could mean. Furthermore, how personal and diverse the meaning making place tends to be and how experience and habits contribute to the students' creation of microenvironments. Dimensions of environing become part of an embodied process. The analysis of the written stories calls for an alternative understanding of what OE can or should consist of. The findings encourage teachers and researchers to consider alternative understandings and practices of OE that highlight and educate students' overall embodied (individual) experiences and learning in OE and PE.

AB  - Brackish-water reverse osmosis (BWRO) water treatment facilities commonly utilize groundwater for feed water supply. An increase in feed water salinity over time is common due to upward recharge of the production aquifer caused by higher salinity water occurring in deeper aquifers and upwards leakage or upconing of that water during pumping. The rate of change is based on the leakance value of the lower confining unit and the overall wellfield design and pumping rate. The City of Clearwater Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment Plant Number 2 utilizes feed water from the upper part of the Floridan Aquifer System and the overlying Surficial Aquifer System. The design capacity for the facility was set at 23,674 m(3)/d (6.25 MGD). The BWRO process was designed to treat feed water with a total dissolved solids (TDS) of 1,500 mg/L. Soon after startup of the BWRO plant, the feed water TDS increased to a range between 2,400 and 3,300 mg/L. Based on the feed water quality the facility has been able to produce only about 9,470 m(3)/d or about 40% of the design capacity. The groundwater model used to estimate changes in groundwater quality with time produced an inaccurate result, which was based on the choice of an inappropriate conceptual model, selection of the boundary conditions, and some other issues in the model structure. An analysis of the individual production well pumping rates and associated changes in salinity show that the confining units between the aquifers are likely breached by karst conduits. These localized breaches caused rapid and unpredictable increases in feed water salinity under pumping conditions. The BWRO facility will require a re- design of the treatment process with a number of options available to produce the desired product water. Because of the inability to accurately predict long-term changes in feed water quality, there is high risk in the design and operation of BWRO facilities using a karstic aquifer system as a feed water source. The location of the specific vertical conduits that allow upward movement of higher salinity water cannot be accurately predicted in the aquifer system.

AB  - An extinct thermophile European water buffalo Bubalus murrensis was recorded in the interglacials of the Middle and Late Pleistocene in Central and Western Europe. The species was unknown after the Eemian Interglacial (c. 123 ka) there and have never been found in Eastern Europe. Here we report on an unexpected record of this exotic species in the center of East European Plain near the Kolomna town (Moscow Region) more than 110 millennia later, in the Bolling - Allerod warming of the Last glacial. The unique paleontological discovery of the last European water buffalo in the center of Eastern Europe occupied mainly by a cold adapted so-called `Mammoth fauna' allow us to discuss this unusual occurrence in paleoenvironmental context and suggest the model of dispersal and final extinction of the species. Based on recent integrated studies, we show that the species could persist in the Ponto-Caspian region and then spread northwards during the last Late Pleistocene warming. Main factors of its extinction could be the rapid global climatic changes and strong regional paleoenvironmental instability as well as increasing activity of Upper Paleolithic hunters. The discovery is important in the context of the late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions and a recent phenomenon of global warming.

AB  - Aggregation phenomena occur across the biological sciences, from cell adhesion to insect swarms, animal home ranges to human cities. Understanding the mechanisms by which they may spontaneously emerge has therefore generated much interest from applied mathematicians. Partial differential equations (PDEs) with nonlocal advection offer a popular formalism for studying aggregations. However, the inherent nonlocality, often necessary for ensuring continuum models are well-posed, makes their study technically challenging. Here, we take a different approach by studying a discrete-space system that can be formally related to classical nonlocal PDE approaches via a limiting procedure. We show how to find expressions for the asymptotically stable steady-states of this discrete-space system via an energy functional approach. This allows us to predict the size of aggregations as a function of the underlying movement mechanisms of individual organisms. We apply this to a recent model of cell adhesion, revealing a hysteresis property whereby the existing aggregations may persist even as the adhesion tendency decreases past the bifurcation point. We compare this to numerical solutions of the associated nonlocal PDE system, showing that the hysteresis property predicted by the discrete-space expressions is also present in the continuum system.

AB  - In the real estate and construction industry, the built environment contributes to environmental crises and climate threats . However, what are the environmental negative effects/impacts at the post-development stage (operational stages)? Are they different from those at virgin constructions? After the construction phase, what factors inhibit the adoption of sustainable real estate management practice, herein referred to as the green lease movement? To what extent has sustainable real estate management practice been adopted in Nigerian commercial cities? Specifically, this study examines negative environmental crises at the operational stages and confirms if different from the conventional counterpart. It also examines the factors inhibiting the full adoption of sustainable real estate management practices. Similar to conventional construction, carbon dioxide emissions and toxic waste generation emerged as the major negative effects/impacts during the operational stage. Lack of prerequisite skills, enforcement of green leases, inadequate training, and empowerment of licenced property managers and occupiers on how such leases operate significantly inhibit the full adoption of green leases in the region. Energy conservation bulbs and digital metering are the most adopted features. The current property management practice does not address these negative effects/impacts.

AB  - Temporary opportunities for studying and working abroad have been growing globally and intensifying the movement of highly skilled temporary populations. To attract this group, cities need to address their residential and mobility needs. This study focuses on factors influencing residential and travel satisfaction of transnational temporary residents, highlighting the occurrence of residential selfselection, its impacts on residential and travel choices and on derived levels of satisfaction. We have estimated a Bayesian Structural Equations Model and found that lower levels of residential satisfaction (residential dissonance) are associated with lower rents, living farther away from the place of study or work, and having higher transport expenditures. In contrast, higher levels of residential satisfaction (residential consonance) are related to individuals' stronger preferences for active modes, lower levels of public transport use, and reduced transport monthly expenditures, which suggest shorter commuting distances. These findings reveal the tradeoffs involving residential location, monthly rent, and transport expenditures, highlighting that providing good public transport connections can reduce the burden of commuting distances. Our results indicate that better transport supply and land-use balance near the residence can improve both residential and travel satisfaction.

AB  - The occurrence of fog in Bengaluru is a perennial feature observed during winter, a phenomenon that affects several economic sectors and human health. This study takes a comprehensive approach for the analysis of fog attributes viz., frequency of occurrence, numbers of fog hours, time of onset/dispersal, intensity with high-density intra-hourly data (October to March) for a period of 11 years from January 2009 to December 2019. Also, the characteristics of nocturnal inversion parameters (Height of Inversion Base, Top, Depth and Strength) have been examined on the days with/without fog to establish a relationship between the two concurring meteorological phenomena. In the studied time frame December reported 129 and January 126 fog events while October, November, February and March reported 33, 96, 44, 11 events respectively. Similarly, December and January accounted for maximum fog hours. More than 80% of fog events were reported between 2200 to 0200 UTC with maximum (74) in 0100-0129 UTC slot and dispersed between 0000-0400 UTC. Intensity wise Shallow fog is most frequent (51%) while Moderate, Dens, Very-Dense have a frequency of 29%, 19.6% and 0.4% respectively. In Bengaluru, Elevated-Inversions are common occurrences throughout the year while Surface-Inversions are more frequent in the winter. In the study, Elevated-Inversion parameters produce a clear distinction when compared in regards to foggy and Non-foggy days emphasizing on the Fog-Inversion coupling.

AB  - Purpose The rates of upper extremity reconstruction for patients with tetraplegia remain low. We performed a retrospective study to assess recent reconstruction rates and delineate factors associated with the occurrence of reconstruction.
   Methods We examined the National Inpatient Sample database (2012-2017) for the rate of reconstruction for patients with tetraplegia. The details of provider distribution characteristics and neighborhood attributes were obtained from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile and based on the area deprivation index, respectively. We calculated the mean reconstruction rate per year and generated multivariable logistic regression models to examine the influence of patient factors, hospital characteristics, and provider distribution on the odds of undergoing functional reconstruction for tetraplegia patients.
   Results Among 404,660 encounters with patients with tetraplegia, only 1,430 (0.4%) patients underwent upper extremity reconstruction from 2012 to 2017, with a mean rate of 238 procedures per year. We identified 5,450 hand surgeons, 12,751 physiatrists, and 444 spinal cord injury specialists, with variation in their national distribution. A greater number of surgeons near SCIS was associated with increased probability of reconstruction (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.12). The odds of surgery were greater for patients receiving care at urban teaching (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.35-7.47) or urban nonteaching (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.11-2.63) hospitals, whereas those at private nonprofit (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78) or investor-owned (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52-0.82) hospitals had lower odds. Although most patients had insurance coverage, patients with a higher income or those who received subsidized care had greater odds of undergoing reconstruction.
   Conclusions Reconstruction rates remain low and are correlated with the environment of care, financial factors, and provider availability. Policies that focus on reducing these factors in addition to increasing interspecialty collaboration could improve access to surgery for patients with tetraplegia.

AB  - Israel's West Bank settlements are a central point of contention in the dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Overall, however, their rapid proliferation has been generally understood through the lens of an ideologically centered approach that highlights, specifically, the centrality of the national religious settlers' movement. Against this background, the article focuses on the overlooked reality of large, state-sponsored suburban settlements - and in particular on the role of the Israeli Ministry of Housing in their establishment between the mid1970s and the early 1990s. Building on contributions in the field of political economy and political geography, we conceive the actions of the Ministry in the occupied West Bank as a result of a broader strategy of spatial restructuring. By considering both economic and political imperatives underlying this strategy, our analysis offers a more comprehensive assessment of the factors behind Israel's settlement policy. Drawing on a broad range of empirical sources, from archival material to in-depth interviews with Israeli planners, we argue that the proliferation of settlements has been largely the outcome of a process of metropolitanization - i.e. of the dynamics of urban development of Israel's main metropolitan centers and the adoption of a new, post-Keynesian policy paradigm based on market-oriented economic development. This process has constituted a major factor for the settlements' growth and, ultimately, in the emergence and naturalization of a new territorial configuration in the area of Israel/Palestine.

AB  - Public participation in planning politics is a legal right in many countries. Planners often see themselves as the defenders of public interests, whereas planning studies may see public planning as the institutionalization of politics, the politicized management or government of disputes on planning issues. Public participation is ultimately a political decision, and this article focuses on how phrases like planning is 'a work in progress' and agonistic consensus is a 'solution for now' in fact add a critical issue to planning politics: such statements indicate that planning should be seen as an unfinished process, and decisions as temporary. A 'solution for now' literally means a 'planning for-the-time-being' and a 'coming-back-to', highlighting that there are processual issues unresolved within planning praxis. Politics and planning cannot be separated. Two cases of urban planning conflict-the struggle of the homeless for shelter and the Occupy movement-show this: they are used to discuss how planning politics may benefit from having a temporary resting place and being unfinished.

AB  - The network-wide urban traffic signal settings are generally optimized with the link-based overall indices, incapable of taking the traffic flow at the path level into account. This paper proposes a mixed backpressure index for a path considering both its throughput and the movement occupancies. With this index, we propose a one-step control to optimize the network-wide signal timing plans every time step embedded with a path-based store-and-forward model and extend it to multi-step by applying model predictive control methodology for the purpose of avoiding erratic switching among stages. Both the one-step and multi-step control are equivalently translated into mixed-integer linear programming problems for computational efficiency. The results of a numerical study on a calibrated network of Caohejing District in Shanghai indicate that the mixed backpressure index based methods provide better performance in terms of delay time as well as maximum queue length than other throughput-optimal methods. Additionally, they allow for relatively fair distribution of delay time associated with paths with appropriate parameter design.

AB  - This article explores an interesting episode in the history of time, health, and modernity: Britain's 1908 and 1909 Daylight Saving Time (DST) Bills. While the original DST scheme was unsuccessful, the discussions surrounding its implementation reveal tensions central to early twentieth century modernity, namely between industrial time and 'natural' bodily rhythms. This article argues that DST was essentially a public health measure aimed at improving the conditions of indoor workers like shop girls and clerks through government regulation of the private time of the labouring classes. Drawing on the extensive evidence provided to two House of Commons Special Committees, this article reveals how DST debates drew together contemporary discussions around sunlight therapy, night work, and the importance of regular sleeping and eating to tackle Britain's endemic urban diseases like consumption and anaemia. I suggest that the idea of bodily rhythms was increasingly important in medical thinking in this period and that the study of rhythmicity points to the potential for incorporating temporality as an analytical category in medical history.

AB  - Motorcycles and motorcyclists have a variety of attributes that have been found to be a potential contributor to the high liability of vulnerable road users (VRUs). Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) that include pedestrians, bicyclists, cycle-rickshaw occupants, and motorcyclists constitute by far the highest share of road traffic accidents in developing countries. Motorized three-wheeled Rickshaws (3W-MR) is a popular public transport mode in almost all Pakistani cities and is used primarily for short trips to carry passengers and small-scale goods movement. Despite being an important mode of public transport in the developing world, little work has been done to understand the factors affecting the injury severity of three-wheeled motorized vehicles. Crash injury severity prediction is a promising research target in traffic safety. Traditional statistical models have underlying assumptions and predefined associations, which can yield misleading results if flouted. Machine learning(ML) is an emerging non-parametric method that can effectively capture the non-linear effects of both continuous and discrete variables without prior assumptions and achieve better prediction accuracy. This research analyzed injury severity of three-wheeled motorized rickshaws (3W-MR) using various machine learning-based identification algorithms, i.e., Decision jungle (DJ), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT). Three years of crash data (from 2017 to 2019) was collected from Provincial Emergency Response Service RESCUE 1122 for Rawalpindi city, Pakistan. A total of 2,743 3W-MR crashes were reported during the study period that resulted in 258 fatalities. The predictive performance of proposed ML models was assessed using several evaluation metrics such as overall accuracy, macro-average precision, macro-average recall, and geometric means of individual class accuracies. Results revealed that DJ with an overall accuracy of 83.7 % outperformed the DT and RF-based on a stratified 10-fold cross-validation approach. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis showed that factors such as the lighting condition, crashes involving young drivers (aged 20?30 years), facilities with high-speed limits (over 60 mph), weekday, off-peak, and shiny weather conditions were more likely to worsen injury severity of 3W-MR crashes. The outcomes of this study could provide necessary and essential guidance to road safety agencies, particularly in the study area, for proactive implementation of appropriate countermeasures to curb road safety issues pertaining to three-wheeled motorized vehicles.

AB  - Increasing evidence denotes the role of the microbiome in biological invasions, since it is known that microbes can affect the fitness of the host. Here, we demonstrate differences in the composition of an invader's microbiome along the invasion range, suggesting that its microbial communities may affect and be affected by range expansion. Using a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing approach, we (i) analyzed the microbiomes of different tissues (exoskeleton, hemolymph, hepatopancreas, and intestine) of a successful freshwater invader, the signal crayfish, (ii) compared them to the surrounding water and sediment, and (iii) explored their changes along the invasion range. Exoskeletal, hepatopancreatic, and intestinal microbiomes varied between invasion core and invasion front populations. This indicates that they may be partly determined by population density, which was higher in the invasion core than in the invasion front. The highly diverse microbiome of exoskeletal biofilm was partly shaped by the environment (due to the similarity with the sediment microbiome) and partly by intrinsic crayfish parameters (due to the high proportion of exoskeleton-unique amplicon sequence variants [ASVs]), including the differences in invasion core and front population structure. Hemolymph had the most distinct microbiome compared to other tissues and differed between upstream (rural) and downstream (urban) river sections, indicating that its microbiome is potentially more driven by the effects of the abiotic environment. Our findings offer an insight into microbiome changes during dispersal of a successful invader and present a baseline for assessment of their contribution to an invader's overall health and its further invasion success.
   IMPORTANCE Invasive species are among the major drivers of biodiversity loss and impairment of ecosystem services worldwide, but our understanding of their invasion success and dynamics still has many gaps. For instance, although it is known that host-associated microbial communities may significantly affect an individual's health and fitness, the current studies on invasive species are mainly focused on pathogenic microbes, while the effects of the remaining majority of microbial communities on the invasion process are almost completely unexplored. We have analyzed the microbiome of one of the most successful crayfish invaders in Europe, the signal crayfish, and explored its changes along the signal crayfish invasion range in the Korana River, Croatia. Our study sets the perspective for future research required to assess the contribution of these changes to an individual's overall health status and resilience of dispersing populations and their impact on invasion success.

AB  - In the traditional cellular automata evacuation model, the space is divided into fine grids at a micro level, which is mainly used in a two-dimensional plane case. The evacuation space is mostly a small-scale architectural space or local area. Therefore, it is difficult to simulate a wide range of evacuation scenario, and there are less researches of the cellular automata model for a wide range of evacuation. Therefore, this article combines the movement characteristics and status of the pedestrian flow to establish a mesoscopic cellular automata model of evacuation applied to larger evacuation scenarios. This model uses road cell division instead of planar grid cell division, which augments the area of a single cell physically, increases the number of people occupied by a single cell, and expresses the number of people in each cell in the form of state variables. By changing personnel density and personnel speed, and by introducing "source loading" cell loading to simulate the evacuation of people in the scene, the behavior of pedestrians evacuating from the building to the road in the actual evacuation process can be simulated. The state transition equation simulates the movement of people in the evacuation process. When the number of people in the cell is larger, the density of people in the cell is higher, and their walking speed also decreases, which reflects the distribution and movement characteristics of pedestrian flow. This paper uses this model to divide the evacuation area of the college campus, and divides the entire campus into four evacuation areas. The evacuees in each area are evacuated corresponding to the corresponding exit, by planning the evacuation path, pedestrians walking from the "source loading" cell to the exit for evacuation. Through simulation, it is possible to analyze the macro-evacuation situation in the scene and observe the status change of a single cell. There are observed a high density of people in local road sections during campus evacuation, and the problem about the distribution of people on campus problems such as unevenness of pedestrian distribution and long evacuation schedules in certain places. Through the simulation of this model, possible problems in the actual evacuation process are found, and the improvement guidance and opinions are presented correspondingly.

AB  - The discourse marker vamos is the first-person present indicative plural of the verb ir ("to go") and acts as a guide throughout the discourse. We studied its use in the PRESEEA corpus of Granada, analyzing 54 interviews and rescuing 270 occurrences of vamos. Mainly, we detected that its use was higher in the speech of people with only a primary education, while its use among the university educated represented 27% of cases. It was also used more frequently by young people, particularly females, although only age was found to be influential because of the intrinsic and original value of the first-person plural form, by which speakers are integrated and form part of a group. Among the pragmatic values of the marker is its use as a reformulator in more than 60% of cases; 22% as a structurer that helps to continue and conclude the discourse; and approximately 13% when used as a modalizer to convey the speaker's attitude. Its main linguistic characteristic is its appearance preceded by conjunctions such as pero and y, and its main position is initial, as it accounts for 90% of occurrences.

AB  - Predictive models for estimating strong-motion duration in sites characterized by soft-soil profiles are presented in this paper. The models were developed using a strong-motion database that includes observations from subduction interface earthquakes that occurred from 1989 to 2020 and recorded in Mexico City, which is located at source-to-site distances up to 600 km. A linear mixed-effects regression model, which is a statistical fitting procedure that allows to consider the correlation structure of grouped data, was used to develop the predictive models. Relative significant duration was selected to measure strong-motion duration. This measure can be directly associated with the accumulation of energy of the ground movement. The proposed predictive models relate relative significant duration with moment magnitude, either hypocentral distance or closest distance to the rupture plane, and dominant period of the soil. Regression analyses were performed grouping the ground-motion data by both seismic event and site class. Model assumptions, such as homoscedasticity, normality, and linearity of effects, were verified from residual analyses. From the results, the expected value of the natural logarithm of relative significant duration was found to be similar to 1.2 times greater for an earthquake with a moment magnitude equal to 8.0 than for one of 6.0. An insightful discussion about the sources and character of the uncertainties detected in the proposed predictive models is also presented in this study. The predictive models proposed in this paper are of valuable application in seismic and structural engineering because they allow to circumscribe properly the dimension and randomness of strong-motion duration.

AB  - Due to the burgeoning demand for freight movement, freight related road safety threats have been growing substantially. In spite of some research on the factors influencing freight truck-related crashes in major cities, the literature offers limited evidence about the effects of the built environment on the occurrence of those crashes by injury severity. This article uses data from the Los Angeles region in 2010-2019 to explore the relationships between the built environment factors and the spatial distribution of freight truck-related crashes using XGBoost and SHAP methods. Results from the XGBoost model show that variables related to the built environment, in particular demographics, land uses and road network, are highly correlated to freight truck related crashes of all three injury types. The SHAP value plots further indicate the important nonlinear relationships between independent variables and dependent variables. This study also emphasizes the differences in modeling mechanisms between the XGBoost model and traditional statistical models. The findings will help transport planners develop operational measures for resolving the emerging freight truck related traffic safety problems in local communities.

AB  - On July 23, 2019, a high-speed and long-runout landslide occurred in Jichang Town, Shuicheng County, Guizhou Province, China, causing 42 deaths and 9 missing. This paper used the discrete element software MatDEM to construct a three-dimensional discrete element model based on digital elevation data and then simulated and analyzed the movement and accumulation process of the landslide. The maximum average velocity of the source area elements reached 14 m/s when passed through the scraping area; meanwhile, the velocity of the scraping area elements increased rapidly. At 90 s, the maximum displacement of the source area elements reached 1358.5 m. The heat generated during the movement of the landslide was mainly the frictional heat, and the frictional heat increased sharply when the source area elements passed through the scraping area. The change of frictional heat has a certain positive correlation with the velocity of the scraping area elements. Finally, the volume of the scraping area elements was 2.4 times greater than the source area elements in the deposits. The scraping effect increases the volume of the sliding body and expands the impact area of the landslide disaster. Additionally, by setting different compressive and tensile strengths as well as internal friction coefficients to analyze the influences of their value changes on the landslide movement process, the results show that the smaller the strengths and internal friction coefficient of the model, the greater the depth and area of the scraping area, which will result in a thicker accumulation; meanwhile, the average displacement, average velocity, and heat will also increase.

AB  - In a complex road traffic scene, illegal lane intrusion of pedestrians or cyclists constitutes one of the main safety challenges in autonomous driving application. In this paper, we propose a novel object-level phase space reconstruction network (PSRNet) for motion time series classification, aiming to recognize lane intrusion actions that occur 150m ahead through a monocular camera fixed on moving vehicle. In the PSRNet, the movement of pedestrians and cyclists, specifically viewed as an observable object-level dynamic process, can be reconstructed as trajectories of state vectors in a latent phase space and further characterized by a learnable Lyapunov exponent-like classifier that indicates discrimination in terms of average exponential divergence of state trajectories. Additionally, in order to first transform video inputs into one-dimensional motion time series of each object, a lane width normalization based on visual object tracking-by-detection is presented. Extensive experiments are conducted on the THU-IntrudBehavior dataset collected from real urban roads. The results show that our PSRNet could reach the best accuracy of 98.0%, which remarkably exceeds existing action recognition approaches by more than 30%.

AB  - This article's main goal is to analyze the actions of the public power during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of the indigenous movement in the state of Amazonas. It explores the main consequences of this scenario to the State action in relation to the indigenous issue, currently. It discusses the challenges of originary peoples facing the pandemic, the struggle for land and public health rights. From the analysis of remote interviews (via smartphone) and speech analysis (using the tag/word cloud technique) it was accomplished the interpretation of expressions used to describe the undignified treatment towards the indigenous peoples of Brazil by agents of the public sector at the initial stages of the pandemic, preceding the peak (April May 2020). The aforementioned agents base their actions on a project of the ruling classes and indigenous peoples are deeply affected by their absence. The rolling-back and denial of their rights represents an invitation for the worsening of conflicts to their breaking point, both in ancestral land and as in urban spaces of more recent occupation.

AB  - During the French vote on same-sex marriage, small subgroups of students and young professionals have emerged alongside La Manif pour tous (LMPT). Among these small-scale organizations, "Les Veilleurs" and "Les Gavroches" crafted a rhetoric based on "conquering the streets" and public space, developing an alternative playbook to LMPT's classic way of working. Invoking Gramscian "cultural combat", they aimed to continue the mobilization efforts and ensure their visibility at a time when their decline was underway. Their search for "new methods of action" sheds light on the concrete ways in which these conservative Catholics learn to protest publicly despite their relative dearth of experience in activism. Drawing on an ethnographic lens, this article seeks to identify what these tactical repertoires reveal about mobilized resources, internal targeting, and cultural motives. Transfers and borrowings, the initiatory function of these repertoires, their ideological roots, and their urban occupation patterns altogether reflect a learning process and a mobilization that seeks to politicize well beyond gender issues.

AB  - Dengue is hyperendemic in most Southeast Asian countries including Thailand, where all four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) have circulated over different periods and regions. Despite dengue cases being annually reported in all regions of Thailand, there is limited data on the relationship of epidemic DENV infection between humans and mosquitoes, and about the dynamics of DENV during outbreaks in the northeastern region. The present study was conducted in this region to investigate the molecular epidemiology of DENV and explore the relationships of DENV infection in humans and in mosquitoes during 2016-2018. A total of 292 dengue suspected patients from 11 hospitals and 902 individual mosquitoes (at patient's houses and neighboring houses) were recruited and investigated for DENV serotypes infection using PCR. A total of 103 patients and 149 individual mosquitoes were DENV -positive. Among patients, the predominant DENV serotypes in 2016 and 2018 were DENV-4 (74%) and DENV-3 (53%) respectively, whereas in 2017, DENV-1, -3 and -4 had similar prevalence (38%). Additionally, only 19% of DENV infections in humans and mosquitoes at surrounding houses were serotypically matched, while 81% of infections were serotypically mismatched, suggesting that mosquitoes outside the residence may be an important factor of endemic dengue transmission. Phylogenetic analyses based on envelope gene sequences showed the genotype I of both DENV-1 and DENV-4, and co-circulation of the Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes of DENV-2. These strains were closely related to concurrent strains in other parts of Thailand and also similar to strains in previous epidemiological profiles in Thailand and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. These findings highlight genomic data of DENV in this region and suggest that people's movement in urban environments may result in mosquitoes far away from the residential area being key determinants of DENV epidemic dynamics.

AB  - An epic Covid named '2019-nCoV' also called '2019 novel Covid's or 'Coronavirus' by the World Health Organization is responsible for the stated disease of pneumonia that started from the December month of 2019 in Wuhan City of Hubei, China (Fong S et. al. 2020). Coronavirus is a pathogenic infection. From the phylogenetic investigation completed with complete genomic arrangements, bats happen to be likely the COVID-19 infection origin, however the temporary hosts have not been identified with evidence till now. A lot of information is yet to be acquired about this virus and even after more than ten months since the start of this documented disease we still stand nowhere near knowing the virus. Regardless, very minimal clinical information on COVID-19 infection is at present accessible and solid information on age susceptibility, the confirm cause of the infection, brooding time, episodes, viral load, dispersal pathogenesis, examination protocols, and any clinical reactions to antivirals are missing to have strong clinical evidence. Many dermatologists have reported abnormal cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients and started to analyse the several reasons for these cutaneous manifestations to occur and which can be used as a diagnostic tool in identifying COVID-19 positive patients at an early stage. Many studies have been done which proves that dermatological symptoms are one of the major symptoms that can be seen. The main aim of this review article is to summarise the different findings in the field of cutaneous manifestations linked to COVID-19 and to understand the importance of dermatological symptoms as vital aiding tool for diagnosis of COVID-19 on a large scale.

AB  - Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that inhabit urban estuaries like Galveston Bay, Texas, are exposed to cumulative stressors including pollution, fisheries, shipping, freshwater inflows, and construction operations. With continuing development, it is imperative to understand the key environmental variables that make the Galveston Bay estuary suitable habitat for this protected species. The Galveston Bay Dolphin Research Program conducted monthly photo identification surveys of bottlenose dolphins in a previously understudied 186 km(2) area in upper Galveston Bay (UGB). To understand occurrence patterns in this region, we calculated monthly encounter rates of dolphins (dolphins/km) for four consecutive years (2016-2019). Using multiple linear regression models, we investigated the relationship between encounter rates, and water temperature and salinity. Monthly encounter rates ranged from 0.00 to 1.23 dolphins/km with an average of 0.34 dolphins/km (SE = 0.05). Over 80% of the variance was explained by the predictor variables water temperature and salinity (R-2 = 0.820). Water temperature had a positive linear effect on encounter rates at over 23.37 degrees C (SE = 1.42). Accordingly, higher encounter rates occurred during months with warm temperatures (May-September) compared to cooler months (November-April), indicating a predictable yearly movement pattern. Moreover, salinity was a highly significant predictor variable, with encounter rates dropping linearly with decreases in salinity. Higher numbers of dolphins are found in UGB during summer, but an exodus of dolphins occurs with low salinity levels, regardless of the time of year and water temperature. These findings should be considered during infrastructure projects (i.e., flood gate system) that may alter dolphin habitat and prey availability.

AB  - Albania is located in the Alpine fold belt extending to the central part of the Dinarides-Hellenides arc in a zone characterized by intense tectonic-seismic activity that has a considerable influence in shaping the geo-environment of the area. Historically, strong earthquakes occurred in this region and triggered lots of mass movements causing considerable damages such as life loss, destruction of properties and disruption of the geo-environment. This paper introduces several earthquake-triggered mass movement events in Albania that occurred during 1850-2019. It was achieved through collection and analysis of data from historical studies and authors' field investigations. The results show that soil type, slope inclination and seismic activity have a direct influence in the occurrence of these movements consistent with similar parameters occurred worldwide. Earthquake's magnitude and degree of mass movement is well correlated. Mass movements such as lateral earth spread, rock fall, debris slides, sand boils, sand fluidization, cracks and settlement were triggered by earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.0 or higher. On the other hand, lateral rock spread needs a higher seismic magnitude to occur.

AB  - Overabundant suburban deer (Odocoileus spp.) are a source of human-wildlife conflict in many communities throughout the United States. Deer-vehicle collisions, impacts to local vegetation, tick-borne pathogens, and other negative interactions are typical reasons cited for initiating deer management programs. Social attitudes, legal constraints, and perceived safety concerns lead many communities to examine nonlethal management options. Surgical sterilization is currently the only nonlethal method available to permanently sterilize females with a single treatment. However, there are limited data demonstrating methods and outcomes in management programs that sterilize a high percentage (>90%) of local populations of females, particularly regarding the impact of immigration on non-isolated populations. We present data from 6 surgical sterilization sites with geographically open populations in California, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Virginia, USA. From 2012 to 2020 we sterilized 493 deer, primarily via ovariectomy, and conducted annual or periodic population estimates using camera surveys, road-based distance sampling, and intensive field observations to assess population trends. Study sites ranged from 1.2 km(2) to 16.5 km(2) with similar to 47-169 individuals, resulting in approximate densities of 6-63 deer/km(2). For all sites we noted an average reduction of similar to 26% (17%-36%) from Year 1 to Year 2. Four years after initial treatment, we documented an average population reduction of similar to 45% (29%-56%). During the first year, the average cost per deer sterilized at locations where bait was used was US$1,185 ($927-$1,572). Surgical sterilization projects demonstrate that significant reductions in local deer densities using high-percentage, surgical sterilization programs can be achieved in non-insular locations, where baited deer are approachable by vehicle for darting. Sustained sterilization efforts may be necessary, as is the case with all deer management programs, in areas where immigration is possible, and all the animals are not sterilized.

AB  - The movement of supporters' Club, institutionalized in Sao Paulo since 1969, has become a recurrent aspect in stadiums by changing many elements of the local supporters' club. This study aims to present the path of the two main supporters' entities in the history of Palmeiras: TUP (Torcida Uniformizada do Palmeiras), founded in 1970, which gathered most of Palmeiras supporters until the middle of the following decade, and Mancha Verde, which united most Palmeiras supporters from the1990s. The analysis, based on interviews with leaders of supporters' club, in the newspapers O Estado de S. Paulo and Folha de S. Paulo, and in Placar magazine, aims to reflect what self-images the entities have developed; the recurring relationship of cooperation in the supporters' clubs universe of the 1970s, and the growing confrontations between them during the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s. The changes that occurred during the whole period allow us to analyze the virility conceptions and the native concept of respect, as well as visualize the connection between the growing number of homicides and violent crimes in Sao Paulo and the increasingly violent relationships between supporters in the city.

AB  - Simple Summary: In recent years, the increased presence of wildlife in habitats close to urban settlements has raised concerns about the risk of pathogen transmission from wild animals to humans due to the spread of different parasites. For this reason, a survey aimed at describing the dispersal and parasitism level of two cervid ectoparasites was carried out in the northern Apennines, in central Italy. The presence of two hippoboscids, the autochthonous Lipoptena cervi and allochthonous L. fortisetosa, native to Eastern Asia and recently recorded in Italy, were assessed on their main host species (red deer, fallow deer, and roe deer), considering host sex and age. The alien species L. fortisetosa was found to be widespread in the study area, most likely competing with L. cervi. Moreover, red deer seemed to be the favored host of both flies, with differences in sex and age class preferences. This study demonstrated the importance of regularly monitoring the populations of these parasites, especially the invasive species, due to the risks to human health, as these insects are potential vectors of pathogens.
   Lipoptena fortisetosa and L. cervi are hematophagous ectoparasites belonging to the Hippoboscidae family and preferentially living on cervids. In recent years, they have received specific attention due to the great increase in the abundance of their host species, and to their medical and veterinary importance as possible vectors of pathogens harmful to humans and animals. The aim of this study was to investigate the parasitism level of both of these flies on their main hosts in Italy, which are red deer, fallow deer, and roe deer, and to highlight a possible preference for a species, sex, or age class among the hosts. Deer keds were collected by examining 326 cervids hunted in the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines. Outcomes showed that L. fortisetosa has greatly spread throughout the study area, where it competes with the autochthonous L. cervi. Moreover, red deer was the favored host species of both ectoparasites, while different preferences for host sex and age classes were observed in the two hippoboscids. The regular monitoring of deer ked populations, especially the allochthonous L. fortisetosa, which is continuously spreading in Europe, is recommended to expand the knowledge on these parasitic species that are potentially dangerous to public health.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Early identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Targeted strategies are needed to support equitable access to diagnostic services to ensure that children from low-income and racial/ethnic minority families receive the benefits of early ASD identification and treatment.
   OBJECTIVE To test the efficacy of family navigation (FN), an individually tailored, culturally informed care management strategy, to increase the likelihood of achieving diagnostic ascertainment among young children at risk for ASD.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial of 249 families of children aged 15 to 27 months who had positive screening results for possible ASD was conducted in 11 urban primary care sites in 3 cities. Data collection occurred from February 24, 2015, through November 5, 2018. Statistical analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis from November 5, 2018, to July 27, 2020.
   INTERVENTIONS Families were randomized to FN or conventional care management (CCM). Families receiving FN were assigned a navigator who conducted community-based outreach to families to address structural barriers to care and support engagement in recommended services. Families receiving CCM were assigned to a care manager, who did limited telephone outreach. Families received FN or CCM after positive initial screening results and for 100 days after diagnostic ascertainment.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome, diagnostic ascertainment, was measured as the number of days from randomization to completion of the child's clinical developmental evaluation, when a diagnosis of ASD or other developmental disorder was determined.
   RESULTS Among 250 families randomized, 249 were included in the primary analysis (174 boys [69.9%]; mean [SD] age, 22.0 [3.5] months; 205 [82.3%] publicly insured; 233 [93.6%] non-White). Children who received FN had a greater likelihood of reaching diagnostic ascertainment over the course of 1 year (FN, 108 of 126 [85.7%]; CCM, 94 of 123 [76.4%]; unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.39 [95% CI, 1.05-1.84]). Site (Boston, New Haven, and Philadelphia) and ethnicity (Hispanic vs non-Hispanic) moderated the effect of FN (treatment x site interaction; P = .03; Boston: HR, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.31-3.26]; New Haven: HR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.94-3.89]; and Philadelphia: HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.60-1.37]) (treatment x ethnicity interaction; P < .001; Hispanic families: HR, 2.81 [95% CI, 2.23-3.54] vs non-Hispanic families: HR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.45-1.53]). The magnitude of FN's effect was significantly greater among Hispanic families than among non-Hispanic families (diagnostic ascertainment among Hispanic families: FN, 90.9% [30 of 33], and CCM, 53.3% [16 of 30]; vs non-Hispanic families: FN, 89.7% [35 of 39], and CCM, 77.5% [31 of 40]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Family navigation improved the likelihood of diagnostic ascertainment among children from racial/ethnic minority, low-income families who were detected as at risk for ASD in primary care. Results suggest differential effects of FN by site and ethnicity.

TI  - Mapping home internet activity during COVID-19 lockdown to identify occupation related inequalities
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence has accumulated that movement restrictions enacted to combat virus spread produce disparate consequences along socioeconomic lines. We investigate the hypothesis that people engaged in financially secure employment are better able to adhere to mobility restrictions, due to occupational factors that link the capacity for flexible work arrangements to income security. We use high-resolution spatial data on household internet traffic as a surrogate for adaptation to home-based work, together with the geographical clustering of occupation types, to investigate the relationship between occupational factors and increased internet traffic during work hours under lockdown in two Australian cities. By testing our hypothesis based on the observed trends, and exploring demographic factors associated with divergences from our hypothesis, we are left with a picture of unequal impact dominated by two major influences: the types of occupations in which people are engaged, and the composition of households and families. During lockdown, increased internet traffic was correlated with income security and, when school activity was conducted remotely, to the proportion of families with children. Our findings suggest that response planning and provision of social and economic support for residents within lockdown areas should explicitly account for income security and household structure. Overall, the results we present contribute to the emerging picture of the impacts of COVID-19 on human behaviour, and will help policy makers to understand the balance between public health and social impact in making decisions about mitigation policies.

AB  - We present the preliminary results of a study of the Bystrinskoe earthquake, which occurred in the southern Baikal region on 21 September 2020 and was accompanied by shaking with an intensity of VI-VII on the MSK-64 scale in the epicentral area and with an intensity of V in large cities of southern East Siberia (Irkutsk, Angarsk, Usolye-Sibirskoe, Zakamensk, etc.). A preliminary characteristic of the seismic event is given on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of seismological, structural-tectonic, strain, emanation, and hydro-geochemical data obtained during the monitoring of hazardous geologic processes in the Baikal natural territory. We have estimated the seismologic parameters of the Bystrinskoe earthquake, characterized the accompanying phenomena, and identified the effects that are of interest as probable precursors of future strong earthquakes in the Baikal region. The data obtained suggest that the earthquake occurred in the zone of the Main Sayan Fault as a result of strike-slip movement along the W-NW fault. The earthquake focus was apparently located at a shallow depth, as evidenced by the duration of the shocks, macroseismic manifestations, and the strong rumble heard at different directions from the epicenter.

AB  - The extent of home ranges of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) was studied on Crete (Greece) during 2005-2015 by monitoring 27 individuals with very high frequency radio-telemetry. Radio-tagged birds were followed for an average period of 13.1 months (n = 7-22), where a total of 1615 days of fieldwork produced 4420 radiolocations (x = 163.5 radiolocations per tagged bird, n = 142-328). Overall, the mean home range and mean core area of griffon vultures were estimated at 1560 +/- 140 km(2) (KDE 95%) and 373 +/- 36 km(2) (KDE 50%) respectively with significant age-related differences within seasons. Immature griffon vultures ranged on average about double the area ranged by adults in winter and occupied significantly larger core areas. The home range overlap in per cent and utilization distribution between adult and immature birds was also significantly less in winter than in summer. Foraging griffon vultures avoided northern slopes with unfavourable flight conditions and selected sites within rangelands with low diurnal temperature variations where overwintering livestock and suitable nesting cliffs occur. Foraging adults were restricted to the vicinity of the breeding colonies and favoured sites away from urban zones. In contrast, immature griffon vultures selected pastoral zones in marginal areas with mild winters and rugged terrain. The existence of predictable food sources in combination with suitable roosting sites and favourable flight conditions were the main factors differentiating the space-use pattern between the two age classes. We recommend that apart from the maintenance of traditional farming practices, sites, such as large communal roosts and flight corridors or entire 'hotspot' activity zones of immature birds, should be taken into account in conservation planning and sensitivity mapping for the species.

AB  - Human-snake conflict results in negative outcomes for people and snakes, and if left unmanaged, could undermine conservation efforts. One approach to managing conflict between people and snakes is to use signage to inform members of the public on the presence of venomous snakes and measures to prevent snakebites. To be an effective tool, however, signs must first be noticed, then read and understood by the target audience. As part of conservation efforts targeting eastern massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) in southwestern Ontario, Canada, we tested the effectiveness of signage at increasing awareness of its presence, status and threats, and snakebite prevention. We installed 6 informational signs at trailheads in a park occupied by massasaugas and conducted a random questionnaire survey of visitors during a 3-week period before (n = 51) and after (n = 54) sign installation. Awareness of the presence of massasauga habitat increased significantly after sign installation, whereas awareness of status, threats, and snakebite prevention methods did not change. Our results suggest that informational signs were effective, to some degree, at short-term information sharing with recreationists in the context of venomous snake conservation. This cost-effective approach warrants consideration as part of an overall strategy to mitigate human-snake conflict.

AB  - The green building certification system has long-lasting benefits by improving building efficiency and sustainability. The ultimate goal of such classification is to promote the preservation of the global environment as well as the occupants' well-being and their health. In this paper, we present examples of buildings that have been designed and built in Poland and have been certified with BREEAM, LEED and WELL. Our study investigates human factors in certification systems and examines the WELL Building Standard as a supplement to other green systems, which will probably be the most popular in the future. The green building movement should prioritize pro-human factors and the associated environmental beliefs to improve indoor environment quality for users' needs. We present this matter on the example of the Polish office space market, providing statistics and analyzing the architecture of six certified office buildings from Warsaw, Poznan and Wroclaw. They are a representative sample of buildings designed following the certification regime. It was demonstrated how this aids in improving work comfort, enhances the program of office spaces and the organization of service spaces within buildings, which increases the rank of this architecture and positively affects the urban environment.

AB  - This paper analyzes small farmers' trajectories in converting to organic farming in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo during the 1990s and 2000s. The conversion occurred under the initial push of individuals connected the movement of the Theology of Liberation and after the structuring of a regional market around large-scale distribution. The paper shows how the integration of these farmers in a market system ruled by capitalist logic was accompanied, at the local level, by the professionalization of agriculture and by the implantation of corporate structures and logic. It also shows how these ecologic modernization dynamics, while contributing to the creation of a new rural elite and new forms of social inequality, seem to also be able to contribute to the maintenance of farming in a context of strong urban pressure, to the return of young people to farming, and the construction of territories of ecologic quality. In this sense, it questions whether contexts exist in which ecologic modernization would be a compromise accepted by defenders of more radical alternatives? Whichever the answer to this question, the answer we propose underlines the importance of reintegrating the analysis of the ecologic farming trajectories to a broader study of social changes, mainly in its local components.

AB  - Concrete diaphragm walls (CDWs) are widely used as support of deep excavation in soft ground in urban areas. Ground deformation occurs during the excavation of trenches for the installation of the CDW panels due to ground stress release. This paper investigates the ground deformation during slurry trenching using Mindlin solution. The pressure of slurry used to protect the trench stability during excavation is simulated as a triangularly distributed load on the trench walls, the soil stress state is solved using Mindlin solution, and the horizontal and vertical ground displacement are obtained through integral transformation of ground strain. The rationality of the solution is verified through comparison between the analytical solution and field measurement. Sensitivity analyses are performed on soil elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, trench excavation depth and panel length. Simplified formulation is proposed for the prediction of horizontal ground deformation. The impact of excavation stages and adjacent panels on the ground deformation is explored. The study finds that the Mindlin solution is able to provide an approximate solution on the ground deformation during slurry trenching, and the simplified formulation can be used to provide a fast estimate of the horizontal ground movement in engineering practice.

Students who participate in the project apply their learned techniques to real situations and learn by doing. New use of pedestrian motion modeling is introduced in regional planning through visual accessibility prediction maps of towns. Studies have shown that the distribution of pedestrian movements is explained by spatial quantities representing the properties of the street network. Preliminary observations have identified three locations with the most activity. In addition, after socketing the pedestrian motion model, it is possible to preview the streets and places where conflicts between road users will occur.

AB  - Road traffic accidents are a leading cause of premature deaths and globally pose a severe threat to human lives. In particular, pedestrians crossing the road present a major cause of vehicle-pedestrian accidents in South Korea, but we lack dense behavioral data to understand the risk they face. This paper proposes a new analytical system for potential pedestrian risk scenes based on video footage obtained by road security cameras already deployed at unsignalized crosswalks. The system can automatically extract the behavioral features of vehicles and pedestrians, affecting the likelihood of potentially dangerous situations after detecting them in individual objects. With these features, we can analyze the movement patterns of vehicles and pedestrians at individual sites, and understand where potential traffic risk scenes occur frequently. Experiments were conducted on four selected behavioral features: vehicle velocity, pedestrian position, vehicle-pedestrian distance, and vehicle-crosswalk distance. Then, to show how they can be useful for monitoring the traffic behaviors on the road, the features are visualized and interpreted to show how they may or may not contribute to potential pedestrian risks at these crosswalks: (i) by analyzing vehicle velocity changes near the crosswalk when there are no pedestrians present; and (ii) analyzing vehicle velocities by vehicle-pedestrian distances when pedestrians are on the crosswalk. The feasibility of the proposed system is validated by applying the system to multiple unsignalized crosswalks in Osan city, South Korea.

TI  - Creating Healthy Enterprises: the Workplace Health Action Plan in China
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
LA  - English
AB  - On October 21, 2019, the "Notice on promoting the healthy enterprises" and "Specification of Healthy Enterprise Construction (trial)" were issued jointly by the National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee Office and six other government partners. As one of the objectives and tasks of the occupational health protection action (2019-2030), this multisectoral "Healthy Enterprise" Action Plan (HEAP) serves as the first "healthy cell" project carried out at the national level as an indispensable part of the Healthy China Initiative and the Healthy City Movement.
   It is of great significance to recognize the importance of the burden of disease linked to the exposure of occupational risks and the ability to identify the main areas of concern.
   This article interprets the process of how the healthy workplace or healthy enterprise was originated and evolved; how the theory was introduced and developed in China; and how the 4 main action indicators toward healthier and safer workplaces were formulated including the following: 1) developing the health policy system; 2) building healthy working environments; 3) providing health services; and 4) creating healthy culture. It concludes that the national "healthy enterprise" policy is a specific workplace-based public health practice in the field of occupational health and contributes to build a preventive culture in the context of the Healthy China Initiative. It aims to explore and summarize workplace health promotion models, methods, and experience suitable for China and to disseminate them across China.

AB  - This article discusses the effect of medical education on politicization during the late Ottoman period. The article focuses on the nineteenth-century emergence of the epistemological and etiological shift in medicine on a global scale, which led to the dominance of the modernization paradigm in the environment of the Military School of Medicine in Istanbul. The ideas favoring modernization and progressivism became widespread through partnerships and differences between the two generations of physicians represented by the periods of Tanzimat (1839-1876) and Abdulhamid II (1876-1909). Based on the narratives of prominent physicians of the late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkey, the article aims to illustrate that all the activities in the school resulted in the gradual transformation of the perspective of the students in contrast to their professors, interpreting the concept of progress as an effective basis to assist the modern aspirations of the administrative elites, composing the hidden curriculum of modern medical education in the Ottoman context. The younger generation began to equate materialism with solidarity, political activism, and insurgency, which would finally enable them to lead the movement against the monarchy or sultan. This generation would also occupy leading administrative positions in the first decades of the new Turkish Republic.

AB  - Land subsidence is a global threat to coastal areas worldwide, including the North Java coastal area. Of many areas experiencing land subsidence in North Java, the rate of land subsidence in Pekalongan has matched the high subsidence rates usually found in big cities. The rate of land subsidence in Pekalongan far exceeds the sea-level rise, resulting in a looming threat of land loss. The devastating impacts of land subsidence are the manifestation of its subsurface movement. Therefore, it is essential to understand the subsurface to elucidate the mechanism of land subsidence. Previous studies on land subsidence in Pekalongan are mainly related to subsidence rate monitoring and have not elaborated on the subsurface condition. This paper reviews the Pekalongan subsurface geology based on available literature to provide insight into the land subsidence problem. The results revealed that the land subsidence occurs in the recent alluvial plain of Pekalongan, consisting of a 30-70m thick compressible deposit.Possible mechanisms of land subsidence arise from natural compaction, over-exploitation of confined groundwater, and increased built areas. As the seismicity of the study area is low, tectonic influence on land subsidence is considered negligible. It is expected that the offshore, nearshore, and swamp deposits are still naturally compacting. As the surface water supply is minimal, over-exploitation of groundwater resources from the deltaic and Damar Formation aquifers occurs. In the end, future research direction is proposed to reduce the impacts of the subsidence hazard.

TI  - PRISHALTSITE (THE NEW-COMERS): DYNAMICS OF MIGRATIONS, SOCIAL STATUS AND ADAPTATION (ACCORDING TO OTTOMAN REGISTER DATA FROMTHE 16TH-17TH CENTURIES REGARDING THE SANCAK OF NIKOPOL)

AB  - The presented study is an attempt for a multifaced research the registered prishaltsi (out-comers) in the Ottoman tax inventories - one of the most important indicator of the occurred demographic, ethno-religious, economic and even political changes during 16th - 17th cc. The author's observations are mainly focused on unpublished and just partially published Ottoman register material about sancak of Nikopol, while in the quantitative and statistical analysis is primarily used data from the detailed registered defters of 1516/17, 1541-45, 1579 (1613/14) and 1642/43-1646. One of the highlights is put on the reasons for the preservation of the authentic form of the word prishalets - prishelets (Gamma C Phi 6M), in the Ottoman registration practice, synonyms of which in Bulgarian language are preselnik (immigrant), chujdenets (foreigner), drugozemets (from another land), immigrant and others. One of the starting concepts in the study is that when registered in such manner they are clearly recognizable - for the local population, as well as for the Ottoman tax officers and clerks - as new settlers compared to permanent residents of the respective town or village. The outlined common characteristics of the discussed by the study prishaltsi, give grounds at least several key aspects of their role and place in the Bulgarian society during 16th - 17th cc. to be pointed out. First of all the so-called prishultsi are within the most important indicators of the demographic situation and the dynamics of migration processes for the period considered. The complex study of the data about them in the context of a number of other explanatory entries (ethnonyms and nicknames such as: surf/serb (serbian), vlach/eflyak, rum/grak (greek), latin, arbanash/arnavut, etc.; annotations, locating the departure points of the migration; so called "escapes by the taxpaying population (reaya)" and other) gives a real opportunity the basic parameters of the migration processes to be outlined. They mark the intensity of migration processes during 16th - 17th cc. that had led to the depopulation of entire regions and destabilization of the Orthodox community, but along with it had provided the constant "mechanical" growth and economic boom of a number of major urban centers in the Bulgarian lands. The high concentration of prishaltsi in Kazgan Banara (today's town of Kotel), for example, as evidenced by the adduced register data, clearly marks the stages of the enlargement of the town and its transformation into one of the centres of the Bulgarian Revival movement. Among the outlined summaries the conclusion that deserves attention is that the so called prishaltsi are far from belonging to the marginalia of the society - neither at city level nor at village one. The summarized entries on taxes in all the commented registers from the 16th and 17th century do not detect any difference in taxation compared to the rest of the population, even when the prishaltsi are listed within the categories of population with special status and obligations to the central government. Furthermore, many of them are among the prosperous social classes in Bulgarian society throughout the whole period considered, and even afterwards.

AB  - The dire wolf was one of the successful top predators in North America during the Pleistocene. It is best known from the southern part of North America, and it even immigrated to South America. Fossils of dire wolves are very rare north of 42- North latitude in North America. That distribution supported the belief that the low temperatures and ice sheets in the higher latitudes of North American formed an insurmountable barrier for the dispersal of dire wolves. Here we report the first record of the dire wolf fossil in Eurasia. The fossil is a partial mandibular fragment with a tooth recovered from a Late Pleistocene underwater sand mine site near the city of Harbin in Northeastern China. Other mammalian fossils from the same site suggest that this dire wolf coexisted with the typical Mammuthus-Coelodonta fauna of Eurasia. The newly discovered specimen has a huge m1; much larger than gray wolves and other large canids from the same region. The massive m1 trigonid accounts for a high percentage of its overall length. The m1 talonid is reduced, but retains a small entoconid. The m2-3 alveoli suggest that the two teeth were smaller than those of the gray wolf. The combination of these morphologies is present only in the dire wolf. When the body mass spectra of medium and large-bodied carnivores from Asia and North America were compared, the Asian dire wolf occupies a position nearly overlapping the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta ultima). During the Late Pleistocene, C. crocuta ultima was one of the most widely distributed and dominant carnivores in Asia. Competition from hyenas may have kept dire wolf Asian populations at very low levels leading to their rarity as fossils rare in Asia.

AB  - Improving the rainwater retention capacity (RRC) of green roofs has been proposed as an important component of urban stormwater management. In this study, a two-layered soil green roof model was established to enhance RRC compared to each single soil column model. The hydrological process of layered soil green roofs was simulated using the HYDRUS-1D program, with simulation results verified by measured results. The results showed that the RRC of the layered soil was 5% and 1% higher than that of each single substrate under a long-term dry-wet cycle and increased by 15% and 11% per event compared with the single substrates. In addition, higher peak drainage reduction and longer peak drainage delay were observed in the layered soil green roof compared to each single soil. The layered soil slowed the movement of the soil wetting front and increased the maximum water content of the upper soil. The water loss of the layered soil was reduced after rainfall and mainly occurred in the lower layer of the layered soil. These results suggest that the structures of green roofs with an upper layer with higher permeability and a lower layer with lower permeability have better hydrological performance.

AB  - Seth Tobocman's War in the Neighborhood (2000), a graphic narrative about squatting in Manhattan's Lower East Side, attempts to rethink the politics (both oppressive and liberatory) of domestic space. This article examines the meanings of home in War in the Neighborhood in the terms suggested by Kristin J. Jacobson, whose theorisation of 'neodomestic fiction' suggests a move in contemporary American literature toward representations of domesticity that affirm a productive instability. This instability is made manifest in Tobocman's work on the terrain of gender and race, where attempts to practice an anarchistic prefigurative politics collide with the recurrence of misogyny and racism to destabilise domestic spaces that are already threatened by the gentrification of the neighbourhood. Tobocman depicts the squats as spaces motivated by efforts to put radical politics into practice, but acknowledges the perils they encounter in doing so, and develops an account of the workings of power that provides an explanation. After describing the multivalent accounts of home that occupy a central role in contemporary U.S. politics, I examine the contestations that destabilise domesticity in War and argue that the text, by virtue of its political emphasis and urban preoccupation, highlights connections between neodomestic fiction and critical literary geography.

AB  - The identification of the most rockfall-prone areas is the first step of the risk assessment procedure. In the case of land and urban planning, hazard and risk analyses involve large portions of territory, and thus, preliminary methods are preferred to define specific zones where more detailed computations are needed. To reach this goal, the QGIS-based plugin QPROTO was developed, able to quantitatively compute rockfall time-independent hazard over a three-dimensional topography on the basis of the Cone Method. This is obtained by combining kinetic energy, passing frequency and detachment propensity of each rockfall source. QPROTO requires the definition of few angles (i.e., the energy angle phi(p) and the lateral angle a) that should take into account all the phenomena occurring during the complex block movement along the slope. The outputs of the plugin are a series of raster maps reporting the invasion zones and the quantification of both the susceptibility and the hazard. In this paper, a method to relate these angles to some characteristics of the block (volume and shape) and the slope (inclination, forest density) is proposed, to provide QPROTO users with a tool for estimating the input parameters. The results are validated on a series of case studies belonging to the north-western Italian Alps.

AB  - Introduction Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI) may occur during Mass Gathering Events (MGE). A failure to prepare and train the health care system for potential MCI, can cause chaos and delays in the response, leading to an increased morbidity and mortality. Education and training of staff are crucial for preparedness. In Italy, hospital Emergency Plans for Massive Influx of Injured (in Italian designated with the acronym PEMAF) are mandatory since the '90's. However, when available, they are usually poorly known by the staff, rarely reviewed and validated. In 2014, Matera, a city in Southern Italy, was designated as the European Capital of Culture for 2019. As a result, we took this opportunity to revise the "Madonna delle Grazie" PEMAF and to start a program for increasing the awareness of the plan among the medical staff and provide specific training for MCI management. Material & methods The PEMAF was reviewed through simulations that involved the entire staff. A partnership with the International Association for Medical Response to Major Incidents & Disasters (MRMI) led to the support of experts and to the organization of residential courses based on the MAss Casualty SIMulation tool (MACSIM (R)). In total, six residential educational events of MACSIM-PEMAF were organized. Individual capacity was tested before and after the education through self-administered semi-quantitative questionnaires. Results All the available resources were mapped and the functional areas identified. Alert, coordination and command sequences were defined. The communication network was improved. Documentation and registration systems were developed. Standard operational procedures (action cards) were created for the key positions. The knowledge and capacity to function in active roles during a MCI was improved among the participants in the educational program. Conclusions MGE are great opportunities for the development of the hosting community but also represent an increased risk of MCI. Preparedness is mandatory for health care systems. The educational format MACSIM-PEMAF seems to be adequate to review and improve the existing plans and transfer specific skills to attendants.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with great health implications have been identified as important by-products during primitive obsolete electronics (e-waste) recycling activities. Their distribution patterns and human exposure levels are highly particle size dependent, but have not been adequately examined due to the lack of emission data. The present study was conducted to address this issue by measuring the emissions of PAHs from thermal treatment and open burning of typical e-waste pieces. The emission factors from thermal treatment and open burning of plastic casingswere 3.15 x 10(4)-1.56 x 10(5) and 4.22 x 10(3)-1.96 x 10(4) ng g(-1), respectively, with 6.37 x 10(4)-2.17 x 10(5) and 1.98 x 10(3)-2.68 x 10(3) ng g(-1) for printed circuit boards, respectively. Low-molecular-weight PAHs predominated the total PAH emissions in both procedures. Particulate PAHs contributed the most emissions in thermal treatment, but gaseous PAHs predominated in open burning. Generally, the size distributions of particle matter and PAHs were characterized by a unimodal shape peaking at 0.56-1 or 0.32-0.56 mu m. Most PAHs especially high-molecular-weight ones were found on fine particles. Absorption appeared to be the main mechanism at emission sources and re-distribution of PAHs may have occurred between particulate and gaseous phases during progressive dispersal from combustion sources. High cancer risk (7.23 x 10(-4)) was incurred for e-waste recycling workers via inhalation and dermal absorption, mostly attributed to the exposure of fine particles. Improved techniques are needed to reduce potential health risk for e-waste recycling workers and residents living in adjacent areas. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Iowa Bird That Inspired Antonin Dvorak's American String Quartet in 1893: Controversy over the Species' Identity and Why It Matters
T2  - NINETEENTH-CENTURY MUSIC REVIEW

KW  - VIREOS
AB  - Antonin Dvorak composed the String Quartet in F major (op. 96, the 'American') in June 1893 while visiting the town of Spillville, Iowa, USA. Based on accounts from Dvorak's secretary Josef Kovarik, portions of the quartet's Scherzo movement were inspired by birdsong Dvorak heard in Spillville. Kovarik's account included both Dvorak's visual description of the bird that inspired him and a transcribed fragment of the birdsong Dvorak reportedly used. In 1954, Clapham identified the bird as a scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea), based mainly on the visual description. This widely accepted identification was questionable because of the poor match of the tanager's song to musical material in the Scherzo. In 2016, Floyd proposed the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus) as Dvorak's inspiration, based on song rather than appearance. The vireo's song is clearly identifiable in the Scherzo as well in the birdsong fragment recorded by Kovarik. The mismatch between the visual description and the transcribed song fragment could have occurred when Dvorak heard and recorded the persistent singing of a cryptic red-eyed vireo, but misidentified the song's source when he caught sight of a brightly coloured tanager. Correct identification of the birdsong changes the interpretation of the movement. Previously, birdsong has been considered the source of a short secondary motif. But red-eyed vireo songs are highly variable, and a slight variation of Kovarik's song fragment could be the basis of the main theme of the Scherzo. Therefore, Dvorak may have used American birdsong in the movement considerably more than previously appreciated.

AB  - Tuberculosis is one of the oldest known diseases and the leading communicable cause of deaths worldwide. Although several studies have been carried out on tuberculosis, no research has examined the publication trends in this area. Hence, this study aimed to fill the gap by conducting a bibliometric study in publications trends on tuberculosis and tuberculosis-related studies in Africa from 2010-2019 and explore the hotspots. Information in published documents on tuberculosis and its related studies from 2010 to 2019 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The bibliometric tool biblioshiny and Microsoft Excel 2016 were used to analyse the top leading journals, top cited documents, authors' country production, country collaboration networks, most relevant authors, authors' impacts, most relevant authors by corresponding author, most cited countries, university collaborations, most relevant affiliations, conceptual structural maps, title word co-occurrence networks, collaboration and significance of individual sources, university, country and keyword relations. A total of 3945 published documents were retrieved. The analyses showed that European Respiratory Journal was the leading journal in publications on tuberculosis studies with a total of 452 published articles, the WHO 2012 report was the most cited document with 2485 total citations while South Africa was the most productive country in tuberculosis publications as well as the leading country with the highest co-authorship collaboration. Analysis of top relevant authors revealed that Anonymous (133) and Dheda (44) were the two topmost relevant authors of tuberculosis publications, South Africa was the most relevant country by corresponding authors and the topmost cited country for tuberculosis publications. Furthermore, analysis of the university collaborations network showed that the University of Cape Town was the topmost university in Africa with the highest collaboration network, tuberculosis as a word had the highest co-occurrence network while the Three Field Plot diagram revealed the relations between universities, keywords and countries. This study provides a quantitative and qualitative analyses of the leading journals, most cited published articles, title word occurrences, and most relevant authors in published documents on tuberculosis and tuberculosis related studies from 2010-2019.

AB  - Heatwaves are one of the most dangerous natural hazards causing more than 166,000 deaths from 1998-2017. Their frequency is increasing, and they are becoming more intense.
   Electric fans are an efficient, and sustainable solution to cool people. They are, for most applications, the cheapest cooling technology available. However, many national and international health guidelines actively advise people not to use them when indoor air temperatures exceed the skin temperature, approximately 35 degrees C.
   We used a human energy balance model, to verify the validity of those recommendations and to determine under which environmental (air temperature, relative humidity, air speed and mean radiant temperature) and personal (metabolic rate, clothing) conditions the use of fans would be beneficial.
   We found that current guidelines are too restrictive. Electric fans can be used safely even if the indoor dry-bulb temperature exceeds 35 degrees C since they significantly increase the amount of sweat that evaporates from the skin. The use of elevated air speeds (0.8 m/s) increases the critical operative temperature at which heat strain is expected to occur by an average of 14 degrees C for relative humidity values above 22 %. We also analyzed the most extreme weather events from 1990 to 2014 recorded in the 115 most populous cities worldwide, and we determined that in 93 of them the use of fans would have been beneficial.
   We developed a free, open-source, and easy-to-use online tool to help researchers, building practitioners, and policymakers better understand under which conditions electric fans can be safely used to cool people.

AB  - Stephanodiscus niagarae Ehrenberg is currently restricted to specific regions of central Mexico, however, during the late Pleistocene, it had a wider distribution in the country. This change in distribution is similar to those observed for several organisms that migrated southwards during cold, glacial climates, supporting the hypothesis that central Mexico acted as glacial refugia for these species. This study aims to support this hypothesis for S. niagarae as well as to analyze its ecological distribution in modern environments in central Mexico. For this purpose we studied 18 samples from 16 lakes located around Mexico City, selected among 46 lakes along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Diatom assemblages in superficial sediments, and climatic, hydrochemistry, and nutrient parameters of each lake were analyzed by means of canonical correspondence analyses. Additionally, we created an ecological niche model (ENM) with modern occurrence data (n = 47) and environmental variables (WorldClim) to produce potential distribution maps of S. niagarae during the present time and under the LGM conditions in the Nearctic realm. S. niagarae was recorded only in 4 sites in central Mexico (abundances < 10%) associated with temperate, subhumid conditions in freshwater lakes with [Mg2+] - [Ca2+] - [HCO3-] ionic dominance and high turbidity, mesotrophic to hypertrophic systems (based on chlorophyll a values), but with a tendency to P-limitation. In our study sites S. niagarae showed low abundances in diatom assemblages dominated by Aulacoseira spp. Temperature (annual mean, coldest and warmest quarters means) was identified by ENM as the main environmental variable controlling its distribution, with its highest modern support in the USA, southern Canada, and a restricted distribution in the highlands of western and central Mexico. Whereas, the LGM scenario (- 5.5 degrees C) identified the western and central highlands in Mexico and southern USA as the highest probability distribution areas supporting the approach that the Sierra Madre Occidental could have acted as a migration corridor offering suitable habitats for a southward migration into central Mexico during colder (glacial) periods. In conclusion, S. niagarae distribution in the central and western mountains of Mexico is controlled by temperature changes and its presence may be associated with colder (glacial) periods.

AB  - The transfer of nutrients between marine and terrestrial systems has important ecological consequences, and animal movement is an important driver of nutrient transfer. Coastal birds forage in marine environments and breed in terrestrial habitats, and thus serve as vectors moving nutrients from the sea to the land. However, urbanization can influence the extent to which coastal birds forage in marine or terrestrial environments due to the availability of human subsidies. Establishing a reliable and straightforward indicator of marine foraging would be useful for assessing changes in the use of terrestrial vs. marine habitats in the face of urbanization and broader environmental change, and for understanding the flow of nutrients and energy between terrestrial and marine environments. Mercury (Hg) is a highly toxic heavy metal which bioaccumulates in marine food webs, and is a potential indicator of marine foraging. Methylmercury (MeHg), is present only in aquatic ecosystems and reaches elevated concentrations in the prey species of marine birds. Thus, high concentrations of MeHg would be expected for birds foraging in marine environments in comparison to those foraging on terrestrial sources. We hypothesized that the degree of marine foraging influences Hg uptake in coastal birds. To test this hypothesis, we combined GPS tracking data with measurements of Hg concentrations in the blood of herring gulls (Larus argentatus) along an urban gradient in the northeast United States. We examined Hg concentrations for 51 individual herring gulls tracked with GPS tags at study sites representing high, medium and low degrees of urbanization. Our results showed a strong and significant positive relationship between Hg concentrations and the proportion of herring gull foraging locations occurring in offshore waters. Hg concentrations differed significantly between herring gulls whose primary foraging habitat occurred in marine vs. terrestrial environments. Gulls in more urban colonies spent less time foraging in marine environments, and had significantly lower Hg concentrations than those at the more remote study. Our results suggest that Hg concentrations in blood can be used to reflect the extent of marine foraging for animals using both marine and terrestrial habitats. Hg concentrations could be valuable monitoring tool to assess how the use of marine foraging habitats changes through time (dietary shifts) or relative to environmental change such as urbanization.

AB  - Objectives: Requests for opioid pain medication more than a few weeks after surgery are associated with greater symptoms of depression and cognitive biases regarding pain such as worst-case thinking and fear of painful movement. We sought factors associated with patient desire for more opioid medication and satisfaction with pain alleviation at suture removal after lower extremity surgery. Design: Cross sectional study. Setting: Enrollment occurred at 1 of 4 orthopaedic offices in an urban setting. Patients/Participants: At suture removal after lower extremity surgery, 134 patients completed questionnaires measuring catastrophic thinking, ability to reach goals and continue normal activities in spite of pain, symptoms of depression, and magnitude of physical limitations. Main Outcome Measurements: Psychological factors associated with questionnaire-reported patient desire for another opioid prescription, satisfaction with postoperative pain alleviation, and the self-reported number of pills remaining from original opioid prescription. Results: In logistic regression, smoking and greater catastrophic thinking were independently associated with desire for opioid refill (R-2 = 0.20). Lower satisfaction with pain alleviation was associated with greater catastrophic thinking (R-2 = 0.19). The size of surgery (large vs. medium/small procedure) was not associated with pain alleviation or satisfaction with pain alleviation. Conclusions: The association between unhelpful cognitive bias regarding pain and request for more opioids reinforces the importance of diagnosing and addressing common misconceptions regarding pain in efforts to help people get comfortable.

AB  - Deep-seated landslides are important agents of relief shaping and can have substantial impact on human settle-ments. Many examples are present in the Campania region of southern Italy, where the association of complex lithostratigraphic and structural geologic conditions might have effect on landslide initiation and evolution. On this basis and considering the effect that the deep-seated landslide have had in the last years on the urban settle-ment, the Buonalbergo landslide was analyzed in terms of decadal kinematics and geological control and insights in prospective evolution were provided. The analysis of data derived by geological and landslide field mapping, settlement damage analysis, Persistent Differential Interferometry SAR data analysis, and Finite Elements stability analysis revealed i) the approximately constant rate movement of the landslide in the last three decades with a consistent enlargement of its area, ii) the presence of a large overturned anticline, characterized by a complex lithostratigraphic arrangement and multiple discontinuity sets, iii) the presence of faults responsible for morpho-logical depression development, iv) a rotational mechanism characterizing the upper sector of the landslide and the ongoing translational sliding of blocks located at its toe and v) the effect of potential pore pressure scenarios on prospective kinematics (i.e. single to multiple stages creep) with the observed constant rate movement poten-tially related to a pore pressure at the landslide base ranging between 300 and 400 kPa. Result interpretation sug-gests i) the role of the structural and lithostratigraphic setting of the slope as predisposing factor for landslide development, ii) the potential of fold-related fabric in controlling landslide geometry and fragmentation, iii) the possible occurrence of multiple landslide events affecting the slope affected by the deep-seated landslide and iv) the potential of hydrologic conditions in modulating landslide velocity and evolution toward slope failure. The relevance of results is related to the representativeness of the Buonalbergo landslide as common process in the Apennine context in terms of potential long-term morphologic evolution of the slope and the existence of many landslides that develop in similar geological conditions driving sediment production and inducing persis-tent topographic changes in mountainsides.

AB  - A total of 367 bovine sera positive to antibodies against non-structural proteins (NSPs) of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus were screened for serotype O, A and SAT2 antibodies using the virus neutralization test (VNT). Sera had been collected in 2016 from North (228) and South (139) Darfur States in Western Sudan, where high and low circulation of FMD virus, respectively, prevailed. Tested sera represented the positive-NSPs portion in a random sample of 669 sera collected from both States. According to standard statistical methods, calculations for serial testing (NSPs ELISA and VNT) were applied to estimate prevalence rates of serotype-specific antibodies in the two States. In each State, approximately 20% of NSPs positive sera failed typing. Prevalence's detected were 49% +/- 5% (O), 27% +/- 5% (A) and 14% +/- 4% (SAT2) in North Darfur State and 27% +/- 5% (O), 17% +/- 4% (A) and 8.0% +/- 3% (SAT2) in South Darfur State. In both States, prevalence rates were significantly higher for serotype O, followed by A then SAT2; the same order that was known in most parts of Sudan. Consistently, estimated prevalence's were statistically significantly higher (P < 0.05) in North Darfur than in South Darfur State. Apart from serotype SAT2, detected prevalence rates were lower or similar to those inside the country in previous occasions. Frequency and pattern of distribution of serotype O prevalence were consistent with its suggested pattern of circulation from the Nile valley to other parts in Sudan and significant within the country's circulation. Alternatively, serotype SAT2 prevalence and distribution in Darfur area were suggestive of sporadic occurrence. However, slightly higher prevalence rates of SAT2 antibodies in Darfur than in neighbouring Kordofan areas in 2013 reflected the wide dissemination of SAT2 (http://www.wrlfmd.org) in Sudan in early 2014. Risk of FMD in Darfur seemed to be associated with the movement of animals to the North in the wet season as part of the pastoral system, and with movement related to trade into urban centers more than with pastoralism across the Western borders. Generally, the result presented little evidence to suggest presence of FMD primary endemic foci in Darfur area.

AB  - Changes in atmospheric water vapor mainly occur in the atmospheric boundary layer. However, due to many factors, such as orography and ground thermal dynamic conditions, the change trends and transformation law of atmospheric water vapor contents above different surfaces are still unclear. In this work, a Doppler weather radar with high spatial-temporal resolution was used to monitor the variations and transformations of water vapor contents over different land surfaces for two years. The results show that the atmospheric water vapor content shows a very good positive correlation with elevation at altitudes between 600 m and 1200 m, while different land surfaces have delicate impacts on atmospheric water vapor contents, such as extreme values appearing above impervious urban surfaces, uniform distributions appearing over water body and vegetated surfaces being wet but avoiding extreme conditions. Compared with previous studies, the results and conclusions of this study are mainly derived from accurate direct observations based on high-resolution radar. Identifying the distribution and transformation of water vapor over different surfaces can enhance our understanding of the movement and variation of atmospheric water vapor over complex terrain and different land surfaces, and improve the planning and construction capacity of different surfaces, such that humankind can mitigate the severe disasters caused by drastic changes in atmospheric water vapor.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the strategies, tactics and conveniences present in the everyday life of the settlers and pre-settlers in the city of Querencia do Norte-PR. We start from the theoretical contributions on everyday life as a place of inventions and resistances for De Certeau (2014) and De Certeau, Giard and Mayol (2013). Another concept frequently used is convenience, pointed by De Certeau, Giard and Mayol (2013) as a form of implicit education, an ordering of social behaviors, rules for coexistence of the subjects in the social environment. In this sense, we conducted oral history interviews with residents of settlements, pre-settlement, residents and former residents of Querencia do Norte-PR. Through the interviewees' reports we were able to identify that, in order to maintain their place of will and power, the "owners" of the lands in Querencia do Norte used force to remove the rural workers (known as "posseiros"), this even before the arrival of the Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST). Thus, this region constitutes as a space of fights, where death from land conflicts was a frequent occurrence. The ones who died were the workers who did not have political contacts and financial capital. This reality remains during the first years of the MST's arrival, and through cunning these workers build their daily lives and despite the ownership of the land, the daily struggle to be able to plant and sell the product of their work continues.

AB  - The present study had as main objective to describe general aspect the regulars (students/clients - bodybuilding practitioners) of brazilian fitness gyms that reside in Bolivia and, at the same time, to understand the opinion of those responsible (owners/guardians/teachers) of these spaces in the city of Corumba-MS (Brazil), especially considering the condition of pendularity of users on the studied border.The "free access" gyms (without personalized training) were mapped, as well as that attended students in a condition of pendularity, practitioners of weight training and who authorized the development of the research. In this way, the sample had two units selected, and questionnaires with open and closed questions were applied to the two delimited groups (students/clients and owners/guardians/teachers). Preliminary results show that the adherence and frequency of these fitness spaces, in the view of students/clients pendularity, occurs for different reasons, highlighting the good location, price/quality, weight loss, health maintenance, sports training, while in the view of the owners/guardians/teachers, good communication and importance in fostering the local economy/trade are highlighted. We conclude, therefore, that because it is a border region, it becomes extremely important to describe the general aspect of this audience, especially highlighting the reasons for the pendular movement in this fitness segment. The embryonic results also reinforce the need for further studies to better understand the frequency and participation of these subjects in pendulum condition in the different fitness spaces in the region.

AB  - Background Like many developing countries, Thailand has experienced a rapid rise in obesity, accompanied by a rapid change in occupational structure. It is plausible that these two trends are related, with movement into sedentary occupations leading to increases in obesity. National health examination survey data contains information on obesity and socioeconomic conditions that can help untangle the relationship, but analysis is challenging because of small sample sizes. Methods This paper explores the relationship between occupation and obesity using data on 10,127 respondents aged 20-59 from the 2009 National Health Examination Survey. Obesity is measured using waist circumference. Modelling is carried out using an approach known as Multiple Regression with Post-Stratification (MRP). We use Bayesian hierarchical models to construct prevalence estimates disaggregated by age, sex, education, urban-rural residence, region, and occupation, and use census population weights to aggregate up. The Bayesian hierarchical model is designed to protect against overfitting and false discovery, which is particularly important in an exploratory study such as this one. Results There is no clear relationship between the overall sedentary nature of occupations and obesity. Instead, obesity appears to vary occupation by occupation. For instance, women in professional occupations, and men who are agricultural or fishery workers, have relatively low rates of obesity. Conclusion Bayesian hierarchical models plus post-stratification offers new possibilities for using surveys to learn about complex health issues.

AB  - Academic literature has so far explored food democracy and citizen participation in agri-food system governance mainly in relation to the 'food' end of agri-food systems, and primarily in urban contexts. We argue that this focus can be usefully extended to agricultural production and to wider territorial processes occurring in rural areas. In this study, we examine the development of a grassroots movement demanding stricter municipal regulation of agricultural pesticide use and support for a more sustainable and localised agri-food system. The study site, located in the north-eastern Italian Alps, has in recent years been characterized by the spread of intensive agriculture, particularly due to the expansion of vineyards. Our conceptual framework brings together the literature on food democracy and just sustainability transitions, seen from a territorial perspective. We use this framework to examine the role played by civil society organisations and alternative food networks in municipal and territorial agri-food system governance. The results show how the grassroots anti-pesticide mobilisation played a key role in reforming municipal pesticide regulations and in slowing down the spread of intensive agriculture in the province. We also draw attention to the framings used by activists to gain the support of public opinion and local administrators. Finally, we discuss the role played by different forms of food democracy processes in facilitating the emergence of a territorial vision of just sustainability transitions.

AB  - Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has emerged as a ubiquitous solution for data collection from embedded sensors of smart devices to improve the sensing capacity and reduce sensing costs in large regions. Due to the ubiquitous nature of MCS services, smart devices require awareness of against misbehaving users that are becoming smarter to clog the resources in such a nondedicated sensing environment. In an MCS setting, the primary goal of a fake sensing task submission is to keep participant devices occupied, such as the battery, sensing, storage, and computing. Since the development of robust sensing campaigns highly depends on the existence of a realistic model of misbehaving users, this article leverages artificial intelligence and introduces a region-based self-organizing feature map (SOFM)-based model on user movement patterns so as to place the fake sensing tasks with the objective of maximum impacted participants and recruits. Uniformly and randomly initialized neurons are designed with fixed and adaptive quantities that are determined based upon the affected area on the covered terrain. Through numerical studies, we show that the impact of the SOFM structures can affect up to 46% of the participants and up to 37% of the recruits under various SOFM topologies. Furthermore, SOFM-based task submission models can increase the energy consumption in recruited devices by up to 39% due to the illegitimate task submission.

AB  - Introduction Brazil is one of the epicenters of COVID-19 pandemic and faces several hindrances to make his COVID-19 vaccination plan efficient. Methods The Brazilian COVID-19 vaccination plan was evaluated and the hindrances to make the COVID-19 vaccination plan efficient were described and discussed. Results High territorial extension might contribute to a delay on the COVID-19 vaccination, due to difficulty in delivering vaccines to furthest Brazilian states and to all the interior cities. The choice among the vaccines should be done based on the type of storage and must consider the transport conditions necessary to maintain its effectiveness. The indigenous individuals were included with health-care workers as the first group to be vaccinated, inflaming the number of vaccines doses distributed in states where the indigenous population have higher prevalence. The antivaccine movement and the politicization of the vaccine are also hindrances to be overcome in Brazil. The COVID-19 incidence or mortality rate and the distribution of intensive care units (ICUs) are not a criterion to distribute the vaccines, as we did not identify a correlation between these markers and the number of vaccines. However, a strong or very strong correlation occurred between the number of COVID-19 vaccines and the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths by COVID-19, gross domestic product, as well as populational density. A total of 83,280,475 doses of COVID-19 vaccines were distributed in Brazil. In the first dose, the Coronavac (Sinovac (TM)), AZD1222 (AstraZeneca/Oxford (TM)), and BNT162b (Pfizer/BioNTech (TM)) vaccines were responsible to vaccinate, respectively, 9.61%, 6.69%, and 0.35% of the Brazilian population. In the second dose, the Coronavac, AZD1222, and BNT162b vaccines were responsible to vaccinate, respectively, 7.52%, 0.53%, and Conclusions The Federal Government must evaluate the hindrances and propose solutions to maximize the immunization against COVID-19 on Brazil.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the possible correlation between using a partial coverage interocclusal plaque and the probability of changes in dental positioning. Methods: this is a transversal study, where twenty patients with temporomandibular muscle dysfunction (tmd) were selected in the city of aracaju-se-brazil, with both gender and aged over 18 years. The clinical examination was carried out by the research diagnostic criteria/tmd, patients were classified according to the subgroup of dysfunctions. Individuals classified as muscular tmd were positioned in the dental chair and submitted to orthodontic button bonding procedures on the buccal surface of the central incisors and on the first molars, in such a way that they served as a guide for overlapping tomographic images. Soon after, the anterior partial device was adapted to the antero-inferior teeth and the patients underwent cone-beam computed tomography. The research participants were instructed to use such a device daily, for eight hours, for a period of eight weeks and, thus, they were submitted to a new tomographic image for later evaluation in three dimensions and measurement of the dental positioning modification, if it occurred. Results: in this study we observe no statistically significant association between the presence of tooth movement and the use of the partial cover plate. Conclusion: according to the results of this study, there was no statistical correlation between the use of the partial-coverage interocclusal plaque and the change in dental positioning for the period evaluated.

AB  - The Comunidade Nova Esperanca was created in 2020 in a public space on the outskirts of the city of Curitiba, capital of the state of Parana, based on the actions of the Popular Movement for Housing (PMH). The occupied area, with a total area of 371,420.23 m(2), belongs to the Social Action Foundation, a public entity linked to the Municipality of Curitiba. As it is an occupation, the area is currently subject to a lawsuit for repossession. Faced with the need to clarify the characteristics of the area, the Parquet of the State of Parana requested the Federal University of Parana (UFPR) to carry out a technical study on the possibilities of use, occupation and subdivision of the area and the environmental conditions since it is located in a municipality with fragile environment. In this study, we analyze the environment, general living conditions, housing and ways of generating income of about 1,200 families, of which 65% are between 25 and 59 years old and 1/4 of them are immigrants particularly affected by the pandemic and the economic crisis. Overall, we identified the state's omission in housing and social protection policies. In the opposite direction, in the community, residents preserve the forest, organize solid waste collection, build biodigesters and certain septic tank structures to reduce soil and groundwater contamination. In addition, there is a community garden, a collective kitchen and a sewing workshop. The occupied area is an obvious solution to the housing deficit. Furthermore, income generation and new forms of sociability between Brazilians and immigrants are examples that can inspire the implementation of reception and integration policies.

AB  - Background and Aim During endoscopic submucosal dissection for superficial esophageal cancer, patient body movement can sometimes occur, which may cause discontinuation of the procedure. Propofol and dexmedetomidine have recently been found to be useful sedatives for endoscopic submucosal dissection. This study investigated whether sedation using propofol plus dexmedetomidine can suppress the patient's body movements during esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection and compared this combination with sedation using propofol alone.
   Methods This was a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial. Patients with superficial esophageal cancers who underwent esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection at Yokohama City University Hospital were prospectively enrolled and were randomly assigned to the propofol and the propofol plus dexmedetomidine groups. The primary endpoint was the incidence of restlessness. The secondary endpoints were the satisfaction score, maintenance dose of propofol, and number of rescue propofol injections.
   Results Sixty-six patients (propofol group: n = 33; combination group: n = 33) were included. The combination group had a significantly lower incidence of restlessness than the propofol group (3.0% vs 27.3%, P = 0.02). In the combination group, the satisfaction scores of the endoscopists were significantly higher, the maintenance dose of propofol was significantly lower, and the number of rescue propofol injections was lower than those in the propofol group (3.0% vs 18.2%, P < 0.001). Although the incidence of bradycardia was significantly higher in the combination group (30.3% vs 3.0%, P < 0.01), no serious adverse effects occurred.
   Conclusion The propofol plus dexmedetomidine combination provided excellent sedation that effectively suppressed the patient's body movements during esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection.

AB  - The development of welfare assistive devices for frail elderly people has attracted significant attention for its effort to improve the quality of life and reduce the burden on caregivers. However, it is challenging to conduct multiple user tests because of the significant burden on the elderly; thus, we need efficient ways to extract insight through different approaches. In this study, we aim to elucidate real-time transitions in users' emotions and achievement motivation while using such a device. We synthesize an utterance analysis method based on attribution theory, in which all users' utterances are attributed to four categories (ability, effort, task difficulty, and luck) that follow the developed coding rules. Knowing the transitions in causal attribution allows us to extract salient experiences for users, especially by extracting shifts from them and analyzing why the shift occurred and what exactly was happening before and after the shift. If only salient user experiences can be referenced from the aggregate data, useful information can be extracted in a short time to improve system characteristics and the environment. We discussed the validity and reliability of the proposed method by conducting a user test of an electric-assisted four-wheeled cycle for frail elderly people in Kakegawa city in Shizuoka, Japan. We also succeeded in marking the points that need attention, which is about 33% of the total amount of utterance data (1626 utterances), and thus confirmed the potential of the proposed method. Future research should examine how the developed methodology can help designers improve assistive device development, as well as how it can contribute to other fields such as education and social assistance.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) on tall or upward-pointed lighting installations affects the flight behavior of night-migrating birds. We hypothesized that common low-rise lights pointing downward also affect the movement of nocturnal migrants. We predicted that birds in flight will react close to low-rise lights, and be attracted and grounded near light sources, with a stronger effect on juveniles during their autumn migration. We conducted a controlled longitudinal experiment with light-emitting diode floodlights and considered nearby structures that turn on lights at night. We analyzed 1501 high-resolution 3D nocturnal flight paths of free-flying migrants and diurnally captured 758-2009 birds around experimental lights during spring and autumn 2016, and spring 2017. We identified change points along flight paths where birds turned horizontally or vertically, and we considered these indicative of reactions. Flight paths with and without reactions were generally doser to our experimental site in spring than in autumn when the lights were on. Reactions were up to 40% more likely to occur in autumn than in spring depending on the threshold magnitude of turning angle Reactions in spring were up to similar to 60% more likely to occur at similar to 35 m from the lights than at >1.5 km. In autumn, some vertical reactions were similar to 40% more likely to occur at similar to 50 m from the lights than at >2.2 km. Interactions between distance to lights and visibility or cloud cover were consistent with known effects of ALAN on nocturnal migrants. Under poor visibility, reactions were up to 50% more likely to occur farthest from structures in spring, but up to 60% more likely to occur closest to lights in autumn. Thus, the effects of ALAN on night-migrating land birds are not limited to bright lights pointing upward or lights on tall structures in urban areas. Diurnal capture rates of birds were not different when lights were on or off for either season. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that low-rise lights pointing downward affect night-migrating birds. Although the interpreted reactions constitute subtle modifications in the linearity of flight paths, we discuss future work that could verify whether the protection of nocturnal migrants with lights-out programs would have greater impact if implemented beyond urban areas and include management of low-rise lights.

AB  - An extreme rainfall event with maximum 12 hr accumulated rainfall of 464.8 mm associated with a quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system occurred over the western coastal region of South China in June 2017. An observational analysis shows that early convective storms were initiated near the mountains and moved northeastwards. Moreover, a convergence line between cold northerly winds and warm southerly winds in the lower levels was formed, which favored the development of the quasi-stationary system. Cold northerly winds were associated with land breeze, downslope winds as well as previous rainfall during earlier period, and cold pool outflows during later period. Cloud-resolving simulations were performed to examine the roles of terrain, land-sea surface roughness contrast, and cold pool outflows in the formation of heavy rainfall. Results demonstrate that land-sea surface roughness contrast and mountains in the middle of Yangjiang and Jiangmen facilitated the formation of the convergence line during earlier period, and cold pool outflows sustained it during later period. Besides orographic lifting, coastal hills helped reduce the stability. Mountains in the middle of Yangjiang hindered the movement of the convective system, without which the associated heavy rainfall would shift farther north. Mt. Tianlu with westward concave morphology played a vital role in the formation of local convergence and the concentration of heavy rainfall. Without it, the total rainfall in the region of interest was reduced. This study suggests the importance of representing processes associated with the complex underlying surface in models for the prediction of heavy rainfall in coastal regions.

AB  - From Traditional Sports and Games (TSG) we have not only learned different ways of living time as well as inhabit space and a particular mode of practicing sports and games from distinct cultures, but also promoting universal dialog among people. TSG presents sustainable and ecological references for living needed even before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nowadays, environmentally friendly policies and production methods must be taken more seriously. TSG may reveal a path to sustainable development, considering our corporeality and cultural diversity. TSG are expressions of human groups that historically reproduce their way of life-based on modes of social cooperation and specific forms of relationship with nature, traditionally characterized by sustained environmental management. The purpose of this article is to discuss how TSG promotes intercultural dialog with a focus on sustainability, and how it empowers people and creates equality among its players. We understand that TSG can break socio-cultural barriers. For this study, we considered data from a Brazilian experience of TSG's Festival held at a public school in the city of Sao Paulo (Brazil), organized in collaboration with our study group. Data consists of observations recorded in pictures and films during the processes of organization, preparation, implementation, and evaluation of a TSG Festival, held in a public school in Sao Paulo, Brazil from the years of 2017 and 2018, with the participation of 800 students from the first to the ninth grade of elementary school, aged between 7 and 17 years. The first step in our analysis is taken from a dynamic called "Talking Circles," where researchers registered dialog about experiences and used specific literature about TSG, from a philosophical perspective. The team and students from our study group that organized these events were invited to participate in four different Talking Circles. Approximately 20 people participated in each one of these meetings. Recurrences that emerged from these Talking Circles are presented in the results and explored afterward. What does this experience-from bodies in movement, artistic or sporting, or both-teach about intercultural dialog and empowerment? Such gestures indicate a cultural heritage and corporeal wisdom that allows humans to face new encounters and understanding in peace, recognizing humanity common to all of us, regardless of our origins. Ethical and aesthetical results of such dialog reveal possibilities to be explored in our relationship with different cultures and the environment, providing points of sustainable development through TSG.

AB  - Background
   Interpersonal violence has physical, emotional, educational, social, and economic implications. Although there is interest in empowering young people to challenge harmful norms, there is scant research on how individual agency, and, specifically, the "power to" resist or bring about an outcome relates to peer violence perpetration and victimization in early adolescence. This manuscript explores the relationship between individual agency and peer violence perpetration and victimization among very young adolescents (VYAs) living in two urban poor settings in sub-Saharan Africa (Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Blantyre, Malawi).
   Methods and findings
   The study draws on two cross-sectional surveys including 2,540 adolescents 10 to 14 years from Kinshasa in 2017 (girls = 49.8% and boys = 50.2%) and 1,213 from Blantyre in 2020 (girls = 50.7% and boys = 49.3%). The sample was school based in Malawi but included in-school and out-of-school participants in Kinshasa due to higher levels of early school dropout. Peer violence in the last 6 months (dependent variable) was defined as a four categorical variable: (1) no victimization or perpetration; (2) victimization only; (3) perpetration only; and (4) both victimization and perpetration. Agency was operationalized using 3 scales: freedom of movement, voice, and decision-making, which were further divided into tertiles. Univariate analysis and multivariable multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate the relationships between each agency indicator and peer violence. The multivariable regression adjusted for individual, family, peer, and community level covariates. All analyses were stratified by gender and site.
   In both sites, adolescents had greater voice and decision-making power than freedom of movement, and boys had greater freedom of movement than girls. Boys in both settings were more likely to report peer violence in the last six months than girls (40% to 50% versus 32% to 40%, p < 0.001), mostly due to higher rates of a perpetration-victimization overlap (18% to 23% versus 10% to 15%, p < 0.001). Adolescents reporting the greatest freedom of movement (Tertile 3) (with the exception of girls in Kinshasa) had a greater relative risk ratio (RRR) of reporting a perpetrator-victim overlap (boys Kinshasa: RRR = 1.9 (1.2 to 2.8, p = 0.003); boys Blantyre: RRR = 3.8 (1.7 to 8.3, p = 0.001); and girls Blantyre: RRR = 2.4 (1.1 to 5.1, p = 0.03)). Adolescents with the highest decision-making power in Kinshasa also had greater RRR of reporting a perpetrator-victim overlap (boys: RRR = 3.0 (1.8 to 4.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, girls and boys in Kinshasa with intermediate decision-making power (tertile 2 versus 1) had a lower RRR of being victimized (Girls: RRR = 1.7 (1.02 to 2.7, p = 0.04); Boys: RRR = 0.6 (0.4 to 0.9, p = 0.01)). Higher voice among boys in Kinshasa (Tertile 2: RRR = 1.9 (1.2 to 2.9, p = 0.003) and Tertile 3: 1.8 (1.2 to 2.8, p = 0.009)) and girls in Blantyre (Tertile 2: 2.0 (1.01 to 3.9, p = 0.048)) was associated with a perpetrator-victim overlap, and girls with more voice in Blantyre had a greater RRR of being victimized (Tertile 2: RRR = 1.9 (1.1 to 3.1, p = 0.02)). Generally, associations were stronger for boys than girls, and associations often differed when victimization and perpetration occurred in isolation of each other. A main limitation of this study is that the cross-sectional nature of the data does not allow a causal interpretation of the findings, which need further longitudinal exploration to establish temporality.
   Conclusions
   In this study, we observed that peer violence is a gendered experience that is related to young people's agency. This stresses the importance of addressing interpersonal violence in empowerment programs and of including boys who experience the greatest perpetration-victimization overlap.

AB  - This paper explores the role and place of national, regional, and international society collaborations in addressing the major global burden of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). On the same order of HIV, RHD affects over 40 million people worldwide. In this article, we will outline the background and current therapeutic landscape for cardiac surgery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) including the resource-constrained settings within which RHD surgery often occurs. This creates numerous challenges to delivering adequate surgical care and post-operative management for RHD patients, and thus provides some context for a growing movement for and applicability of structural heart approaches, innovative valve replacement technologies, and minimally invasive techniques in this setting. Intertwined and building from this context will be the remainder of the paper which elaborates how national, regional, and international societies have collaborated to address rheumatic heart disease in the past (e.g., Drakensberg Declaration, World Heart Federation Working Group on RHD) with a focus on primary and secondary prevention. We then provide the recent history and context of the growing movement for how surgery has become front and center in the discussion of addressing RHD through the passing of the Cape Town Declaration.

AB  - Our study gives voice to socially marginalized women from the Global South whose struggles with sexual harassment are largely invisible in the #Metoo movement. Employing an ethnographic approach, this study examines the digitized resistance of Chinese rural-urban migrant women (n = 41) against sexual harassment faced in their workplaces. We adopt the lens of intersectionality to reveal the nuanced impacts of mobile communication practices negotiated in the context of gender, class, and the organizational structure across informal and formal economies. We find contrasting pictures of bottom-up disruption in the informal labor market and top-down transformation occurring in the modern factory. Migrant women working in the unregulated market restructured the existing patriarchal culture by deploying mobiles to establish collaborative groups for job information sharing. This mobile-mediated sharing enabled the rise of self-employed entrepreneurship, thus avoiding male intermediation in their livelihoods and thereby reducing the chances of encountering harassment. However, these benefits were uneven, with digitally-challenged women missing out. In contrast, migrant women employed in a registered factory with established rules actively negotiated top-down transformation of patriarchal culture. Female managers, in newly gained leadership roles, exercised their professional authority to encourage female workers to re-shape the discursive gender power of mobile spaces shared with male workers. Women actively confronted sexually provocative behavior of men on chat groups. We argue that subtle and covert mobile practices, in addition to visible and direct ones, allow for the construction of digitized female resistance culture as part of broader societal change influenced by mobile communication. We conclude with comments on the complexity and dynamism of mobile-mediated gender transformation in the context of rapid socio-economic development in the Global South..

AB  - Obsidian sourcing in the Near East was principally developed to investigate the Neolithic Revolution, but limitations of these early studies were soon recognized. Critics noted that sites included in the models span millennia and vary in size and function. Greater insight is offered by a more contextualized examination of the nature and timing of sites. Within the Neolithic sequence, one phase of considerable interest is the Halaf period (c. 6000-4500 BCE) in Northern Mesopotamia. The spread of Halaf "tradition," arguably the earliest example of a widely shared material culture in the region, has been tied to varied hypotheses of movement (of people, objects, and/or ideas) that remain largely untested. The use of obsidian sourcing to investigate Halafian phenomena (e.g., the spread of Halaf ceramics, the practice of dryland farming) would ideally involve high temporal resolution and consider settlement function and scale (e.g., an early urban center, a small farming village). Umm Qseir, the smallest known Halaf site, fulfills both. Occupied for less than two centuries, Umm Qseir was an environmentally marginal farmstead managed year-round by just two or three families at a time. The closest contemporary settlement was more than 30 km to the north, within the conventional limits of dryland farming (annual rainfall > 250 mm). Here we reconstruct and refine obsidian sourcing data for Umm Qseir artifacts from 1990s and 2000s studies, and we present new data for a small assemblage. We also highlight techno-typological clues that elucidate production, use, and maintenance of such artifacts. Ultimately, such findings offer insights into the exchange strategy of Syrian steppe farmsteaders and reflect an important means of risk management.

AB  - Geomorphological investigations in Rome's river valley are revealing the dynamism of the prehistoric landscape. It is becoming increasingly apparent that paleogeographic conditions that defined Rome in the historical era are the product of changes since the Bronze Age, which may be the result of local fault activity in addition to fluvial dynamism. Through a dedicated borehole chronostratigraphic study, integrated by C-14 and archaeological dates, and paleomagnetic investigations, we offer here new evidence for fault displacement since ca. 4500 years/BP. We present the failure of the sedimentary fabric of a clay horizon caused by liquefaction processes commonly linked with seismic shaking, interpreting an (ca. 4 m) offset to signify the existence of a fault line located at the foot of the Capitoline Hill. In addition, we show evidence for another (ca. 1 m) offset affecting a stratigraphic horizon in the river channel, occurring along another hypothesized fault line crossing through the Tiber Valley. Movement along this fault may have contributed to a documented phase of fast overflooding dated to the sixth century BCE which eventually led to the birth of the Tiber Island. The most plausible scenario implies progressive deformation, with an average tectonic rate of 2 mm/year, along these inferred fault lines. This process was likely punctuated with moderate earthquakes, but no large event necessarily occurred. Together, the available evidence suggests that during the early centuries of sedentary habitation at the site of Rome, active fault lines contributed to significant changes to the Tiber River valley, capable of challenging lowland activities.

AB  - The sustainability of rural sanitation includes the long-term welfare of both rural and urban societies. As a commonly used rural sanitation technology, operation of intermittent sand filters (ISF) is impacted by biofilm clogging inside the ISF. In this study ISF performance is studied at low hydraulic loading rates (HLR) to explore the interaction between biofilm growth and wastewater treatment efficiency. CW2D/HYDRUS, a simulation model which does not include media hydraulic property changes caused by biofilm growth, is utilized as a numerical control to contrast the effects of biofilm growth inside an experimental ISF. A paired experiment with simulation demonstrate that biofilm clogging comprised dominantly of heterotrophs occurred in the top layers of the ISF. Lowered HLR slows clogging development but not final clogging extent. The biofilm clogging development zone offers adequate removal of applied biodegradable COD and NH4+ - N. However, the spatial distribution of heterotrophs and biodegradable COD does not match the denitrification requirement of the resulting NO3-- N. A simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) potential is manifested in the clogging development zone, but lowered HLR reduces media moisture level to a less favorable level for denitrification. Furthermore, slowed water movement under lower HLR aggravates the accumulation of NO3- - N, which can potentially result in counterproductive salt accumulation. Since biofilm growth is a natural and self-adaptive response towastewater application, this study suggests accepting limited, managed biofilm growth and clogging in ISFs. In addition, this study calls for further research to manage biofilm growth and clogging for long-term ISF sustainability. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In instances where earthquakes with large magnitude occur, liquefaction-induced lateral deformation of ground has caused thorough destruction to the underground structure of urban rail transit. A sequence of shaking table experiments was conducted on shield-enlarge-dig type's subway station structure in liquefiable ground exposed to the near field earthquake and the far field earthquake. Outcomes of these experiments are discussed in items of foundation deformation, pore water pressure, acceleration response, dynamic soil pressure, and macroscopic failure of model structure. The measured data infers that, when subjected to a high intensity earthquake, the model structure generates an upward movement relative to the foundation. The difference between the soil pressure above and below the structure is the internal cause of the liquefaction-induced uplift of the structure. The shear deformation to the soil layer of the foundation happened, and the displacement peak values of the left and right pendula were asymmetric. The acceleration response and its amplification coefficient in the model foundation gradually increases towards the surface from the bottom as a result of a low intensity earthquake, but for medium and high intensity earthquakes, the acceleration response decreases first and then increases. A notable phenomenon of high frequency filtering and low frequency amplification ensued during the seismic wave propagation from the bottom to the surface of soil. For the same depth of measuring points in foundation soil, the time when the pore-pressure ratio reaches the peak lags behind the time when the acceleration reaches the peak, and the hysteresis is more intense with a rise in magnitude of ground movement. The response spectrum of a low intensity earthquake is characterized by low period accumulation and amplification, while the response spectrum of medium and high intensity is characterized by moves from short period to long period and multi-peaks. The pore pressure accumulation of the model foundation experienced a change process of "rapid growth and slow dissipation," and the time period of its sharp increase was consistent with that of the sharp increase of the acceleration arias strength. The existence of the underground structure notably inhibits an increase in pore water pressure. The earthquake damage mechanism of the underground subway station of shield-enlarge-dig type in liquefiable ground occurred in three phases: shear failure occurred on the column and damaged the opening position and spandrel of the tunnel; connection parts of the side wall and roof exhibited tensile damage; and the underground structure collapsed.

AB  - Research on the impact of the environment on COVID-19 diffusion lacks a full-comprehensive perspective, and neglecting the multiplicity of the human-environment system can lead to misleading conclusions. We attempted to reveal all pre-existing environmental-to-human and human-to-human determinants that influence the transmission of COVID-19. As such, We estimated the daily case incidence ratios (CIR) of COVID-19 for prefectures across mainland China, and used a mixed-effects mixed-distribution model to study the association between the CIR and 114 factors related to climate, atmospheric environmental quality, terrain, population, economic, human mobility as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Not only the changes in determinants over time as the pandemic progresses but also their lag and interaction effects were examined. CO, O-3, PM10 and PM2.5 were found positively linked with CIR, but the effect of NO2 was negative. The temperature had no significant association with CIR, and the daily minimum humidity was a significant negatively predictor. NPIs' level was negatively associated with CIR until with a lag of 15 days. Higher accumulated destination migration scale flow from the epicenter and lower distance to the epicenter (DisWH) were associated with a higher CIR, however, the interaction between DisWH and the time was positive. The more economically developed and more densely populated cities have a higher probability of CIR occurrence, but they may not have a higher CIR intensity.The COVID-19 diffusion are caused by a multiplicity of environmental, economic, social factors as well as NPIs. First, multiple pollutants carried simultaneously on particulate matter affect COVID-19 transmission. Second, the temperature has a limited impact on the spread of the epidemic. Third, NPIs must last for at least 15 days or longer before the effect has been apparent. Fourth, the impact of population movement from the epicenter on COVID-19 gradually diminished over time and intraregional migration deserves more attention.

AB  - In this paper, I try to understand what kinds of mobilities of transformation occur in the museum, both as a concept and as a spatial and sensorial experience, from my own ethnographic work on the Bread for Social Change Museum in Gabrovo, Bulgaria, reviewed in dialogue with studies on other types of museums as representatives of important transformations and innovations in the creative industries. The other types of museums explored below include: Community-founded and partially state-sponsored museum in Brazil (Museum of the Imaginary Object in Salvador de Bahia); Statefounded and financed but community-run cultural center in British Columbia (Clifford); Community-founded and privately-funded museums in Peru and Mexico (Cuauhtemoc Camarena and Teresa Morales; Buntinx); Individually-founded community museums at private homes in Morocco (Kapchan) and the Museum of Bread for Social Change in Bulgaria (Savova-Grigorova).
   The questions I ask include: What do these differently funded and functioning physical spaces have in common as an idea and as a strategy for development that explore the museum logics as symptoms of larger social processes imbued with affect and emotion? And in the movement towards tangible and intangible heritage safeguarding, are people afraid to forget, or excited about remembering, or vice versa? The research finally analyzes the social, cultural, and economic roles of the museums and cultural centers as points along the Bread for Social Change Cultural Route and thus the wider vision and potential benefits to sustainable development of the new emerging sphere of "social tourism".
   The Bread Route includes three different geographic and thematic routes, all envisioned to be ultimately united into one: Bread Route in Bulgaria (currently operating), European Bread Route and a Global Bread Route across continents (to be developed).The Bread Routes and in particular the Bread (for Change) Museum in Gabrovo, Bulgaria, bear the mo!o "Travel with a mission" and present a case of creative tourism we explore in this research as social tourism, while the points on the Route are perceived not as tourist a!ractions but as "destinations of experiences".
   Methodologically, this research is both an action research and an auto-ethnography, since the idea for the Route is a personal vision and initiative of the researcher, dr. Nadezhda Savova-Grigorova, cultural anthropologist awarded as "Traveler with a Mission of the Year 2012" by the global National Geographic for having traveled 76 countries exploring their bread traditions and helping communities unite through community baking creative methods, also recognized as a new form of art therapy called "Bread Therapy".
   The Bread Cultural Route integrates the categories of cultural, gastronomic, and green alternative tourism, but also (participatory) social tourism as it offers tourists and underprivileged locals interactive, deeply touching and transformative baking activities that leave the travelers with lasting emotional memories from their "travel with a mission". The activities planned along the European and Global Routes are developed and offered by various local organizations and institutions, from Bread Houses part of the Bread Houses Network to Bread Museums, bakeries, community and cultural centers, and various NGOs, which offer experiences that include all the multifaceted therapeutic/healing, social, anthropological, training, and performative sides of the breadmaking processes and local bread traditions.
   The Bread Route in Bulgaria passes through the socio-cultural centers Bread Houses, part of the Bread Houses Network Bulgaria (www.bread.bg) in six locations with rich tangible and intangible cultural heritage (Gabrovo, Veliko Tarnovo/Zlataritsa, Chiprovtsi, Plovdiv, Stara Zagora, Sofia). In each "destination of experience", the tourists can master different local recipes for the preparation of traditional bread and pastry products, while they also participate in the innovative method for community baking called "Theater of crumbs", which enables them to learn about and recreate impressions from each location by drawing in flour and then creating sculptures/symbols out of dough. The baking events can engage the tourists with local disadvantaged groups that regularly visit the Bread House for free as part of its "Bread Therapy" program. The daily mission of the Bread Houses as socio-cultural centers is to both revive and enrich forgo!en traditions related to food, arts and cra#s, and at the same time to create conditions to gather people from different social backgrounds, people with disabilities and various other isolated and vulnerable groups to regularly meet, knead bread and share it along with spontaneous contacts and friendships between very different people.
   Part of the social tourism concept as interpreted by the Bulgarian Bread Route is that if a group decides to go through all or some of the points/Bread Houses on it, they engage in a playful game element: the group takes one of the ingredients of bread from each subsequent Bread House (local flour, water, salt, honey, yeast, local spices) and in the last Bread House before departing, everyone kneads a collective bread incorporating the collected bread ingredients and experiences - a truly delicious and unforge!able memory.
   The foundational stone of the Bread Route in Bulgaria and internationally is the historic Bread House in the town of Gabrovo, which has evolved over time since 2009 as the first in Bulgaria, and possibly the world, Bread Museum dedicated to breadmaking as a tool for social transformation and powerful symbol of political and social struggle. The Bread for Social Change Museum was inaugurated in 2016 during a visit of the President of the global Agenda 21 for Culture, Catherine Cullen, in Gabrovo, which was selected as one of the Global Cities implementing the Agenda 21 for Culture in Development. Agenda 21 recognized the Bread House as one of the best practices in the field of synergies between the creative industry and tourism industry in the city of Gabrovo, which was also later awarded as a UNESCO Creative City, and the Bread Museum's model and recipe for traditional local sourdough-bread were included in a global publication linking the culinary (and particularly bread) heritage of Creative Cities around the globe(1).
   The Gabrovo house itself is the old family home of the great-grandmother of Nadezhda Savova-Grigorova, which she donated to be used as a community center and which slowly evolved as an alternative museum space run by the joint volunteer activism of enthusiasts. The process of creating the community center-museum by engaging local people with both their painful memories and passionate hopes for change, their complaints and dreams, has been a deeply charged dynamic of memory production, re-production, and representation. How can museums become ever more socially inclusive and interactive cultural institutions, hubs for community revival?
   Museum Mobilities: Cultural Democracy in the Transition from Object to Thing
   One evening during the first year of the creation of the Bread House, which subsequently evolved as the Bread (for Social Change) Museum, a middle-aged man with big black moustache and a large belly entered the house with a suspicious look on his face. At first, he was reluctant to join the community
   [GRAPHICS]
   Walking up the steep steps from the Tangier port and entering the narrow streets of the medina, I found the house quickly. It was indistinguishable from the others. It wasn't until I entered that I found the sign designating the location. 'Dar Gnawa,' it said, 'Commemorating the Memory of God's Mercy (dar gnawa tuhiyyu dhikra at-tarahhum). And indeed, both commemoration and memory were created and displayed here.
   Before putting this passage into context later in the paper, I raise the critical question of what it means for a house, or any place for that ma!er, to commemorate memory. How and why is a building enmeshed with sensations and practices? The figure of the museum is the epitome of these dilemmas and of a global change of principles of representation and civil society.
   For over a century, museums mainly exhibited "lifeless museum objects"(2). As Franz Boas laid the foundations of "salvage anthropology," the practice of collecting objects from indigenous societies confronted the challenge of contextualizing materiality in the absence of its ecosystem, which has raised questions on the museum's colonial exoticization of the "Other"?(3), their disciplining social projects(4), and their role in the repatriation of objects(5). Bourdieu's concept of "cultural capital"(6) is o#en evoked in works on museums as the elite's symbolic power in its embodied and objectified states. In addition to representation, "collective memory" is a key issue in the field of Museum Studies, ever since it became a focus of study with Maurice Halbwachs(7), and nowadays, most scholars would perhaps agree with John Urry that: "there is no past out there or back there [...] only the present, in the context of which the past is being continually re-created"(8).
   When the nineteenth-century semi-private museums became publicly funded centers for instruction of citizenship, the Western "exhibitionary complex" (Bennet 1995) was transformed in the Eastern European and Soviet reality, as Boris Groy argues in " The Display of Art in Totalitarian Space," from the vita contemplativa's aestheticism to the vita activa embodied in the new populist museum of the Proletariat9. But did museums take a middle path through the ruins of the Berlin Wall?
   Already in the 1960s, a "new museology"(10) with a "museum in transition"(11) emphasized "community bridge-building" for the democratic purposes of equality of access(12). As Edward Alexander argues in his Museums in Motion(13), museums are built but not static, since movement circulates among the variety of museums and within their new community outreach activities(14). The growing discourse on inclusive practices, however, needs to be more critical of what is assumed by "the general public," since quite often this "average" approximation incorporates preconceived notions that exclude, even inadvertently, people of lower socio-economic classes and literacy levels or physical impairment. When in the late 1980s and into the twenty-first century UNESCO pushed for heritage to be understood as much more than objects - see for instance intangible heritage - museums faced the even greater challenge of interacting with cultural practices and civic values, if they, together with, or being simultaneously cultural centers, aspire to be recognized by governments as primary agencies for the UNESCO's 2003 Intangible Heritage Convention 2003(15).
   The 1980s marked an internal movement towards change of the "museums in motion", which later evolved in the late 1990s into a phenomenon that anthropologist Ivan Karp called global "tactical museologies," where "the most fundamental global process that makes the concept of the museum available as a tactical resource is that the museums themselves travel"(16) as a concept adapted by sub-cultures, peripheral urban neighborhoods, and rural communities who a!empt to redefine the universalistic view in the "Declaration on the Importance and Value of Universal Museums" signed by eighteen of the world's most powerful museums. The symbolic travel of museums as physical constructs spread across diverse geographic and cultural areas turns them into "contact zones," in James Clifford's concept (1997), that link "routes" of older processes of globalization such as colonialism and imperialism, and conflict and creativity.
   Another aspect of the traveling idea of the museum is Karp's observation of a "non-nation-based world polity [funding organizations] that uses the categories of Western experience, such as the museum or development itself, to organize the distribution of resources both through and outside the state"(17). In Europe, neoliberal devolution dictated that cultural institutions be increasingly managed through the so-called "arms-length," independent bodies with non-for-profit character (trusts, foundations, NGOs, international organizations like UNESCO, and civic associations)(18). But is this the "right" or "left" arm, to adopt Bourdieu (1998)(19) on the policy hands of the State? Bourdieu's hand metaphor raises questions about the museum's new identity and outreach programs. How and towards whom is the museum hand "reaching out"? Is it simply giving something and waiting for nothing interactive in return but mute legitimation? Is the museum ready to shake hands, ready to work with the community and get its hands dirty, tired, calloused? Is it ready to cover them with paint and clay? In sum, has the museum's community outreach been able to escape the common development failure: the failure of reciprocation? " What is wrong with the so-called `free gift' is the donor's intention to be exempt from return gifts coming from the recipient," concludes Mary Douglas. "A gift that does nothing to enhance solidarity is a contradiction"(20).

   I was making watermelon juice with Jorge and Veronica in the kitchen of the Museu do Objeto Imaginario (Museum of the Imaginary Object), nestled in the bosom of the historic center of Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, on a late night in February 2008. Slow reggae tunes were seeping from the tiny bar below, where people rested cha!ing aFTer a night of dancing through the crossroads of Pelourinho in a caminhada, an ambulant musical manifestation, which the owner of the bar organizes in honor of the candomble god Exu every year on the last day of Carnival. Ten years ago, he found it important to emphasize that Exu should not be confused with the Christian Devil, but is a traditional Afro-Brazilian divine messenger who moves in-between the different worlds and energies with dance, music, and play.

AB  - This paper presents a recent rainfall-induced reactivated compound soil slide in Yanyuan County, China, on July 19, 2018. In this paper, according to the elaborate investigation of the soil slide area at field and prefailure slope stability analysis, the corresponding failure mechanisms are comprehensively studied. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on remote sensing, three-dimensional modelling, in situ and laboratory experimental testing, borehole exploration, and numerical simulation were carried out in this work. According to the results, two different sliding processes were identified involving the main sliding and lateral collapse. The main sliding occurred as multiple stages along with two different types of slip zones, which involve a preexisting basal zone of the ancient landslide and an interlaminar shear zone within the ancient landslide deposits. The predominance of reactivated surface geomorphology provides a clue to elucidate the dominant compound movement of the event. Unconsolidated sliding mass and the basal sliding surface are ideal for the development of the reactivation motion. Saltatory microrelief of the original slope determined the retrogressive failure type of the soil slide. The well-developed groundwater in the landslide area significantly increased the soil mass saturation, with an average saturation value of 98%, formed dominant seepage in the sliding mass, and promoted landslide reactivation. Furthermore, rainwater infiltration due to 14 days' antecedent cumulative rainfall of 350.6 mm directly contributed to the occurrence of the landslide by increasing the pore water pressure in the slope. The maximum shear plastic strain and displacement obtained by numerical simulation show that the lateral slope was unstable with the removal of the main sliding. Because the soil slide is located in the west area of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province (ELIP), it is a partial resurrection of the ancient basalt landslide. Therefore, this study has a certain significance for revealing the reactivated mechanism of basalt ancient landslide.

AB  - A mass die-off of Common Murres (Uria aalge) occurred from spring 2015 to spring 2016 in the northern Gulf of Alaska. Seabird die-offs have been recorded previously in the region, but this event was unique in its long duration and wide spatial extent. hi response to the die-off, Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) biologists conducted systematic beach surveys along the road system adjacent to the city of Kodiak and compiled reports from local citizens in remote locations throughout the Kodiak Archipelago to document the number of dead birds observed on beaches. Analysis of beached bird records indicated that at least 1,994 dead Common Murres were observed in the Kodiak Archipelago from 4 April 2015 to 26 April 2016. Extrapolating the density estimate, based on carcasses counted on systematic surveys on the Kodiak road system (55 murres/km, SE = 12), to all beaches in the Kodiak road system study region in the same biophysical habitat class based on Alaska ShoreZone coastal mapping, yielded an estimate of 6,305 dead Common Murres (95% CI = 3,522-9,088). in addition to Common Mures, carcasses of another 65 birds representing 15 species were found on beaches on the Kodiak road system during the die-off. The die-off event was preceded by a large-scale inshore movement by marine bird species typically seen offshore (Common Murres and shearwater species), as documented by Kodiak NWR survey data and by local observers throughout the archipelago. Survey data indicate the population estimate for Common Murres in the northeastern region of the archipelago increased from 711 in June 2012 to 31,543 in June 2015 (4,335% increase), and from 5,063 in August 2012 to 64,039 in August 2015 (1,165% increase).

AB  - Microseismic vibrations of the upper part of the soil strata occur continuously under the influence of endogenous and exogenous processes of both natural and artificial origin. Micro-oscillations of technogenic nature are especially characteristic of densely built-up urban areas. The practice of monitoring seismological monitoring observations shows that under such conditions it is possible to observe various types of microseismic vibrations, including elastic vibration signals in the frequency range of 1-100 Hz, generated by passing subway trains. In the calculations of the seismic stability of the designed structures, special attention is paid to the resonance characteristics of the upper part of the soil strata, which at certain frequencies can significantly enhance seismic vibrations, for example, from external vibrations sources. By traditional methods, the characteristics of resonant oscillations and their accounting are carried out, as a rule, with an insufficient degree of reliability and completeness, as a result of which and so they are usually used as auxiliary ones. In this paper, a methodological complex is considered using modern methods for measuring and processing microseismic signals in order to identify areas with maximum amplitudes of response to external elastic influences in the study area for construction and take them into account in the future in design and construction. The study of vibroseismic noises formed on the surface of the soil layer, for example, by passing subway trains, allows one to estimate the amplitude-frequency properties of these soils, and the spectral ratio of horizontal displacements of soils to vertical H/V and the derivative of these ratios - the coefficient of vulnerability of the K-y - provide a confident selection of weakened zones that are subject to the greatest impact of external elastic vibrations.

AB  - According to China's second national survey of pollution sources, the contribution of agricultural non-point sources (ANS) to water pollution is still high. Risk prevention and control are the main means to control costs and improve the efficiency of ANS, but most studies directly take pollution load as the risk standard, leading to a considerable misjudgment of the actual pollution risk. To objectively reflect the risk of agricultural non-point source pollution (ANSP) in Chongqing, China, we investigated the influences of initial source input, intermediate transformation, and terminal absorption of pollutants via literature research and the Delphi method and built a PTA (pressure kinetic energy, transformation kinetic energy, and absorption kinetic energy) model that covers 12 factors, with the support of geographical information system (GIS) technology. The terrain factor calculation results and the calculation results of other factors were optimized by Python tools to reduce human error and workload. Via centroid migration analysis and Kernel density analysis, the risk level, spatial aggregation degree, and key prevention and control regions could be accurately determined. There was a positive correlation between the water quality of the rivers in Chongqing and the risk assessment results of different periods, indirectly reflecting the reliability of the assessment results by the proposed model. There was an obvious tendency for the low-risk regions transforming into high-risk regions. The proportion of high-risk regions and extremely high-risk regions increased from 17.82% and 16.63% in 2000 to 18.10% and 16.76% in 2015, respectively. And the risk level in the main urban areas was significantly higher than that in the southeastern and northeastern areas of Chongqing. The centroids of all grades of risky areas presented a successive distribution from west to east, and the centroids of high-risk and extremely high-risk regions shifted eastward. From 2000 to 2015, the centroids of high-risk and extremely high-risk regions moved 4.63 km (1.68 degrees) and 4.48 km (12.08 degrees) east by north, respectively. The kernel density analysis results showed that the high-risk regions were mainly concentrated in the main urban areas and that the distribution of agglomeration areas overall displayed a transition trend from contiguous distribution to decentralized concentration. The risk levels of the regions with a high proportion of cultivated land and artificial surface were significantly increased, and the occupation of cultivated land in the process of urbanization promoted the movement of the centroids of high-risk and extremely high-risk regions. The identification of key areas for risk prevention and control provides data scientific basis for the development of prevention and control strategies.

AB  - The site of Venta Micena (Orce, Spain), c. 1.6 Ma, preserves one the best paleontological records of the early Pleistocene large mammals fauna in Europe. Here we describe the specimens of the genus Canis Linnaeus, 1758 in the context of the late Villafranchian and Epivillafranchian fossil dogs from Eurasia. Anatomical and metric data suggest that the Venta Micena Canis form differs from the classical records of Canis etruscus Forsyth Major, 1877 and Canis arnensis Del Campana, 1913, and that it forms part of the younger Canis mosbachensis Soergel (1925) lineage, also recorded in two slightly younger sites of the Orce site complex, Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva-3, dated to c. 1.4 Ma. The anatomy of the Venta Micena fossil material shows features that resemble the Canis forms from the Caucasian site of Dmanisi, dated to 1.8 Ma, and Canis ex gr. C. mosbachensis. Nevertheless, dental peculiarities support the creation of a new chrono-species, Canis orcensis n. sp., from the town of Orce. Morphological and paleoecological data suggest that this species probably consumed more vertebrate flesh than other similar sized early Pleistocene canids (i.e., a trend to hypercarnivory), which had more omnivorous dietary habits.

AB  - Background Toxic metabolic encephalopathy (TME) has been reported in 7-31% of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, some reports include sedation-related delirium and few data exist on the etiology of TME. We aimed to identify the prevalence, etiologies, and mortality rates associated with TME in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study among patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at four New York City hospitals in the same health network between March 1, 2020, and May 20, 2020. TME was diagnosed in patients with altered mental status off sedation or after an adequate sedation washout. Patients with structural brain disease, seizures, or primary neurological diagnoses were excluded. The coprimary outcomes were the prevalence of TME stratified by etiology and in-hospital mortality (excluding comfort care only patients) assessed by using a multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age, race, sex, intubation, intensive care unit requirement, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, hospital location, and date of admission. Results Among 4491 patients with COVID-19, 559 (12%) were diagnosed with TME, of whom 435 of 559 (78%) developed encephalopathy immediately prior to hospital admission. The most common etiologies were septic encephalopathy (n = 247 of 559 [62%]), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (n = 331 of 559 [59%]), and uremia (n = 156 of 559 [28%]). Multiple etiologies were present in 435 (78%) patients. Compared with those without TME (n = 3932), patients with TME were older (76 vs. 62 years), had dementia (27% vs. 3%) or psychiatric history (20% vs. 10%), were more often intubated (37% vs. 20%), had a longer hospital length of stay (7.9 vs. 6.0 days), and were less often discharged home (25% vs. 66% [all P < 0.001]). Excluding comfort care patients (n = 267 of 4491 [6%]) and after adjustment for confounders, TME remained associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (n = 128 of 425 [30%] patients with TME died, compared with n = 600 of 3799 [16%] patients without TME; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.52, P = 0.031), and TME due to hypoxemia conferred the highest risk (n = 97 of 233 [42%] patients with HIE died, compared with n = 631 of 3991 [16%] patients without HIE; aHR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.00, P = 0.001). Conclusions TME occurred in one in eight hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was typically multifactorial, and was most often due to hypoxemia, sepsis, and uremia. After we adjustment for confounding factors, TME was associated with a 24% increased risk of in-hospital mortality.

AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to share responses from current literature, a small case study about perceptions and practices of the school of education faculty toward multicultural and educational issues concerning the rapid rise in online environments during coronavirus (COVID-19) experiences and just-in-time strategies for addressing digital equity and educational inclusion in K-16 online educational settings.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This is a conceptual paper that emerged from an action research case study. The study included four faculty in an urban school of education. The faculty participants were asked to provide examples of educational inclusion strategies used during transitioning their courses and advising to online environments in a Research I university. Faculty included one educational leadership, one sports management, one special education and one teacher education professor. Central issues explored practices related to language, technology access, curriculum design and technological competencies and assessment. A driving question was: How do institutions, schools or educators provide learning opportunities to support digital equity and inclusive education practice to maintain and strengthen relationships and core practices of multicultural education during a time of physical distancing during COVID-19? And what are the experiences, barriers, successes?
   Findings
   Research-based transformative knowledge, real situations and practical resources for considering inclusive education curriculum concepts were found that are connecting educators, teachers, learners and communities during this time of crisis.
   Research limitations/implications
   Methodological limitations that influenced the research design include conducting research in a totally virtual environment, small sample size, lack of diversity in curriculum content and one research site. The data collection was limited to written responses from the faculty participants. This action research study took place in a time frame limited by COVID-19 conditions during a four-month period.
   Practical implications
   In theory and practice, this new online movement suggests learners, teachers, educators and leaders are gaining experience and knowledge about resources and strategies for using new technologies, assessments and flexible curriculum as powerful tools for building language, curriculum and social-cultural communication bonds across generations and including special needs populations. Such new and emerging strategies could be used to bridge gaps in a time of distancing to support inclusive and equitable learning environments in education to minimize the effects of an emergent COVID-19 digital divide. Social learning culture as constructed, performed and captured in patterns of cooperation among faculties shows the world becoming more open and less restricted by borders. In conclusion, an emerging new conceptual framework is presented in Figure 2 to support action planning to bridge the digital equity access and learning gaps created by COVID-19.
   Social implications
   It is in times of strife and difficulty that problems and issues become exacerbated. While some educators easily adapted and took on the challenges of online learning, others needed time for learning and mourning (literally and figuratively). The issues of equity and access have become even more apparent as this paper takes inventory of intersections between multicultural education, special education, sports education and K-16 education overall.
   This is an excellent time to reflect on how education can address the cultural, economic and social barriers that impact student learning globally for all learners.
   Originality/value
   The brief collective case study reports educational experiences during a time of crisis that stimulates creative and innovative approaches to creating inclusive and equitable online learning environments to address diverse learning needs. The various and often contrasting educator responses from faculty facing digital and educational challenges present ideas that might be applicable in the global learning environment beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - National Highway (NH) 29 is a strategic highway of India that runs from Assam to Manipur, through Nagaland. This highway, also known as the Asian Highway 1 (AH 1), connects India to the Southeast Asian countries via Myanmar. A section of the highway, located near the capital city of Kohima, was damaged by major landslides on 1st August 2018. Another landslide occurred in the same area on 4th August 2019, which totally blocked vehicular movement for nearly a month. In both instances, the area received heavy rainfall intermittently for some days preceding slope failure. Geologically, the area is made up of highly jointed and fractured Disang rocks that are composed predominantly of shales intercalated with minor beds of siltstone, and some clay pockets indicating weathering of these rocks. The slide material comprises a mixture of loose debris of shales and saturated clays. A multi-parameter study involving geotechnical, kinematic and joint analyses, slope mass rating, resistivity surveys, and remote sensing using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was carried out to determine the factors responsible for the two landslide events in this area. The study finds that the soils, with low values of unconfined compressive strength, are one of the major contributors to slope failure in the area. Slope stability analyses demarcate the slopes of the study area as partially stable to highly unstable. Kinematic and joint analyses indicate that the rocks are structurally weak due to the presence of joints, which make them susceptible to wedge failure. Analyses of joints and slickensides confirm complex deformation taking place in the area. The study of satellite imagery of the study area, coupled with field evidences, indicate that the area is crossed with faults. The presence of one such fault and two confined aquifers was validated by resistivity surveys, which explains the shearing of the rocks and high degree of weathering of the country rocks. The low shear strength of the soils and saturation of other slope materials due to heavy rainfall led to the two landslides events.

AB  - In Europe, emerging organic compounds (EOCs) in groundwater is a growing research area. Prioritisation for monitoring EOCs in Europe was formalised in 2019 through the development of the first voluntary groundwater watch list (GWWL). Despite this, groundwater occurrence data in the peer reviewed literature for Europe has not been reviewed to date. Questions surrounding the effect, toxicity, movement in the subsurface and unsaturated zone make the process of regulating EOC use difficult. The aim in Europe is to develop a unified strategy for the classification, and prioritisation of EOCs to be monitored in groundwater. This paper compiles evidence from the recent published studies from across Europe, since 2012, when the last major literature global review of EOCs in groundwater took place. A total of 39 studies were identified for review based on specific selection criteria (geography, publication date, sample size>10, inclusion of EOCs data). Data on specific compounds, and associated meta-data, are compiled and reviewed. The two most frequently detected EOCs, carbamazepine and caffeine, occurred in groundwater at concentrations of up to 2.3 and 14.8 mu g/L, respectively.
   The most frequently reported category of compounds were 'Pharmaceuticals'; a highly studied group with 135 compounds identified within 31 of the 39 studies. In Europe, the majority of reviewed studies (23) were at a regional scale, looking specifically at EOCs in a specific city or aquifer. The use of analytical methods is not uniform across Europe, and this inevitably influences the current assessment of EOCs in groundwater. A correlation between the number of compounds analysed for, and the number detected in groundwater highlights the need for further studies, especially larger-scale studies throughout Europe. For the development of EU and national regulation, further work is required to understand the occurrence and impacts of EOCs in groundwater throughout Europe and elsewhere. 2020 Copyright British Geological Survey (C) UKRI 2020.

AB  - When an invasive wetland grass degrades a Ramsar wetland and Important Bird Area, decisive management action is called for. To limit the extent and spread of European Phragmites australis, the Ontario government began the first, large-scale application of glyphosate (Roundup Custom (R)) over standing water to control an invasive species in Canadian history. Between 2016 and 2018, over 1000 ha of marsh were treated. To assess the concentration, movement and longevity of this herbicide in treated marshes, we measured the concentration of glyphosate, its primary breakdown product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and the alcohol ethoxylate-based adjuvant Aquasurf (R) in water and sediments in areas of the highest exposure and up to 150 m into adjacent bays. The maximum observed concentration of glyphosate in water was 0.320 mg/L, occurring within 24 hr of application. The maximum glyphosate concentration in sediment was 0.250 mg/kg, occurring within about 30 days of application. AMPA was detectable in water and sediment, indicating microbial breakdown of glyphosate in the marsh, but at low concentrations (max(water) = 0.025 mg/L, max(sed) = 0.012 mg/kg). The maximum distance from the point of application that glyphosate was detected in the water was 100 m, while AMPA was detectable only at the edge of where glyphosate was applied (0 m). Concentrations in water returned to pre-treatment levels (<DL) within 20-30 days of application. In sediment, glyphosate residue persisted above detection limits (>0.005 mg/kg) for over one year but less than two years. Concentrations of alcohol ethoxylates were variable in space and time, following a pattern that could not be attributed to Aquasurf (R) use. The direct, over-water application of Roundup Custom (R) with Aquasurf (R) to control invasive P. australis did not reach concentrations deemed to pose toxicological concern to aquatic biota by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment.

AB  - Partial shade occurrences still prevail as a major obstacle for maximum power generation from photovoltaic (PV) power plants, particularly in urban areas. Therefore, augmenting the power output during such conditions has become a prerequisite in PV installations to guarantee reliable power conversion efficiency. In this context, PV array reconfiguration utilizing physical relocation techniques is a cost effective as well as promising solution. Though many such techniques have been developed in recent times, the applicability of those solutions to real-time power plants is questionable, predominantly due to: 1) incompatibility to unsymmetrical PV arrays, 2) impractical displacement of PV modules to distant columns, 3) necessity of large number of physical relocations, 4) need for lengthy interconnection ties and 5) non-availability of universal relocation rules. In this context, this paper proposes a new reconfiguration technique that can be applied globally irrespective of the size, type, and rating of PV arrays. In principle, the technique evolves from a mathematical concept to arrange PV modules diagonally along the opposite corners of the smallest rectangle that can be developed using squares. Graphically, the proposed technique emulates the vertical downward movement of knights in a chess board. More importantly, the relocation procedure is carefully designed such that each PV module in the array is relocated with in its respective column itself, thereby reducing the overall number of relocations required significantly. Distinctive from existing strategies, the proposed method can be applied to both unsymmetrical and symmetrical PV arrays without any arbitrary assumptions. For validation, extensive simulations considering numerous shade patterns as well as hardware experimentations have been carried out, and the results are compared with prominent techniques available in literature. The results attained show an average instantaneous power difference of 0.3 kW and 0.8 kW respectively for an 8.1 kW system, compared with its counterparts and conventional interconnection schemes. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to determine whether gentrification predicts the movement of shooting victims over time and if this process has decreased access to care. Background: Trauma centers remain fixed in space, but the populations they serve do not. Nationally, gentrification has displaced disadvantaged communities most at risk for violent injury, potentially decreasing access to care. This process has not been studied, but an increase of only 1 mile from a trauma center increases shooting mortality up to 22%. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study utilizing Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) and Pennsylvania trauma systems outcome (PTOS) data 2006-2018. Shootings were mapped and grouped into census tracts. They were then cross-mapped with gentrification data and hospital location. PPD and PTOS shooting data were compared to ensure patients requiring trauma care were captured. Census tracts with >= 500 residents with income and median home values in the bottom 40th percentile of the metropolitan area were eligible to gentrify. Tracts were gentrified if residents >= 25 with a bachelor's degree increased and home price increased to the top third in the metropolitan area. Change in distribution of shootings and its relation to gentrification was our primary outcome while proximity of shootings to a trauma center was our secondary outcome. Results: Thirty-two percent (123/379) of eligible tracts gentrified and 31,165 shootings were captured in the PPD database. 9090 (29.2%) patients meeting trauma criteria were captured in PTOS with an increasing proportion over time. The proportion of shootings within gentrifying tracts significantly dropped 2006-2018 (40%-35%, P < 0.001) and increased in non-gentrifying tracts (52%-57%, P < 0.001). In evaluation of shooting densities, a predictable redistribution occurred 2006-2018 with incident density decreasing in gentrified areas and increasing in non-gentrified areas. Shootings within 1 mile of a trauma center increased overall, but proportional access decreased in gentrified areas. Conclusions: Shootings in Philadelphia predictably moved out of gentrified areas and concentrated in non-gentrified ones. In this case study of a national crisis, the pattern of change paradoxically resulted in an increased clustering of shootings around trauma centers in non-gentrified areas. Repetition of this work in other cities can guide future resource allocation and be used to improve access to trauma care.

AB  - During recent years, a series of civil construction works have been started on all slopes from Iasi Municipality. This study aims to analyse the stability of a perimeter from a southern slope of the city, in the area of Mihai Ciuca Street, Iasi. For the development of a GF + 1 construction (ground floor and first floor) in this area geotechnical surveys were performed and soil samples were taken, which have been analysed by specific geotechnical methods. Starting from the values of the physical-mechanical parameters of the rocks, respectively from the aspects regarding the terrain geometry, different simulations were performed in order to identify its stability factor. These simulations took into account the presence or absence of construction, the existence of the current groundwater level or of a level close to the surface, as well as of the possibility of the occurrence of an earthquake. When we start from the hypothesis according to which all three factors act simultaneously on the researched land (the given construction load, the high groundwater level / current groundwater level and the earthquake), the values obtained are unfavourable. The results obtained for these situations indicate the following stability factors: 0.93 (when the groundwater is considered at the level of 3 m, with the loading of the construction and earthquake), respectively 1.2 (when the current groundwater level, load and earthquake are considered). These values are below the limit of the allowed stability coefficient of 1.25 (the value indicated by standards for the admissible safety factor, Fsadm). Also, the observations made on the field before, but also during the operation of the edifice exploitation, highlighted the punctual appearance of some geotechnical problems, which required the additional realization of some construction works (drains, retaining walls, gutters, etc.), imposing very high costs. The terrain continues to be modified by pushing phenomena on certain parts of the already existing construction, leading to the occurrence of cracks and infiltrations in the basement, to the deformation of a water tank or to the vaulting of the fence foundation. Without the adoption of specific measures to prevent the movement of land, there is the possibility of dynamization of the slope on certain parts and, consequently, this would lead to partial or total endangerment of the safety of the construction.

AB  - Here, we consider the last decades of ceramic manufacture among the Pawnee in the Central Great Plains, using petrographic analysis to explore raw material availability and use at the Kitkahahki Town site (14RP1). Historical documents reveal tremendous regional pressures and conflicts in the Kitkahahki Town area during its occupation in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries-processes that could have altered or restricted the movement of women outside village boundaries. Contact-era Pawnee pottery from Kitkahahki Town exhibits atypical paste textures, atypical inclusions, or both. At least one potter used atypical materials available immediately adjacent to the village, which suggests that ceramic raw material collection was at least occasionally adjusted to reduce risk. Petrographic analysis contributes to our understanding of Indigenous communities in colonial settings, particularly to questions of technological change and landscape use when both were intensely negotiated and rapidly changing.

AB  - Evaluation of the impact of transport on the surrounding environment requires an ecosystem approach: to analyze components that provide information about the distribution of concentrations of the monitored contaminants and to allow an estimate of the dynamics of movement of these substances in the environment. Trees are used for biomonitoring for wide range of contaminants, coming not only from air pollution from industry or transport but also from winter chemical road maintenance. The research paper presents the determination of sodium and chloride ions content in assimilative organs of conifers and evaluates the influence of the contamination potential on these ions contents in needles of the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Scots pine is studied a useful bioindicator for different tip of trace elements, but in the case of influence of winter maintenance, there is not so deep focusing as in the case of spruce. We have used this species of conifers for their usual occurrence. To assess the differences between sensitivity of salinity of different type of needles, the results of analysis of first- and second-year needles of Scots pine needles and samples of the Norway spruce were compared. The study was conducted in two different areas (for Scots pine and Norway spruce) in the Czech Republic. Samples of soils were collected near each tree of interest. The results of ions concentrations (Na, Cl) were evaluated depending on two factors: the distance from the road and the age of the needles. For evaluation of the impact of transport on the surrounding environment also the concentrations of wide range of elements were measured. The study confirmed a higher sensitivity of Norway spruce to salinity than in Scots pine. Given the confirmed increased sensitivity of spruce stands to the effects of winter road maintenance, spruce is not an appropriate tree species for the immediate vicinity of road infrastructure. Increased NaCl accumulation in the assimilation organs of the conifer trees near the road was confirmed and scales with concentrations were established to assess the degree of contamination.

AB  - We use combined teleseismic and strong motion data sets to investigate finite-fault slip models for a double of earthquakes that occurred on August 11, 2012, in northwestern Iran near the cities of Ahar and Varzaghan. The data include teleseismic P-waveforms retrieved from broadband seismic stations located between 30 degrees 94 degrees from the earthquakes and local strong motion data recorded by the Iran Strong Motion Network, installed and operated by the Building and Housing Research Centre. We first invert teleseismic P-waveforms and local strong motion data separately. For the first event (12:23 UTC), the teleseismic broadband inversion yields a somewhat deeper and simpler distribution of slip than the local strong motion inversion. The strong motion inversion results in a more complex distribution because of higher frequency content but can also be influenced by complexities in the propagation path. For the second event (12:34 UTC), the slip distribution from strong motion data is more similar to the teleseismic result and shows a simple slip area with a small relative movement to the west. To resolve the differences between the results of these two data sets and obtain a better constrained slip model, we perform a joint inversion of teleseismic broadband and local strong motion data.
   The joint inversion for the first event shows two asperities with a maximum slip of 3.9 m up-dip from the hypocenter and extending to the west between depths of 1 and 5 km. A second narrower high-slip area is seen just above the hypocenter from 6 to 10 km depth. The total moment for this earthquake is calculated to be M-o = 3.8 x 10(25) dyn-cm (3.8 x 10(18) N.m) (M-w 6.4). For the second event, the results of the joint inversion show a simple slip distribution that is mainly confined in a single patch around the hypocenter with a depth range from about 10 to 13 km and maximum slip of 1.9 m. We compute a total seismic moment of M-o = 1.6 x 10(25) dyn-cm (1.6 x 10(18) N.m) (M-w 6.1) for the second event. The largest stress drops for the first event occur above the hypocenter with an average stress drop over the rupture area of 120 bar (12 Mpa). For the second event, the maximum stress drop occurs at the reported focal depth with an average stress drop over the rupture area of 80 bar (8 Mpa).

AB  - Aim Understanding the patterns and correlates of the range expansion of established alien species is crucial for predicting invasion impacts and developing effective control strategies. With accelerating globalization, it is key to identify the interactions of different global change processes, such as how land-use change may influence range expansion, yet empirical studies remain limited.
   Location Liuji Town, Jiangsu Province, China.
   Methods We first divided the study area into 128 grids with a resolution of 1 x 1 km and conducted visual encounter surveys over two years for a total of 492 water bodies to explore the establishment and range expansions of a global notorious invader, the American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus (Shaw, 1802) (= Rana catesbeiana (Shaw, 1802)) using generalized linear mixed models. Then, we investigated the residence time of the established bullfrogs in each water body based on a questionnaire survey. We quantified the habitat loss and range expansion of the past 30 years via GIS-based spatial analysis and explored their temporal dynamics using the breakpoint regression technique.
   Results We found that the area of suitable habitats was the most important variable positively related to the bullfrog establishment. There was a similar temporal trend of the range expansion and habitat loss, although the optimal time of habitat loss was slightly earlier than that of the great increase in bullfrog range expansion. Overall, the bullfrogs tended to expand faster with greater habitat loss after controlling for temporal non-independence.
   Main conclusions Our results demonstrated that loss of suitable habitats may facilitate invaders with faster range expansion to occupy the remaining limited resources. Alien species might thus accelerate invasions under human-induced land-use modifications in the era of global change. The time lag between range expansion and habitat loss is the golden window for preventing the spread of established alien species in disturbed habitats.

AB  - Featured Application Verification of DInSAR analysis results, Ascending or Descending solution for better aspect, GNSS verification method, underground to ground surface measurement, and landslide mapping based on deformation map. The area of Taiwan is 70% hillsides. In addition, the topography fluctuates wildly, and it is active in earthquakes and young orogenic movements. Landslides are a widespread disaster in Taiwan. However, landslides are not a disaster until someone enters the mountain area for development. Therefore, landslide displacement monitoring is the primary task of this study. Potential landslide areas with mostly slate geological conditions were selected as candidate sites in this study. The slate bedding in this area is approximately 30 to 75 degrees toward the southeast, which means that creep may occur due to gravity deformation caused by high-angle rock formation strikes. In addition, because the research site is located in a densely vegetated area, the data noise is very high, and it is not easy to obtain good results. This study chose ESA Sentinel-1 data for analysis and 1-m LiDAR DEM as reference elevation. The 1-m LiDAR DEM with high accuracy can help to detect more complex deformation from DInSAR. The Sentinel-1 series of satellites have a regular revisit period. In addition, the farm areas of roads, bridges, and buildings in the study area provided enough reflections to produce good coherence. Sentinel-1 images from March 2017 to June 2021 were analyzed, obtaining slope deformation and converting it to the vertical direction. Deformation derived from SAR is compared with other measurements, including GNSS and underground slope inclinometer. The SBAS solution process provides more DInSAR pairs to overcome the problem of tremendous noise and has increased accuracy. Moreover, the SBAS method's parameter modification derives more candidate points in the vegetated area. The vertical deformation comparison between the GNSS installation location and the ascending SBAS solution's vertical deformation is consistent. Moreover, the reliable facing of the slope toward the SAR satellite is discussed. Due to the limitations of the GNSS stations, this study proposes a method to convert the observed deformation from the slope inclinometer and convert it to vertical deformation. The displacement of the slope indicator is originally a horizontal displacement. It is assumed that it is fixed at the farthest underground, and the bottom-to-top movement is integrated with depth. The results show that the proposed equation to convert horizontal to vertical displacement fits well in this condition. The activity of landslides within the LiDAR digital elevation model identified as scars is also mapped.

AB  - Fire is one of the most common disasters that threaten the safety of the crowd in metro stations. Due to the variations in the design of metro stations, the hazard posed by the spreading products of the fire can pose different risks. The typical structures of metro stations in Guangzhou and Washington, D.C., are very different from each other. In Washington, D.C., the "high-dome" structure is predominant in the construction of metro stations, while in Guangzhou, most metro stations have the "flat ceiling" structure. In this article, a numerical modeling for fire dynamic simulation is used to predict and compare the spreading characters of fire products (the smoke height change, the temperature distribution and the visibility change) when fires with 2.5 MW heat release rate occur in the platform center and at the platform end in the two kinds of metro stations. The results show that, in the same fire scenario, the lowest smoke heights monitored in the Guangzhou model is 0.6 m (fire at the platform end) and 0.8 m (fire in the platform center) above the safe smoke height in 360 s after a fire breaks out, while it is 6.15 m (fire in the platform center) and 6.2 m (fire at the platform end) above the smoke height in the Washington model. The temperature increment in the Guangzhou model is 23 degrees C (fire in the platform center) to 29 degrees C (fire at the platform end) in 360 s after the fire breaks out, while the temperature increment in the same period in the Washington model is 8.5 degrees C (fire at the platform end) to 9 degrees C (fire in the platform center). The visibility of most areas on the platform of the Guangzhou model is about 1 m no matter the fire is in the platform center or at the platform end at 360 s after the fire begins, while in the Washington model, the visibility of most areas is 1.5-13.5 mm (fire at the platform end) to 4-14 m (fire in the platform center) at the same moment. Based on the results, the environment is worse when the fire happens at the end of the platform than that when the fire happens in the platform center of the Guangzhou model. While the fire location has fewer impacts on the smoke height, temperature, and visibility in the Washington model, metro stations with a high-dome structure can be beneficial to fire evacuation safety; however, the construction cost can be high. Metro stations with flat ceiling are widely used in more cities for it has lower construction cost; to compensate for its weaker abilities under fire conditions, it is suggested that smoke exhaust systems should be carefully and fully considered.

AB  - At approximately 3:50 a.m. (UTC + 8) on August 21, 2020, a massive rainfall-induced landslide occurred in Zhonghaicun, Fuquan town, Hanyuan County, Sichuan Province, China, forming an approximately 40.85 x 10(4) m(3) landslide accumulation, burying eight houses and approximately 100 m of roads, and causing long-term traffic interruptions. The landslide was comprehensively evaluated through field investigation, UAV photography, borehole drilling, and laboratory tests. According to movement and accumulation characteristics, the landslide is divided into the main sliding zones (the source area, impact sliding area, shoveling-accumulation area, and accumulation area) and landslide-affected zones. The deformation and failure of the Zhonghaicun landslide are related to the lithology (existence of a weak interlayer), geomorphology (microrelief changes), and antecedent rainfall. However, the main trigger of the landslide is continuous rainfall, which increases the landslide saturation and pore water pressure and reduces the mechanical strength of the weak layer. The landslide failure mode is complex. The upper slope is affected by rainfall and loses stability first. Under the impact of the sliding mass, sliding of the lower slope is triggered. This study of the Zhonghaicun landslide characterizes the evolution process of a complex rainfall-induced landslide and provides ways to mitigate landslide disasters.

AB  - Research on the actions of anti-extraction movements has primarily comprised single-case studies in developing countries. Despite increasing mobilization and policy objectives to increase mineral extraction in the EU, we have little systematic knowledge of forms of resistance in a European setting. This paper exhaustively and comparatively maps anti-extraction movements in Sweden and investigates how movements' actions relate to their socio-political contexts. Sixteen place-specific movements are identified and studied using frame analysis and political process theory. The results suggest that anti-extraction movements occur across Sweden and that their socio-political contexts differ in access to indigenous rights institutions, project owner engagement, and support/opposition from host municipalities and national interest groups. The frame analysis indicates that movements share several goals, sometimes interpret similar contexts differently, and that differences in actions reflect differences in interpretations of contextual opportunities. Our results show that anti-extraction movements in Sweden involve diverse actors, including environmental interest groups, new networks mobilizing against extraction projects, indigenous Sami organizations, farmers' organizations, and landowners. Broad repertoires of actions, including civil disobedience, are used to influence the public, permitting processes, political actors at various scales, and project owners. Differences in socio-political contexts often align with movements' interpretations of opportunities and relate with differences in action choices.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to determine the number of Jews in the number of political exiles, as well as to identify their role in the radical political participation of the Irkutsk province in the 1880s - 1900s.
   The source base consists of documents from the State Archives of the Irkutsk Region, the State Archives of Modern and Contemporary History of the Irkutsk Region, most of which were not introduced into scientific circulation, as well as sources of personal origin.
   It will be recalled that in the first half of the XIX century. Jews, due to their social isolation, were still far from participating in the country's radical social and political organizations. Jews did not take a noticeable part in the student movement of the late 1830s and 1840s. They also were not represented among the Petrashevites. The criminal and political exile of Jews became most active in the second half of the 19th century. By the 1880s, they are in the second place after the Russians in the radical anti-government parties. And then their number continues to increase; by the end of the 19th century, their number in the left-wing radical parties grew rapidly.
   During the study, the authors came to the following conclusions:
   Jews in the composition of political exiles of the Irkutsk province in the late 19th - early 20th centuries occupied a significant, and sometimes leading position, behind only of the Russian workers;
   Having education and work experience, Jews, who were political exiles, got a job in numerous trade and purchasing establishments of Irkutsk, expeditions to supply the northern territories, banks, wholesale shops, and warehouses without much difficulty. They successfully served in printing houses, transport shops, tanneries and even on the railroad, thereby developing the Siberian region, which needed professionals in new industries;
   Urban communities of Jews, not accepting revolutionary propaganda, provided sympathy and support to exiled Jews, being interested in them as teachers for their children;
   It was the political exiles who made the newspaper Vostochnoye Obozreniye agenuine center of opposition life, due to the notable levels of education and outstanding thoughts;
   Before the first Russian revolution, a large number of political exiled Jews were concentrated in Irkutsk. They exerted an active influence on the work of the opposition, which incurred the displeasure of local authorities, who were trying to limit the exile of Jews to the Siberian region.
   In general, the history of the Irkutsk province of the post-reform period is inextricably linked to the exile of the Jews. Although the Jews had been removed from the normal social environment and experienced significant material deprivation in Siberia, they influenced the social life of local people, had a noticeable positive impact on the local society, contributed to the growth of its self-awareness, civic consciousness and political culture.

AB  - Simple Summary The presence of flavivirus-specific antibodies in neotropical non-human primates (NPs) (i.e., dengue virus) is well known. However, it is unclear if dengue virus or other flaviviruses could be maintained in sylvatic cycles. We detected the presence of antibodies against dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2), Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and several undetermined flaviviruses in NPs in Costa Rica. Our work suggests continuous exposure of NPs to several flaviviruses in Costa Rica. These findings open the question of whether bidirectional transmission between humans and non-human primates can occur due to human encroachment into NP habitats, the movement of NP into urban settings, or bridging vectors. Arthropod-borne viruses belonging to the flavivirus genus possess an enormous relevance in public health. Neotropical non-human primates (NPs) have been proposed to be susceptible to flavivirus infections due to their arboreal and diurnal habits, their genetic similarity to humans, and their relative closeness to humans. However, the only known flavivirus in the American continent maintained by sylvatic cycles involving NPs is yellow fever virus (YFV), and NPs' role as potential hosts of other flaviviruses is still unknown. Here, we examined flavivirus exposure in 86 serum samples including 83.7% samples from free-range and 16.3% from captive NPs living in flavivirus-endemic regions of Costa Rica. Serum samples were opportunistically collected throughout Costa Rica in 2000-2015. We used a highly specific micro-plaque reduction neutralization test (micro-PRNT) to determine the presence of antibodies against YFV, dengue virus 1-4 (DENV), Zika virus, West Nile virus (WNV), and Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). We found evidence of seropositive NPs with homotypic reactivity to SLEV 11.6% (10/86), DENV 10.5% (9/86), and WNV 2.3% (2/86). Heterotypic reactivity was determined in 3.5% (3/86) of individuals against DENV, 1.2% (1/86) against SLEV, and 1.2% (1/86) against WNV. We found that 13.9% (12/86) of NPs were positive for an undetermined flavivirus species. No antibodies against DENV-3, DENV-4, YFV, or ZIKV were found. This work provides compelling serological evidence of flavivirus exposure in Costa Rican NPs, in particular to DENV, SLEV, and WNV. The range of years of sampling and the region from where positives were detected coincide with those in which peaks of DENV in human populations were registered, suggesting bidirectional exposure due to human-wildlife contact or bridging vectors. Our work suggests the continuous exposure of wildlife populations to various flaviviruses of public health importance and underscores the necessity of further surveillance of flaviviruses at the human-wildlife interface in Central America.

AB  - The London Marylebone Road monitoring site is a roadside supersite adjacent to a highway carrying 80-90,000 vehicles per day on six lanes in a street canyon. Data from the Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN), Black Carbon Network, Automatic Hydrocarbon Network, Heavy Metal Network, Particle Size and Number and Particle Composition Network covering the period from 2009 to 2018 were analysed to determine short-term (diurnal, weekly and seasonal) and long-term variations and geographic source attribution. The contribution of roadside emissions relative to background sites (roadside increment) to the pollution climate was also investigated. The long-term trend analysis shows significant decline in regulated pollutants such as the particulate matter fractions (4.0%; 3.93%/yr for PM2.5 and PM10 respectively) and gas phase pollutants associated with vehicular emissions (5.5%; 1.22% and 2.1%/yr for CO, NOx and NO2 respectively), although concentrations of SO2 and O-3 have remained relatively constant over the years. Equivalent Black carbon (eBC) and total particle number count have also declined over the years whereas the heavy metals show mixed results (only Cu, Ni and V shows significant downward trends). The inorganic ionic components of the PM10 fraction, elemental (EC) and organic carbon (OC) and the volatile organic compounds all generally show declining trends over the period. Assessment of the diurnal variations shows elevated concentrations of the particulate matter fractions, the nitrogen oxides, CO and SO2 at periods corresponding to the traffic rush hours, whereas O-3 peaked in the afternoon when there is less titration due to lower NO concentrations. The diurnal pattern of eBC and Total Particle Number Count are similar to NOx and show strong traffic influence. Cl, Mg, K and Na levels show no systematic pattern throughout, with their presence likely controlled by meteorological conditions, and Ca showing high concentrations in the afternoon because of resuspension of deposited dust resulting from turbulence created by vehicular movement, and eroded road-surface material. Ammonium and nitrate show their lowest concentrations during the day when the temperature is high, probably reflective of their semi-volatile nature, with sulphate producing a peak around mid-day. The VOCs, with the exception of ethane, give the bimodal peaks typical of traffic related emission in the diurnal plots and their pattern is more similar to CO than the other traffic emitted gaseous pollutants. Ethane is associated with leakages from gas supply pipes. The weekday plots show weekday (Monday - Friday) increases in traffic-related pollutants and a decline over the weekends due to lower traffic volumes, with the reverse observed for O-3. K and the marine aerosol components show relatively similar concentrations on all days of the week, while Ca, NH4+, NO3- and SO42- all show a weekday maximum and decline over the weekend. The pollutants show seasonal variations; O-3 shows a springtime maximum, with the traffic-emitted pollutants (NO, NOx, CO, EC, OC etc) giving a winter maximum due to increase in emission, lower mixing depth and poor dispersion. Particulate matter fractions and total particle count show lower concentrations in summertime reflective of the semi-volatile nature of some components.
   Ca shows less seasonal variability, with marine aerosol components showing a maximum winter concentration driven by higher wind speed conditions. NH4+, NO3- and SO42- show lowest levels in summer and maximum springtime concentrations. The traffic-related VOCs show a summertime minimum and wintertime maximum, while isoprene shows increased concentrations during summertime. The street canyon circulation causes the sampling of North London air on northerly winds, but enhanced traffic pollution when winds have a southerly component. There is a sizeable roadside increment above the local background for both exhaust (particulate matter mass fractions, particle number and eBC) and non-exhaust emissions (heavy metals). However, roadside increments of inorganic species, which include Ca, marine aerosol components and the secondary particulate matter components, are not significant, indicating that they are mainly controlled by regional transport of the pollutants. Polar plots show strong local contributions for the regulated gas phase pollutants and the carbon components (EC and OC), with O-3 concentrations enhanced mainly from the northerly direction. The long-range contribution from mainland Europe to the particulate matter fractions is significant and occurs mainly as secondary aerosol. Ratios of OC/EC in particles have shown a steady increase due to a more rapid reduction of EC than OC.

AB  - The April 5th 2017 Mw 6.15 Sefidsang earthquake occurred east-northeast of the town of Fariman near the Cimmerian arc-related Fariman complex. The stress distribution was estimated by seismic parameters and Coulomb stress distribution in the source region. Inferred Coulomb stress field and general pattern of aftershocks distribution revealed that the Sefidsang earthquake occurred on a northeast-dipping listric fault with dextral reverse movement. Proximity of the Sefidsang sequence to Fariman complex proposes the reactivation of the pre-existing Cimmerian arc-related faults in the present-day stress field. The crustal-penetrating low-angle inverted faults coupled with Mesozoic maficultramafic magmatism can shed light on the structural aspects of the region. The kinematics was also investigated by GPS velocity fields and morphotectonic features. The counterclockwise block rotation under the left-lateral regional shear between the Doruneh fault system and the North Kopeh Dagh fault system and NE-oriented coeval shortening led to the formation of rhombic structures. Cimmerianrelated basement faults in NE Iran confined the expansion of rhombic cells and sense of block rotation. The results of this study improved our understanding about kinematics of active deformation in NE Iran and had important implications for seismic hazard assessment of the region and potential future failure area.

T2  - BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT, LIFE-CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS
LA  - English
CP  - 10th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)
AB  - The bridge over the estuary of the Deva River, in the town of Deba, Basque Country, in "Guipuzcua", has been serving exclusively as a footbridge for pedestrians since 2013, and is a work of great heritage value, considered by the Catalogue of Bridges of before 1900 as the most representative work and that best preserves, at provincial level, the character of bridge architecture of the second half of the nineteenth century. The bridge (1866), which until the construction of the new junction in 2006 served as a connection of roads N-634 and GI-638, has suffered several episodes of settlement in its foundation throughout its history. It has been studied in recent years as a consequence of the settlements observed in the piers and their importance within the regional transport network. On July 5, 2018, the vertical settlement of one meter and the longitudinal rotation of the central pile occurred. These deformations caused damage to the entire bridge, mainly to the two central vaults, starts on the pile accompanied its movement and suffered displacements, torsions, loss of pieces and cracking. There was also a great depression in the carriageway and the loss of part of the downstream parapet. Firstly, the actions aimed at stabilizing the structure in its current situation will be undertaken, preventing it from collapsing. In a second phase, work will be carried out to restore the original geometry of the bridge for its commissioning. This article analyzes the recent experience in the rehabilitation of a unique 19th century masonry bridge. This differentiated rehabilitation required the development of very specific works in an extremely valuable environment from an environmental point of view. This is why some innovative actions are explained to mitigate the different sources of risk during the works on the site.

AB  - Shark depredation, whereby hooked fish are partially or completely consumed before they can be retrieved, occurs globally in commercial and recreational fisheries. Depredation can damage fishing gear, injure sharks, cause additional mortality to targeted fish species and result in economic losses to fishers. Knowledge of the mechanisms behind depredation is limited. We used a 13 yr dataset of fishery-dependent commercial daily logbook data for the Mackerel Managed Fishery in Western Australia, which covers 15 degrees of latitude and 10 000 km of coastline, to quantify how fishing effort and environmental variables influence depredation. We found that shark depredation rates were relatively low in comparison with previous studies and varied across the 3 management zones of the fishery, with 1.7 % of hooked fish being depredated in the northern Zone 1, 2.5 % in the central Zone 2 and 5.7 % in the southern Zone 3. Generalized additive mixed models found that measures of commercial fishing activity and a proxy for recreational fishing effort (distance from town centre) were positively correlated with shark depredation across Zones 1 and 2. Depredation rates increased during the 13 yr period in Zones 2 and 3, and were higher at dawn and dusk, suggesting crepuscular feeding in Zone 1. This study provides one of the first quantitative assessments of shark depredation in a commercial fishery in Western Australia, and for a trolling fishery globally. The results demonstrate a correlation between fishing effort and depredation, suggesting greater fishing effort in a concentrated area may change shark behaviour, leading to high rates of depredation.

AB  - The internal situation in the Don region in 1918, during the intervention of armed units of the Austrian and German armies, has been overshadowed in the scholarship by two key phenomena: fates of the Volunteer Movement and formation of the quasi-state, All-Great Don Host. It is important to reconstruct the events that took place in the Don towns and villages in May-November 1918. Historical sources are scattered throughout archives and libraries. The author has used fonds of the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the State Archive of the Rostov Region, and the Center for Documentation on the Contemporary History of the Rostov Region. Austrian and German units that appeared on the borders of the Don region in early May 1918 engaged in combat only with the Red Army detachments. Cossacks and foreign troops fought together from the very beginning. In future, the German administration strove to organize uninterrupted supplies of industrial raw materials and products, food and fodder from the Don territory. In order to do this, the Germans occupied key control points and transport communications in the Western part of the region. A double government was introduced in the villages: alongside atamans there appeared German commandants. Re-election of Ataman P. N. Krasnov in August 1918 was ensured by the Germans; his most influential opponents were neutralized; censorship for the press was introduced. The Germans held a neutral position towards Russian officers and the Volunteer Army. The experience of intervention in the South of Russia influenced the fate of Germany, as German soldiers received a practical lesson in revolutionary action. Presence of the Central Powers' troops in Russia forced the Entente countries to intervene more actively in the affairs of their former ally.

AB  - At the very end of the year 2020, on 29 December, a hazardous earthquake of M-w = 6.2 hit the area of Petrinja and its surroundings, in the NW of Croatia. The earthquake was felt across the area of 400 km, leaving an inconceivable damage in the vicinity of the epicenter, devastated towns and ruined lives. In order to map the spreading of earthquake waves and to determine the coseismic ground displacement after the mainshock, we have analyzed open satellite radar images of Sentinel-1 and the GNSS data from the nearest CORS station related to the epicenter, along with the seismic faults. In this paper, we addressed and mapped the displacement linear surface ruptures detected by the SAR interferometry. The results show the vertical ground displacement to the extent of -12 cm in the southern area and up to 22 cm in the north-western part of a wide area struck by the earthquake impact, related to the epicenter. Subsidence and uplift in a range of +/- 5 cm over a wider affected area indicate a spatial extent and hazardous impact made by the earthquake. The ground displacement of 30 cm to the West and 40 cm to the East has been identified considering the intersection of Pokupsko and Petrinja strike-slip fault system in the seismic zone of Pannonian basin. Accordingly, we obtained matching results of 5 cm south-easting shift and -3 cm subsidence on Sisak GNSS CROPOS station, addressing the tectonic blocks movement along the activated complex fault system. The results compared with the geology data confirm the existence of two main faults; the Pokupsko and the Petrinja strike-slip faults and interpret the occurrence of secondary post-seismic events over the observed area.

AB  - Honey bee mating is difficult to control as it occurs in flight, several kilometers away from the hive of origin of both queens and drones. In recent years, there has been an increase in the introduction into Italy of queen bees and swarms originating from interracial crossings (especially those known as "Buckfast"), or belonging to non-native subspecies. Consequently, there is a strong need to establish areas suitable for controlled mating. The Italian national beekeeping registry (BDNA) has been recently set up to monitor the position of apiaries and movement of hives, with the purpose of economic and sanitary protection and improvement of bee heritage and food safety. The BDNA was, thus, deemed a suitable tool to explore the availability of areas that could be used as mating stations. Specific criteria, such as not be classified as wetlands, altitude below 1500 m a.s.l., distance of at least 6000 m from an apiary, and distance of at least 1500 m from the national terrestrial border, were selected for defining the mating stations. Furthermore, all the remaining Italian national territory was considered suitable for settlement of mating stations, including towns, industrial settlements, and roads. Based on these criteria, the following methodological framework was applied: (1) collection of the required data (i.e., apiaries coordinates, geospatial data on soil classification, geospatial data on terrain altitude, Italian boundary geospatial data); (2) calculation for the excluded areas according with the criteria listed above; (3) calculation of the mating areas by means of the difference between the entire Italian territory and the excluded areas. The database of BDNA was used to identify them. Appropriate databases and software were used to exclude the areas of the Italian national territory that did not fulfill the established criteria. In this paper, we report the procedure applied to identify on maps the areas suitable for controlled mating of queen bees in the Italian national territory based on data currently available in the BDNA.

AB  - The study area comprises the Niksar Basin of Tokat district, located in the Middle Black Sea region, Turkey. The Kelkit River flows through the center of Niksar Valley. The lithological units exposed on the northern and southern parts of Kelkit River have disparate geological sequences; grouped as "Pontid" and "Anatolit" respectively. The micritic and biomicritic limestone of Upper Jurassic -Lower Cretaceous, limestone of Upper Cretaceous, and the detrital limestone of Upper Cretaceous -Lower Paleocene form characteristic karstic aquifers. In the valley, a thick sequence of loose gravel, sand, and clayey materials of Pliocene and Quaternary are deposited. The presence of clay lenses in these materials created suitable hydrodynamic conditions for the formation of confined and unconfined aquifers. The karstic aquifers recharged through precipitation and valley-fill aquifer through Kelkit River. These aquifers fulfill the water supply demands of the entire population of Niksar Town and surrounding villages. This paper summarizes hydrogeological research conducted on all basinal formations. The Karstic aquifers and the unconfined aquifer of valley-fill sediments were systematically analyzed. The physical characteristics of the aquifer formations, karstification, occurrence, and movement of groundwater, recharge, and discharge sources, and discharge hydrograph analysis were conducted. The exposed hydrogeological formations were recharged through precipitation by 0.329x10(9)m(3) and discharged by 0.317x10(9)m(3) during the study period. The karstic formations were recharged from precipitation by 45.0x10(6)m(3), while discharged from karstic springs by 47.88x10(6)m(3) of water. The discharge rate of major karstic spring ranges from 4.3 to 430 l/s and the discharge coefficient ranges from 0.004-0.026 day-1. The storage capacity of springs varies from 0.14-5.01x10(6)m(3) and the total discharged volume during the study period was 48.10x10(6)m(3). The groundwater budget of the valley-fill aquifer represents that during the study period recharged from different sources 0.266x10(9)m(3) and discharged 0.263x10(9)m(3) by all sources. The conceptual hydrogeological model of Niksar Valley simulates geological, hydroclimatic, hydrogeomorphologic, hydrostratigraphic, hydrogeological, and hydrologic field environments.

AB  - Background: Concern for the development of extrapyramidal side effects (EPSEs) represents a barrier to the routine use of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic medication in patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES). Flupenthixol decanoate is a first-generation antipsychotic, which is readily available in the public healthcare system in South Africa.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the nature, occurrence and severity of EPSEs and their impact on patients with FES over 12 months of treatment with flupenthixol decanoate (fluanxol depot).
   Setting: The study was based in Cape Town, South Africa, and patients with FES were recruited from inpatient services at Stikland and Tygerberg Hospitals and surrounding psychiatric clinics. This was a sub-study of a larger study, which examined several outcomes in patients with FES treated with the lowest effective dose of flupenthixol decanoate.
   Methods: The Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) was used to assess both subjective experience and objective measures of EPSEs in a cohort of patients with FES (N = 130). The relationship between demographic and clinical risk factors for individual subsets of EPSEs was also determined.
   Results: in the context of an overall good 12-month tolerability, EPSEs peaked at month 3. Patients with akathisia were more likely to have greater symptoms of depression, and Parkinsonism was predicted by higher Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores (independent of medication dosage). Black and white patients showed higher total ESRS and higher subjective ESRS scores, compared with patients of mixed ancestry, and white patients scored higher on Parkinsonism ratings.
   Conclusion: Flupenthixol decanoate is well tolerated in patients with FES. Certain clinical features of schizophrenia may be related to EPSEs. Ethnicity is a socio-cultural construct, and hence the differential risk of EPSEs should be interpreted according to ethnicity. Variations in the environment, diet, substance use and genetics may all affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of psychotropic drugs and warrant further investigation.

AB  - Background: The conflict in Syria has led to the displacement of 1.5 million refugees into the neighboring country of Lebanon, with a majority that have yet to return to their homeland. Syrian adolescents in the town of Bar Elias in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon have lived and grown in the face of resource-limited environments, restricted movement, and a longing for return. Resilience is manifested in the adaptation to such circumstances through close supportive relationships, social engagement, employment, and religion. There is a communal aspect to resilience that is important to the adolescent refugee experience and to the efforts supporting these communities.
   Methods: Fifteen one-to-one interviews and two focus groups, with a total of eighteen Syrian adolescents, were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis informed by grounded theory principles. Participants were recruited through partnering non- governmental organizations (NGOs) in the area, and ethical approval was granted through UCL and the American University in Beirut (AUB).
   Results: Syrian adolescents highlighted supportive relationships, communal activities and spaces, memories of home, employment, and shared environments as integral elements to their personal adaptation. Methods of resilience involved social cohesion and establishing stability for one's family and close community. Adaptation to the present is intertwined with facing the consequences of displacement in this new context and maintaining aspirations for a bright future. Engaging with the environments they share and help create is an important facet of resilience and occurs through group gatherings, hobbies, and online communication. Additionally, inner strength can be derived from religious activities and empowers individual processing.
   Conclusion: This study illuminates the elements and mechanisms embodied in these adolescents' communities and relationships that allow for adaptation to life in Bar Elias. These factors strengthen their approach to overcome social barriers and practice resilience. These communal aspects of the adolescents' lives also connect to their memories of home, current environment, and future aspirations.

AB  - The purpose of the research is to reveal the specifics of women's organizations formation in the form of "women departments", "women delegate meetings", "women councils" in Volyn region during the first postwar years; to elucidate the content of their activities through the prism of political and propaganda work and participation in the process of the collective farm system formation in the region. The methodological basis of the research is the principles of historicism, scientificity, a combination of systemic and regional approaches, an authorial objectivity, a moderate narrative constructivism, as well as the use of general scientific (analysis, synthesis, generalization) and special historical (historical genetic, historical typological, historical systemic) methods. The scientific novelty consists in the fact for the first time in the historiography of the Ukrainian women movement on the basis qf previously unknown archival documents there has been elucidated the topic of women's participation in the Sovietization of the western regions of Ukraine during the first postwar decade, in particular, in Volyn; there has been highlighted the policy of the Bolshevik government's use of women as an effective tool for forming the collective farm system in the region; the dynamics of the quantitative growth of members of women's organizations has been elucidated. The construction of the image of a woman activist by Stalinist propaganda has been illustrated; controllability of the process of women activation by the party structures; the scale of work of "women departments" and "women councils" through the organization of women forums, meetings; rhetoric of speeches of women delegates. The Conclusions. After the liberation of Volyn region from the German occupiers, the campaign was launched there to restore the institutions of the Soviet power: In 1945, women department was established in the structure of the CP(b)Ukr regional committee, and women organizers were appointed in the district committees. These bodies coordinated and supervised the work of women's organizations, which were necessarily created en masse in institutions, organizations, villages, and later- in the collective farms of the region. Their main task was to mobilize women's resources for the process of economic life reconstruction and development in the region. In addition, they partially took care of the social problems of the region - the elimination of illiteracy and poor literacy of women, guardianship of orphans, the disabled, mothers with many children, the improvement and landscaping of villages and towns, and etc.

AB  - 1. Background
   Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership.
   2. Research questions
   On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research? (2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature?
   3. Theoretical framework
   (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research
   The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s, contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium.
   (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research
   Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding the review's selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger's study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews.
   In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger's effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management.
   A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education.
   In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin's (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan's (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals, 70% of the topics were related to principals' leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development.
   4. Research method
   This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions.
   5. Research findings
   The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001. Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2 times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network.
   6. Contributions
   Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan.

AB  - Simple Summary Few studies refer to ecological differences of genetically close and morphologically almost identical insectivorous bat species. However, this information is indispensable for effective and sustainable nature conservation strategies. This study aims at investigating differences in the spatial ecology of the long-eared bat species Plecotus auritus and Plecotus austriacus in a typical cultural landscape of Brandenburg, where the two species occur sympatrically. The reconstruction of the prey spectrum revealed that P. auritus and P. austriacus strongly overlapped in their diet. Our results suggest that resource partitioning is based on using different foraging habitats. While radio-tracked females of P. auritus were strongly associated with woodland patches resulting in small-scale activity areas of only few square kilometers, activity areas of P. austriacus encompassed a large-scale matrix of grassland habitats in the magnitude of a small town. Based on these results, we identify priority conservation needs for the two species to ensure that these differences in the spatial behavior and habitat use can be adequately taken into account for future nature conservation efforts. Movement behavior and habitat use of the long-eared bat species Plecotus auritus and Plecotus austriacus were studied in the Havelland region in Brandenburg (Germany). Data collection included mist-netting, radiotelemetry, reconstruction of prey items, and monitoring of roosting sites. Body measurements confirm a high degree of phenotypic similarity between the two species. Total activity areas (100% Minimum Convex Polygons, MCPS) of Plecotus austriacus (2828.3 +/- 1269.43 ha) were up to five-fold larger compared to Plecotus auritus (544.54 +/- 295.89 ha). The activity areas of Plecotus austriacus contained up to 11 distinct core areas, and their mean total size (149.7 +/- 0.07 ha) was approximately three-fold larger compared to core areas of Plecotus auritus (49.2 +/- 25.6 ha). The mean distance between consecutive fixes per night was 12.72 +/- 3.7 km for Plecotus austriacus and 4.23 +/- 2.8 km for Plecotus auritus. While Plecotus austriacus was located most frequently over pastures (>40%) and meadows (>20%), P. auritus was located mostly within deciduous (>50%) and mixed forests (>30%) in close vicinity to its roosts. Roost site monitoring indicates that the activity of P. austriacus is delayed relative to P. auritus in spring and declined earlier in autumn. These phenological differences are probably related to the species' respective diets. Levins' measure of trophic niche breadth suggests that the prey spectrum for P. auritus is more diverse during spring (B = 2.86) and autumn (B = 2.82) compared to P. austriacus (spring: B = 1.7; autumn: B = 2.1). Our results give reason to consider these interspecific ecological variations and species-specific requirements of P. auritus and P. austriacus to develop adapted and improved conservation measures.

AB  - At the start of the 20th century, the church strongly influenced the value judgements and the world of thoughts and ideas of people in our region. Primarily two confessions, the Lutheran and Orthodox faiths, have to be considered in the Estonian context. Starting from the Reformation that took place in the 16th century, the Lutheran faith prevailed in Estonia. Baltic Germans and most Estonians belonged to this confession. The Orthodox faith rose to the agenda only in connection with the extensive religious conversion movement of the 1840s. The Riga Vicar Diocese (covering the governorates of Livland and Courland) was established in 1836 as part of the Pskov Diocese and became an independent diocese in 1850. The Governorate of Estland was part of the St Petersburg Diocese until 1865. Thereafter it became part of the Riga Diocese. By the start of the 20th century, Orthodox believers accounted for a fifth of Estonia's population. It is unclear how large a part of all Orthodox believers in Estonia consisted of Estonians at that time. In 1914, there were 210 Orthodox congregations in the territory of Estonia and Latvia: 99 Estonian, 49 Latvian, 29 Russian, and 33 mixed congregations. It is quite evident that Estonians accounted for the greater portion of the members of Estonian Orthodox congregations and that Estonians dominated as clerics in them as well. In 1918, 74 Estonian Orthodox priests served in at least 75 Estonian Orthodox congregations, in other words 75% of Estonian congregations in Estonia.
   After the February Revolution, large-scale changes took place in the summer of 1917 in the organisation of the entire Orthodox Church of Russia. The most important innovations were the restoration of the church council and of the position of patriarch. Estonian Orthodox believers wished to give local Orthodox church life more of an Estonian character: church services in the Estonian language, christening using typically Estonian names, instruction in the Estonian language in Orthodox schools similarly to Lutheran schools, publication of spiritual literature in Estonian, and other such matters. Yet the most important issue for the Estonian congregations in the Riga Diocese was the restoration of the Tallinn Vicar Diocese headed by an Estonian bishop. The Russian Orthodox Church Synod granted permission for this in July of 1917.
   Estonian Orthodox believers made proposals to two men who had been educated at the Riga theological seminary as well as the theological academy to apply for the position of Tallinn's Vicar Bishop. Aleksander Kaelas (1880-1920), a philosophy lecturer at Moscow University, declined the offer. Paul (Pavel) Kulbusch (1869-1919), the priest of the St Petersburg Estonian congregation, also thought twice about the proposal before agreeing: 'I knew what condition our homeland was in and was familiar with its Orthodox church life. Besides, it was foreseeable what would henceforth happen in our country due to the war: plenty of sadness and hardship could be expected.' Additionally, the arrival of German forces in Estonia could be expected soon. Kulbusch was elected Vicar Bishop of Tallinn at a plenary assembly of the Riga Diocese that took place in Tartu on 10 August 1917 and was ordained on 31 December.
   During and after the First World War, new nation-states were created as empires collapsed. As part of this process, the Republic of Estonia was born on 24 February 1918. Estonians could not yet start building their independent state because German forces shortly captured all of Estonian territory.The occupying authorities did not recognise Estonia's independent statehood and set Estonia's annexation to Germany, the country's colonisation by Germans, and the Germanisation of Estonian cultural life as its objectives. Very little is still known about Estonian cultural life from that time. Its study will help to better understand the aspirations of Estonians in preserving their national-cultural self-awareness in 1918 under the conditions of Germanisation. The German occupying authorities were particularly ill-disposed towards everything associated with Russianness. Thus, the position of the Orthodox Church deteriorated, and the position of the Lutheran Church, which was associated with Baltic Germans, became stronger.
   In January of 1918, Patriarch Tikhon appointed Vicar Bishop Platon provisional acting Bishop of Riga as well. Tikhon and Platon thought that Platon would probably remain alone in his work during German rule without the support of the Russian Orthodox Church. It was not known if henceforward it would be possible at all to move about between Estonia and Russia and to exchange information. Hitherto in historical literature, it has been believed that Estonia's regular communication with the church authorities in St Petersburg and Moscow was cut off due to the German occupation. In reality, it was possible even later on in certain cases to cross the border either with the permission of the German military authorities or illegally. Bishop Platon nevertheless succeeded in sending Archdeacon Konstantin Dorin, the secretary of the Provisional Council of Riga Diocese, to Moscow to see Patriarch Tikhon in the summer of 1918. Dorin's report on his trip reveals the mutual esteem and trust that the leaders of the Estonian and Russian Orthodox churches felt regarding one another.
   The financial situation of the Orthodox Church deteriorated significantly in 1918 compared to 1917. On the one hand, the wartime economic difficulties affecting all of Estonia influenced this. These difficulties became even more pronounced during the German occupation, when reserves of raw materials, fuel, and food were even taken from Estonia to Germany. On the other hand, Estonian Orthodox clerics were left without any stable income due to the political changes. After the October Revolution in 1917, the Bolsheviks seized control of Russia's finances, including those of the Orthodox Church. Starting on 1 January 1918, the church no longer received any money from the state. The Orthodox Church in Estonia was able to operate only thanks to donations from Orthodox believers.
   Bishop Platon rendered very considerable services in supporting the spiritual resistance of Orthodox Estonians during the German occupation with his tours of the country, his memorandums, and the promotion of the Orthodox Church more broadly. In 1918, Platon visited 71 congregations in cities (Tartu, Voru, Valga, Parnu, Viljandi, Riga), conducted tours in Tartu and Voru counties, and around Vortsjarv Lake. Considering the fact that there were 118 congregations in Estonia's Orthodox rural deaneries in 1915, the number of congregations that he visited accounted for over half of the congregations. The bishop was most frequently in Tartu, visiting Tartu's Alexander congregation, the cleric of which was Anton Laar, who was Platon's confidant and a member of the Provisional Council of Riga Diocese. Platon's words gave clerics strength of soul to remain with their congregations in that difficult time in both worries and joys. According to Platon, the aim of his visits to congregations was to bring the people together, to affirm national self-awareness and their belief in the victory of goodness and fairness, and to encourage the people at a difficult time. Thereat Platon supported all nationalities, both Estonians and Russians.
   The First World War ended on 11 November 1918 and in essence, the German occupation in Estonia also ended on that date. Bishop Platon held Estonia's independence in high esteem, writing on 14 November 1918: 'Now, on historical days, when the idea of Estonian independence has finally managed to assert itself, although initially provisionally, every Estonian wishes that this loveliest idea of Estonia will also be permanently secured. In this sense, I as well, as the head of the Estonian Orthodox Church and hence the spiritual leader of 1/5 part of the Estonian people, support with all my might the firm undertaking of the Estonian people: to arrive at its complete independence.' Other Orthodox clerics also rejoiced together with the entire Estonian people regarding the end of the German occupation. Unfortunately, the end of the German occupation did not yet bring peace to Estonia. Shortly, the armed forces of Soviet Russia crossed the Estonian border, and the Estonian nation and church, power and spirit were in mortal danger. The Bolsheviks executed Bishop Platon in Tartu on 14 January 1919. He was declared a martyr-saint in 2000.
