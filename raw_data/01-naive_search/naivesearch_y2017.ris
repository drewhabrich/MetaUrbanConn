AB  - An important limitation of studies on the ecological value of urban habitats is the question of habitat connectivity. While connectivity allows spread and genetic exchange of species, isolation can lead to the extinction of populations through inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. However, while practitioners already start improving urban habitat patches by means of restoration, issues of connectivity have not been taken in account although being crucial for a self-sustaining habitat network. In our study, we evaluate the connectivity of public urban grasslands such as lawns, grasslands in residential areas, playgrounds or parks in the city of Munster, Germany. Employing a graph theory approach, which uses a map (graph) of habitat patches to calculate functional connectivity measures using patch area size and patch connectivity, we studied four groups of different plant dispersal distances (2 m, 20 m, 44 m and 100 m). This approach can be recommended for planning issues due to the output of different indicator values and comparably low data demands. Our results show for the first time, that connectivity of urban grasslands is extremely low for species of short-distance dispersal but slightly increases for long-distance dispersal. Except two larger conglomerations of well-connected patches, urban grasslands were found to be mostly sparsely connected. Thus, future research should focus on options to improve connectivity and to prioritize patches for ecological improvement. The graph theory approach turned out to be a useful tool to analyse urban habitat connectivity but also to illustrate results obtained.

AB  - Maintaining forest landscape connectivity is one of the most effective ways to alleviate natural forest fragmentation and biodiversity loss problems. Recently, graph theory based metrics have been used as powerful tools in the assessment of landscape connectivity. However, the functional features of landscape units at different structure levels, based on which outcomes can be enriched and advice can be given for practical applications, have been overlooked. In this study, a series of graph-based connectivity indices was calculated to 1) evaluate the optimal threshold distance, 2) identify the key landscape units at the component and patch levels, and 3) classify the functional types of components and patches and analyze functional patterns at different structural levels. The relationship between patch size and patch functional performance in maintaining landscape connectivity was discussed. With a natural forest area in Minqing County of China as the study area, recommendations regarding forest conservation and connectivity enhancement were provided based on the research conclusions. This study provides a way to comprehensively analyze habitat fragmentation and functional patterns for local forest conservation. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban expansion increases fragmentation of the landscape. In effect, fragmentation decreases connectivity, causes green space loss and impacts upon the ecology and function of green space. Restoration of the functionality of green space often requires restoring the ecological connectivity of this green space within the city matrix. However, identifying ecological corridors that integrate different structural and functional connectivity of green space remains vague. Assessing connectivity for developing an ecological network by using efficient models is essential to improve these networks under rapid urban expansion. This paper presents a novel methodological approach to assess and model connectivity for the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) and Yellow-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus goiavier) in three cities (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Jakarta, Indonesia and Metro Manila, Philippines). The approach identifies potential priority corridors for ecological connectivity networks. The study combined circuit models, connectivity analysis and least-cost models to identify potential corridors by integrating structure and function of green space patches to provide reliable ecological connectivity network models in the cities. Relevant parameters such as landscape resistance and green space structure (vegetation density, patch size and patch distance) were derived from an expert and literature-based approach based on the preference of bird behaviour. The integrated models allowed the assessment of connectivity for both species using different measures of green space structure revealing the potential corridors and least-cost pathways for both bird species at the patch sites. The implementation of improvements to the identified corridors could increase the connectivity of green space. This study provides examples of how combining models can contribute to the improvement of ecological networks in rapidly expanding cities and demonstrates the usefulness of such models for biodiversity conservation and urban planning.

AB  - As urban areas expand, understanding how ecological processes function in cities has become increasingly important for conserving biodiversity. Urban green spaces are critical habitats to support biodiversity, but we still have a limited understanding of their ecology and how they function to conserve biodiversity at local and landscape scales across multiple taxa. Given this limited view, we discuss five key questions that need to be addressed to advance the ecology of urban green spaces for biodiversity conservation and restoration. Specifically, we discuss the need for research to understand how green space size, connectedness, and type influence the community, population, and life-history dynamics of multiple taxa in cities. A research framework based in landscape and metapopulation ecology will allow for a greater understanding of the ecological function of green spaces and thus allow for planning and management of green spaces to conserve biodiversity and aid in restoration activities.

AB  - The fragmentation of natural habitats is a major threat for biodiversity. However, the impact and spatial scale of natural isolation mechanisms leading to species loss, compared to anthropogenic fragmentation, are not clear, mainly due to differences between fragments and islands, such as matrix permeability. We studied a 500km(2) Mediterranean region in France, including urban habitat fragments, continuous habitat, and continental-shelf islands. On the basis of 295 floristic releves, we built species-area relationships to compare isolation in fragments after urbanization, with continuous habitat and continental-shelf islands. We assumed either no dispersal, infinite dispersal, or estimated intermediate levels of habitat reachability through graph theory. Isolation mechanisms occurred in fragments but with a lower strength than in near-shore islands, and most importantly affected perennial plants. Annual plants were less affected, probably due to their smaller size and shorter life cycle. Isolation occurred at landscape level in fragments and at patch level in islands. The amount of reachable habitat (accounting for spatial configuration) explained local species richness in both systems, but the amount of habitat (no consideration of spatial configuration) was already a good predictor. These results suggest an important role of habitat amount around fragments in mitigating the isolation effects observed in near-shore islands, and the importance of carefully considering different functional groups.

AB  - Anthropogenic change, specifically urbanization, has lasting impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Past work has linked green space variables and socioeconomic characteristics with biodiversity in urban areas. Shrinking cities present an interesting case for studying biodiversity because many of these places have implemented demolition policies to remove vacant buildings from the landscape, which returns previously urbanized land back into a "natural" state. The objective of this study is to investigate the multifaceted relationship among urban green space, socioeconomic characteristics, demolition activities, and avian species richness in the shrinking city of Buffalo, NY. We first establish a baseline understanding of how social and ecological factors are related to avian species richness through generalized linear models (GLM) and then incorporate a variable characterizing demolition to understand how the process of demolition may be impacting species richness relative to other factors. Second, since our analysis relies on "citizen science" data from eBird, we aim to better understand the factors driving eBird participation in Buffalo through zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models to test how social and ecological characteristics and demolition affect checklists submission across the city. Our findings suggested that demolition activities do not increase species richness in Buffalo, indicating these sites may not be returning to a natural state that is usable by birds. We also found that areas that have undergone considerable demolition may be a potential deterrent to eBird participation, and eBird users may create bias by sampling areas with greater green space connectivity, and thus higher richness.

AB  - In urban landscapes, gardens provide refuges for bee diversity, but conservation potential may depend on local and landscape features. Foraging and population persistence of bee species, as well as overall pollinator community structure, may be supported by the abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources. Floral resources strongly differ in urban gardens. Using hand netting and pan traps to survey bees, we examined whether abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources, as well as ground cover and garden landscape surroundings influence bee abundance, species richness, and diversity on the central coast of California. Differences in floral abundance and spatial distribution, as well as urban cover in the landscape, predicted different bee community variables. Abundance of all bees and of honeybees (Apis mellifera) was lower in sites with more urban land cover surrounding the gardens. Honeybee abundance was higher in sites with patchy floral resources, whereas bee species richness and bee diversity was higher in sites with more clustered floral resources. Surprisingly, bee species richness and bee diversity was lower in sites with very high floral abundance, possibly due to interactions with honeybees. Other studies have documented the importance of floral abundance and landscape surroundings for bees in urban gardens, but this study is the first to document that the spatial arrangement of flowers strongly predicts bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings, it is likely that garden managers may promote bee conservation by managing for floral connectivity and abundance within these ubiquitous urban habitats.

AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most severe drivers of current global biodiversity loss and has contributed to severe declines in many amphibian species. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for amphibians in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian species richness of 46 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 46 control ponds (CONTROL).
   Our study revealed that environmental conditions clearly varied between STOPON and CONTROL. The most pronounced differences were that STOPON were larger, shallower, sunnier, more isolated by streets and had a greater cover of built-up area and lower cover of arable land surrounding them. Nevertheless, the amphibian assemblages of STOPON and CONTROL were very similar. All nine amphibian species (including three threatened species) detected in this study were found in both pond types. Moreover, species richness (2.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.2) and the frequency of each species did not differ between STOPON and CONTROL. The only exception was Pelophylax spp., which occurred more regularly in STOPON. Both habitat and landscape quality affected amphibian species richness; however, the explanatory power of the habitat models was about twice as high as those of the landscape models.
   In conclusion, stormwater ponds play an important role for amphibians in urban areas. In comparison to CONTROL, the low landscape quality in the surroundings of STOPON seemed to be compensated by a higher habitat quality due to regular management.

AB  - Increasing development of urban environments creates high pressure on green spaces with potential negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. There is growing evidence that green roofs - rooftops covered with vegetation - can contribute mitigate the loss of urban green spaces by providing new habitats for numerous arthropod species. Whether green roofs can contribute to enhance taxonomic and functional diversity and increase connectivity across urbanized areas remains, however, largely unknown. Furthermore, only limited information is available on how environmental conditions shape green roof arthropod communities. We investigated the community composition of arthropods (Apidae, Curculionidae, Araneae and Carabidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 green sites at ground level in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. We assessed how the site's environmental variables (such as area, height, vegetation, substrate and connectivity among sites) affect species richness and functional diversity using generalized linear models. We used an extension of co-inertia analysis (RLQ) and fourth-corner analysis to highlight the mechanism underlying community assemblages across taxonomic groups on green roof and ground communities. Species richness was higher at ground-level sites, while no difference in functional diversity was found between green roofs and ground sites. Green roof arthropod diversity increased with higher connectivity and plant species richness, irrespective of substrate depth, height and area of green roofs. The species trait analysis reviewed the mechanisms related to the environmental predictors that shape the species assemblages of the different taxa at ground and roof sites. Our study shows the important contribution of green roofs in maintaining high functional diversity of arthropod communities across different taxonomic groups, despite their lower species richness compared with ground sites. Species communities on green roofs revealed to be characterized by specific trait assemblages. The study also provides details on the environmental conditions that influence arthropod diversity and gives new perspectives on how the design of green roofs can be improved to increase their ecological value. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of integrating green roofs in planning policies which aim to enhance urban habitat connectivity.

AB  - Forest fragmentation and the associated potential habitat loss is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. One strategy that promotes its maintenance at a landscape scale is the establishment of biological corridors that enhance structural and functional connectivity of the biotic components. However, the applicability and functionality of this tool is limited due to the lack of planning at the moment of the design and establishment of corridors or connectivity networks that are guided by detailed and rigorous methods. In this research, we developed a theoretical proposal of ecological connectivity for the Santa Elena village, Medellin municipality, Colombia, using tools from landscape ecology. Initially, 21 forest fragments or nucleus were selected based on their minimum size (larger than 5 ha), core area (larger than 1 ha), and shape index (rounded or nearly rounded). Then, based on a friction matrix, we designed a potential network that would allow to connect 1356.35 ha of remnants forests through 31 ecological corridors of 100 m wide, comprising 208.33 ha in total. Finally, we discussed the importance of promoting this kind of strategies based on landscape ecology that enhance both habitat conservation and landscape connectivity in areas near large Latin-American cities.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation is challenging in urbanizing landscapes where recurring habitat degradation occurs and space is limited for subsequent restoration. Conservation efforts based on natural reserves may not be able to maintain certain ecological processes that extend beyond the reserves. There is an urgent need to conserve or restore critical habitats outside of protected areas to maintain the functional connectivity of habitat networks. In this study, we developed a connectivity modelling approach associated with varying conservation scenarios to establish habitat conservation priorities in a rapidly urbanizing area of Shenzhen, China. We incorporated unprotected habitat patches into the reserve network via four scenarios and prioritized the contributions of these patches to habitat connectivity. We also investigated the responses of species with different dispersal abilities to habitat changes under each conservation scenario. The results showed that the spatial pattern of unprotected habitats played an important role in enhancing the connectivity of the entire network within the study area. The habitat patches around protected areas could create greater connectivity gains and should be prioritized for conservation. The key patches that substantially enhance connectivity were identified as special conservation concerns. The connectivity benefits from different scenarios were closely linked with species dispersal abilities. This study promotes the understanding of the importance of habitats outside of protected areas in urbanizing landscapes and provides the species-specific and spatially explicit conservation schemes for making informed decisions in urban planning and management.

AB  - Habitat loss, together with less obvious land-use changes such as intensified farming practice, can have significant adverse impacts on biodiversity. An important factor in determining the ability of species to cope with such changes is their potential to sustain a populations network by dispersal across the landscape. Habitat quality and structure are particularly important for surface-dwelling species with low dispersal abilities, such as amphibians. To assess this ecological function, ponds in a coastal and typically rural area of northern France were surveyed for amphibians in 1974, 1992 and 2011. These repeated surveys yielded different outcomes for different species groups. Three rare species persisted in more or less specialized habitat types. Two moderately common species declined, but kept strongholds in coastal dunes and associated marshes. Five common species with broad ecological niches remained equally widespread. The Northern crested newt declined markedly and the Midwife toad declined dramatically, as did their breeding habitats in vegetated ponds and cattle drinking troughs. One species, the Moor frog, may have gone locally extinct. A model of relative resistance to amphibian dispersal was created for different landscape types, on a scale from 0 (low resistance) to 1 (high resistance). This generated values of 0.23 for pasture, 0.72 for arable and 0.98 for urban and transport. As pasture declined in the study area, while arable and urban/transport infrastructure increased, amphibian dispersal became more difficult. However, dispersal paths proved difficult to evaluate in a patchy landscape like the one surveyed, due to a paucity of spatial signal. Pond loss is a more tractable reason for the observed amphibian species decline than is the quality of intervening terrestrial habitat matrix. In 2011, 22 newly created ponds had species richness in line with pre-existing ponds and this will have counteracted a dwindling metapopulation structure, indicating that habitat creation/restoration can play a valuable role in conservation. The colonization of new ponds may also prove more informative for gauging the potential for amphibian dispersal in the landscape than the preceding decline.

AB  - Designing connected landscapes is among the most widespread strategies for achieving biodiversity conservation targets. The challenge lies in simultaneously satisfying the connectivity needs of multiple species at multiple spatial scales under uncertain climate and land-use change. To evaluate the contribution of remnant habitat fragments to the connectivity of regional habitat networks, we developed a method to integrate uncertainty in climate and land-use change projections with the latest developments in network-connectivity research and spatial, multipurpose conservation prioritization. We used land-use change simulations to explore robustness of species' habitat networks to alternative development scenarios. We applied our method to 14 vertebrate focal species of periurban Montreal, Canada. Accounting for connectivity in spatial prioritization strongly modified conservation priorities and the modified priorities were robust to uncertain climate change. Setting conservation priorities based on habitat quality and connectivity maintained a large proportion of the region's connectivity, despite anticipated habitat loss due to climate and land-use change. The application of connectivity criteria alongside habitat-quality criteria for protected-area design was efficient with respect to the amount of area that needs protection and did not necessarily amplify trade-offs among conservation criteria. Our approach and results are being applied in and around Montreal and are well suited to the design of ecological networks and green infrastructure for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in other regions, in particular regions around large cities, where connectivity is critically low.

AB  - Rapid rates of urbanisation affect biodiversity through habitat fragmentation and loss. Because urban golf courses are large green spaces, they potentially harbour much biodiversity if managed for such. The area of untransformed land of golf courses in the Eastern Cape (South Africa) was determined using Geographic Information System (GIS), the woody plant composition of a subsample was determined by field sampling and the greenkeepers were interviewed. There was a significant relationship between climate and woody cover, species richness and percentage native plants but not species diversity. There was no relationship between management scores and species richness, diversity and percentage native. Significant relationships were evident between woody plant species richness and course income, number of grounds staff, number of club members and greenkeepers' years of experience. These results suggest a complex suite of factors that play a role in the woody plant composition of urban golf courses and their contribution to urban biodiversity.

AB  - The movements of organisms and the resultant flows of ecosystem services are strongly shaped by landscape connectivity. Studies of urban ecosystems have relied on two-dimensional (2D) measures of greenspace structure to calculate connectivity. It is now possible to explore three-dimensional (3D) connectivity in urban vegetation using waveform lidar technology that measures the full 3D structure of the canopy. Making use of this technology, here we evaluate urban greenspace 3D connectivity, taking into account the full vertical stratification of the vegetation. Using three towns in southern England, UK, all with varying greenspace structures, we describe and compare the structural and functional connectivity using both traditional 2D greenspace models and waveform lidar-generated vegetation strata (namely, grass, shrubs and trees). Measures of connectivity derived from 3D greenspace are lower than those derived from 2D models, as the latter assumes that all vertical vegetation strata are connected, which is rarely true. Fragmented landscapes that have more complex 3D vegetation showed greater functional connectivity and we found highest 2D to 3D functional connectivity biases for short dispersal capacities of organisms (6 m to 16 m). These findings are particularly pertinent in urban systems where the distribution of greenspace is critical for delivery of ecosystem services.

AB  - Context Connectivity is fundamental to understanding how landscape form influences ecological function. However, uncertainties persist due to the difficulty and expense of gathering empirical data to drive or to validate connectivity models, especially in urban areas, where relationships are multifaceted and the habitat matrix cannot be considered to be binary.
   Objectives This research used circuit theory to model urban bird flows (i.e. 'current'), and compared results to observed abundance. The aims were to explore the ability of this approach to predict wildlife flows and to test relationships between modelled connectivity and variation in abundance.
   Methods Circuitscape was used to model functional connectivity in Bedford, Luton/Dunstable, and Milton Keynes, UK, for great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), drawing parameters from published studies of woodland bird flows in urban environments. Model performance was then tested against observed abundance data.
   Results Modelled current showed a weak yet positive agreement with combined abundance for P. major and C. caeruleus. Weaker correlations were found for other woodland species, suggesting the approach may be expandable if re-parameterised.
   Conclusions Trees provide suitable habitat for urban woodland bird species, but their location in large, contiguous patches and corridors along barriers also facilitates connectivity networks throughout the urban matrix. Urban connectivity studies are well-served by the advantages of circuit theory approaches, and benefit from the empirical study of wildlife flows in these landscapes to parameterise this type of modelling more explicitly. Such results can prove informative and beneficial in designing urban green space and new developments.

AB  - Ecologists increasingly appreciate the central role that urban biodiversity plays in ecosystems, however much urban biodiversity is neglected, especially some very diverse groups of invertebrates. For the first time in southern Europe, land snail communities are analysed in four urban habitats along a geographical gradient of three cities, using quantitative methods and assessing the relative roles of local environmental conditions ("distance from sea", "distance from city centre", "vegetation cover") and spatial effects by principal coordinate analysis of neighbour matrices, redundancy analysis and variation partitioning. A total of 53 species was recorded, a richness similar to that of natural areas. At habitat level, species richness did not show a clear increasing trend from more to less urbanized habitats, but rather a homogeneous pattern. At city level, study areas hosted rather heterogeneous species assemblages and biotic homogenization did not seem to have any impact; indeed, only three species could be considered alien. Variation partitioning showed that land snail communities were mostly structured by environmental factors, even when spatial structures independent of measured environmental variables were included: "vegetation cover" and "distance from city centre" were the environmental variables that explained most of the variation in species composition. The lack of strong spatial structure also unexpectedly suggested that transport by humans aids dispersal of organisms with low mobility, which are usually limited by spatial constraints in natural environments. These results provide ecological and conservation implications for other invertebrate groups, suggesting to set priorities in management strategies that include habitat conservation at local scale.

AB  - City ponds have the potential to harbour a rich biodiversity of aquatic insects despite being located in an urban landscape. However, our current knowledge on the correlates of pond biodiversity is limited and even less is known about the factors that influence the ecological uniqueness of urban ponds. The multiple environmental gradients, at different spatial scales, that may affect biodiversity and ecological uniqueness of urban ponds can thus be seen both as an opportunity and as a challenge for a study. In this study, we aimed to fill this gap by focusing on aquatic insect assemblages in 51 ponds in the Swedish city of Stockholm, using a metacommunity perspective. We found that species richness was primarily determined by the density of aquatic insects, water depth and proportion of buildings around the pond. The uniqueness of ponds was estimated as local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD), and it was primarily related to the proportion of arable land and industry around the ponds. With regard to the metacommunity we found two interesting patterns. First, there was a negative relationship between richness and LCBD. Second, biodiversity was spatially independent, suggesting that spatially-patterned dispersal did not structure species richness or LCBD. These last two patterns are important when considering conservation efforts of biodiversity in city ponds. We hence suggest that the conservation of insect biodiversity in urban pond should consider the surroundings of the ponds, and that high-richness ponds are not necessarily those that require most attention because they are not ecologically the most unique.

AB  - Aims: We investigated urban grasslands to: (1) explore current patterns of plant species richness in high-maintenance vs low-maintenance grasslands, (2) investigate environmental drivers of plant species richness and composition, and (3) derive management recommendations and assess the potential for plant species introduction.
   Location: Cities of Cologne (50 degrees 56' N, 6 degrees 57' E) and Munster (51 degrees 57' N, 7 degrees 37'E), North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
   Methods: We performed plant inventories and measured soil and above-ground biomass characteristics in 100 urban grasslands in two cities differing in population size and environmental setting. The data set covered 35 high-maintenance grasslands, which are cut ormulched up to 14 times a year, and 65 low-maintenance grasslands with one to two cuts per year or sheep grazing. We used ANCOVA and DCA to assess drivers of vegetation composition and species richness. The floristic potential and options to restore biodiversity were assessed taking into account maintenance intensity and key abiotic variables of the grasslands using thresholds derived from published literature and our own data.
   Results: High-maintenance urban grasslands harboured significantly lower plant species richness compared to low-maintenance grasslands. However, plant species richness of both grassland types turned out to be lower than that of comparable semi-natural agricultural grasslands. Floristic composition was primarily conditioned by maintenance intensity, but for plant species richness environmental factors such as soil pH, phosphorus availability and city were additionally important. Just eight of the 100 studied urban grasslands were found to be already valuable and species-rich, whereas the vast majority showed relatively low species richness but a high potential for species introduction.
   Conclusions: Apparently, most urban grasslands exhibited quite constrained plant species richness, suffering from high-maintenance intensity but probably also from dispersal and seed limitations. Nevertheless, as the majority of the studied grasslands showed favourable abiotic preconditions for higher plant species richness, restoration techniques using species introduction could be an easy and promising method to support grassland biodiversity in urban areas.

AB  - Connectivity is a vital element in landscape structure because of its importance in species-landscape interactions. Connectivity analysis of green spaces in urban landscapes, especially in high-density cities such as Hong Kong, differs from that of habitats in natural or rural landscapes. Using the human being as the target species, we formulated with GIS techniques a resistance weight, a structural connectivity index and an ecological barrier effect index to assess connectivity of green spaces. Two factors were included in the modeling, namely the resistance of different land uses related to human activities, and the distance between different urban green spaces. We analyzed the relationships between the connectivity index of green spaces and green cover, elevation, building density and population density. Our results indicate that low connectivity usually occurs in both old and new town centers with high building density and low green cover, and in areas occupied by land uses with a high resistance weight. However, urban density may not necessarily have a negative influence on the structural connectivity of green spaces. Green cover also may not necessarily have positive impact on connectivity if the green spaces have a poor spatial pattern. Adding more green stepping stones, large green spaces and green corridors to form greenways and shortening the distance between urban green spaces can offer a spatial-planning strategy to increase the green space connectivity in Hong Kong. The study provides insights to optimize connectivity of green spaces to improve the urban living environment in high-density metropolises.

AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are considered major threats to freshwater biodiversity and to invertebrates in particular. These often irreversible processes may lead to local and regional extinctions of species, most notably of stenotopic taxa. In spite of this, a number of studies have shown that small habitat patches can sustain rich and abundant communities. The present work assesses the relevance of a group of four small man-made (secondary) wildlife ponds to Odonata species diversity and abundance. Results obtained on pond recruiting capacity, species richness, abundance and habitat use by means of exuviae collection and monitoring of adults using a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method indicate the potential suitability of these small aquatic biotopes and the surrounding landscape as habitat providers and stepping stone connectors in the VallSs lowlands (Catalonia, Spain). This region, close to the metropolitan area of Barcelona, has severely degraded natural habitats and high landscape fragmentation due to infrastructure, urban and industrial expansion. A comparison among a greater number of sites (ponds and sections of streams and rivers) distributed across the region showed that adequately managed small waterbodies harbour richer Odonata communities than others that are unmanaged or managed specifically for other types of fauna or uses. Appropriate care of these small biotopes avoids disturbance and keeps them free from vertebrates like fish and waterfowl which, under certain conditions, may have a strong influence on the invertebrate communities because, apart from feeding on larvae, they may have a negative impact on macrophyte development and water quality. While rivers and streams, the only natural aquatic habitats in the area, may be both expensive and technically challenging to restore and manage successfully, the creation and/or restoration of small ponds and short river sections in suitable locations can be a cost-effective method for enhancing freshwater vegetation and invertebrate diversity in this impacted landscape.

AB  - Globally, as trends of urbanisation continue to intensify, there has been increasing concern over the impacts of urban expansion on biodiversity and greater attention towards addressing these impacts. Ecological infrastructure such as urban rivers and their catchments may enhance biodiversity, ecological functioning and ecosystem service delivery within cities. Birds are good indicators of urban habitat quality because their ecology is well-studied and they are habitat selective. This study assesses the ecological value of a small urban river catchment in Cape Town, South Africa, in terms of its effect on the taxonomic and functional diversity of birds. 178 bird counts were carried out at 89 sites and 95 species were recorded. The nine functional groups considered were present in equal proportions in the catchment and in the whole of southern Africa, making the catchment a microcosm of the region's avifauna in terms of functional composition. Using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, we showed that the river was responsible for the occurrence of certain species and functional groups that would not otherwise occur in the suburbs. Nutrient movers, insectivores, scavengers and seed dispersers responded strongly to a gradient of distance from the river and the position on the river. Contrary to the homogenised assemblage that might be expected of an urban area, the catchment contains a taxonomically and functionally diverse bird assemblage. The combination of a river, a heterogeneous urban matrix and an adjacent national park makes this catchment an exemplar of the value of ecological infrastructure for urban biodiversity.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation threatens habitats, biodiversity and other ecosystem services. In tackling this threat, the dynamic processes of social-ecological systems should be recognised and understood. Although network analysis based on graph theory has been recognised as an efficient way of spatially understanding landscape or habitat connectivity, only few studies have offered specific approaches or suggestions for integrating detailed social-ecological values into geographical distributions. As a contribution to bridging this gap, this paper introduces a social-ecological network model for the issue of landscape or habitat fragmentation applied to the case of Stockholm, Sweden. Graph theory was used in combination with sociotope and biotope maps for simple visualisation of network situations in two-dimensional maps. The European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus), European common toad (Bufo bufo) and human beings were selected as indicator species, based on a landscape ecology analysis in Stockholm Municipality in 2009. Slope, land use and human disturbance maps were assessed in order to decide cost values of travelling from node to node. Lease-cost-path accumulation was used to create ideal reference maps of green networks. Three separate maps were then developed for suggesting efficient routes for three indicators in city scale that mainly connect from the Royal National City Park to the other parts of the city. The model in Hjorthagen neighbourhood to highlight two practical paths that link this fragmented community to its neighbouring park areas. Findings make it possible to address two scales of network improvement strategies, namely first for the city-scale green network that connects geographical habitats (nodes) and the regional green wedges of the city, and the second that of neighbourhood links between habitats in detailed layers of green networks. Strategic improvement potentials are presented based on ideal reference maps of green networks correspondingly.

AB  - Cities represent considerable opportunities for forwarding global biodiversity and sustainability goals. We developed key attributes for conserving biodiversity and for ecosystem services that should be included in urban-planning documents and reviewed 135 plans from 40 cities globally. The most common attributes in city plans were goals for habitat conservation, air and water quality, cultural ecosystem services, and ecological connectivity. Few plans included quantitative targets. This lack of measurable targets may render plans unsuccessful for an actionable approach to local biodiversity conservation. Although most cities include both biodiversity and ecosystem services, each city tends to focus on one or the other. Comprehensive planning for biodiversity should include the full range of attributes identified, but few cities do this, and the majority that do are mandated by local, regional, or federal governments to plan specifically for biodiversity conservation. This research provides planning recommendations for protecting urban biodiversity based on ecological knowledge.

In a large-scale study, we explored the value of human-made structures - river levees - as valuable habitats that support large populations of plants and butterflies and affects the spatial turnover of species within an urban landscape. The most significant environmental variables affecting plant and butterfly populations on levees were also examined. The richness of native plant species was about 25% greater on levee transects than on control grassland transects. However, the richness and abundance of butterflies on levees were the same as on grassland sites. Among environmental factors, urban area cover negatively affected the richness of native plant species. Shrub cover decreases the richness and abundance of butterfly species. In addition, high mowing intensity had a negative influence on abundance. Community dissimilarity of plants on levees was affected by spatial variables. Our study is the first to highlight levees as significant habitats for plant and herbivorous insect persistence, and their potential function for plant dispersal. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecosystem services related to landscape connectivity are of paramount importance for biodiversity conservation. However, due to the complexity of urban systems, both landscape connectivity assessment and the analysis of ecosystem services related to landscape connectivity are often inadequately conducted, or even completely lacking, in urban planning. The PANDORA 3.0 model, developed as a QGIS plugin and illustrated here with a study case, is the first free, open-source tool for an integrated evaluation of ecosystem services related to landscape connectivity for biodiversity conservation purposes in urban contexts. The PANDORA 3.0 model plugin aims to be a versatile and innovative tool for assessing Green Infrastructure value in terms of ecological connectivity and biodiversity, useful for the planning of sustainable and resilient landscapes and cities. Its open code availability means that users, scientists, developers and planners involved in urban and landscape ecology will have the opportunity to test the PANDORA 3.0 model in several contexts and even contribute further improvements.

AB  - This article presented the results of a comparative analysis of carabid species compositions (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in urban green areas of the City of Lublin, Eastern Poland. In this study, the occurrence and abundance of ground beetles were analysed according to habitat preference and dispersal ability. A total of 65 carabid species were found in the three green areas. Obviously, the high species richness of ground beetles in the greenery of the Lublin is determined by the mostly undeveloped floodplain of the river Bystrzyca. The species richness of carabids and their relative abundance decrease in the assemblage of green areas under the effect of isolation of green patches and fragmentation of the semi-natural landscape elements in the urban environment. Generalists and open-habitat species significantly prevailed in all green areas. The prevailing of riparian and forest species at floodplain sites of the river Bystrzyca demonstrated the existence of a connection of the carabid assemblage with landscape of river valley. The Saski Park and gully "Rury" are more influenced by urbanization (fragmentation, isolation of green patches) and recreation that is consistent with the significant prevalence of open-habitats species in the carabid beetle assemblage.

AB  - As global urban populations grow, green spaces in cities are under increasing pressure to provide urban habitat and perform important ecosystem services. While public natural areas are typically called upon to provide key habitat in cities, green spaces on private property make up large parts of the urban land base and provide important roles for habitat and ecosystem services that support city function. However voluntary strategies for encouraging ecological stewardship on private property in cities are not well studied. This paper accesses available literature, case studies, municipal and organizational reports, and first-person interviews to describe four emerging strategies for catalyzing voluntary private property stewardship in cities: (a) indirect incentives; (b) market-based certifications; (c) community-based initiatives; and (d) payments for ecosystem services. Each offers the potential to combine the individual actions of multiple urban landowners in order to optimize the landscape-scale benefits of these actions in a strategic way. Components, methods and drivers are identified for each strategy and examples are provided to illustrate their application. The challenge of scale in optimizing ecological benefits in cities, and the potential for institutional partnering on multi-parcel, private property stewardship efforts to generate both site-scale and landscape-scale ecological outcomes is discussed. Voluntary, urban ecological stewardship strategies offer a different set of solutions than regulatory models, and open a new land base that would otherwise be inaccessible for improving ecological function as cities change and grow.

AB  - The cumulative impact of broad scale environmental change includes altered land-cover and fragmentation. Both altered land-cover and fragmentation have a negative effect on species diversity, but the scale they act on may differ because land-cover alters environmental characteristics, whereas fragmentation alters movement among sites.
   We evaluated the scale specific effects of land-cover, fragmentation, and habitat size on alpha and beta diversity (total, turnover, and nestedness).
   Stream fish communities were sampled across five urbanizing watersheds. Generalized mixed linear models were used to test how diversity (alpha and beta) is affected by land-cover, connectivity, and habitat size. Indices of land-cover were calculated from correspondence analyses on land-cover data, fragmentation was estimated with the dendritic connectivity index, and habitat size was calculated as the length of the stream segment (alpha diversity) or the length of the stream network (beta diversity).
   Alpha diversity was most strongly related to land-cover variables associated with urban development and agriculture (negative relationship with urbanization). Whereas, beta diversity was most strongly influenced by habitat size (positive relationship) and fragmentation (positive relationship). Turnover was positively correlated with fragmentation and habitat size, whereas species loss was negatively correlated with habitat size.
   Land-cover has a larger effect on alpha diversity because it alters the environmental conditions at a site, whereas fragmentation has a larger effect on beta diversity because it affects the movement of individuals among sites. Assessing the cumulative impact of environmental change requires a multiscale approach that simultaneously considers alpha and beta diversity.

AB  - Species distributions are a function of an individual's ability to disperse to and colonize habitat patches. These processes depend upon landscape configuration and composition.
   Using Blanchard's cricket frogs (Acris blanchardi), we assessed which land cover types were predictive of (1) presence at three spatial scales (pond-shed, 500 and 2500 m) and (2) genetic structure. We predicted that forested, urban, and road land covers would negatively affect cricket frogs. We also predicted that agricultural, field, and aquatic land covers would positively affect cricket frogs.
   We surveyed for cricket frogs at 28 sites in southwestern Ohio, USA to determine presence across different habitats and analyze genetic structure among populations. For our first objective, we examined if land use (crop, field, forest, and urban habitat) and landscape features (ponds, streams, and roads) explained presence; for our second objective, we assessed whether these land cover types explained genetic distance between populations.
   Land cover did not have a strong influence on cricket frog presence. However, multiple competing models suggested effects of roads, streams, and land use. We found genetic structuring: populations were grouped into five major clusters and nine finer-scale clusters. Highways were predictive of increased genetic distance.
   By combining a focal-patch study with landscape genetics, our study suggests that major roads and waterways are key features affecting species distributions in agricultural landscapes. We demonstrate that cricket frogs may respond to landscape features at larger spatial scales, and that presence and movement may be affected by different environmental factors.

AB  - In a simulation study of genotypes conducted over 100 generations for more than 1600 butterfly's individuals, we evaluate how the increase of anthropogenic fragmentation and reduction of habitat size along urbanisation gradients (from 7 to 59% of impervious land cover) influences genetic diversity and population persistence in butterfly species. We show that in areas characterised by a high urbanisation rate (> 56% impervious land cover), a large decrease of both genetic diversity (loss of 60-80% of initial observed heterozygosity) and population size (loss of 70-90% of individuals) is observed over time. This is confirmed by empirical data available for the mobile butterfly species Pieris rapae in a subpart of the study area. Comparing simulated data for P. rapae with its normal dispersal ability and with a reduced dispersal ability, we also show that a higher dispersal ability can be an advantage to survive in an urban or highly fragmented environment. The results obtained here suggest that it is of high importance to account for population persistence, and confirm that it is crucial to maintain habitat size and connectivity in the context of land-use planning.

AB  - Ecological networks have been considered to be an effective strategy to counter habitat fragmentation, which is occurring in the urbanization context. Researchers and planners have begun to integrate ecological networks in both thematic planning and urban or regional planning for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. In this paper, we integrated the least-cost path model, network structure analysis, and gravity model to construct a regional ecological network of Poyang Lake Eco-economic Region, China. The least-cost model was improved by integrating three resistance factors, including land cover, slope, and human-induced pressure into it, presenting the landscape characteristics comprehensively in corridor simulation. The network structure analysis was employed to assess the proposed ecological network and the gravity model was used to identify the relative significance of network elements. Results indicated that the proposed hierarchical ecological network has good circuitry, complexity, and connectivity. Spatial analysis of prioritized network elements and breaking points revealed the regional connectivity condition, presenting significant reference to decision making in both land-use management and network implementation. Our study demonstrated that the integrated methodology is effective in regional ecological network planning and shows feasibility to be applied to other regions.

AB  - Cities are known to be extraordinarily rich in alien plant species compared to rural environments. This is related to specific attributes of urban areas including the availability of natural resources and habitats (namely geological substrates and land cover), the dispersal pathways and associated propagule pressure due to trade and traffic, and the proximity many urban hubs have to rivers. Here we explored how richness and proportions of alien species introduced after the discovery of the Americas (so-called neophytes), can be explained by environmental covariates along the urbanization gradient from very rural to very urbanized grid cells. We tested whether there is a specific urban effect, either as an interaction effect of urbanized areas that changes these general relationships, or if there is an effect due to specific urban conditions. We found that the environmental covariates explaining richness as well as proportions of neophytes remain largely the same across the rural-urban gradient. There is, however, an effect of urbanized area on neophyte species richness and proportions, which also incorporates strictly urban conditions. Rivers, roads and railroads contribute disproportionately less to the increase of neophyte species diversity in more urbanized areas, which might be due to the already higher number of neophytes in cities. We argue that the conditions determining neophyte richness in cities are not fundamentally different from those in rural environments, but extend on the same environmental axis, i.e. having different positions along the gradient towards the upper end.

AB  - In urban and peri-urban agricultural production systems of Sub-Saharan African cities, diverse and functional complex weed communities may help to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services and therefore indirectly support crop performance. However, effects of agricultural intensification and urbanisation on important weed diversity in the West African region had received so far little attention, although in Burkina Faso and Ghana up to 90 per cent of the population depends on agriculture as a main source of income generation. Hence, our research focussed on the analysis of changes in weed assemblages' structure and function of okra fields that were cultivated under different management intensities and were embedded into the rural, peri-urban and urban environment of two West African cities: Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and Tamale (Ghana). We found a strong relationship between gender and market orientation of okra cultivation. Market orientation of okra farmers was also a major driver in shaping weed species assemblages and led to the development of a distinct weed assemblage in urban areas that even showed higher diversity in weeds' function. Morphological plant traits (life form, seed properties) were most affected by agricultural practises; distribution pattern of ecological traits (seed dispersal mode, pollination vector) seemed to be influenced additionally by environmental characteristics with less entomophilous but more ornithochorous weed species on okra fields within urban areas. Our results revealed that the management of okra was highly variable and that this variation was influenced by fariners' socioeconomic background leading to changes in soil properties. These in turn may alter the functional diversity of beneficial weed communities beyond changes in species richness by potentially harming the provisioning of ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination.

AB  - The role of green belts is not only to provide the recreation for human activities but also to improve environmental quality and to provide refuges for wildlife under intensified urban development. After the new demarcation of administrative areas, the influx and construction of industrial zones and commercial buildings has caused a major change of the original landscape in the Dadu hill area in Taichung City, Taiwan. The aims of this study are to provide recommendations pertaining the design of ecological corridors to improve the connectivity of the remaining green places, and the assessment of the health of habitat for the developed urban area. We compared the biodiversity (birds, mammals, plantation) and carbon flux in three different suburban areas including a campus, a metropolitan park and an undeveloped woodland in regular disturbance by human and fire. According to the results of habitat similarity, the metropolitan park and campus were grouped with the higher diversity of birds, but the woodland had the higher diversity of plantation and mammals. Seasonal change is the main factor which affects the carbon flux and vegetation growth situation, and the disturbance by human activities and canopy and coverage by plantation are the causes of fluctuations. The habitat assessment which integrated the biodiversity and carbon flux provided another angle to evaluate the greenbelt design comprehensively. However, the quantification of the whole ecosystem service value is a further direction of environment management, especially in green place conserving under the urban sprawl.

AB  - Urban vacant lots can vary considerably in their vegetation structure, from dense, shrubby habitats to wooded remnant fragments that may provide habitat for a variety of birds. By identifying which features promote diverse bird communities, we can determine at which scale management practices should focus and the necessary habitat structure and composition features. We surveyed 150 vacant lots throughout Baltimore, Maryland for their bird communities, lot vegetation, and landscape-level forest cover. An ordination of the bird community indicated a response to a gradient of canopy cover and canopy height at the vacant lot. We also found that forest cover within 100 m of the vacant lot was the most important predictor of abundance for five bird species of interest. Species richness was spatially autocorrelated among sites, indicating that bird communities may also be driven by species' dispersal and environmental gradients across the city. Overall, bird communities are responding to habitat features across multiple scales, from the vacant lot vegetation, to landscape-level forest cover, to city-wide dynamics. Thus, we recommend management practices to focus on increasing city-wide forest cover in order to increase species richness, yet with awareness regarding where the lot occurs within the city.

AB  - 1. This review assesses current knowledge about the interplay between landscape and pollinator communities. Our primary aim is to provide an evidence base, identify key gaps in knowledge and highlight initiatives that will help develop and improve strategies for pollinator conservation.
   2. Human-dominated landscapes (such as arable land and urban environments) can have detrimental impacts on pollinator communities but these negative effects can be ameliorated by proximity to semi-natural habitat and habitat corridors. There is also evidence to suggest that increased landscape heterogeneity and landscape configuration can play an important role in the maintenance of diverse pollinator communities.
   3. Landscape characteristics have direct impacts on pollinator communities, but can also influence abundance and richness through interaction with other drivers such as changing climate or increased chemical inputs in land management.
   4. The majority of existing literature focuses on specific hymenopteran groups, but there is a lack of information on the impact of landscape changes on non-bee taxa. Research is also needed on the effectiveness of management interventions for pollinators and multiple year observations are required for both urban and rural initiatives.
   5. Current policies and monitoring schemes could contribute data that will plug gaps in knowledge, thus enabling greater understanding of relationships between landscapes and pollinator populations. This would in turn help design mitigation and adaptation strategies for pollinator conservation.

AB  - In the light of ongoing global urbanization and the high pace of resource consumption, there is an urgent need to foster compact cities. Currently, however, we lack integrative guidelines on how to manage trade-offs between urban densification and the provision of green space. Against this background, this study applies the concepts of green infrastructure and ecosystem services to develop a guideline for landscape planning to foster compact and green cities. The guideline was tested on the example of the landscape plan of Dresden (Germany), which foresees a compact city in a green network. Results show that the concepts of ecosystems services and green infrastructure can support urban practitioners in structuring the complex interrelations between landscape planning and compact and green cities. The developed guideline provides an integrative framework for modular landscape planning that: (1) reflects the spatial heterogeneity and properties of urban ecosystems and landscapes; and (2) considers cities as integrated socio-ecological systems. The case study indicates that a more comprehensive perspective of cities and their ecosystem is required, one that connects green with grey infrastructure. Further research should focus on how the green infrastructure concept can be refined to incorporate strategic planning for compact cities.

AB  - Pollinators such as bees and hoverflies are essential components of an urban ecosystem, supporting and contributing to the biodiversity, functioning, resilience and visual amenity of green infrastructure. Their urban habitats also deliver health and well-being benefits to society, by providing important opportunities for accessing nature nearby to the homes of a growing majority of people living in towns and cities. However, many pollinator species are in decline, and the loss, degradation and fragmentation of natural habitats are some of the key drivers of this change. Urban planners and other practitioners need evidence to carefully prioritise where they focus their resources to provide and maintain a high quality, multifunctional green infrastructure network that supports pollinators and people. We provide a modelling framework to inform green infrastructure planning as a nature based solution with social and ecological benefits. We show how habitat suitability models (I-ISM) incorporating remote sensed vegetation data can provide important information on the influence of urban landcover composition and spatial configuration on species distributions across cities. Using Edinburgh, Scotland, as a case study city, we demonstrate this approach for bumble bees and hoverflies, providing high resolution predictive maps that identify pollinator habitat hotspots and pinch points across the city. By combining this spatial HSM output with health deprivation data, we highlight 'win-win' opportunity areas in most need of improved green infrastructure to support pollinator habitat quality and connectivity, as well as societal health and well-being. In addition, in collaboration with municipal planners, local stakeholders, and partners from a local greenspace learning alliance, we identified opportunities for citizen engagement activities to encourage interest in wildlife gardening as part of a 'pollinator pledge'. We conclude that this quantitative, spatially explicit and transferable approach provides a useful decision-making tool for targeting nature-based solutions to improve biodiversity and increase environmental stewardship, with the aim of providing a more attractive city to live, work and invest in.

AB  - The functionality of forest patches and networks as green infrastructure may be affected negatively both by expanding road networks and forestry intensification. We assessed the effects of (1) the current and planned road infrastructure, and (2) forest loss and gain, on the remaining large forest landscape massifs as green infrastructure at the EU's eastern border region in post -socialistic transition. First, habitat patch and network functionality in 1996-98 was assessed using habitat suitability index modelling. Second, we made expert interviews about road development with planners in 10 administrative regions in Poland, Belarus and Ukraine. Third, forest loss and gain inside the forest massifs, and gain outside them during the period 2001-14 were measured. This EU cross -border region hosts four remaining forest massifs as regional green infrastructure hotspots. While Poland's road network is developing fast in terms of new freeways, city bypasses and upgrades of road quality, in Belarus and Ukraine the focus is on maintenance of existing roads, and no new corridors. We conclude that economic support from the EU, and thus rapid development of roads in Poland, is likely to reduce the permeability for wildlife of the urban and agricultural matrix around existing forest massifs. However, the four identified forest massifs themselves, forming the forest landscape green infrastructure at the EU's east border, were little affected by road development plans. In contrast, forest loss inside massifs was high, especially in Ukraine. Only in Poland forest loss was balanced by gain. Forest gain outside forest massifs was low. To conclude, pro-ctive and collaborative spatial planning across different sectors and countries is needed to secure functional forest green infrastructure as base for biodiversity conservation and human well-being.

AB  - Urban small water bodies, such as ponds, are essential elements of human socio-economic landscapes. Ponds also provide important habitats for species that would otherwise not survive in the urban environment. Knowledge on the biodiversity of urban ponds and the relationship between their ecological value and factors linked to urbanization and socio-economic status is crucial for decisions on where and how to establish and manage ponds in cities to deliver maximum biodiversity benefits. Our study investigates if the pattern of urban-pond biodiversity can be related to different socio-economic factors, such as level of wealth, education or percentage of buildings of different types. Because of lack of previous studies investigating that, our study is of exploratory character and many different variables are used. We found that the biodiversity of aquatic insects was significantly negatively associated with urbanisation variables such as amount of buildings and number of residents living around ponds. This relationship did not differ depending on the spatial scale of our investigation. In contrast, we did not find a significant relationship with variables representing socio-economic status, such as education level and wealth of people. This latter result suggests that the socio-economic status of residents does not lead to any particular effect in terms of the management and function of ponds that would affect biodiversity. However, there is a need for a finer-scale investigation of the different potential mechanism in which residents in areas with differing socio-economic status could indirectly influence ponds.

AB  - Urban growth is considered to be a major driver of environmental change. Urbanisation can affect urban biodiversity in differentways. So far, most studies focused on the impact of urbanisation on single taxa in one habitat type. In this study, we used data of species inventories and GIS-based landscape elements to examine the effects of habitat size and landscape composition on the species diversity of three taxonomic groups (vascular plants, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera) in meadows and ruderal sites in the urban region of Basel, Switzerland. We also related the responses of three species traits (body size, dispersal ability and food specialisation) to habitat size in Orthoptera and Lepidoptera. We found that species of the different taxonomic groups differed in their response to habitat size and landscape composition both in meadows and ruderal sites depending on the traits examined. The species richness of Orthoptera and Lepidoptera was positively related to meadow size but not to the size of ruderal sites, while the opposite was true for plants. For Lepidoptera in ruderal sites, the percentage cover of ruderal area in the closer surroundings was a better predictor of species richness than habitat size per se. To sustain high levels of urban biodiversity, we recommend that urban planners develop adequate management strategies to satisfy the different requirements of various taxonomic groups and to increase the quality of green sites surrounding the target habitat.

AB  - Freshwater organisms generally exhibit strong genetic structuring. Although understanding the level and spatial distribution of genetic diversity is crucial for conservation management planning, such information has received little attention until recently in highly developed cities where local extinction attributed to habitat destruction and urbanisation is intense. We compared the genetic divergence in mitochondrial COI of the freshwater shrimp Caridina cantonensis collected from 32 sites in Hong Kong, to determine the connectivity among populations and the levels of genetic diversity of the shrimp. We found that shrimp from different streams are genetically highly differentiated and each stream always has its own unique haplotype groups, even though some of the streams are separated only by a few kilometres, indicating very limited gene flow across streams. Moreover, genetic diversity within each stream is very low, usually with a single haplotype dominating the entire population, and genetic differentiation was observed among tributaries from the same drainage. The high genetic diversity of these species over short distances has significant conservation implications because a substantial amount of biodiversity may have already been lost as a result of past development. Careful conservation planning is essential for future development in Hong Kong and other cities.

AB  - Context Increasing human populations in urban areas pose a threat to species' persistence through habitat loss and fragmentation. It is therefore essential that we develop methods to investigate critical habitat loss thresholds and least detrimental landscape configurations.
   Objectives We develop a framework to assess how the pattern of habitat loss impacts the ecological and social characteristics of a landscape and how this varies depending on the species and criteria by which it is judged.
   Methods We use a scenario-based approach to test six propositions in which habitat is lost preferentially based on patch characteristics. We use eight bird and two amphibian species as indicator species. To compare scenarios, we present a method combining the output from a metapopulation model with measures of social impacts of land-cover change in a multiple criteria decision analysis. We also determine whether a habitat loss threshold exists, below which small loss of habitat can lead to large loss of species' occupancy.
   Results We found that, of the scenarios presented, preferentially losing common habitats and smaller patches was least detrimental for both ecological and social factors. Threshold effects were found for all but the generalist bird species.
   Conclusions We have outlined a workflow which allows for transparent, repeatable comparison between landscapes. This workflow can be used to compare urban landscape plans, or to develop general understanding of the impacts of different forms of habitat loss. Reassuringly, the recommendations based on the scenarios presented are in keeping with received conservation wisdom: to prioritise larger and/or rarer patches.

AB  - Riparian areas are often the only green areas left in urban and suburban landscapes, providing opportunities for conservation and connectivity of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. While city planners and land managers often tout the importance of riparian networks for these uses, it is not well established if urban riparian plant communities are actually functioning as connected assemblages. Furthermore, urban riparian zones are well known to be highly invaded by non-native plant species and may be functioning to increase the spread of non-native species across the landscape. Here we examine connectivity of plant assemblages in riparian networks within an extensively urbanized landscape. We sampled riparian plant communities at 13 sites along three second-order streams of the Rahway River watershed, New Jersey. We also characterized propagule dispersal at each site by sampling litter packs on the river banks five times between March-October 2011 and identifying germinants from litter packs after cold stratification. Species turnover of both riparian and litter vegetation was more strongly associated with flow distance, particularly for native species, indicating that riverine systems are important for promoting connectivity of native plant assemblages in urban landscapes. However, non-native germinants significantly dominated propagule dispersal along the stream reaches, particularly early in the growing season, suggesting spread utilizing the river system and preemption may be an important mechanism for invasion success in this system. Our data show that management of invasive species should be planned and implemented at the watershed scale to reduce spread via the river system.

AB  - Roads provide humans with a means of mobility between destinations, be it for transportation of goods and services or as a means of connecting with others. However, roads are also known to contribute toward a number of deleterious landscape processes, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, pollution (e.g., chemical, noise and light) and animal mortality. Few studies however have investigated their effects on avifauna. We investigated the influence of road width on movements of nearby bird assemblages in Australia by comparing crossing counts of four species guilds and sizes over roads of varying widths in Southern Brisbane. In addition, we also sought to determine the association of seasonality with species crossing richness and abundance. Species guild affiliations were based on definitions from previous literature: small forest dependent, large forest dependent, honeyeater, and urban tolerant; whereas body size classifications were arbitrarily defined: small (< 20 cm), medium (20-29 cm), and large (> 30 cm). Road sites were selected based on their vegetation likeness, both within and between sites, and this was assessed using the Specht classification system. We detected strong, negative correlations between road width and forest species richness, crossing species richness and species crossing abundance. In particular, analysis of species guild classifications revealed species richness and crossing likelihoods of the small forest dependent guild to be consistently lower than those of large forest dependent, honeyeater and urban tolerant guilds. Analysis of species by body size classification yielded similar outcomes: small birds were consistently less likely to be present nearby and cross over roads of all widths compared to medium and large birds. We believe gap permeability, particularly changes in vegetation structure and complexity that may restrict a species ability to access to the gap, as well as competition and predation, play an important role in determining species presence and crossing likelihood. Dense vegetation is known to benefit smaller species due to the provision of foraging resources and shelter from larger, more aggressive species.

AB  - Introduction: In the Pacific Northwest of North America, research addressing lentic-breeding amphibian population vulnerability has emphasized aquatic habitats, frequently neglecting terrestrial habitats. Consequently, wetland protection and restoration often fails to preserve or restore adjacent uplands required by lentic-breeding amphibians. Inattention to the juxtaposition and connectivity of uplands to wetlands could locally extirpate lentic-breeding amphibians. The objective of this research is to identify the relative importance of juxtaposed terrestrial and aquatic habitats in a lentic-breeding amphibian, the northern red-legged frog (Rana aurora), by evaluating the relationship between its occurrence and abundance with its aquatic and terrestrial habitats. To accomplish this, egg mass counts were used to quantify R. aurora populations in 30 stillwater habitats across an urbanization gradient. Using a Geographic Information System, seven descriptors of aquatic and surrounding terrestrial habitats were measured to evaluate their relationships to R. aurora occurrence and abundance.
   Results: Rana aurora occurrence and breeding abundance both reflect the forested area around wetland breeding sites and forest connectivity to those sites. Rana aurora breeding abundance also strongly reflects the percent of forested perimeter around wetland breeding sites. The forest habitat most important for R. aurora breeding abundance seems to be > 200 m from the breeding wetlands. The American bullfrog presence and the two aquatic parameters measured, wetland area and vegetated area, were unrelated to R. aurora occurrence and breeding abundance.
   Conclusions: Area and connectivity of juxtaposed forested terrestrial habitat may represent a basic control on R. aurora presence and population size. Urban development policies should consider preservation and restoration of upland forest habitats beyond current fixed-width buffers and wetland habitat area at landscape scales.

AB  - The rates of urbanization and increase in urban sprawl that have occurred in China over the past thirty years have been unprecedented. This article presents a new city-scale dasymetric modelling approach that incorporates historical census data for 28 cities in the Pearl River Delta area of southern China. It combines Landsat imagery (from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015) with a 'limiting variable' estimation algorithm to generate a gridded estimate of population density. These gridded population patches are organized as a city-network to reveal the influence of urban agglomeration on population spreading processes. We then combine population patches and graph-based connectivity metrics to describe the spatial-temporal evolution of each city within the urban agglomeration. Our population disaggregation results yield accuracy improvements of 40%-60% over three traditional population disaggregation methods, to reflect the population distribution characteristics more explicitly and in greater detail. The probability of connectivity metrics from dasymetric population maps in Pearl River Delta (1) outline the role of urban agglomeration in population spread, (2) simulate the evolution of 'polycentric' urban agglomeration, and (3) outline the individual components of the polycentric megaregion. Our outlined approach is a transferable and an improved means of producing city-scale dasymetric population maps. Our case study provides practical guidance on wide applications of the medium resolution remote sensing data in delineating, measuring, and quantifying the evolution of urban agglomeration across different jurisdictional boundaries and time periods.

AB  - A large number of green infrastructure (GI) projects have recently been proposed, planned and implemented in European cities following the adoption of the GI strategy by the EU Commission in 2013. Although this policy tool is closely related to biodiversity conservation targets, some doubts have arisen as regards the ability of current urban GI to provide beneficial effects not only for human societies but also for the ecological systems that host them. The aim of this work is to review the features that should be considered critical when searching for solutions that simultaneously support biodiversity and guarantee the provision of ecosystem services (ES) in urban areas. Starting from a case study in the metropolitan area of Rome, we highlight the role of urban trees and forests as proxies for overall biodiversity and as main ecosystem service providers. We look beyond the individual functional features of plant species and vegetation communities to promote the biogeographic representativity, ecological coherence and landscape connectivity of new or restored GI elements.

AB  - The city is a complex system that evolves through its inherent social and economic interactions. Mediating the movements of people and resources, urban street networks offer a spatial footprint of these activities. Of particular interest is the interplay between street structure and its functional usage. Here, we study the shape of 472,040 spatiotemporally optimized travel routes in the 92 most populated cities in the world, finding that their collective morphology exhibits a directional bias influenced by the attractive (or repulsive) forces resulting from congestion, accessibility, and travel demand. To capture this, we develop a simple geometric measure, inness, that maps this force field. In particular, cities with common inness patterns cluster together in groups that are correlated with their putative stage of urban development as measured by a series of socio-economic and infra-structural indicators, suggesting a strong connection between urban development, increasing physical connectivity, and diversity of road hierarchies.

AB  - A fundamental problem in landscape ecology is understanding the isolating effects of different patterns of habitat loss and fragmentation on species and ecosystems. In the 21st century, urban development and sea level rise (SLR) are predicted to affect large areas of the United States, further exacerbating already fragmented and densely populated landscapes. Increasing or restoring habitat connectivity may ameliorate these effects, but the broad-reaching efforts required to assess current and future changes to connectivity, especially in low-lying areas vulnerable to SLR, are still under development. To address these issues, we strategically identified a small group of regionally significant species that represent a range of characteristics and ecological requirements useful for examining landscape connectivity. We used expert opinion to parameterize divergent species responses (i.e. resistance) to landscape features and to assess permeability of the landscape. From this, we estimated contemporary and future low-resistance habitat cores in the year 2100. We modeled six species for habitat connectivity using a multiscaled circuit theory-based approach and analysed them collectively to indicate landscape connectivity across the Southeastern United States. Using this approach, we were able to forecast changing connectivity patterns based on predicted urbanization and SLR. Our results suggest that there will be a 41% reduction in the number of low-resistance cores and a 35% decrease in mean area of remaining cores. In addition, current areas of high landscape connectivity will become more fragmented as future connectivity values indicate a more homogenized landscape structure. In the future landscape, pathways for connectivity are likely to move inland and northward as sea level and urbanization pressures increase. Our results may inform more comprehensive planning initiatives regionally or nationally, while simultaneously providing a multiscaled context for localized planning efforts.

AB  - Currently, large amount of habitats of wildlife have been displaced by artificial structures because of urban expansion. As a result, smaller patches of habitat have been lost, larger patches have become fragmented, and some of the habitats become lonely islands which will have weaker and weaker contact with outside. Therefore, the optimization of landscape structure will benefit more for biodiversity conservation by analyzing the best landscape layout as the patches have been rapidly lost. In this article, we have analyzed and reclassified the spatial pattern of the value of biodiversity based on the possibility of connectivity method which enabled the possibility of the identification of key patches. In the results, we have found that biodiversity value was not evenly distributed with patch area because of the difference of connectivity. Key patches of Beijing have been classified into three categories: (1) patches with larger area; (2) satellite patches around large patches; (3) stepping-stone patches with high connectivity.

AB  - Globally, urbanization threatens similar to 950 amphibian species with extinction. Yet a lack of knowledge on the factors influencing common and infrequently encountered species in landscapes that are under increasing pressure from urban development is limiting effective conservation. We examined the relative importance of aquatic variables (pond) and terrestrial variables (at three spatial scales: 10 m, 100 m and 1 km), for commonly and infrequently encountered frogs in an urbanizing forested landscape in southeastern Australia. Species richness and the occurrence of four common species were influenced by the aquatic environment (water body size, aquatic vegetation). Species richness also decreased with increasing urbanization within 1 km. This trend was driven by a strong decrease in richness of infrequently encountered species with increasing road length within 1 km from breeding ponds. Richness of infrequently encountered species also decreased with a reduction in forest cover within 10m to 1 km from breeding ponds. Our findings suggest that frog conservation in urbanizing landscapes requires a mix of strategies across different spatial scales. Maintaining or re-establishing common frogs in urbanizing forested landscapes is likely to be achieved by providing ponds with suitable habitat. However, to conserve several frog species that are sensitive to forest loss and urbanization, breeding habitats need to be maintained within a network of large forest reserves. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Maintaining ecosystem continuity has become a central element in spatial planning policies. Several authors acknowledge the environmental, also known as landscape, fragmentation due to human action as one of the main causes which have negative effects on biodiversity. The phenomenon consists of the transformation of larger patches of habitat in smaller ones, or fragments, which tend to be more isolated than in the original condition. It is extremely evident in urban areas, including settlements and various transport and mobility infrastructures, whose main ecological effects include loss of habitat, increased mortality of plants, and isolation of animal and vegetal species. In this paper, we assess landscape fragmentation dynamics of six landscape units belonging to two European regions, i.e. Sardinia in Italy (from 2003 to 2008), and Andalusia in Spain (from 2005 to 2009). We developed on three indices: the Infrastructural Fragmentation Index (IFI), the Urban Fragmentation Index (UFI), and the Connectivity Index (CI). We found that coastal areas generally suffer from an higher pressure due to the demand of longer or faster transport infrastructures and new settlements and less fragmented areas tend to show the most relevant dynamics in a sort of convergent pattern. Even though landscape fragmentation and connectivity are intuitively complementary phenomena, in this paper we did not found any statistical evidence of this associative property.

AB  - Urban rights-of-way (ROWs) offer large underused tracts of land that could be managed for plants and butterflies of threatened ecosystems like tall-grass prairies. However, built-up unvegetated urban lands might serve as barriers preventing butterflies and resource plants from settling along ROWs. Further, negative edge effects from surrounding urban lands or frequent mowing and spraying associated with urbanization may prevent butterflies from benefiting from urban ROWs as habitats. However, because ROWs often run for kilometres, they might facilitate movement from other, similar habitats by which they run close. To determine if surrounding built-up lands had a greater effect on butterflies than did the abundance of resource plants along ROWs, we surveyed butterflies and resource plants along transects in 48 transmission lines in or near Winnipeg, Manitoba, 2007-2009. In general, butterfly richness and abundance were better predicted by available resources than by built-up urban lands surrounding ROWs. Butterfly species richness per visit increased by 85% with increases from 10 plant species per site to 80 species of plants per site, while abundance per species per visit increased by 100% with increases from negligible forb cover to 5% forb cover, and by 112% with increases in vegetation height-density from 5 cm to 40 cm high. If appropriate resource plants are reintroduced and managed for along urban ROWs, densities of most butterfly species will increase along these lines despite surrounding built-up urban lands. Thus, urban ROWs present an opportunity for restoring habitats for prairie butterflies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Storm surge protection systems have proven effective in protecting populations in developed areas and can allow for development in otherwise potentially flood-prone areas. Resultant intensification of land conversion can result in large scale habitat fragmentation. Simultaneously, urbanized areas worldwide are increasingly accumulating large amounts of vacant land, creating an unprecedented opportunity to improve green space networks and natural systems. This article describes creation of a regional growth framework that balances the need to repurpose vacant lots with the provision of ecosystem services. The analysis seeks to maximize the structural connectivity of the landscape by using high ecological potential of vacant lands as a device for linking existing habitat patches, wildlife conservation areas, wet-lands, riparian corridors, and small-scale green spaces. The research uses raster-based suitability models generated in ArcGIS to determine development potential and ecological values of vacant land parcels. Vacant lands having low development potential and high ecological value are linked spatially to create ecological corridors among patch areas using a least cost path connectivity model generated with Linkage Mapper software. Results indicate that vacant land can connect existing ecological patch and core areas with relatively minimal negative impact on development potential while simultaneously enhancing provision of ecological services. The approach provides a model for an ecologically based solution for repurposing vacant urban land.

AB  - Questions: Urban ecosystems present an opportunity to study ecological communities in the context of unprecedented environmental change. In the face of urban land conversion, ecologists observe new patterns of species composition, dominance, behaviour and dispersal. We propose a hypothetical socioeconomic template that describes a gradient in human investment in community composition to aid in organizing the human role in shaping urban biodiversity. We asked: (1) what is the relative magnitude of taxonomic and functional turnover of urban woody plant communities across different land-use types; and (2) do land uses exhibiting higher intensity of human management of biodiversity support higher turnover over those with less human influence?
   Location: Baltimore, MD, USA (39 degrees 17' N, 76 degrees 38' W).
   Methods: We examined patterns in woody plant biodiversity across 209 plots of different urban land uses. Six land-use types were arranged along a gradient in the intensity through which humans are hypothesized to manage species composition at the plot scale. We calculated local, or alpha-diversity, and compositional turnover, or beta-diversity, of taxonomic and functional diversity across plots within each land-use type. We compared the magnitude of these biodiversity measures between land uses to test our conceptual template for how the intensity of human management can predict urban woody plant biodiversity.
   Results: We observed high taxonomic turnover in residential and commercial plots compared with vacant or open space land-use areas. This was associated with a weaker, but similar, pattern in functional diversity. This was associated with low total abundance in residential and commercial plots. Furthermore, the number of unique species was extremely high in the same land-use types.
   Conclusions: Our observations help explain why turnover can be high in heavily managed plots relative to vacant land. In patches without heavy human management, we found low levels of turnover. This highlights the importance of assessing diversity both locally and at the level of turnover between patches. Management and policy can benefit from the perspective embodied in the conceptual approach tested here.

AB  - Connection of similar landscape patches with ecological corridors supports habitat quality of these patches, increases urban ecological quality, and constitutes an important living and expansion area for wild life. Furthermore, habitat connectivity provided by urban green areas is supporting biodiversity in urban areas.
   In this study, possible ecological connections between landscape patches, which were achieved by using Expert classification technique and modeled with probabilistic connection index. Firstly, the reflection responses of plants to various bands are used as data in hypotheses. One of the important features of this method is being able to use more than one image at the same time in the formation of the hypothesis. For this reason, before starting the application of the Expert classification, the base images are prepared. In addition to the main image, the hypothesis conditions were also created for each class with the NDVI image which is commonly used in the vegetation researches. Besides, the results of the previously conducted supervised classification were taken into account. We applied this classification method by using the raster imagery with user-defined variables. Hereupon, to provide ecological connections of the tree cover which was achieved from the classification, we used Probabilistic Connection (PC) index. The probabilistic connection model which is used for landscape planning and conservation studies via detecting and prioritization critical areas for ecological connection characterizes the possibility of direct connection between habitats. As a result we obtained over % 90 total accuracy in accuracy assessment analysis. We provided ecological connections with PC index and we created inter-connected green spaces system. Thus, we offered and implicated green infrastructure system model takes place in the agenda of recent years.

AB  - Compact urbanization is the main strategy for sustainable urban development. However, it is yet unclear whether compact urban forms are ecologically more favourable than dispersed ones. In this paper, we studied the effects of urban sprawl on the riparian vegetation condition in one of the most degraded watersheds in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, Argentina. We conducted random sampling of the riparian vegetation at sites along streams in the basin and assessed urban indicators at the reach and sub-watershed scales for each of those sites in a geographic information system: urban area, impervious surface, population density and two landscape metrics of dispersion. The indicators assessed explained a high proportion of the variability of the vegetation response variables, thereby confirming the importance of urban sprawl pressure in shaping riparian communities in fluvial ecosystems. Dispersed urbanization had more positive than negative effects on the vegetation in the study area. Riverbanks associated with dispersed urbanization had more plant species, including exotics, when urban sprawl was assessed at the local scale. At the sub-watershed scale, dispersed urbanized areas were richer in native plants and most of the functional groups, and poorer in exotic species. The model of the compact city, including bio-corridors along watercourses, has been proposed for the Buenos Aires conurbation process for the next decades. Our results showed that the quality of existing river corridors across the compact matrix was not desirable and best practices for redesigning a more sustainable landscape structure are necessary, including the restoration of habitats for wetland species.

AB  - Accurately quantifying the variation of urban green space is the prerequisite for fully understanding its ecosystem services. However, knowledge about the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban green space is still insufficient due to multiple challenges that remain in mapping green spaces within heterogeneous urban environments. This paper uses the city of Hangzhou to demonstrate an analysis methodology that integrates sub-pixel mapping technology and landscape analysis to fully investigate the spatiotemporal pattern and variation of hierarchical urban green space patches. Firstly, multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis was applied to time series Landsat data to derive green space coverage at the sub-pixel level. Landscape metric analysis was then employed to characterize the variation pattern of urban green space patches. Results indicate that Hangzhou has experienced a significant loss of urban greenness, producing amore fragmented and isolated vegetation landscape. Additionally, a remarkable amelioration of urban greenness occurred in the city core from 2002 to 2013, characterized by the significant increase of small-sized green space patches. The green space network has been formed as a consequence of new urban greening strategies in Hangzhou. These strategies have greatly fragmented the built-up areas and enriched the diversity of the urban landscape. Gradient analysis further revealed a distinct pattern of urban green space landscape variation in the process of urbanization. By integrating both sub-pixel mapping technology and landscape analysis, our approach revealed the subtle variation of urban green space patches which are otherwise easy to overlook. Findings from this study will help us to refine our understanding of the evolution of heterogeneous urban environments.

AB  - Inclusion of specific rural architectural and planning forms in the urban structure of Moscow is analysed. As a theoretical background, theories of Garden-Cities (Howard, 1902), Rural-urban continuum (Sorokin, Zimmerman, 1929), Slow city (Mayer, Knox, 2009) are considered. Inclusion of rural architectural and planning forms is analysed for different structural elements of Moscow's urban environment-public spaces, industrial areas, residential areas, street and road network. Authors argue that once included into the structure of the city, rural planning and architectural forms do not disappear, but after the termination of the implementation of their parent species and ways of life, which are really related to agriculture and other " non-urban" activities, they are transformed for integration into urban life and the environment, contributing to an increase in their diversity. This pattern can be traced consistently, at least, from the XVIII century.

AB  - We investigated the relationships between vegetation area, edge length, and mammals in the urban woods of Daejeon Metropolitan City, South Korea. The vegetation patches included in this study varied from 2.1 to 501.0 ha in size. Surveys were conducted monthly between February and October 2015, with a survey route measuring 1km in length and 10 m width established in each forest patch. Field signs of 14 species of mammals were recorded in the 33 chosen forest patches over the course of the study period, and the number of species in each patch varied from 2 to 11. Mammal species richness was positively correlated with vegetation area, and field sign frequency was positively correlated with vegetation area and negatively correlated with edge length. The field sign frequencies of large moles Mogera robusta, Siberian chipmunks Tamias sibiricus, leopard cats Prionailurus bengalensis, Korean hares Lepus coreanus, water deer Hydropotes inermis, and wild boars Sus scrofa were positively correlated with vegetation area. Moreover, that of large moles, leopard cats, Korean hares, and water deer were negatively correlated with edge length. Remnant vegetation area and edge length are the primary determinants of mammal species richness and field sign frequency in urban woods, highlighting the importance of vegetation patch size for mammal conservation in fragmented urban landscapes.

AB  - The Big East Lake water network (BELWN), located in Wuhan city, China, is mainly composed of six lakes and isolated from the Yangtze river. At the background of restoring the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes, four season investigations were conducted during 2014-2015 to study the spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of macroinvertebrate communities, explore their relationships with environmental factors, and forecast the change trends in assemblages in a long period after restoration measures. A total of 40 species were recorded, oligochaetes and chironomids dominated the communities. Season variation in density and biomass were distinct and the community differences in lakes related to the degrees of organic pollution. In comparison with the historical data, the species richness of mollusks in Donghu lake sharply decreased due to water pollution and the loss of diverse habitat. Concerning on the whole BELWN, the whole taxa recorded in our study was slightly fewer than the previous study. A new recorded species polychaete Nephtys sp. was first collected with an important ecological interest. As an urban lake system dominated by eutrophication, the water nutrients significantly affected the distribution of macroinvertebrates. According to the GAM models, the dominant species responded to environmental gradients with different response curves. After restoring the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes, the macroinvertebrate communities would change and the biodiversity would steadily increase with time. Additionally, the new recorded species Nephtys sp. would spread into the whole BELWN in the foresee future.

AB  - Introduction: Urbanization has altered the natural landscape in the world. The urban expansion has been occurring more rapidly than ever before in China.
   Objective: To analyze the urban forest landscape pattern and ecological network structure in the Pudong district in Shanghai, China.
   Materials and methods: The study area covers 553 km(2), including 253 km(2) of built-up area. Using Landsat 7 2008TM, 2007 Spot Image, Google Earth and city maps, the structural characteristics were analyzed. The landscape patterns of the urban forest and green network structure were interpreted using ArcGIS Software.
   Results and discussion: The area of the urban forest patches (>900 m(2)) and the built-up area in the district were 5.15 % and 5.78 % respectively. The area of the green corridor network was 80.27 km(2) while the density was 1.99 km.km(-2). The linkage of the green network was 1.30, circuitry was 0.19 and connectivity 0.47. The tree canopy coverage was 7.02 % in the entire study area, and 10.27 % in the built-up area. The tree canopy coverage can reach to 8.68 % similar to 9.79 % in the total study area, and 11.49 % similar to 12.3 % in the built-up area.
   Conclusion: The green network has been constructed, but it was not well designed, so it is necessary to improve its structure. The existing trees cannot modify the forest environment for all the urban forest. Planting more trees is feasible to increase the tree canopy coverage.

AB  - Efforts to retain ecological connectivity have become a conservation priority to permit animal movements within home ranges, allow dispersal between populations and provide opportunities for animals to respond to climate change. We used expert-opinion and empirically derived models to investigate landscape connectivity at two spatial scales among bobcats Lynx rufus in New Hampshire, USA. Paths of marked bobcats were compared to random movements in the context of program CIRCUITSCAPE. At the local scale (within home ranges), the empirical model (based on observations and telemetry locations) performed better than the expert-opinion model. At the regional scale (state of New Hampshire), both models identified urban development as a potential barrier; however, the models differed in predicting how specific natural features (e.g. mountains and large water bodies) and some roads affected bobcat movements. When compared with bobcat population structure based on genetic information, the expert-opinion model overestimated the influence of roads. Alternatively, the empirical model overestimated the influence of snow. Our findings indicate that the empirically based resistance model was better at describing landscape-scale effects, whereas the expert-opinion model provided a good understanding of gene flow at a regional scale. As such, both models may be considered complementary. Bobcats were sensitive to disruptions imposed by habitat fragmentation and thus may be a suitable focal species for evaluating the consequences of land-use changes on the regional suite of mesocarnivores.

AB  - An important set of ecosystem services (ESs) delivered by green infrastructure (GI) is based on habitats and species protection and enhancement, that is on maintaining and improving biodiversity. Indeed, the second objective of the European Biodiversity Strategy recommends that ecosystems and their services are maintained and enhanced by establishing GI and restoring at least a 15% of the ecosystems which show up significant decay. From this perspective, habitat fragmentation can be considered one the most outstanding causes of a decreasing attitude of GI towards the delivery of habitat-based ESs, since it weakens the capacity to deliver such services by undermining the networking potential of habitats. In this study, we propose a study concerning the Metropolitan City of Cagliari which includes seventeen municipalities into a unique system of metropolitan government. Sixteen Natura 2000 sites (N2Ss) are located in the City, which amount to about 30% of the metropolitan area. We propose a methodological approach to identify ecological corridors (ECs) between N2Ss, based on the prioritization of functional land patches related to their suitability to deliver ESs concerning biodiversity maintenance and enhancement. The methodology consists of two steps: i. identifying the most suitable patches to be included in ECs on the basis of their accessibility, that is, on their negative attitude towards contributing to landscape fragmentation; ii. assessing, through a discrete-choice-model, the ECs identified through point i in terms of their suitability to be included in a metropolitan GI, starting from the territorial taxonomy based on biodiversity characteristics connected to N2Ss, habitat suitability, and recreational and landscape potentials.

AB  - Background: Urbanisation filters species in communities depending on their adaptability to conditions in built-up areas, especially in semi-natural habitats. Roadside vegetation is widespread along urban-rural gradients and is therefore a good place to study landscape-scale factors influencing plant community composition.
   Aim: Our study aimed to assess how plant species distributions vary between urban and rural landscape contexts and to identify biological traits favoured in urban areas.
   Methods: Presence/absence data for 63 indigenous common species were collected in 296 road verge patches distributed along the urban-rural gradient in three French cities. We investigated the effects of landscape composition on species assemblages and related individual species responses to urbanisation to functional traits associated with dispersal and persistence capacity.
   Results: Many grassland species were negatively affected by increasing proportion of built-up areas in the landscape. Insect-pollination and high seed production appeared to be key traits favoured in grassland communities in urban areas, whereas dispersal modes were less related to plant distribution.
   Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that urban filters affect common species of widespread, managed road verges. Better knowledge of the flora of these herbaceous roadsides may contribute to the conservation of common biodiversity within other grassland habitats found in urban areas.

AB  - Understanding the environmental factors driving species-genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs) is critical for designing appropriate conservation and management strategies to protect biodiversity. Yet, few studies have explored the impact of changing land use patterns on SGDCs specifically in aquatic communities. This study examined patterns of genetic diversity in roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) together with fish species composition across 19 locations in a large river catchment, spanning a gradient in land use. Our findings show significant correlations between some, but not all, species and genetic diversity end points. For example, genetic and species differentiation showed a weak but significant linear relationship across the Thames catchment, but additional diversity measures such as allelic richness and fish population abundance did not. Further examination of patterns in species and genetic diversity indicated that land use intensification has a modest effect on fish diversity compared to the combined influence of geographical isolation and land use intensification. These results indicate that environmental changes in riparian habitats have the potential to amplify shifts in the composition of stream fish communities in poorly connected river stretches. Conservation and management strategies for fish populations should, therefore, focus on enhancing connectivity between river stretches and limit conversion of nearby land to arable or urban use to maintain current levels of biodiversity.

AB  - Liangzhou District in northwest China was taken as the study area, the urban boundary and expansion information combined land use data were collected and interpreted through four different period images in 1986, 2000, 2006 and 2012 to analyze the urban expansion and laildscape pattern. Firstly, the arid inland river basins oasis city was seen as a system to compare the expansion pattern in different period. Secondly, circle -layers models and fan shaped models were used to analyze the spatial structure of expansion and expansion directions. We found that the urban area of Liangzhou District increases from 754.2 hm2 in 1986 to 1772.8 hm2 in 2012, with an average annual increased about 40.7 hm2, which account for 5.4% of the total area. The expansion speed increased 7.5 times and intensity increased 4 times in the past 26 years. Besides, the fragmentation of landscapes in Liangzhou District increased, and the patch density, diversity index and evenness index also increased year by year. The landscape of Liangzhou District was influenced greatly by the dominant landscape types such as farmland, urban land and unused land and with the overall stability and better connectivity. However, the spatial connectivity of small patches decreased inside of the landscape.

AB  - This study sought to identify critical areas for puma (Puma concolor) movement across the state of Arizona in the American Southwest and to identify those most likely to be impacted by current and future human land uses, particularly expanding urban development and associated increases in traffic volume. Human populations in this region are expanding rapidly, with the potential for urban centers and busy roads to increasingly act as barriers to demographic and genetic connectivity of large-bodied, wide-ranging carnivores such as pumas, whose long-distance movements are likely to bring them into contact with human land uses and whose low tolerance both for and from humans may put them at risk unless opportunities for safe passage through or around human-modified landscapes are present. Brownian bridge movement models based on global positioning system collar data collected during bouts of active movement and linear mixed models were used to model habitat quality for puma movement; then, a wall-to-wall application of circuit theory models was used to produce a continuous statewide estimate of connectivity for puma movement and to identify pinch points, or bottlenecks, that may be most at risk of impacts from current and future traffic volume and expanding development. Rugged, shrub- and scrub-dominated regions were highlighted as those offering high quality movement habitat for pumas, and pinch points with the greatest potential impacts from expanding development and traffic, although widely distributed, were particularly prominent to the north and east of the city of Phoenix and along interstate highways in the western portion of the state. These pinch points likely constitute important conservation opportunities, where barriers to movement may cause disproportionate loss of connectivity, but also where actions such as placement of wildlife crossing structures or conservation easements could enhance connectivity and prevent detrimental impacts before they occur.

AB  - Urban centers are important foci for plant biodiversity and yet widespread planting of wildflower gardens in cities to sustain pollinator biodiversity is on the rise, without full consideration of potential ecological consequences. The impact of intentional wildflower plantings on remnant native plant diversity in urban and peri-urban settings has not received attention, although shared pollinators are likely to mediate several types of biotic interactions between human-introduced plants and remnant native ones. Additionally, if wildflower species escape gardens these indirect effects may be compounded with direct ones. We review the potential positive and negative impacts of wildflower gardens on urban native flowering plants, and we reveal substantial gaps in our knowledge. We present a roadmap for research to address whether wildflower gardens, while benefiting pollinators, could also hasten the extinction of native remnant plants in urban settings, or whether they could have other effects that enrich urban biodiversity. Goals of future wildflower mixes should consider the totality of potential interactions.

AB  - Urban forests are important for alleviating the impact of environmental stress in intensely developed cities and play a role in maintaining natural interactions in urban ecosystems. Two of the most densely populated cities in Southeast Asia: Jakarta and Depok, Indonesia, have seen a dramatic decrease in green spaces, despite the importance of such spaces in making these cities more liveable and sustainable. One of the few remaining green spaces in the greater Jakarta area is the urban forest at Universitas Indonesia, yet little is known about its native biota, especially its bats. A host plant association study was conducted to determine the role of fruit bats in the urban forest ecosystem, which are suspected to be seed dispersers and pollinators. Eight fruit bat species (Cynopterus brachyotis, C. horsfieldii, C. minutus, C. sphinx, C. titthaecheilus, Macroglossus minimus,M. sobrinus, and Rousettus amplexicaudatus) consumed plant products from 26 plant species. Bat-plant species pairs were significantly associated (Cramer's V = 0.51, p < 0.05). Ficus species comprised the highest percentage of plants consumed (25%), yet they were never deliberately planted, suggesting that fruit bats introduced them from other areas. Additionally, introduced plants were found outside the introduction area. By acting as seed dispersers and pollinators, fruit bats potentially contribute to the current plant diversity in the urban forest and connect distant plant populations. Fruit bats facilitated seed dispersal of species important to forest regeneration, an important insight for future plans to increase green spaces to mitigate the negative effects of anthropogenic change in urban environments.

AB  - In the mid-1960s, the Staten Island Citizens Planning Committee (SICPC) thwarted plans for the Richmond Parkway, seeking instead to weave dense, affordable housing options within a network of linear preserves they donned "the Greenbelt." By the mid-1970s, however, the SICPC decoupled their environmental concerns from dense housing schemes, turning instead toward ecological zoning strategies. The SICPC's changing vision reveals the policies and park spaces that emerged when environmentalists ran square into the realities of the mid-1970s fiscal crisis. If such policies proved effective for preserving biodiversity, they also helped cement the segregated landscape taking shape across the metropolis.

AB  - Urbanization is a leading cause of species extinction; however, interest in urban greenspaces as sites for conservation has grown considerably in recent decades, raising questions about the ability of these habitats to support desired wildlife. Our goal was to determine how distinct forms of urban greenspace and their landscape context influenced the species composition of ground-dwelling beetle communities. We examined the taxonomic and functional composition of Carabidae and Staphylinidae in urban vacant lots, urban farms, and planted urban prairies within the City of Cleveland, Ohio. Beetles were collected using pitfall traps across 23 sites. We found that the three habitats examined varied significantly in beetle composition, with several unique species found within each type of greenspace. Carabidae abundance and richness were greater in urban prairies and urban farms relative to vacant lots. The abundance and taxonomic richness of Staphylinidae were highest within urban farms. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial CCA revealed that both local features and landscape variables influenced beetle community assembly. Most beetle taxa were negatively associated with buildings within the surrounding 1-km landscape, whereas grass was the most important local habitat feature. Additionally, we found variation in the distribution of species traits among habitats; ecological traits such as moisture tolerance and dispersal capacity differed significantly among urban greenspaces. Most interesting from a conservation perspective was a greater abundance of brachypterous carabids found in urban prairies, which suggests that these habitats provide overwintering and breeding habitat for some beetle species. Our findings demonstrate that urban greenspaces play important roles in shaping arthropod diversity in cities, and maintaining habitats that vary in design and management is important for their conservation.

AB  - Plants in cities must cope with various anthropogenic environments that differ from surrounding landscapes. Moreover, the differences in biotic and abiotic conditions among these habitats filter species with suitable traits and niche requirements. Here we aim to identify those attributes that promote species occurrence across and within urban habitat types of large cities. Species composition of spontaneously occurring vascular plant species was recorded in 1-ha plots in seven different urban habitat types in each of 32 European cities. Each species was characterized in terms of dispersal type, growth form, height, seed bank longevity, seed mass, selected leaf traits and ecological indicators including Ellenberg indicator values, Grime's life strategies, and immigration pathways using information from available speciestrait databases. For each species, total frequency of occurrence across all plots and habitat frequency of occurrence across plots of given habitat types were calculated and regression trees were used to relate them to traits and ecological indicators. The most frequently occurring species in the cities tended to be human-dispersed, nutrient-demanding plants that prefer drier to mesic soil conditions. These species do not possess the S-strategy and usually produce seeds of low mass forming short-term persistent seed banks. Habitat-specific responses were also revealed, indicating the effects of between-and within-habitat heterogeneity on trends in species performance in cities. Such patterns can be overlooked when differences in species occurrences in particular urban habitat types are not considered; thus, habitat-specific responses can resolve inconsistencies found when whole urban floras are analysed as a whole.

AB  - Since the Chinese government carried out the reform and opening up policy, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture has experienced rapid urbanization and dramatic land use change. This research aims at analyzing urban expansion in Xishuangbanna and its impact on the land use pattern using combined methods, including radar graph, the gradient-direction method and landscape metrics. Seven land use maps from 1976 to 2015 were generated and analyzed, respectively. The results showed that urban and rubber expanded rapidly, while forest decreased during the last 40 years. The city proper, the county town of Menghai and the county town of Mengla showed the most significant and fastest urban expansion rates. In response to rapid urban expansion, land use types outside urban areas changed dramatically. In Jinghong and Mengla, urban areas were usually surrounded by paddy, shrub, rubber and forest in 1976, while most areas were dominated by rubber by 2015. With the development of Xishuangbanna, landscape diversity increased along urban-rural gradients, but decreased in some key urban areas. Urban expansion slightly reduced the connectivity of forest and increased agglomeration of rubber at the same time. Based on the analyses above, we moved forward to discuss the consequences of urban expansion, rubber plantations and land fragmentation.

AB  - Urbanization threatens biodiversity worldwide and is expected to increase in the future. This involves intensification of fragmentation and increase of urban forest remnants. Thus, it is important to understand the functioning of these patches for the preservation of local biodiversity. Mutualistic interactions such as seed dispersal have a key role in the dynamics of plant populations and could help to mitigate the negative effects of fragmentation on wild plant populations. In this context, we have used the mastic Pistacia lentiscus, a common Mediterranean shrub, as a model to study the interaction between seed dispersal by birds and the local genetic diversity of individuals in a highly fragmented semiarid forestry area of the Iberian Southeast (Murcia, Spain). Results reveal a high genetic diversity and a lack of differentiation between shrub patches of P. lentiscus in the area, probably as a result of a strong, but rather recent fragmentation, and an apparently poor contribution of birds to the dispersal of Pistacia seeds. However, the existence of latent impacts cannot be discarded, since at least one of the patches shows some signs of inbreeding.

AB  - In recent years, the continuous expansion of urban-transport networks in China has aggravated the fragmentation of regional landscapes and led to the degradation of multiple ecological functions. In this study, Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, patch size of fragmentation geometry were used to identify and monitor spatial distribution patterns of landscape fragmentation due to urban-transport networks in Fujian Province. This network has caused serious damage to regional ecological functions, and risks to the persistence of animal populations and biodiversity. This analysis revealed that the smallest patch class (0-15 km2) occurred with a much greater frequency than all other larger patch sizes. In the coastal cities of Xiamen, Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, the percentage of the number of patches less than 300 km2 was higher than in the western cities of Nanping, Sanming and Longyan, and the percentage of the area of patches less than 300 km2 was also higher. Based on a holistic identification of the structure of the network and its landscape division, we found that: Fujian Province has a spatial pattern of landscape fragmentation, with less fragmentation in western and northern regions, and most fragmentation in southern and eastern regions. Coastal regions and areas close to the main transport routes were more seriously fragmented and contained most of the small patches.

AB  - By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other riversfor hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation.
   The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of 'closeness' of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15 m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers similar to 50 to similar to 200 m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a 'lively' atmosphere. At widths over similar to 200 m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaldng in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity.
   In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In June 2013 an unprecedented movement spearheaded by young people took to the streets of Brazilian cities. Despite the diversity of explanations of the protests, one thing became clear: the urban question was at the center of events. Brazil has become an international role model for its innovations in social policy and even urban policy. There have been social struggles for a democratic city. New policies, new programs, new projects, and a Ministry of Cities have been created. This democratic and participatory process has taken place in the context of fiscal adjustment and therefore contention over resources. When the federal government resumed investment in cities following a developmentalist project, capital linked to the production of space took over the leadership of the urban process and the virtuous cycle of urban policy declined. Investment in works directed by the real estate market in the context of mega-events such as the World Cup and the Olympics together with tax relief for the purchase of automobiles deepened the deterioration of urban living conditions, especially housing and mobility.

AB  - Alien species are often first introduced to urban areas, so it is unsurprising that towns and cities are often hotspots for invasions. However, while large cities are usually the first sites of introduction, small towns are more numerous and have a greater chance of launching invasions into natural areas as they have proportionally larger interfaces with their surroundings. In this paper we develop a set of scenarios as hypotheses to explore the role of small towns in facilitating within-country dispersal of alien plants. In particular, we developed ten scenarios for how introductions to small towns, agricultural and natural areas can lead to landscape-scale invasions. We tested a part of these scenarios using a case study of a highly invaded region in South Africa (the Berg River catchment in the Western Cape). We specifically investigated the main plant invasion routes between 12 small towns and their surrounding agricultural and natural areas. This was accomplished by conducting urban-specific alien plant surveys in towns, then comparing these results to regional databases of naturalized and/or invasive plants. Many of the alien plants found in urban areas were listed as invasive or naturalized in the catchment (over 30% of the total alien species pool). Despite marked environmental gradients across the study area, we found no relationships between the alien plant species richness in towns and climatic variables or with levels of anthropogenic disturbances. All towns hosted large numbers of invasive plant species and nearly half of the alien species found in towns were naturalized or invasive in surrounding areas. The likelihood of alien plants being naturalized or invasive outside urban areas increased in proportion to their local abundance in towns and if they were tall and woody. Ornamental horticulture was the main reason for introduction of these alien species (69%). Small towns can and do harbour significant populations of plant taxa that are able to spread to surrounding natural areas to launch invasions. Comparing lists of species from urban alien plant surveys with those from naturalisation records for the region is a useful protocol for identifying species which may be moving along the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum.

AB  - Amazonian understory antbirds are thought to be relatively sedentary and to have limited dispersal ability; they avoid crossing forest gaps, and even narrow roads through a forest may limit their territories. However, most evidence for sedentariness in antbirds comes from field observations and plot-based recapture of adult individuals, which do not provide evidence for lack of genetic dispersal, as this often occurs through juveniles. In this study, we used microsatellite markers and mitochondrial control-region sequences to investigate contemporary and infer historical patterns of genetic diversity and structure of the Rufous-throated Antbird (Gymnopithys rufigula) within and between two large reserves in central Amazonia. Analyses based on microsatellites suggested two genetically distinct populations and asymmetrical gene flow between them. Within a population, we found a lack of genetic spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that genotypes are randomly distributed and that G.rufigula may disperse longer distances than expected for antbirds. Analyses based on mitochondrial sequences did not recover two clear genetic clusters corresponding to the two reserves and indicated the whole population of the Rufous-throated Antbird in the region has been expanding over the last 50,000 years. Historical migration rates were low and symmetrical between the two reserves, but we found evidence for a recent unilateral increase in gene flow. Recent differentiation between individuals of the two reserves and a unilateral increase in gene flow suggest that recent urban expansion and habitat loss may be driving changes and threatening populations of Rufous-throated Antbird in central Amazonia. As ecological traits and behavioral characteristics affect patterns of gene flow, comparative studies of other species with different behavior and ecological requirements will be necessary to better understand patterns of genetic dispersal and effects of urban expansion on Amazonian understory antbirds.

AB  - 1. Pollination is a major ecosystem service in which insects, particularly bees, play an important role for the reproduction of most angiosperms. Currently, this service is considered under threat due to reported bee declines. Moderately urbanised areas could be important for pollinators and pollination; however, compared to agricultural and natural systems, they are poorly studied. 2. Here, we investigated the relative effects of local habitat quality and anthropogenic land use across an agricultural to urban gradient for local plant and flying insect communities. We quantified local flower visitor networks and related network architecture to these local and landscape factors using structural equationmodelling. Flower visitor network architecture is often assumed to act as a surrogate for the ecosystem service of pollination. To test this idea, we related network metrics to pollination of four experimental, insect pollinator-dependent plant species. 3. Overall, local land use markedly influenced plant and flying insect communities. Flower richness and bee richness were higher in urban compared to agricultural areas. Flower visitor network metrics (e.g. linkage density) increased with the proportion of urban area surrounding a site. Also, relative to agricultural areas, urban flower visitors were more generalised and foraged from a higher number of plant species, likely a consequence of higher urban flowering plant richness. However, urban bees also visited a lower proportion of the available flowering plants (higher specialisation). Surprisingly, linkage density, network specialisation and flower visitor generality were not related to pollination of our four experimental plants per se. Rather, it was the proportion of urban cover, flying insect abundance and bee richness that were positively related to pollination. 4. Our findings show strong effects of local land use on plant and flying insect communities and flower visitor interaction networks. We observed increased overall visitation rates and pollination services to our experimental plants in urban compared to agricultural areas, despite increased urban flower visitor generality. Indeed, flower visitor network metrics were a poor proxy of provision of the ecosystem service of pollination. Nevertheless, our results point to potential facilitating effects of diverse urban floral and bee communities for pollination.

AB  - Urban development often results in diminished forest cover and severely fragmented landscapes, but most research on effects of urban development has been focused on densely forested regions and has not distinguished remnant from recently established forest cover. Urban development may have different effects in heterogeneous landscapes with high pre-urban fragmentation. Our study investigated spatial and temporal distribution of remnant forest ecosystems across a large urban landscape to assess effects of landscape structure and development patterns on forest conversion. Forest ecosystem distribution within the greater Chicago region (18,822 km(2)) was mapped in three time periods using Public Land Survey records (1830's) and aerial imagery (1939 and 2010). Loss of original forest between sampling periods (conversion) was related to landscape features, land use, and sociodemographic factors. In 2010 similar to 17% of pre-urban forest area remained, which represented similar to 40% reduction relative to 1939. Conversion did not differ greatly with urbanization, but fragmentation was greater in areas with high population density and rapid population growth. Conversion was lower in areas close to waterways, where there was less impervious surface, and also differed among land uses (highest in agricultural and industrial). Remnant forests had higher canopy cover, basal area, and native species dominance than recently established forests. Urbanization may have lower relative effects on total forest cover in naturally fragmented landscapes, but may result in extreme fragmentation. Remnant forests had characteristics consistent with high functional value, but creating connectivity among ecosystems in highly urbanized areas will require promotion of canopy cover in urban land uses.

AB  - Large number of studies on "landscape fragmentation", were conducted in the literature. Most of them focused on habitat loss (species loss), open space loss, and changes in land use/cover (LULC), and landscape mosaic (landscape pattern/metrics etc.). Fragmentation was one of the most widely used concept amongst these topics that attracts attention due to high urbanization and dramatic changes of the cities. It was emphasized in various articles that fragmentation has adverse impacts on landscape however, it differs in various ways including, quantity of elements, naturalness and ecological values of landscape mosaic. To support this hypothesis, we applied a reference method for measuring fragmentation. In this context, Hedge Network (HN) approach was adopted and applied in lower plain of the ancient Meander River in Aydin Province, Turkey due to its agricultural character. Spontaneous vegetation cover in ditches of irrigated fields are permanent due to the water supply from irrigation system and precipitation in the study area. In this context, hedgerow types along permanent fields were recorded from 15 sampling plots. Thus, this study enabled an enhanced interpretation and biotope/biodiversity based understanding of landscape fragmentation.

AB  - Urban areas provide habitat for numerous native species, but life in towns and cities presents many challenges. The effect of climate on the ecology and the behaviour of non-volant vertebrates inhabiting urban habitats have received little attention. In this study, we investigated demography, growth rates, movements and reproduction of a semi-aquatic freshwater turtle, Chelodina longicollis, along a natural to urban gradient during a period of relatively high rainfall (2011-2014) and compared this to a previous study in the same system during drought (2006-2007). In addition to changes in rainfall, urbanization increased considerably over the same time period and a pest-exclusion fence was constructed to mitigate against urban hazards encroaching on the adjacent reserve. Turtles grew at similar rates, had similar abundances and sex ratios and had similar reproductive output across the gradient from urban to non-urban sites during the wet period. Despite increasing urbanization, recruitment occurred at all sites and survivorship estimates were similar among sites. Turtles moved among wetlands at high rates and over long distances (6km), underscoring the importance of movements in urban landscapes. Our results contrast with those for the same system during drought, when turtles were less abundant and grew slower in the nature reserve compared with the urban environment. Our results underscore the strong influence climate can have on population dynamics and resilience of species to changes brought about by urbanization. Further monitoring is required to understand the long-term population responses of long-lived species to drought cycles.

AB  - Purpose The white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is an important reservoir host for the pathogen responsible for Lyme disease in eastern North-America. Indigenous cases of Lyme disease in southern Quebec have increased from two cases in 2004 to 160 cases in 2015. Because of the strong relationship between the white-footed mouse occurrence and the Lyme disease pathogen prevalence, we can estimate the risk of Lyme disease by finding areas of high contact between mice. In this study, we inferred the movement patterns and contact rate of the white-footed mouse in southern Quebec.
   Methods We used pattern-orientated modelling to estimate a directional measure of functional connectivity from an Individual-Based Model. We replicated the spatial pattern observed in previously published molecular analysis of a white-footed mouse population.
   Results A perceptual range of 80 m best explained the genetic structure of the white-footed mouse in the region. The paths of individuals generally overlapped the edges of urban centers and the boundary of linear obstacles such as highways and water bodies. We show that the contact probability of mice was a good predictor of the number of mice caught in the field.
   Conclusions Our findings highlight the usefulness of individual-based models to potentially predict high contact areas and disease hotspots across landscapes.

AB  - Environmental processes and dispersal are primary determinants of metacommunity dynamics. The relative importance of these effects may vary between species of different abundance classes, given variation in life history traits. Under high disturbance conditions, rare species may be more easily eliminated from their optimal habitats and their distribution may therefore be more heavily dependent upon dispersal from nearby habitat patches than common species.
   We tested if metacommunity dynamics vary between abundance classes in a high disturbance environment.
   Standardized butterfly sampling was conducted in the urban parks of Hong Kong. To estimate the strength of environmental processes, we measured an array of environmental variables for all sampled parks. Spatial predictors were generated to estimate the effect of dispersal.
   For shaping common species compositions, we found environmental processes (and specifically environmental variables including floral density and surrounding woody plant cover) slightly more important than spatial processes. For rare species, only spatial processes were significant while environmental processes were insignificant. Our result contrasts previous studies in natural metacommunities, which have shown that both common and rare species compositions are shaped by environmental processes and similar variables.
   Our results demonstrate that high disturbance conditions may inhibit rare species establishment and persistence in urban landscapes. Local habitat management may not be sufficient in conserving rare species in urban environments-spatial context and configuration should be considered in planning for biodiversity. We also highlight the utility of community deconstruction analysis in providing insights into rare species metacommunity dynamics.

AB  - We aimed to assess the impact of land-use structure on AFIS occurrence and evaluation of these bioindicators in urban conditions. We compiled data about forest continuity based on archival maps and forest management plans; floristic records of 79 AFIS occurrences were collected within a 1 x 1 km grid and land-use form structure in Poznan (W Poland). We tested fidelity of AFIS using chi(2) tests and effects of land-use structure using random forest models. We also checked spatial autocorrelation and its impact on AFIS distribution patterns within old and recent forests, using spatially explicit generalized linear models. We found a strong relationship between AFIS number per grid square and fraction of forests and waters in land-use structure. Relationships between AFIS distribution and land-use shows that AFIS are a good proxy describing human impact or an urbanity gradient. AFIS number per grid square shows small, but significant positive spatial autocorrelation, which suggests possibilities of migration into new forests. AFIS, treated as a bioindicative group of species, may be a useful indicator of landscape and land-use structure transformation in urban environments. Occurrence of many AFIS that are endangered at the city scale indicates the need for conservation of old forests in urban areas, to preserve biodiversity in urban environments. Thus, AFIS may act as indicators of old forests with high conservation value in cities, which need special protection.

AB  - Pathogenic fungi are a growing health concern worldwide, particularly in large, densely populated cities. The dramatic upsurge of pigeon populations in cities has been implicated in the increased incidence of invasive fungal infections. In this study, we used a culture-independent, high-throughput sequencing approach to describe the diversity of clinically relevant fungi (CRF) associated with pigeon faeces and map the relative abundance of CRF across Seoul, Korea. In addition, we tested whether certain geographical, sociological and meteorological factors were significantly associated with the diversity and relative abundance of CRF. Finally, we compared the CRF diversity of fresh and old pigeon faeces to identify the source of the fungi and the role of pigeons in dispersal. Our results demonstrated that both the composition and relative abundance of CRF are unevenly distributed across Seoul. The green area ratio and the number of multiplex houses were positively correlated with species diversity, whereas wind speed and number of households were negatively correlated. The number of workers and green area ratio were positively correlated with the relative abundance of CRF, whereas wind speed was negatively correlated. Because many CRF were absent in fresh faeces, we inferred that most species cannot survive the gastrointestinal tract of pigeons and instead are likely transmitted through soil or air and use pigeon faeces as a substrate for proliferation.

AB  - Powerline clearings are common in urban and semi-urban landscapes worldwide. The clearings could potentially promote flowering species associated with open-canopy habitats, and provide alternative habitat for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands, but the empirical evidence for this hypothesis is weak. We carried out a large-scale field study of understorey plant communities at 51 sites in powerline clearings and adjacent boreal forest. At each site, we placed four 4 m x 5 m plots with five 1-m(2) subplots in the clearing centre and a parallel set of plots 100 m into the adjacent forest. Habitat characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital maps. The clearings had a higher richness of species associated with semi-natural grasslands, and a higher richness of shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant forb species. Total plant richness and diversity were higher in the clearings than in the forests. The magnitude of difference in species composition between clearings and forest, and plant community properties in the clearings, depended on the environmental context (age of the clearing, productivity, shading by tree regrowth, landscape fragmentation, climate). Our results indicate that over time, powerline clearings develop into novel habitats. Low-productive sites were dominated by Ericaceaous dwarfs shrubs. Richness of forbs and semi-natural grassland species in the clearings increased with productivity. Richness of shade-intolerant forbs and semi-natural grassland species increased with fragmentation of the surrounding landscape. We conclude that frequent clearing of productive sites can enhance plant biodiversity including richness of insect-pollinated species and mitigate the loss of species associated with semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Modelling population dynamics of invasive species may help to propose effective management countermeasures. Invasion dynamics generally show recursive patterns across species and regions, where initial lag is followed by spread and eventual dominance phases. However, timing and modes of these phases are highly variable, emerging from the interplay between traits of the invader and characteristics of the invaded landscape. Disentangling this interplay is particularly arduous in species with complex life-histories, where an individual passes through different life stages that alter physiology, behaviour and interactions with the environment. Here, we describe an age structured model that can be utilized to simulate population dynamics of invasive pond-breeding anurans. The model follows a spatially structured population approach, each pond representing a discrete habitat patch that exchanges individuals with other similar patches, and simulates change in survival and dispersal behaviour as a function of age. It also integrates dispersal with landscape complexity through landscape resistance modelling to depict functional connectivity across the pond network. Then we apply the model to a case study, the invasion of the guttural toad Sclerophrys gutturalis in Cape Town, first detected in 2000. Age-structured demographic and spatial dynamics of the focal population are reconstructed in a network of 415 ponds embedded in a heterogeneous landscape. Parameterization is conducted through field and laboratory surveys, a literature review and data collected during an ongoing extirpation from 2010. We use the model to explore: i) occurrence and duration of lag phase; ii) whether the spatial spread fits an accelerating or a linear trend; iii) how simulated dynamics match field observations. Additionally we test model sensitivity to demographic and behavioural traits. We found a lag phase in both demographic and spatial dynamics; however the lag duration of these dynamics does not coincide, where invaders start to spread across the pond network five years before the demographic explosion. Also, we found that the spatial spread fits an accelerating trend that causes complete invasion of the network in six years. Such dynamics noticeably match field observations and confirmed patterns previously detected in other invaders characterized by high dispersal abilities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that it would have been preferable to quantify initial propagule size and post-metamorphic survival in the field; both timing and modes of invasion are particularly sensitive to these parameters. We conclude that the model has potential to forecast amphibian invasion dynamics and test management countermeasures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The diverse Potamogeton genus includes over 80 species of aquatic macrophytes that occur across a broad geographic range and have variable response to environmental conditions. This study evaluated how environmental and spatial variables structure assemblage composition and species richness of Potamogeton spp. in the US states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. Variation partitioning analysis was used to study the relative contribution of local, climate and spatial variables in explaining assemblage composition and species richness. Models were also developed for sixteen Potamogeton spp. using partial linear regression. Assemblage composition and total species richness were better explained by the pure effects of spatial and local variables as compared to the pure effects of climate variables. However, geographical structuring of variables suggested that species followed a latitudinal gradient that was strongly related to eutrophication and partially related to climate. Models for individual species were similar although some were disproportionately described by specific categories of explanatory variables. For example, invasive Potamogeton crispus was more tolerant of eutrophication than most species and was also described by a strong spatial grouping of lakes near a large urban area. These results suggest that the distribution of Potamogeton spp. is limited by species tolerances to lake variation in local and climate characteristics across spatial gradients, whereas specific species may be more limited by dispersal barriers between lakes with suitable habitat. This analysis is the first regional evaluation of factors related to the distribution of this ecologically important genus and the importance of landscape-level approaches to ecological conservation is emphasized.

AB  - Human modification of the landscape, including urbanization and road construction, has facilitated the spread and establishment of non-native plant species. The effects of urbanization and roads are expected to be species-specific due to differences in species habitat requirements. We examined the influence of urbanization and roads on the occurrences of 16 non-native plant species in over 2000 wetlands within the Chicago metropolitan region in northeastern Illinois, USA. We found that species, or groups of species, responded differently to the effects of urbanization, roads, and proximity to conspecific populations. Occurrences of halophyte species were best predicted by road variables; halophytes were more commonly associated with major roads such as interstates and federal highways, road types that are likely to receive greater applications of de-icing salts. Several species were associated with proximity to Chicago. Proximity to Chicago may serve as a proxy for the degree of urbanization; or alternatively, may reflect a pattern of outward dispersal from an initial establishment point in the urban center. All study species were positively associated with distance to the nearest occupied wetland, implying that for each species, wetlands were more likely to be occupied if closer to other occupied sites. Our results support the need for species-specific understanding of responses to urbanization and roads to facilitate management of non-native species.

AB  - Recent studies have revealed that manor gardens may serve as local hotspots of biodiversity and provide cultural ecosystem services. As a consequence of dramatic land-use changes in recent centuries, followed by significant loss and degradation of natural habitats, manor gardens often serve as harbors for organisms within the cultural landscape. We randomly selected 98 manor gardens, followed by a grid overlay of data from the national natural habitats mapping system. Proportions of natural habitats were calculated for each garden in relation to the surrounding landscape. The results provide information about importance of manor gardens for biodiversity conservation through findings that especially large manor gardens, compared with the surrounding landscape, contain an important proportion of natural habitats, particularly in areas with a high level of human impact. For the gardens, occurrence of the following formation groups of the natural habitats was recorded: forests (total proportion of all kinds of forests habitats is 25.4% of the gardens area), secondary semi-natural grasslands (4.4%), streams and water bodies (1.6%) and wetlands and riverine vegetation (0.5%). The significantly high proportion of natural habitats in manor gardens was found mainly for beech forests and for secondary semi-natural grasslands, especially mesic and montane meadows. No significant importance was proven for wetland habitats. We conclude that nature friendly managed manor gardens can provide a conservation function of local natural habitats and their biodiversity especially in intensively managed landscapes.

AB  - The conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural land and urban areas plays a threat to the protected areas and the natural ecosystems conservation. The aim of this paper is to provide an analysis of the agricultural expansion and its impact on the landscape spatial and temporal patterns in a buffer zone of a protected area located in the transition zone between the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The land use and land cover were mapped between 1971 and 2008 and landscape metrics were calculated to provide a spatiotemporal analysis of the forest structure and the expansion of the croplands. The results showed that the landscape patterns were affected by the economic cycles. The predominant crop surrounding the protected area is sugar cane, which increased by 39% during this period, followed by citrus. This landscape change is connected to the Brazilian oil crisis in 1973. The rapid expansion of sugar cane was largely driven by Brazil's biofuel program, the "Proalcool" (pro-alcohol), a project in 1975 that mixed ethanol with gas for automotive fuel. The forest loss occurred mainly between 1971 and 1988, decreasing the forest cover from 17% in 1971 to 12.7% in 2008. Most of the forest patches are smaller than 50 ha and has low connectivity. Throughout the years, the fragments in the buffer zone have become smaller and with an elongated shape, and the park has become isolated. This forest fragmentation process and the predominance of monoculture lands in the buffer zone threaten the protected areas, and can represent a barrier for these areas to provide the effective biodiversity conservation. The measures proposed are necessary to ensure the capability of this ecosystem to sustain its original biodiversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasive plants are non-native, but in most cases naturalised, species that have successfully spread outside of their native range. Aliens invaded all habitats, are competing with native plants, thus, after the direct destruction of habitats, invasions are recognised as the second largest danger for biodiversity. Northern Red Oak is one of the most common invasive tree species dispersed primarily by birds, but new studies have shown that it is also spread continuously in a forest stand. The main aim of our research was to check how strong is the invasion of Northern Red Oak in Silesia Park, where it was introduced together with other alien plant species, and how this invasion interacts with bird diversity. Silesia Park was created 65 years ago on the surface largely ravaged by coal industry. Because many studies indicate birds as vectors of alien plants invasion, we examined the bird fauna in a described area, looking for species that can contribute to spreading oaks. Research showed the diversity of 50 bird species. Surface with a presence of Northern Red Oak was characterised by greater participation of alien plant species than the patch of natural forest, which existed there long before the park creation. The greatest bird diversity was found in the most natural part of Silesia Park, and the lowest in the area of invasion, especially in the case of species classified as "forest birds". The presence of alien plants increased number of "non-forest" birds, mostly synanthropic species. We also found that Northern Red Oak spreads by spontaneous seed dispersal.

AB  - Orchid bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Euglossini) are important pollinators of many plant families in Neotropical forests, habitats that have become increasingly degraded and fragmented by agricultural practices. To understand the extent to which loss of natural habitat and isolation has affected the genetic diversity and diploid male production (DMP) of two orchid bee species, Euglossa dilemma and Euglossa viridissima, we collected and genotyped 1686 males at five microsatellite loci and tested for differences in allelic richness, heterozygosity and DMP across three different types of land use (natural, agricultural and urban) and between mainland and island populations in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. We also investigated the impact of land use and geographic isolation on gene flow. Euglossa dilemma and E. viridissima seemed to be particularly resilient to loss of natural habitat; in locations with human impact, we did not find reduced genetic diversity, and populations generally showed very little population genetic structure. Only on islands did E. dilemma show significantly reduced genetic diversity. Even after accounting for putative null alleles, DMP was very low (0.2-1.3%) across all sampling sites, including on islands. We therefore suggest that DMP is an insensitive measure of inbreeding and population decline in our two study species.

AB  - Human impacts are believed to be the main cause of the marked decline in bee populations around the world. The ongoing expansion of the urban landscape has created obstacles to the establishment of some bee species, including those that are important pollinators. However, Centris (Hemisiella) tarsata is frequently found in urban landscapes in South America and is considered a keystone species in pollination programmes. Despite the importance of this species, there are no previous studies on the genetic diversity and population structure of C. tarsata. In the present study, four mitochondrial genes (cytb, COI, 16S and 12S) were analysed in 189 individuals from 16 localities in Brazil. The analysis of the concatenated gene sequences (2058 bp) revealed high haplotype variability at each sampling site. Ninety-nine highly similar haplotypes were found and no differentiation among populations was detected. Two haplotypes were shared by most sites, whereas 77 were locally restricted. The star-like haplotype network and expansion tests indicate that C. tarsata populations underwent expansion during the late Pleistocene. The present results and the high potential of the species for dispersal lend support to this marked population expansion. Overall, the findings indicate that this solitary bee is potentially capable of maintaining high levels of genetic diversity in the urban landscape.

AB  - The conservation of species and habitats is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic impacts, particularly land use change, from local to global scales. Although many efforts have been carried out so far to halt or at least reduce the biodiversity loss (e.g., the establishment of protected areas' networks), there are still both knowledge and policy gaps slowing the conservation of species and habitats in complex environments, such as the Mediterranean region. In particular, the human-driven impacts and threats on biodiversity need more careful analysis. Accordingly, this paper aims to assess the habitat quality and degradation in Italy in relation with the spatial pattern of the current protected areas' network, mainly to identify priority areas of intervention, thus supporting large-scale conservation strategies.
   A survey of experts was conducted to identify the main threats for biodiversity from different land uses at the national scale. The InVEST software was then applied to assess and map habitat quality and degradation with a high spatial resolution (20 m). The relationship between habitat quality and degradation as well as their hotspots, and alternative PA categories were also explored. Results indicate that: (i) habitat quality and degradation depend on the location and intensity of the anthropogenic impacts and are sensitive to different protection levels; (ii) the combination of the survey of experts and the spatially-explicit assessment of habitat quality and degradation is useful to highlight variations of the current conditions of biodiversity and habitats; and (iii) the identification of hotspots allows one to identify priority areas for conservation. Accordingly, the proposed approach may be used to strengthen the conservation efforts in similar contexts, and thus support the implementation of the biodiversity-related policies over the long term.

AB  - The control of exotic and invasive species in areas undergoing recovery is a challenge for ecological restoration and this problem may be even greater in urbanized areas. This study evaluated the seed bank and seed rain of a 5-year-old riparian forest located at the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte in southeast Brazil, and verified changes over time in the abundance and species richness and whether planted species already were providing propagules to the site. At the forest, fifteen parcels of 100 m(2) were distributed randomly and soil samples were collected thrice (October 2011, March 2012 and July 2012) to evaluate the seed bank. Seed traps were installed in nine parcels to collect propagules over 1 year. Propagules were segregated and germinate at greenhouse. Species richness and abundance were estimated, and variance and similarity were quantified. In total, 86 species were recorded in the seed banks, 41.9% natives and 33.7% exotics, with the predominance of herbs (87.2%) and only 7% of trees. Species classified as weeds amounted to 52.3%. In the seed rain 642 seedlings germinated but they belonged to only 10 species, half of them were exotics. Regarding life forms, half of the species were arboreal and dominated the samples, highlighting the exotic species Melia azedarach. The species richness of the seed bank did not differ by season, unlike the seed rain which varied significantly by month. Seed bank and seed rain species had a very low floristic similarity with the list of planted species, suggesting that few planted trees had dispersed or were stocking propagules. Many non-planted species were recorded, mostly exotics and/or invasive that were probably derived from the surrounding urban matrix. These might interrupt the successional dynamics of the restoration forest and compromise the restoration process in the medium and long-terms. Our results highlight: (1) the importance of monitoring areas undergoing restoration; (2) that restoration methods and management actions directed to control exotic and invasive species are particularly important for sites in urban regions; and (3) the relevance of conserving forest fragments as sources of propagules for nearby areas.

AB  - The imperative to transform car-dependent cities for a low-carbon future requires that we engage with the challenge of increasing densities along existing road-based transit corridors - within the constraints of existing morphologies. Such corridors are often lined with small lots that are valued for their functional mix and urban character. This paper explores the degree to which small and narrow lots constrain urban intensification through a study of tram corridors in Melbourne. We examine the impact of site area, shape and access conditions as constraints on re-development and increased density. We find that small and narrow lots have not prevented intensification that is substantial in its accumulated effect and contributes more to urban character than large lot re-development. The paper discusses the relations of urban morphology to questions of car-dependency, development capacity and resident resistance.

AB  - Tidally active wetlands are important nurseries for fish and crustaceans; however, urban development involving structural flood mitigation has fragmented and destroyed much of this habitat, often leading to losses in fisheries productivity. The present study demonstrated that some of these impacts may be reversible if rehabilitation projects are implemented over a sufficiently long time. The incremental opening of eight floodgates at a temperate coastal wetland in Australia afforded the opportunity to monitor water quality and nekton assemblages in a tidal creek over 11 years, encompassing pre-floodgate opening, opening of one gate, three gates and finally all eight gates. Floodgate opening enhanced both water quality and nektonic assemblages relative to a control creek whose barrier remained in place. A doubling in species richness occurred and many commercially important species increased in abundance, including Metapenaeus macleayi (15 times more), Acanthopagrus australis (62 times more), Liza argentea (10 times more) and Gerres subfasciatus (19 times more). Recovery to a condition similar to unrestricted reference creeks was achieved once all eight gates were opened. The study illustrated that reinstating tidal flushing can recover nursery habitats and enhance populations of economically valuable species.

AB  - Globalisation has resulted in the movement of organisms outside their natural range, often with negative ecological and economic consequences. As cities are hubs of anthropogenic activities, with both highly transformed and disturbed environments, these areas are often the first point of entry for alien species. We compiled a global database of cities with more than one million inhabitants that data had on alien species occurrence. We then identified the most prominent pathways of introduction and vectors of spread of alien species in these cities. Most species were intentionally introduced to cities and were released or escaped from confinement. The majority of alien species then spread within cities through natural means (primarily unaided dispersal). Pathway prominence varied across the taxonomic groups of alien species: the most prominent pathway for plants and vertebrates was the escape pathway; for invertebrates the stowaway and contaminant pathways were most likely to facilitate introductions. For some organisms, pathway prominence varied with the geographical and climatic characteristics of the city. The characteristics of the cities also influenced the prominence of vectors of spread for alien species. Preventing the natural spread of alien species within cities, and into adjacent natural environments will be, at best, difficult. To prevent invasions, both the intentional and unintentional introduction of potentially harmful alien species to cities must be prevented. The pathways of introduction and vectors of spread identified here should be prioritised for management.

AB  - The influence of anthropogenic habitat loss on animal distribution and core habitat use can be particularly strong in animals with narrow habitat selectivity, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), a delphinid species that specifically inhabits coastal and estuarine waters. This study measured the extent of habitat loss in the waters around Xiamen City, China, where intense environmental changes and coast utilization have occurred in the past 40years. The extent of occurrence and the core habitat of the humpback dolphin were measured based on sighting records from censuses conducted in different years. A Landsat image series revealed a permanent 119.95km(2) loss of coastal waters to land reclamation, coastal modification and harbour construction from 1973 to 2013. The distribution of the humpback dolphin showed a significant shift from inshore to offshore waters and away from artificial shorelines. Though the extent of occurrence appears to change minimally, a significant shift in the core habitat from the original coastal habitats into mid-channel waters was observed in the eastern Xiamen Bay. These results imply multiple consequences of anthropogenic coastal alterations for the humpback dolphin: the elimination of vital habitats, changes in habitat use preferences, and the partitioning of the social structure of the population. The need to adjust current protected area designations along with adequate measures to restore habitat quality and population connectivity, both locally and regionally, are considered.

AB  - Accelerated development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has radically altered the urban environment throughout the globe including India. Modern concepts like "Smart Cities" have begun to touch base in India as well. The backbone of such a concept is a hyper-connected society. Internet of Things (IoT) is the philosophy that underwrites this concept on the back of connecting technologies like LTE and 5G. This paper is an attempt to identify the main critical factors that enables the 5G technology to catalyze the growth of the IoT society and in turn, the smart cities. This study is qualitative and quantitative enumeration of all such factors that may lead one to safely conclude that "5G is indeed the primary driver of IoT". Various standard methodologies have been used here and eventually to identify a relational arrangement of the critical factors, Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) methodology has been adopted.

AB  - Context Biological invasions are characterized by dynamic spatiotemporal distribution patterns. Yet landscape scale distribution patterns of invasive species are rarely leveraged to understand invasion in a comprehensive manner.
   Objectives Characterize three key stages of invasion from the landscape scale distribution patterns for an invasive insect-Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), and investigate the potential spatial variability in establishment and impact risk.
   Methods The study focuses on the recent invasion of D. citri in Southern California's urban landscape. We used a combination of spatiotemporal pattern analyses and species distribution models (SDMs) to characterize the introduction, establishment and impact of D. citri invasion.
   Results Diaphorina citri detections in relation to major roadways revealed that initial detections are significantly closer to major roads than later detections, suggesting that transportation corridors serve as introduction pathways. SDMs of D. citri establishment and impact potential using presence-(pseudo)absence and abundance revealed percent impervious surface as the best landscape predictor. Inclusion of prior D. citri detections as a lagged spatiotemporal effect improved both model fit and performance suggesting that small-scale dispersal events do matter. Interestingly, interpolated risk maps based on the predicted occurrence and abundance highlighted substantial spatial variability in D. citri establishment and impact risk.
   Conclusions Our study demonstrates how examining spatiotemporal patterns of an invasive species is useful in inferring key stages of the invasion, and how occurrence and abundance information can be leveraged to quantify variability in establishment and impact risk. The study thus provides a useful baseline in formulating effective landscape-level management actions.

AB  - Expansion of cities is an international phenomenon that occurs mainly due to population growth. With the expansion of the new cities, the accessibility to the old cities might be affected. The focus of this research is on the governorate of Muscat in Oman and its old city, Greater Mutrah. Our aim is to investigate how the expansion of Muscat had affected the accessibility to the old city. This city was selected because of its inherent value in history, economy, and tourism in the country and the region. In order to understanding how the accessibility is affected in terms of vehicle movement, space syntax theory and its associated methodology -i.e. Axial Maps-is used. Using DepthMapX software, Integration radius 3 was calculated for the old city before and after the expansion of Muscat, and the data were analyzed statistically. The results showed that the expansion has positively affected the accessibility to the old city while altering the spatial structure within it. This paper contributes to interpret the spatial characteristics of the street networks and how these characteristics affect accessibility, and subsequently tourism attraction, to old cities.

AB  - The concept of "ecological network" comes from landscape ecology. It refers to reservoirs of biodiversity connected through corridors. The "Trame verte et bleue" (greenway) is an application of this ecological continuity concept in the French public policies. The "Trame verte et bleue" conveys different representations than those of the farmers. For them, more than corridors, hedges are viewed as barriers to the wind, prevent people and animals from moving, and require trees to be pruned. But hedges, as natural resources, are also come under intimate experience, and involve past generations and actors of the territory. Even though management approaches of farmers, city-dwellers and nature managers converge in mapping and categorizing natural resources, we advocate for a relational approach. This approach allows to recognize the diversity of forms those resources are qualified and managed.

AB  - Conscious of their high energy consumption and dissipation, metropolitan port areas lead transition and adaption policies to achieve and contribute to a global shift toward a low-carbon future. However, we may ask if the adaptation strategies and processes contribute to the greater resilience of port cities. Defining port cities as a system, this article examines this issue through the dynamic point of view of functional complexity, by analyzing the evolution, in time, of diversity (i.e. diversification of primary energy sources) and connectivity (i.e. development of intra- and inter-connectivity among industrial, agricultural and urban subsystems). Our research is embedded in and illustrated by the case study of Aix-Marseille-ProvenCe metropolitan port area (France).
   We show that the complexification processes of Marseille metropolitan port area are not linear and straightforward: they entail different phases characterized by different levels of diversity and connectivity. We identify co-evolving factors such as the development of new energy technological pathways, the emergence of a metropolitan dynamic or the change of business culture toward better cooperation, to explain these complexification dynamics. We discuss these results in regard to other metropolitan port contexts, especially in Asia, in order to assess to what extend the complexification processes of Marseille can enhance the understanding of global changes in industrial societies. We finally question the ability of these complexification strategies, implemented through industrial ecology approaches that do not deeply challenge the use of fossil energy, to respond to sustainability and resilience issues.

AB  - Urban road verges can contain significant biodiversity, contribute to structural connectivity between other urban greenspaces, and due to their proximity to road traffic are well placed to provide ecosystem services. Using the UK as a case study we review and critically evaluate a broad range of evidence to assess how this considerable potential can be enhanced despite financial, contractual and public opinion constraints. Reduced mowing frequency and other alterations would enhance biodiversity, aesthetics and pollination services, whilst delivering costs savings and potentially being publically acceptable. Retaining mature trees and planting additional ones is favourable to residents and would enhance biodiversity, pollution and climate regulation, carbon storage, and stormwater management. Optimising these services requires improved selection of tree species, and creating a more diverse tree stock. Due to establishment costs additional tree planting and maintenance could benefit from payment for ecosystem service schemes. Verges could also provide areas for cultivation of biofuels and possibly food production. Maximising the contribution of verges to urban biodiversity and ecosystem services is economical and becoming an increasingly urgent priority as the road network expands and other urban greenspace is lost, requiring enhancement of existing greenspace to facilitate sustainable urban development.

AB  - This study examines the improvement of juvenile fish recruitment by technical rehabilitation measures implemented in two urban waterways in Berlin, Germany: the River Spree and the Teltow Canal. Rehabilitation sites provide new littoral habitats protected from navigation-induced flow and wake wash and are intended to improve habitat quality for juvenile fish and to support urban fish diversity. Both sites and four control sites with common embankments have been sampled monthly by point electric fishing (875 dips in total) from May to September 2009. In total, 6,243 fish were caught representing 12 species. Two of the species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), dominated the fish community, comprising 81.5% and 16.1% of the total catch. Nine species were rare, with relative abundances <1%, which hampered more detailed species-specific analyses. Of the dips 33% contained no fish, causing zero-inflation of the dataset. A hurdle regression model confirmed positive effects of reduced hydraulic disturbances and resulting vegetation cover on juvenile fish occurrence. However, it also showed low oxygen concentrations limiting habitat quality, as observed at the older, densely vegetated rehabilitation site in the River Spree. The general improvement of the juvenile fish assemblage by the rehabilitation measure appeared rather low, as partially vegetated, rectangle trapeze and trapeze profile banks had even higher fish abundance. The study also revealed a need for adaptive maintenance to improve the long-term performance of this type of rehabilitation structure. With the recovery of aquatic vegetation, the technical bank protection should be adaptively removed to retain the connectivity with the main channel for a sufficient oxygen supply for the long-term functionality as a fish habitat.

AB  - The paper focuses on the position of the urban network and regional relations of sixteen countries of Central Europe based on the advanced producer services. The paper studies how the cities of Central Europe can be integrated into the global networks of advanced producer services, what kind of spatial structural impacts they have, and how it affects the position of the cities in the region. The paper examines the inner city relationships of the Central European region based on the cooperation networks developed by the advanced producer services (Daniels and Moulaert, 1991, Sassen, 1991, Taylor, 2001), and studies its impacts on the inner fractures of the space, whether the gravity center has modified in the last 25 years, whether new division lines occurred, and whether new inner peripheries developed. The paper also offers answer if the region stayed homogenous, if certain cities could close the gap with Western European cities, and if certain cities form new peripheries as a consequence of being unable to get integrated to the global processes.
   Hundred advanced producer services working in the field of management consultancy and accountancy identify seventy-nine cities in sixteen countries of Central-Europe as an empirical base for the study. The empirical study focuses on the network links among the cities with a presence of an advanced producer service, and offers discussion on the relationship matrix of the cities. According to Castell (1996) global spaces of flows develop as a result of the new type of spatial relations of advanced producer services. The development and spread of the information and communication technologies resulted in a multi-edged network, where cities functioning as significant business centers form the points of centralities in the tertiary world economy (Sassen, 2001). Examinations show, a strong centrality describe the urban structure of Central Europe.

AB  - Forest fragmentation, the process of changing original large and intact forest patches into smaller and isolated areas, significantly influences the balance of surface physical environment, biodiversity, and species richness. Sufficient knowledge of forest fragmentation is necessary to maintain ecological balance and promote sustainable resource utilization. This study combines remote sensing, geographical information systems, and landscape metrics to assess forest fragmentation at landscape and pixel levels during different time periods (2000-2005, 2005-2010, and 2010-2015) in the Yingkou region. Spatial statistical analysis is also used to analyze the relationship between forest landscape fragmentation and its determinants (e.g., natural factors, socioeconomic factors, and proximity factors). Results show that forest patches became smaller, subdivided, and isolated during 2010-2015 at the total landscape level. Local changes occurred in the southwest of the study region or around the development area. Our data also indicate that shrinkage and subdivision were the main forest fragmentation processes during three times, and attrition became the main forest fragmentation process from 2010 to 2015. These changes were significantly influenced by natural factors (e.g., elevation and slope), proximity factors (e.g., distance to city and distance to province roads), and socioeconomic factors (e.g., gross domestic product). Results presented in this study provide valuable insights into the pattern and processes of forest fragmentation and present direct implications for the protection and reasonable utilization of forest resources.

LA  - English
AB  - The Po Valley was occupied by the Etruscans starting in the 9th century BC. This presence experienced a significant transformation from the mid-6th century BC, when the territory underwent a widespread colonisation process, which brought about a new pattern in the organization of the landscape. A network of farms and secondary settlements appeared and expanded around both old and new cities. Through the structuring power and the analytical potential of GIS, this research develops new perspectives on the reconstruction of the ancient landscape. In addition to cultural aspects closely related to Etruscan society, in this study we have taken into consideration the role played by the resources of the territory itself, both from economic and the transport network points of view. First, we briefly present the conceptual and physical structure of the GIS. It includes an archive of all the known sites N of the Apennines (541), dating to between the 6th and 4th century BC (managed in a relational database), and a set of geographic and thematic data of general interest, recorded in the same cartographic reference system, handled with GIS software. Second, on the basis of certain distinctive characteristics of settlements such as the size of the occupied area, the internal organization and the building techniques employed, a possible hierarchical subdivision of the settlements is identified. Further, the optimal pathways between major cities are hypothesised considering factors such as slope and the presence of rivers or streams, and a possible road network is calculated using the MADO model (optimal accumulation model of movement from a given origin). The final aim is to propose a settlement model that can then be compared to the reality of the current archaeological record.

AB  - Urban sprawl has resulted in the permanent presence of large mammal species in urban areas, leading to human-wildlife conflicts. Wild boar Sus scrofa are establishing a permanent presence in many cities in Europe, with the largest German urban population occurring in Berlin. Despite their relatively long-term presence, there is little knowledge of colonization processes, dispersal patterns or connectivity of Berlin's populations, hampering the development of effective management plans. We used 13 microsatellite loci to genotype 387 adult and subadult wild boar from four urban forests, adjacent built-up areas and the surrounding rural forests. We applied genetic clustering algorithms to analyse the population genetic structure of the urban boar. We used approximate Bayesian computation to infer the boar's colonization history of the city. Finally, we used assignment tests to determine the origin of wild boar hunted in the urban built-up areas. The animals in three urban forests formed distinct genetic clusters, with the remaining samples all being assigned to one rural population. One urban cluster was founded by individuals from another urban cluster rather than by rural immigrants. The wild boar that had been harvested within urban built-up areas was predominantly assigned to the rural cluster surrounding the urban area, rather than to one of the urban clusters.Synthesis and applications. Our results are likely to have an immediate impact on management strategies for urban wild board populations in Berlin, because they show that there are not only distinct urban clusters, but also ongoing source-sink dynamics between urban and rural areas. It is therefore essential that the neighbouring Federal States of Berlin and Brandenburg develop common hunting plans to control the wild boar population and reduce conflicts in urban areas.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY:Globally, urban plant populations are becoming increasingly important, as these plants play a vital role in ameliorating effects of ecosystem disturbance and climate change. Urban environments act as filters to bioregional flora, presenting survival challenges to spontaneous plants. Yet, because of the paucity of inventory data on plants in landscapes both before and after urbanization, few studies have directly investigated this effect of urbanization.
   METHODS:We used historical, contemporary, and regional plant species inventories for Indianapolis, Indiana USA to evaluate how urbanization filters the bioregional flora based on species diversity, functional traits, and phylogenetic community structure.
   KEY RESULTS:Approximately 60% of the current regional flora was represented in the Indianapolis flora, both historically and presently. Native species that survived over time were significantly different in growth form, life form, and dispersal and pollination modes than those that were extirpated. Phylogenetically, the historical flora represented a random sample of the regional flora, while the current urban flora represented a nonrandom sample. Both graminoid habit and abiotic pollination are significantly more phylogenetically conserved than expected.
   CONCLUSIONS:Our results likely reflect the shift from agricultural cover to built environment, coupled with the influence of human preference, in shaping the current urban flora of Indianapolis. Based on our analyses, the urban environment of Indianapolis does filter the bioregional species pool. To the extent that these filters are shared by other cities and operate similarly, we may see increasingly homogenized urban floras across regions, with concurrent loss of evolutionary information.

AB  - The continuing worldwide increase in urbanization can potentially have a major impact on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, as anthropogenic changes to the environment are known to favor a few species of mosquitoes that can thrive in urban environments. Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) is found extensively in urban habitats, where it lives in degraded, polluted areas and is often the only species of mosquito capable to surviving under such conditions. Traditional mosquito control strategies no longer have the desired effect due to the several factors such as insecticide resistance, abundance of breeding sites, lack of proper sewage and sanitation, and absence of natural predator, leading Cx. quinquefasciatus populations to increase its numbers in cities. In this study, five Cx. quinquefasciatus populations were analyzed using 12 microsatellite markers to investigate whether the dynamics of these populations are being modulated by urbanization and how they are structured in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Our results indicate that only one of the study populations (the population from Anhanguera Park) exhibited evidence of expansion. The populations from Ibirapuera Park and Piqueri Park, the most urbanized regions of the areas studied, did not show signs of expansion. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the dispersal of Cx. quinquefasciatus and its colonization of new areas, as well as the species' demographic patterns and how these are associated with urbanization, particularly in areas undergoing a rural-to-urban transformation, such as Anhanguera Park, is of great importance for mosquito control.

AB  - This paper makes a parallel reading of two recent urban protest movements: the 2013 Istanbul Gezi Park Movement (GPM) and the 2014 Hong Kong Umbrella Movement (UM). As regional centers at both ends of Asia, Istanbul and Hong Kong might at frst sight appear to be incongruent cities for comparison. Istanbul's recent past has been defined by contrasting opinions about the city's post-imperial identity, while Hong Kong's recent past has been shaped by competing visions around the city's post-colonial status. Directing attention to the striking parallels between the GPM and UM in terms of the nature of the events themselves, the profile of the participants and opponents, the government response that they received, and the cultural sensitivities concerning the questions of belonging and identity that they rekindled, the paper argues that comparative studies of the new urban protest movements would provide significant insights for discerning the dynamics of emerging illiberal democracies across the world.

AB  - Much effort has been devoted to identify ecological and life-history traits which facilitate urban colonization by wild avian species, but surprisingly little is known about the population-level mechanisms of urbanization processes. In general, two different patterns of urban colonization have been proposed: 1) the model of independent colonization predicts that birds colonize cities independently in different geographical regions; 2) the model of leapfrog colonization assumes a single colonization event, while additional urban populations are established from the initial urban populations. The aim of this paper was to determine the pattern of urban colonization in a common waterbird, the Eurasian coot Fulica atra. For this purpose, we analysed microsatellite variation in three pairs of urban and rural coot populations from central Poland. We found that a newly-established urban population was genetically more similar to neighbouring rural populations than to long-established urban populations, as indicated by the analysis of fixation index, genetic distance and Bayesian assignment of individuals to genetic clusters. These results are consistent with the model of independent colonization, where neighbouring rural populations are a source of individuals that colonize new urban areas. However, our analysis also showed significant differentiation between long-established urban populations and adjacent rural populations, suggesting that genetic connectivity between two types of habitat decreases with increasing time since urbanization. Our study shows high complexity of urbanization processes in wild animal populations, as well as it underpins utility of molecular tools in studying population-level mechanisms of urbanization.

AB  - Projects focusing on the restoration of degraded ecosystems have to be financially appealing, spatially multiscaled, and ecologically efficient. Considering such premises, a model was elaborated to assess the locals in relation to the kind of management to be adopted (conservation or restoration) and, for locals indicated for restoration, the kind of restoration to be adopted (assisted or passive). Furthermore, we propose a set of ecologically-based alternatives at medium-and local-scaleto assist the restoration of areas considered unsuitable for passive restoration. Such techniques are: install artificial connectors among forest fragments near each other, or, for areas where forest fragments are far each other, install nucleation techniques, revitalization of concrete-lined urban rivers, and the control of erosion and invasive plant species. We tested the potential of our model through a case study carried out in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The study area is predominantly occupied by pasture lands, but urbanization also is an important land cover category. There are 661 forest fragments, being 25 of them larger than 50 ha. From the area considered "non-habitat", i.e., modified due to human usage, 35.5% of the total study area and 45.5% of the study area classified as non-habitat is suitable for passive restoration, and the rest of the area needs is suitable only for assisted restoration techniques. We verified that the facility and low cost of installation are advantageous features of such techniques and the results obtained by mean of application of the assisted techniques indicate that the alternatives tend to accelerate the process of establishing connectivity of the landscape in locals devoid of connections.

AB  - Location factors are vital elements for describing housing price variation. However, limited studies have explicitly illustrated the relationship between urban design and the heterogeneity of housing price patterns. This article specifically evaluates how the interactions between the spatial layouts and land-use system at various scales through street network affect the valuation of the residential properties and the segmentation of housing markets in a network-based Mixed-scale Hedonic Model (MHM) where the submarkets pattern are determined and annotated by the spatially varying estimates on streets. The application of the delivered method in the case of Shanghai City, China, confirms the necessity of using the non-Euclidean distance metric and represent the coexistence between the stationarity and the non-stationarity of the introduced street accessibility variables. The results provide evidence that the impacts of street accessibility measures on the local levels showcase significant spatial variation. It is common for all the places that the properties located on the streets with the higher levels of angular closeness, smaller values of angular betweenness and longer angular distance to the nearby land-uses at the larger scales will be bided higher. It is proven that our delineation of submarket performs better in prediction accuracy than the traditional submarket specifications. The detected submarkets pattern yields that reachable land-use diversity at the pedestrian level is not a preferred factor in the housing submarkets located in the developed city centres. The signs of the price effects of the angular distance to local land uses distinguish the developing submarkets as two main groups with different degrees of geometrical walkability. It is suggestive that continuously developing pedestrian-oriented neighbours in the walkable areas could contribute to decelerating the growth of house price in Chinese cities. The productions of this study can enrich the understanding of the socioeconomic effects of urban design with greater spatial precision across submarkets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization process transforms original landscapes into an anthropic mosaic, causing impacts on hydrologic cycles and on landscape structure and functions. Aiming at the maintenance of the water resources and biodiversity, in an urbanized watershed, the objective of this study was the definition of priority areas for forest restoration. We used a Multicriteria Evaluation (MCE) method, following the steps: criteria definition, identification of the criteria importance, and criteria aggregation through Weighted Linear Combination (WLC). According to the experts, consulted in the context of the Participatory Technique, only two criteria represented the studied landscape: proximity to drainage network and proximity to forest patches. The first criterion was considered twice more important than the second, and through the pairwise comparison matrix, it was obtained respectively the criterion weights of 0.83 and 0.17. The priority map was obtained through the criteria aggregation, using WLC, that considered the criterion weights. The result was a priority map, indicating 5.06% of the study area with very-high priority for forest restoration; 5.22% with high priority; 5.76% with medium priority; 5,42% with low and; 78.53% with very-low priority. We can say that the framework predefined for the study proposed a scenario for priority areas that allowed driving the actions in order to obtain a landscape restoration, beginning through a forest corridor in the riparian zone. Thus, we concluded that the definition of priority areas for forest restoration is possible in an urbanized landscape, using the traditional WLC Multicriteria method.

AB  - Vegetation structure and microhabitat availability and diversity affect ant assemblage diversity, growth, and dispersal. In this study, we described assemblages of ants nesting in twigs found in the leaf litter, comparing nest characteristics and ant colony sizes among different vegetation habitats at a regional scale. Twigs were collected in urban parks, Eucalyptus plantations, and preserved areas of native Atlantic Forest. We measured the twigs, counted the number of ant colonies, and estimated canopy openness. A total of 51,213 ants from 22 genera and 61 species were recorded. We collected 74, 141, and 283 nests in urban parks, Eucalyptus plantations, and native forest areas, respectively. The richest genera were Pheidole, Camponotus, and Solenopsis. Linepithema neotropicum, Gnamptogenys striatula, and Solenopsis sp.2 were recorded in all study areas. We found only one invasive species, Cardiocondyla wroughtonii. Typically, the canopy in urban park areas was more open, and these areas had lower species richness, lower rate of twig occupancy, and smaller diameter twigs occupied by smaller colonies compared to Eucalyptus plantations or native forest. Ant assemblages were determined mainly by vegetation habitat, followed by twig characteristics. As many ant species use twigs as nest site, twigs are critical habitats for maintaining ant diversity in the leaf litter of areas with varying degrees of complexity in the vegetation structure. However, the availability of twigs as nest resource depended on vegetation structure. In addition, twigs may increase the area occupied by the colonies of some ant species, including Wasmannia auropunctata, which was very frequent in urban parks.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have weakened biogeographical barriers to dispersal, thereby promoting the introduction, establishment and spread of alien species outside their native ranges. Several studies have identified a number of biological and ecological drivers that contribute to the establishment of plant species in the invaded range. One long-term factor that is generally accepted as a relevant determinant of invasion success is residence time, or time since first introduction into the new region. Residence time is often an important correlate of range extent in the invaded region, such that alien species with longer residence times in the novel environment tend to be more widely distributed. Plant species that were introduced in different regions at different times provide a unique opportunity to examine the effect of residence time on invasion success. In this paper, we examined how residence time affects the beta diversity of alien plants in selected urban floras of New Zealand and of English and Irish cities. We used an intercontinental plant exchange as a model system, comparing groups of species introduced to New Zealand and to the British Isles at different times (i.e., species native to the British Isles, British archaeophytes and British neophytes) and asked if differences in their beta diversity can be related to differences in their residence times. Our results suggest that observed patterns of beta diversity among the urban floras of New Zealand and of English and Irish cities can be attributed to a combination of residence time and of pre-adaptation to urban habitats that evolved, or were filtered in association with human activities, before the species were introduced into the invaded range.

AB  - Spatially explicit urban forest carbon estimation provides a baseline map for understanding the variation in forest vertical structure, informing sustainable forest management and urban planning. While high resolution remote sensing has proven promising for carbon mapping in highly fragmented urban landscapes, data cost and availability are the major obstacle prohibiting accurate, consistent, and repeated measurement of forest carbon pools in cities. This study aims to evaluate the uncertainties of forest carbon estimation in response to the combined impacts of remote sensing data resolution and neighborhood spatial patterns in Charlotte, North Carolina. The remote sensing data for carbon mapping were resampled to a range of resolutions, i.e., LiDAR point cloud density - 5.8, 4.6, 2.3, and 1.2 pt s/m(2), aerial optical NAIP (National Agricultural Imagery Program) imagery - 1, 5, 10, and 20 m. Urban spatial patterns were extracted to represent area, shape complexity, dispersion/interspersion, diversity, and connectivity of landscape patches across the residential neighborhoods with built-up densities from low, medium-low, medium-high, to high. Through statistical analyses, we found that changing remote sensing data resolution introduced noticeable uncertainties (variation) in forest carbon estimation at the neighborhood level. Higher uncertainties were caused by the change of LiDAR point density (causing 8.7 -11.0% of variation) than changing NAIP image resolution (causing 6.2-8.6% of variation). For both LiDAR and NAIP, urban neighborhoods with a higher degree of anthropogenic disturbance unveiled a higher level of uncertainty in carbon mapping. However, LiDAR-based results were more likely to be affected by landscape patch connectivity, and the NAIP-based estimation was found to be significantly influenced by the complexity of patch shape.

AB  - Tropical rainforest regions are urbanizing rapidly, yet the role of emerging metropolises in driving wildlife overharvesting in forests and inland waters is unknown. We present evidence of a large defaunation shadow around a rainforest metropolis. Using interviews with 392 rural fishers, we show that fishing has severely depleted a large-bodied keystone fish species, tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), with an impact extending over 1,000 km from the rainforest city of Manaus (population 2.1 million). There was strong evidence of defaunation within this area, including a 50% reduction in body size and catch rate (catch per unit effort). Our findings link these declines to city-based boats that provide rural fishers with reliable access to fish buyers and ice and likely impact rural fisher livelihoods and flooded forest biodiversity. This empirical evidence that urban markets can defaunate deep into rainforest wilderness has implications for other urbanizing socioecological systems.

AB  - Some organisms are able to disperse by air through passive or active flying and can colonize highly isolated habitat. We can hypothesis than aerial dispersions could be a process of biodiversity development even in isolated town habitats such as some building roofs.
   The urban aerial plankton has been poorly studied and we analyzed here the arthropods and seeds trapping small species limited to 0.5-5mm sizes and to a low part of the atmosphere (traps on roofs below 50 meters) in Paris, a center of a very large agglomeration. Using plates of wire meshes with fat, we observed that insects are dominant (Diptera and Hemiptera) when spiders and seeds appeared underrepresented.
   At high heights of buildings (and not at low heights), the Landscape Greening Index seems to have a strong positive effect on abundances for spiders, insects and seeds stressing the role of sources and the effect of building barriers on aerial dispersion. These preliminary data encourage research on this process. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Pathogenic and allergenic bacteria and fungi within the indoors can bring detrimental health effects on the occupants. We previously studied the bacterial communities found in households located throughout Hong Kong as well as the skin surfaces of the occupants. As a complementary study, here, we investigated the fungal communities (mycobiome) in the same residences and occupants and identified factors that are important in shaping their diversity, composition, distribution, and dispersal patterns.
   Results: We observed that common skin and environmental fungal taxa dominated air, surface, and skin samples. Individual and touch frequency strongly and respectively shaped the fungal community structure on occupant skin and residential surfaces. Cross-domain analysis revealed positive correlations between bacterial and fungal community diversity and composition, especially for skin samples. SourceTracker prediction suggested that some fungi can be transferred bidirectionally between surfaces and skin sites, but bacteria showed a stronger dispersal potential. In addition, we detected a modest but significant association between indoor airborne bacterial composition and geographic distance on a city-wide scale, a pattern not observed for fungi. However, the distance-decay effects were more pronounced at shorter local scale for both communities, and airflow might play a prominent role in driving the spatial variation of the indoor airborne mycobiome.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that occupants exert a weaker influence on surface fungal communities compared to bacterial communities, and local environmental factors, including air currents, appear to be stronger determinants of indoor airborne mycobiome than ventilation strategy, human occupancy, and room type.

AB  - Urban drainage systems that incorporate elements of green infrastructure (SuDS/GI) are central features in Blue-Green and Sponge Cities. Such approaches provide effective control of stormwater management whilst generating a range of other benefits. However these benefits often occur coincidentally and are not developed or maximised in the original design. Of all the benefits that may accrue, the relevant dominant benefits relating to specific locations and socio-environmental circumstances need to be established, so that flood management functions can be co-designed with these wider benefits to ensure both are achieved during system operation. The paper reviews a number of tools which can evaluate the multiple benefits of SuDS/GI interventions in a variety of ways and introduces new concepts of benefit intensity and benefit profile. Examples of how these concepts can be applied is provided in a case study of proposed SuDS/GI assets in the central area of Newcastle; UK. Ways in which SuDS/GI features can be actively extended to develop desired relevant dominant benefits are discussed; e.g., by (i) careful consideration of tree and vegetation planting to trap air pollution; (ii) extending linear SuDS systems such as swales to enhance urban connectivity of green space; and (iii) managing green roofs for the effective attenuation of noise or carbon sequestration. The paper concludes that more pro-active development of multiple benefits is possible through careful co-design to achieve the full extent of urban enhancement SuDS/GI schemes can offer.

AB  - In today's big cities, meteorological parameters causes climate changes at local and regional measure by changing because of different reasons such as; the decreasing of green places and evaporation of surfaces, increasing of structural areas and surfaces that covered with concrete and asphalt and also the materials having the features of transmitting the temperature better and making high temperature storage. So this big cities turn into places that having a unique climate and providing unhealthy thermal conditions to their citizens. Increasing of impermeable areas in the city because of buildings, roads and surfaces covered with furnishings, decreases the evaporation of soil considerably. And as a result this increases temperature storage under the surfaces. This underground temperature store causes higher temperatures on surfaces than the area covered with flora. So this effects the increasing of sensitive temperature change between surface and atmosphere and also upside radiation waves. In other side, high buildings having shadow effects on both surface and walls can cause temperature decreasing at nights. Notwithstanding, despite of shadow effects, hot surface temperatures with anthropogenic temperature which is occurred as a result of both industrial establishment and other human activities, causes higher temperatures in urban areas than rural areas.
   With quick growth of cities, micro climate changes are also observed and urban temperature islands occur. And with increasing of city structuring, temperatures in cities increase but in other side it's seen that surface temperatures decrease because of increasing seen in air condition and green places. In this research, the effects of green places on temperatures are observed for Batman city. Temperature between the area with the least flora and the area with the most intensive flora is counted. In this research, from http:/glovis.usgs.gov/ site at 30 m spatial resolution, satellite videos called Landsat TM ETM+ AND OLI/TIRS IN 1985 AND 2015 are used. With Erdas 2014 software Landsat TM satellite videos are brought together with layerstack. 3-2-1 band combination is selected in order to specify the urban areas. Controlled-classify is done especially with using Maximum Likelihood classify methodology. In closed land areas, specified with Controlled-classify are measured as hectare. Urban areas borders are revealed with Landsat TM satellite images with using Erdas 2014 software and then they are digitized with ArcGIS 10.3 software again. 1985 Landsat MSS satellite images are compared with other Landsat TM satellite images. With the help of the satellite images in 1985 and 2015, it is stated how changes are observed in that urban and areas used around. In addition, in period between 1985-2015, it is displayed in which areas the city has improved and enlarged. Also, in order to specify surface temperature, we get benefit from thermal bands Landsat TM ETM+ AND OLI/TIRS satellite images. This method has been applied to Batman city which has been growing since 1980. And according to tis application, relationship between green places and urban temperature is specified. It is stated that surface temperature is lower at green places than at urban structuring places. Green places and parks should be increased throughout the city in order to decrease the surface temperature and the number of the urban temperature islands. Also during the preparation of a new city plan we should be careful about structuring the weather corridors.

AB  - This study contributes to both the methodological and empirical literature by developing an integrative approach to assessing temporal and spatial change in riparian ecosystem service delivery by drawing on available and diverse data sets.These data sets act as multiple lines of evidence in supporting comparisons between data sets to test the validity of developed methods and the application of such methods. In order to synthesise these data as well as to determine the fluctuations in riparian ecosystem service provision a scoring system was developed. Methodologically, the scoring system proved informative across the majority of ecosystem services categories, showing close to 80% similarity in outcomes when comparing the scoring method to trends in long-term water quality measurements. Other benefits of the scoring system included its design simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and applicability and replicability across various urban settings. Empirically, the data sets used support the findings of the ecosystem services scoring exercise and suggests that fluctuations in ecosystem service delivery through time and across the river reaches are linked to land-use change and other human activities. Findings suggest that as water leaves an urban protected area and travels across transformed and impacted landscapes, the results are poor water quality and diminished ability of rivers to yield ecosystem services the further the river flows into the urban setting. Urbanisation and changes in land-uses in developing city contexts is therefore shown to affect potential ecosystem services benefits, necessitating increasing management interventions.

AB  - Diachronic analysis with a GIS-based classification of land-use changes based on aerial photographs, orthophotos, topographic maps, geotechnical reports, urban plans, and using landscape metrics has permitted insight into the driving forces responsible for landscape fragmentation in the Mont Saint-Hilaire (MSH) Biosphere Reserve over the period 1958-2015. Although the occurrence of exogenous factors, such as extreme weather and fires, can have a significant influence on the fragmentation of the territory in time and space, the accelerated development of the built environment (+470%) is nevertheless found to be primarily responsible for landscape fragmentation and the loss of areas formerly occupied by orchards, agriculture, and woodlands. The landscape metrics used corroborate these results, with a simplification of the shape of polygons, and once again reveal the difficulties of harmonizing different land uses. MSH has become somewhat of a forest island in a sea of residential development and agriculture. To counter this isolation of fragmented habitat components, forest corridors have been proposed and developed for the Biosphere Reserve and particularly for the core area. Two corridors, to the north and south, are used to connect the protected area and other wooded areas at the regional scale, in order to promote genetic exchange between populations of various species. In that regard, the forest buffer zone around the hill continues to play a key role and has great ecological value for species and ecological preservation and conservation. However, appropriate management and landscape preservation actions should recognize and focus on landscape composition and the associated geographical configuration.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Tropical plant communities in fragmented forests are likely to experience an extinction debt, i.e., the habitat cannot support as many species as are present due to reduced habitat size and connectivity. There are few estimates of the number of species that represent extinction debt, and the number of extinctions over time has rarely been recorded. We recorded population sizes to assess threats and extinctions in gingers (sensu Zingiberales) in fragmented rainforest in Singapore, ca. 200 yr after fragmentation began.
   METHODS: We surveyed extant diversity and population sizes of gingers and used the results to estimate species survival. We critically assessed historic specimens to estimate initial extinctions and extinctions realized in present habitats.
   KEY RESULTS: We recorded 23 species, including five species previously presumed nationally extinct and four species omitted from the national checklist. The revised extinction rate is much lower than previously reported (12 vs. 37%). Most gingers have very small populations or miniscule ranges, implying that extinction debt has not been paid off.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ginger diversity remains high, but the number of species at immediate risk of extinction outnumber recorded extinctions. Although tropical forest fragments remain arks of plant diversity for a long time, extinction debt may be prevalent in all plant groups in Singapore. Slow relaxation of extinction debt should be explicitly identified as a conservation challenge and opportunity. For conserving plant diversity in tropical fragments, relaxation must be reversed through restoration of degraded landscapes and, where feasible, targeted ex situ conservation and planting.

AB  - The study compares the on-going naturbanization processes in and around two Natural Parks under the impact of newcomers, but also tourists from Barcelona and Bucharest and their metropolitan areas. The landscape value of these areas attracts the urban population, which contributes to local sustainable development process but also promotes construction. New businesses associated with rural multifunctionality and value-added activities related to environmental quality were identified. New residents have contributed introducing responsible patterns of consumer, eco-entrepreneurship by women, recovery of abandoned buildings and intensification of rural-urban relationships. Negative impacts such as intensive construction of second homes, with a lower use, in some areas around Cadi-Moixero threaten biodiversity and habitat connectivity. Insufficient integration of environmental policies, particularly in the Comana wetlands, reduces the potential for rural renewal. Research methods included a review of the counterurbanization literature and the statistical data related to processes of naturbanization in both areas, along with the conduct of 30 structured interviews with key local actors in each area. Naturbanization still offers the potential to enhance local development; however, it is urgent to assess social perspectives in natural parks management in order to achieve environmentally friendly built-up areas.

AB  - Seedling recruitment shapes tree communities, including those found in altered landscapes such as urban forests. However, little data exists on local- and broad-scale tree seed immigration and recruitment in these communities. Interspecific competition and seed predation are two major causes of recruitment failure for plants. In North American urban forests, these pressures may be exacerbated by an altered disturbance regime and prevalent invasive species combined with dense populations of rodents and browsers. Preliminary investigation in an urban forest on the eastern shore of Lake Erie indicated very low long-term tree seedling recruitment in the mature canopy stands. Our competing hypotheses were that seed establishment (habitat suitability) and seed limitations (seed availability) explained the tree recruitment failure. We tested seed establishment using field experiments (burning and vertebrate herbivore exclosures) and seed limitation by introducing native tree seeds. Moreover, we tested also seed limitation by examining local and regional seed input using seed traps. We found that seedling recruitment increased significantly with experimental reductions in predators and competitors, suggesting strong biotic establishment limitations in the urban forest. In addition, seed rain correlated significantly with immediately proximate parent plants, but no species arrived beyond what occurs within 50 m of the experimental plots. Essentially, then, the existing canopy species are not replacing themselves and extant seeds are not immigrating to replace them. At the patch scale, habitat quality, particularly seed predation and browsing, as well as competition from nonnative understory shrubs, constrained native tree recruitment in the urban forest. At the landscape scale, the evidence of poor long-term seed recruitment and the lack of long-distance seed input also suggest low native tree seed availability. The tree recruitment failure suggests that, in the absence of active management, this urban forest may eventually convert to an invasive-species dominated urban shrubland.

AB  - Road and railway networks are pervasive elements of all environments, which have expanded intensively over the last century in all European countries. These transportation infrastructures have major impacts on the surrounding landscape, representing a threat to biodiversity. Roadsides and railways may function as corridors for dispersal of alien species in fragmented landscapes. However, only few studies have explored the spread of invasive species in relationship to transport network at large spatial scales. We performed a spatial mismatch analysis, based on a spatially explicit correlation test, to investigate whether alien plant species hotspots in Germany and Austria correspond to areas of high density of roads and railways. We tested this independently of the effects of dominant environments in each spatial unit, in order to focus just on the correlation between occurrence of alien species and density of linear transportation infrastructures. We found a significant spatial association between alien plant species hotspots distribution and roads and railways density in both countries. As expected, anthropogenic landscapes, such as urban areas, harbored more alien plant species, followed by water bodies. However, our findings suggested that the distribution of neobiota is strongest correlated to road/railways density than to land use composition. This study provides new evidence, from a transnational scale, that alien plants can use roadsides and rail networks as colonization corridors. Furthermore, our approach contributes to the understanding on alien plant species distribution at large spatial scale by the combination with spatial modeling procedures.

AB  - Although seed dispersal is a key process determining the regeneration and spread of invasive plant populations, few studies have explicitly addressed the link between dispersal vector behavior and seedling recruitment to gain insight into the invasion process within an urban garden context. We evaluated the role of bird vectors in the dispersal of pokeweed (Phytolacca americana), a North American herb that is invasive in urban gardens in China. Fruiting P. americana attracted both generalist and specialist bird species that fed on and dispersed its seeds. The generalist species Pycnonotus sinensis and Urocissa erythrorhyncha were the most frequent dispersers. Seedling numbers of P. americana were strongly associated with the perching behavior of frugivorous birds. If newly recruited bird species use seedling-safe perching sites, the P. americana will regenerate faster, which would enhance its invasive potential. Based on our observations, we conclude that the 2 main bird vectors, P. sinensis and U. erythrorhyncha, provide potential effective dispersal agents for P. americana. Our results highlight the role of native birds in seed dispersal of invasive plants in urban gardens.

AB  - Due to the special geographic locations and multiple typhoons a year, the frequent strong winds bring great discomfort and danger to the daily lives of the urban residents in southeast coast of China. The strategic design of landsenses pattern on different scales can help reduce gale days in urban areas while delivering diverse additional benefits such as pollution control and biodiversity habitat protection. Although the greatest gale days are observed in cold and damp winters, there is comparatively little information available for land managers to determine an appropriate strategy for landsenses pattern design under these climatic conditions. We present a framework for prioritization and selection of landsenses pattern for gale day reductions. The framework is supported by examining the relationships between urban landsenses pattern evolution and gale day mitigation in the past, with which we used to develop implementation guidelines that maximize reductions of urban surface gale days. We focus particularly on quantifying the benefits of four types of landsenses: land-use patterns, urban road network, architectural patterns, and vertical greening systems (green walls and facades) and demonstrate how to apply the framework with a case study from Pingtan Island, China.

AB  - Context. Brazil has one of the richest biodiversity and one of the most extensive road networks in the world. Several negative impacts emerge from this interaction, including wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC), which may represent a significant source of non-natural mortality in several species. The understanding of the main drivers of WVC is, therefore, crucial to improve the safe coexistence between human needs (transportation of goods and people) and animal populations.
   Aims. We aimed to (1) evaluate the relative influence of land-cover patterns on the distribution of WVC, (2) assess whether WVCs are clustered forming hotspots of mortality, and, if so, (3) evaluate the benefits of mitigating only hotspot sections.
   Methods. We collected WVC data involving medium-large mammals (4-260 kg) along three road transects (920 km), fortnightly over 1 year (n = 1006 records). We used boosted regression trees to relate the WVC locations with a set of environmental variables including a roadkill index, reflecting overall habitat suitability and landscape connectivity, while accounting for spatial autocorrelation effects. We identified hotspots of mortality using Ripley's K statistic and testing whether data follow a random Poisson distribution correcting for Type I error.
   Key results. We found a strong association between WVC probability and roadkill index for all focal species. Distance to riparian areas, tree cover, terrain ruggedness and distance to urban areas were also important predictors, although to a lesser extent. We detected 21 hotspots of mortality, yet with little spatial overlapping as only four road sections (2%) were classified as hotspot for more than one species.
   Conclusions. Our results supported that WVC mainly occur in road sections traversing areas with more abundant and diverse mammal communities. Hotspots of mortality may provide important information to prioritise road sections for mitigation, but this should be used in complement with roadkill indexes accounting for overall mortality.
   Implications. The results support focusing on hotspots and habitat quality and landscape connectivity for a better assessment of road mortality. At the local scale, a larger number and improved road passages with exclusionary fencing of appropriate mesh size in riparian areas may provide safe crossings for many species and constitute a promising mitigation measure.

AB  - Little is currently known about the spatial-temporal dynamics of dengue epidemics in arid areas. This study assesses dengue outbreaks that occurred in two arid cities of Mexico, Hermosillo and Navojoa, located in northern state of Sonora. Laboratory confirmed dengue cases from Hermosillo (N = 2730) and Navojoa (N = 493) were geocoded by residence and assigned neighborhood-level characteristics from the 2010 Mexican census. Kernel density and Space-time cluster analysis was performed to detect high density areas and space-time clusters of dengue. Ordinary Least Square regression was used to assess the changing socioeconomic characteristics of cases over the course of the outbreaks. Both cities exhibited contiguous patterns of space-time clustering. Initial areas of dissemination were characterized in both cities by high population density, high percentage of occupied houses, and lack of healthcare. Future research and control efforts in these regions should consider these space-time and socioeconomic patterns. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study focuses on a representative region of the Mediterranean area with the objective to analyse the landscape's dynamics, to detect the spatial arrangement of class patches, to identify the main agroecosystem characters and to provide a framework to assess ecosystems services. In order to assess land use/land cover changes and landscape persistence, the period between 1960 and 2012 was analysed, taking into consideration the years 1960, 2000 and 2012 using comparable land use maps. Land use and land cover analysis show an urban area growth of 24% during 2000-2012 and of 523% over between 1960 and 2012. The very high levels of land abandonment up to the year 2000 (+7216%) have reversed their trend between 2000 and 2012 (-95%). The orchards showed a relevant increase, particularly after 2000, while the vineyards were linked to the highest value of surface erosion (-74%). The outcomes showed that urban settlements can damage the ecological network with negative effects on the landscape's environmental sustainability in proximity of significant urban centres. Instead, the ecological network is well preserved and highly associated to the agricultural areas when there is the persistence of many land uses and low urban density, despite the presence of dynamic changes.

AB  - In an ever-changing urban landscape, connectivity in terms of walkability is emerging as a major factor when considering urban design. When a city experiences rapid development, it also contributes to an increased homogenization of big city blocks. The acquisition of smaller buildings creates bigger and more modern blocks that not only cause gentrification in terms of population and commercial diversities but also decreases the permeability of streets. This will in turn reduce the walkability of the streets due to the limited numbers of corners and intersections a pedestrian can choose to follow. Rapid development causes the disappearance of historical enclaves where some of the major streets and pedestrianized areas lose their local streetscape identity. This theoretical urban design projection is located at Le Loi in district 1 of Ho Chi Minh City where there is the Municipal Theatre, the Saigon Tax Trade Centre and various avant-garde hotels that were constructed during the French colonial period. The site is also located perpendicular to the newly developed Ngu Yen Hue Boulevard with restrictions in creating any form of activities on this boulevard. To undermine these restrictions, a cultural catalyst approach is identified as the most suitable due to the prevalent nature of how the road becomes the hot spot for cultural activities such as the Lunar Flower Festival held every year. The site has the most cultural and heritage value and is made as the focal point of the design. Concepts are formulated to enhance the experiences of the site where nodes are established as main catalysts for connectivity. The generative concepts are based on the idea of the Situationists International where a bottom-up approach is preferred. These concepts are Derive, Detournment and Stage Cinematics. Translation of these concepts into the proposed schemes will at its core assist in the revitalization of the site by injecting an ever-changing routes and paths, allowing for increased diversity in land-use, cultural activities and urban typologies respectively. These concepts will generate an ever-changing experience of the spaces throughout the year.

AB  - Detroit has a vibrant urban agriculture movement as well as an abundance of vacant land, much of which has come into city ownership through foreclosure. Despite the presence of a land bank and a supportive agricultural ordinance, growers struggle to gain long-term access to and ownership of land on which to farm. Using in-depth interviews with growers and their advocates, community development experts, and city and land bank officials, I discuss the specific challenges that urban growers face and related anxieties communicated by city and land bank officials. Anxieties include commonly held perceptions of the polarity between "urban" and "agriculture," as well as a fear that agriculture may not last. In the absence of an updated master plan, another anxiety relates to land disposition serving as the de facto vision for the city's future. These anxieties reflect the dominance of growth regime frameworks in current governance. I outline the elements of an alternative framework that weaves together agriculture and redevelopment and discuss its prospects at least for the near term.

AB  - The Transition movement has experienced remarkable growth in its first decade, yet there remains considerable doubt about its ability to appeal to a diverse audience. To date, few studies have explicitly examined diversity of participation in the movement. Addressing this gap in the literature, a case study is presented of Transition Town Tooting (TTT). Results from a mixed methods approach comprising semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and a quantitative survey indicate that the demographic profiles of TTT participants do not represent the diversity of the Tooting population. This disparity is exacerbated by TTT's 'passive' approach to inclusivity within the core group. Reflecting upon the implications for Transition's goal of local resilience, it is suggested that, particularly within dense urban communities, initiatives may have more potential for engaging diverse voices through a local 'brokering' role between various subcommunities.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are relatively recent and heavily human-altered terrestrial ecosystems with a surprisingly high diversity of animals, plants and other organisms. Urban habitats are also strongly fragmented and subject to higher temperatures, providing a compelling model for studying adaptation to global change. Crepis sancta (Asteraceae), an annual Mediterranean wasteland weed, occupies fragmented urban environments as well as certain unfragmented landscapes in southern France. We tested for shifts in dispersal, reproductive traits and size across a rural-urban gradient to learn whether and how selection may be driving changes in life history in urban and fragmented habitats. We specifically compared the structure of quantitative genetic variation and of neutral markers (microsatellites) between urban and rural and between fragmented and unfragmented habitats. We showed that fragmentation provides a better descriptor of trait variation than urbanization per se for dispersal traits. Fragmentation also affected reproductive traits and plant size though one rural population did conform to this scheme. Our study shows the role of fragmentation for dispersal traits shift in urban environments and a more complex pattern for other traits. We discuss the role of pollinator scarcity and an inhospitable matrix as drivers of adaptation.

AB  - Impact mitigation practices are currently one of the hottest topics in conservation and regarded as priorities worldwide. Forest bat populations are known to provide important ecosystem services such as pest control and bat boxes have become one of the most popular management options for counteracting the loss of roosts. However, bat boxes tend to be employed in non-native forests near highly humanized areas where human disturbance is higher. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the surrounding landscape composition affects bat box occupancy in urban non-native forests along the Mediterranean corridor in the Northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Two hundred wooden bat boxes were monitored in young non-native forests in the period 2004-2012. The influence of land cover on occupancy rate of bat boxes was analysed at the landscape level in a 5 km buffer around bat-box stations. In total, 1659 inspections were carried out, in which a 15 % occupancy rate was detected. Bat boxes hosted three different species (Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri). More than 70 % of the occupancy can be explained by habitat and spatial composition. The presence of urban areas around bat boxes tends to have a negative impact on bat occupation rates; by contrast, forest coverage has a positive effect, especially for the tree-dwelling bats. These patterns could be associated with the large number of available roosts in buildings, microhabitat or phylopatry. Thus, to increase success, we suggest that landscape composition should be considered when using bat boxes for conservation.

AB  - Management of urban hydrologic processes using green infrastructure (GI) has largely focused on storm water management. Thus, design and implementation of GI usually rely on physical site characteristics and local rainfall patterns, and do not typically account for human or social dimensions. This traditional approach leads to highly centralized storm water management in a disconnected urban landscape and can deemphasize additional benefits that GI offers, such as increased property value, greenspace aesthetics, heat island amelioration, carbon sequestration, and habitat for biodiversity. We propose the Framework for Adaptive Socio-Hydrology (FrASH) in which GI planning and implementation moves from a purely hydrology-driven perspective to an integrated sociohydrological approach. This allows for an iterative, multifaceted decision-making process that would enable a network of stakeholders to collaboratively set a dynamic, context-guided project plan for the installation of GI, rather than a "one-size-fits-all'' installation. We explain how different sectors (e.g., governance, nongovernmental organizations, communities, academia, and industry) can create a connected network of organizations that work toward a common goal. Through a graphical Chambered Nautilus model, FrASH is experimentally applied to contrasting GI case studies and shows that this multistakeholder, connected, decentralized network with a coevolving decision-making project plan results in enhanced multifunctionality, potentially allowing for the management of resilience in urban systems at multiple scales.
   Plain Language Summary What is green infrastructure? A rain garden? Or a nicely maintained yard? Is it a planted space in a city that might catch a little rain and prevent puddling on the sidewalk? It is all of these, but green infrastructure is also about managing water, how people engage with water, and their environment. How do we know if green infrastructure is attractive? Who wanted it, and why? Our research recognizes that there are social and technological dimensions to green infrastructure, and to be successful at both, we need to connect people's interests with the technical side. We looked at common issues in linking social sciences with hydrology and gave it this name: Framework for Adaptive Socio-Hydrology (FrASH). With FrASH we explain the importance of including people and their needs in the green infrastructure design process to avoid "one-size-fits-all'' installations. Our colored graphics show how different sectors (e.g., governance) or their services (e.g., ecosystem services) can create a connected network of organizations that work toward the common goal of designing green space. With these examples, we highlight that FrASH can give citizens a way of investing in and managing their environment through this broader conception of green infrastructure.

AB  - Modeling human mobility is a critical task in fields such as urban planning, ecology, and epidemiology. Given the current use of mobile phones, there is an abundance of data that can be used to create models of high reliability. Existing techniques can reveal the macro-patterns of crowd movement, or analyze the trajectory of an individual object; however, they focus on geographical characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel data representation, the mobility transition graph, to characterize spatio-temporal mobility transition of crowd from city-wide human mobility data. We describe the design, creation, and manipulation of the mobility transition graph and demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by a case study.

AB  - Atmospheric dispersal of bacteria is increasingly acknowledged as an important factor influencing bacterial community biodiversity, biogeography and bacteria-human interactions, including those linked to human health. However, knowledge about patterns in microbial aerobiology is still relatively scarce, and this can be attributed, in part, to a lack of consensus on appropriate sampling and analytical methodology. In this study, three different methods were used to investigate aerial biodiversity over Svalbard: impaction, membrane filtration and drop plates. Sites around Svalbard were selected due to their relatively remote location, low human population, geographical location with respect to air movement and the tradition and history of scientific investigation on the archipelago, ensuring the presence of existing research infrastructure. The aerial bacterial biodiversity found was similar to that described in other aerobiological studies from both polar and non-polar environments, with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes being the predominant groups. Twelve different phyla were detected in the air collected above Svalbard, although the diversity was considerably lower than in urban environments elsewhere. However, only 58 of 196 bacterial genera detected were consistently present, suggesting potentially higher levels of heterogeneity. Viable bacteria were present at all sampling locations, showing that living bacteria are ubiquitous in the air around Svalbard. Sampling location influenced the results obtained, as did sampling method. Specifically, impaction with a Sartorius MD8 produced a significantly higher number of viable colony forming units (CFUs) than drop plates alone.

AB  - The restoration of degraded forests to enhance biodiversity, ecosystem services, as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation is now a major priority in cities around the world. This study evaluated the success of the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project in Durban, South Africa, by assessing ecological attributes. Measures of plant richness, diversity, vegetation structure, invasive alien plants (IAPs) and ecological processes were contrasted across a chronosequence of habitats under restoration (0-year-old, 3-year-old and 5-year-old) and compared with a reference forest habitat (remnant natural forest). Native tree species recruitment and vegetation structure increased with restoration age. Ecological processes, represented by the composition of pollination and seed dispersal traits in all of the habitats under restoration, were similar to the reference habitat. However, low tree density and an increase in IAP cover with an increase in restoration age were identified as threats to reforestation success. We recommend enrichment planting and an effective IAP management strategy to promote more rapid habitat restoration while reducing site maintenance costs. Enrichment planting should not only focus on increasing tree species density and richness, but also on the inclusion of species with missing pollination and seed dispersal categories.

AB  - Land-use change threatens biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide. These changes have impacts on weather patterns, carbon storage, biodiversity, and other ecosystem services from regional to local scales. Only 8 percent of tropical forests are formally recognized as conservation areas, however globally, there is a network of sites that are protected because they are sacred and as a result act as shadow' conservation for biodiversity. Unlike other types of protected sites (e.g., national parks), these sites are seats of religious ritual that anchor a community's cultural identity, while also conserving biological diversity and other ecosystem services. We studied the extent and status of sacred forests in northern Ethiopia, which are threatened because of their small size (similar to 5ha) and isolation, increasing their exposure to edge effects and human pressures. Using historical and modern imagery, we found that over the last 50yr, sacred forests have increased in area, but decreased in crown closure. We also found that forest ecological status, via ground-level investigation, had high mean human disturbance (e.g., trails, plantations, exotic planting; 37%); and that forests close to markets (e.g., cities) increased in area due to planting of Eucalyptus (exotic), indicating a potential threat to their persistence and value as shelters of the church.

AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera, Culicidae) occur in natural, urban, and peri-urban areas throughout the globe. Although the characteristics of urban and peri-urban habitats differ from those of natural habitats in many ways (e.g., fragmentation, pollution, noise, and light), few studies have examined the population connectivity of mosquitoes in urban areas. To obtain an overview of the species composition, we sampled mosquitoes from 23 sites in and around the city of Berlin, Germany. Of 23 species, five occurred in urban, 10 in peri-urban, and 20 in rural areas. Culex pipiens Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) was the most common species collected (75% of all individuals) and occurred in all habitats. Hence this species was selected to be analysed at 10 microsatellite markers. There was no significant differentiation (F-ST = 0.016, P = 0.9) or isolation by distance (P = 0.06) among Cx. pipiens populations along an urban-rural gradient. The only significant differences detected were between Cx. pipiens and a laboratory population of Cx. pipiens f. molestus (pairwise F-ST = 0.114-0.148, P = 0.001 in all comparisons), suggesting that the markers chosen were suitable for the identification of population differentiation. Our results indicate that Cx. pipiens gene flow is widespread within and among urban, peri-urban, and rural areas and that urban habitat does not necessarily impede or enhance gene flow among these populations.

AB  - Urban sociologists and, criminologists have long been interested in the link between neighborhood isolation and crime. Yet studies have focused predominantly on the internal dimension of social isolation (i.e., increased social disorganization and insufficient jobs and opportunities). This study highlights the need to assess the external dimension of neighborhood isolation, the disconnectedness from other neighbor-hoods in the city. Analyses of Chicago's neighborhood commuting network over twelve years (2002-2013) showed that violence predicted network isolation. Moreover, pairwise similarity in neighborhood violence predicted commuting ties, supporting homophily expectations. Violence homophily affected tie formation most, while neighborhood violence was important in dissolving ties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper is focused on the conurbations, extensive urban areas resulting from the expansion and coalescence of several neighbouring cities. Two theses underlay the research. The first is that, in the development of a conurbation, traffic has actually a role of 'maker and breaker of cities', just to paraphrase the title of a well-known article by Colin Clark, focusing on the double role of roads and traffic in urban development: on a one hand, the making of a unique road network, encompassing the whole grid, actually allows movement and interaction all over the settlement, making possible the working of the conurbation as a wide urban system; on the other hand, the resulting pattern of movement concentrates its major flows on few roads connecting the original nuclei and the new development areas, actually bypassing the pre-existing urban fabric and diverting a significant amount of local traffic from the streets of the urban grid, what involves the loss of the fertilisation benefit the irrigation of through movement provides. The second thesis, complementary to the former, is that the merging of the nuclei and their embedding into a conurbation reduces the resilience of the whole settlement, in that it affects the capability of the system to adsorb accidental events and transformations without significantly changing its global behaviour.
   The phenomenon of conurbations and the diachronic analysis of their resilience will here be observed from a configurational point of view, analysing by means of space syntax techniques the urban settlement of Florence, here assumed as an ideal case study. The results are expected to objectively describe the role of inter-urban roads in the making of a conurbation, and to appraise the extent to which their entanglement within the whole concur in transforming its inner geography and enhancing its global vulnerability. More in general, the configurational approach, suitable for appraising the urban grid as the interface between the physical city and the phenomena that occur along its paths, once again proves its usefulness in linking spatial issues and traffic questions, so as to bridge the traditional gap between urban design, focused on the morphologic features of blocks and buildings, and transport analysis, strictly concerned with the distribution of movement flows on the streets network.

AB  - Nothing appears far removed from each other between the 2014 Occupy Central Movement in Hong Kong as a global city and the concerns and aspirations of the residents of Heyang, an ancient village in the hinterland of Zhejiang province, China. However, through a journey of research as communicative praxis that starts with an analysis of the framing of the Occupy Central Movement by China's People's Daily and ends with my active engagement with residents in Heyang, both in terms of their understanding of the Movement and their own local situations, this study arrived at moments of unexpected empathy. When lived experiences of the economically alienated were connected, rural citizens in Mainland China could relate their own ongoing struggles with that of protesters at the Occupy Central Movement in profound ways translocally, despite the chasms between the urban and the rural, the global city and the rural hinterland in today's China.

AB  - The urbanization movement started with the Industrial Revolution and spread throughout the world to many countries. Migration from rural areas to urban areas in particular has caused spatial changes in our country. Urban development has accelerated and increased also in Turkey after the 1980s which has started to put pressure on the important natural resource areas in the vicinity of urban areas. The pressure has developed following urban development and is felt more strongly every day in the national parks which hold a significant position among protected areas. Yozgat camligi National Park which is the study area is located near Yozgat city center. The objective of this study is to determine the spatial changes incurring in Yozgat city center during the past 50 years as well as manifest the socio-spatial impacts of this urban development on national park. In line with this objective the zoning plans for the years 1960, 1980, 2010 and afterwards have been studied to assess the spatial development of Yozgat city and mapped by transferring them into a GIS setting. Furthermore face to face interviews and observations were carried out in the field to assess the socio-spatial impacts of urban development on national park. As a result of the findings obtained from the field studies Yozgat camligi National Park and Yozgat city have intertwined with the impact of urban development and in the ongoing process the national park-urban affiliation have been affected by each other.

AB  - Many urban areas located at the forest edge maintain a high connection to the forest, either because forests provide resources and services that act as safety nets for the poor or because they represent a cultural link to traditional lifestyles. However, in conflict areas, this link to the forest may have been disrupted, either because conflict exacerbates forest degradation, or because people are alienated from their lands by the conflict and have therefore less access to forest resources, or because the frequent movement of people from towns to rural areas and backwards is limited by insecurity and poor transportation means. In this study, we assessed the nutritional status of teenagers living in Quibdo, a forest town that lies at the centre of Colombia's long history of political conflicts, and analysed the role that wild animals (wild fish and wildmeat) still play on their food security. While our analysis clearly showed that wild animals significantly contribute to dietary diversity, food and nutrition insecurity prevailed among teenagers, especially among the poorest families. Our results suggested that post-conflict policies should explicitly promote integrated approaches to reduce food insecurity and value biodiversity for its role in reducing malnutrition.

AB  - Urban problemssuch as resources depletion, environment pollution and waste generationusually occur during rapid urbanisation processes, especially in mega-urban agglomerations. Finding solutions to sustainable urban development is a global research interest, and urban metabolism is an effective approach to analysing the socio-economic system and ecosystem. In this study, three cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration in ChinaBeijing, Tianjin and Tangshanwere selected as study cases. Multiscale integrated analysis of the societal and ecosystem metabolism (MuSIASEM) method and complete decomposition model were applied to reveal the metabolic characteristics and evolutionary trajectories of the three cities from multiple levels and dimensions. Results showed that the metabolic patterns of Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan were service-dominated, technology and capital aggregation-dominated and traditional industry-dominated, respectively. The evolution of economic efficiency, ecological pressure and social welfare in the three cities were different because of the stage of urban development where they were located. Tianjin and Tangshan showed positive correlations between economic growth and energy consumption, whereas Beijing demonstrated a more neutral correlation. In the future, issuessuch as overpopulation, labour shortage and low efficiency of energy and labourare likely to be the key factors that impede sustainable development in the three cities, respectively. Several policy implications were raised, including the combination of population dispersal and competitive industry relocation policies for Beijing, attracting young labour in the short term and transforming the economic growth patterns in the long term for Tianjin, and industrial upgrades and technical innovation for Tangshan.

AB  - Context Many aquatic communities are linked by the aerial dispersal of multiple, interacting species and are thus structured by processes occurring in both the aquatic and terrestrial compartments of the ecosystem.
   Objectives To evaluate the environmental factors shaping the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities associated with tank bromeliads in an urban landscape.
   Methods Thirty-two bromeliads were georeferenced to assess the spatial distribution of the aquatic metahabitat in one city. The relative influence of the aquatic and terrestrial habitats on the structure of macroin-vertebrate communities was analyzed at four spatial scales (radius = 10, 30, 50, and 70 m) using redundancy analyses.
   Results We sorted 18,352 aquatic macroinvertebrates into 29 taxa. Water volume and the amount of organic matter explained a significant part of the taxa variance, regardless of spatial scale. The remaining variance was explained by the meta-habitat size (i.e., the water volume for all of the bromeliads within a given surface area), the distance to the nearest building at small scales, and the surface area of buildings plus ground cover at larger scales. At small scales, the meta-habitat size influenced the two most frequent mosquito species in opposite ways, suggesting spatial competition and coexistence. Greater vegetation cover favored the presence of a top predator.
   Conclusions The size of the meta-habitat and urban landscape characteristics influence the structure of aquatic communities in tank bromeliads, including mosquito larval abundance. Modifications to this landscape will affect both the terrestrial and aquatic compartments of the urban ecosystem, offering prospects for mosquito management during urban planning.

AB  - Compensating for the adverse ecological impacts of waterway development and improving their ecological functioning to achieve good ecological potential (GEP) have become mandatory within the European Union (EU). The technical rehabilitation measures presented here aim to functionally minimize the hydraulic impacts of navigation on aquatic biota in highly urbanized waterways. Their ecological functioning and potential to enhance biodiversity locally was assessed by comparing their macro-invertebrate community composition with nearby non-restored sites. Rehabilitation led to lower hydraulic impact on the littoral zone, which in turn led to the presence of otherwise missing macrophytes and the occurrence of organic mud habitats colonized by invertebrates typically rare in urban waterways. While the control sites were dominated by few, mostly invasive taxa in vast numbers, the rehabilitated sites exhibited a highly diverse community with 22 protected mollusc and insect taxa typically found in the oxbow communities of natural rivers. This major improvement was however not detected using the core metrics of the legally required national assessment tools of the EU Water Framework Directive. Overall results proved the success of this type of rehabilitation measure with respect to improving biodiversity, but they also showed the limiting and key factors influencing the macro-invertebrate communities of highly deteriorated urban waterways. Indeed, future implementations of this type of rehabilitation measure should consider spatial extent, water exchange rates, temporal succession of vegetation and adaptive management to improve its ecological functioning.

AB  - While there are extensive studies of urban 2D forms, research on the varying geometric features and spatial distribution patterns of urban 3D spaces is comparatively rare. In this paper, we propose a coupled model, known as BPANN-CBRSortCA, which is based on a back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) and case-based reasoning technology with sort cellular automaton (CBRSortCA) to simulate future urban building heights and their spatial distribution. BPANN-CBRSortCA uses BPANN to predict the vertical extrusion of building heights and uses CBRSortCA to simulate horizontal urban expansion. The BPANN-CBRSortCA model is innovative because of its capabilities to simultaneously project urban growth in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. The proposed model also overcomes the limitations of the traditional cellular automata models that cannot simulate 'diffused' urban expansion. This research used Wuhan City as a case study to simulate vertical and horizontal urban expansion from 2015 to 2025. The results showed the following: (1) in the next 10 years, new build-up will mainly appear along the edge of Hongshan and Hanyang Districts or will occupy bare land in the form of 'filling' and (2) the tallest buildings will be mainly located to the south of East Lake in Hongshan District and on undeveloped land within the city. These simulation results can provide a reference for future urban planning.

AB  - There are a large number of cultural and natural landscapes aggregating and emerging in the ancient tea horse road. Accurately grasp the dynamic change process of landscape pattern in the area, and analysis natural and human driving force in the landscape pattern evolution of history heritage corridor ancient tea horse road that play the role, for to formulate ecological protection planning of the historical and cultural heritage corridor have great significance. This paper selects these towns and villages which stand along the typically initial segment of the ancient tea horse road i.e. route of Simao to Ninger that as the research object. It uses 1999,2006 and 2013 Landsat TM and ETM remote sensing images as the basic data, and integrating use of RS, GIS and landscape ecology related theory methods, and analyses the characteristics of the landscape dynamic evolution and driving forces and driving mechanism for 14 years in this research area. The results show that has significant changes landscape pattern in study area from 1999 to 2013. The main conclusions are as follows. From the level of types, reduction amount of the forest area is the most, a reduction of 7%, the fragmentation degree increases. Urban construction land shows an overall growth trend, its area increases significantly, an increase of 22.3%, the degree of aggregation increases, the connectivity of urban construction land strengthens, and the patch shape tends to be simple. The area of grassland and water overall area trends to increase. The area of cultivated land trends to increase. From the level of landscapes, in this study area, landscape patch density continues to decrease, the total number of landscape patches continues to reduce, on the whole, the landscape patch distribution becomes more continuous, tends to fusion between patches. Landscape separation index trends to be rising, distribution of landscape types tends to be complex and discrete, individual patches are sporadic, scattered. The landscape of the Shannon diversity index and Shannon evenness index shows a certain rising trend, the diversity of landscape structure is increasing. The rising of Shannon evenness index shows that the control force of the original landscape that was in dominant position on the whole landscape is declining, and influence of different landscape types on the whole landscape pattern tends to equilibrium. This research focuses on the analysis on the driving factors and driving mechanism of the evolution of landscape pattern in the study area from natural factors and human factors. The result shows that topographic factors, demographic factors, economic factors, industrialization and urbanization factors, economic system and decision making factors affect the change of landscape pattern jointly. Meanwhile, at different spatial scales and time scales, the main driving forces which have influence on the landscape pattern are not the same.

AB  - Rural areas show a great diversity of activities and configurations alongside a complex network of articulations among economic sectors and with urban centers. The boundary between what is considered rural and what is considered urban is increasingly blurred. Rurality is a complex system, with a varied range of rural areas (Berdegue, Jara, Modrego, Sanclemente and Schejtman, 2010). The differences in terms of habitat, economy, and access to basic services in both contexts are variables that affect their specificity as unique territories. Projected interventions for rural areas, in any field, should have a specific aim for actors with unique needs. We take the concept of habitability within the intervention framework of a current Chilean public policy, in which interventions are applied as to improve the habitability condition of vulnerable families with the same intervention guidelines in rural and urban settings.

AB  - The present work explores the relationship between an urban road with both, socio-metabolic processes and natural systems patterns. The premise is that roads have a decisive impact on energy, material flows and connectivity between biological structures. Therefore, urban metabolism - Social and natural processes measured out of energy use, material flows and land use - becomes the appropriate instrument to assess and analyze the functionality of the different components operating in artificial and natural systems. The case study traces the metabolic behaviors that result from the cross of Juan Ponce de Leon Avenue through the water system composed by the estuary of Martin Pena and Rio Piedras River. A theoretical framework based on social equity, economy, and ecology is being applied in data collection and analysis. Parametric methodologies and GIS information are used to describe the structural and functional properties of both natural and urban systems. The collected data enable the understanding that the simultaneous loss of energy efficiency and land-use efficiency from the mid-20th century to the present affects the resilience of the area. Consequently, this exploration demonstrates the importance of urban metabolism in maintaining the ecological quality of natural systems. As a result, it proposes an urban metabolism strategy to develop more sustainable urban schemes for the systems composed of urban roads and natural ecosystems. The organized complexity of the water system, necessary to host biodiversity and fundamental ecological processes, cannot be guaranteed if the urban metabolism is not taken into account.

AB  - Human-driven environmental changes can induce marked shifts in the functional structure of biological communities with possible repercussion on important ecosystem functions and services. At the same time it remains unclear to which extent these changes may differently affect various types of organisms. We investigated species richness and community functional structure of species assemblages at the landscape scale (1 km2 plots) for two contrasting model taxa, i. e. plants (producers and sessile organisms) and birds (consumers and mobile organisms), along topography, climate, landscape heterogeneity, and land-use (agriculture and urbanization) gradients in a densely populated region of Switzerland. Our study revealed that agricultural and urban land uses drove marked shifts in the functional structure of biological communities compared to changes along climate and topography gradients, especially for plants, while for birds these changes were comparable. Agricultural and urban land uses enhanced divergence in traits related to resource use for birds (diet and nesting), growth forms, dispersal, and reproductive traits for plants, while it induced convergence in vegetative plant traits (plant height and leaf dry matter content). These results suggest that contrasting assembly patterns may arise within and across taxonomic groups along the same environmental gradients as result of distinct underlying processes and ` organism-specific' environmental perceptions. Our results further suggest a potential homogenization of biological communities, as well as low functional diversity and redundancy levels of bird assemblages in our human-dominated study region. This might potentially compromise the maintenance of key ecological processes under future environmental changes.

AB  - The success of smart city projects is intrinsically related to the existence of large volumes of data that could be processed to achieve their objectives. For this purpose, the plethora of data stored by public administrations becomes an incredibly rich source of insight and information due to its volume and diversity. However, it was only with the Open Government Movement when governments have been concerned with the need to open their data to citizens and businesses. Thus, with the emergence of open data portals, these myriad of data enables the development of new business models. The achievement of the benefits sought by making this data available triggers new challenges to cope with the diversity of sources involved. The business potential could be jeopardized by the scarcity of relevant data in the different blocks and domains that makes a city and by the lack of a common approach to data publication, in terms of format, content, etc.
   This paper introduces a holistic approach that relies on the Smart City Ontology as the cornerstone to standardise and structure data. This approach, which is proposed to be an analytical tool to assess the potential of data in a given smart city, analyses three main aspects: availability of data, the criteria that data should fulfil to be considered eligible and the model used to structure and organise data. The approach has been applied to the case of Brussels Capital Region, which first results are presented and discussed in this paper. The main conclusion that has been obtained is that, besides its commitment with open data and smart cities, Brussels is not mature enough to fully exploit the real intelligence that smart cities could provide. This maturity would be achieved in the following years with the implementation of the new Brussels' Smart City Strategy. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent studies have emphasised the increasing impact, both negative and positive, of Linear Transport Infrastructures (LTIs) on biodiversity. A significant body of scientific and technical knowledge is more and more available to help guide restoration practices concerning especially urban areas. This study explores a comprehensive approach to estimating restoration potential along the LTI edges in the Greater Paris region (in France) in terms of potential biodiversity. Our work consists in inventorying and analysing the Potential Biodiversity Index, PBI, on sites along two LTIs crossing a forest in the northern part of this district. The study concerns a Natura 2000 area, La Poudrerie Park. A total of 84 surveys were carried out corresponding to the 33 hectares surveyed. We studied sites along the LTIs. For this purpose, we chose 84 sites in the traffic corridors. Biodiversity parameter evaluations were performed for each site. These parameters are related to functional traits that make it possible to determine the Potential Biodiversity Index (PBI). These site assessments by PBI may reveal the positive impact of the LTI edges in developing biodiversity. We may establish that there is a positive impact of LTIs edges for ecological restoration and revegetation in an urban context.

AB  - Nowadays, cross-border cooperation (CBC) is an undeniable reality in the space encompassed between European borders. This contributes to economical and social sustainable development, as well as to cohesion for trans boundary areas, which include administrative and territorial units from neighboring countries.
   A correct conceptual basis for the methodological approach to connectivity lies in the fact that the development of transportation systems, as integrated networks at different scales, is deeply changing their operation and the way they induce urban and regional development patterns. Overloaded transport corridors in the context of changing transportation flows are becoming an important issue for accessibility, impacting CBC indirectly, but harshly.
   Different modes of transport create different patterns of accessibility, with different influence in CBC accordingly. Throughout the present research, CBC European case studies, where connectivity-movement between cities, has been identified as a key factor for their territorial success, were assessed, described and analyzed.
   In the period of 2001-2006, improvements and further imbalances have occurred in accessibility development across regions and modes. Some signs indicate that the core-periphery pattern is slowly changing which leads towards an upgrade on the accessibility of places, regions and cities.

AB  - This paper reflects on collaborative landscape research conducted in Reunion Island, an outermost region of the European Union. On this 2,500 km(2) tropical island also considered a major international biodiversity hotspot, land-use planners must address important challenges, especially growing population densities and urban sprawl that cause important pressure on agricultural land and natural ecosystems. While progress has been made towards land-use zoning and planning at, the island scale, entrenched interests and a lack of communication between the agricultural, urban and environmental sectors continue to hinder the design and implementation of integrated land-use plans at the local level. This paper presents an approach to territorial foresight where urban development scenarios and spatial models were co-constructed with a collective of institutional actors in order to facilitate dialogue on future urbanization patterns and impacts on landscapes. It describes how spatially explicit models and simulations of urban development, first used as demonstrators, have raised individual interests and expectations and facilitated the structuring of a collaborative research network. Models and scenarios were then questioned, redesigned collectively and used as boundary objects to facilitate a shift away from statistical and sectorial readings towards more territorialized and integrated perspectives. Analysing inputs, reactions and feedback from the actors involved in the research, this paper discusses the role and potential value of landscape modelling and simulation in mediating debates among planning stakeholders and creating social learning situations.

AB  - In Italy, the first law that puts landscape and historical buildings under public control was implemented in 1922. While this represents a significant achievement for those times, for that law landscape essentially has an historical and aesthetic connotation, without any explicit reference to the components of flora, fauna and geology. Today, many protection policies and initiatives are still biased by the lack of reference to the intrinsic value that biodiversity and ecosystem services have for the maintenance of traditional landscapes, as well as for the survival of the human species. The priority accorded to historical and aesthetic values can lead to a lack of attention to the complex relationship binding the natural environment, agriculture and urban processes. Hence, there is a need in Italy for an increased awareness of the functional role exerted by agriculture as a link between ecosystems and "techno'' systems. The complex and polysemic concept of landscape plays a crucial role in designing new strategies for the rural territories, their economies and their cultures. Moving towards a shared and integrated strategy for multifunctional agriculture involves a substantial revision of the general objectives of growth and development, combining conservation and innovation. In this respect, the full integration of the Strategic Environmental Assessment in regional planning processes is one possible method for building a framework in which policies to promote the development, protection and enhancement of landscapes can work in an integrated way. These observations lead to some final conclusions on the network logic which should drive the integration process of planning and evaluation, along with some reflections on the Italian programme for inland areas.

AB  - The increasing conversion of agricultural and natural areas to human-dominated urban landscapes is predicted to lead to a major decline in biodiversity worldwide. Two conditions that typically differ between urban environments and the surrounding landscape are increased temperature, and high patch isolation and habitat turnover rates. However, the extent and spatial scale at which these altered conditions shape biotic communities through selection and/or filtering on species traits are currently poorly understood. We sampled carabid beetles at 81 sites in Belgium using a hierarchically nested sampling design wherein three local-scale (200 x 200 m) urbanization levels were repeatedly sampled across three landscape-scale (3 x 3 km) urbanization levels. First, we showed that communities sampled in the most urbanized locations and landscapes displayed a distinct species composition at both local and landscape scale. Second, we related community means of species-specific thermal preferences and dispersal capacity (based on European distribution and wing morphology, respectively) to the urbanization gradients. We showed that urban communities consisted on average of species with a preference for higher temperatures and with better dispersal capacities compared to rural communities. These shifts were caused by an increased number of species tolerating higher temperatures, a decreased richness of species with low thermal preference, and an almost complete depletion of species with very low-dispersal capacity in the most urbanized localities. Effects of urbanization were most clearly detected at the local scale, although more subtle effects could also be found at the scale of entire landscapes. Our results demonstrate that urbanization may fundamentally and consistently alter species composition by exerting a strong filtering effect on species dispersal characteristics and favouring replacement by warm-dwelling species.

AB  - Axial and visibility graph analysis models are combined with GIS and Space Syntax to study the corresponding relationship between street network and specific city life in Hankou, China, based on three scales - city, district, and community, so as to interpret the hidden structure out of complex urban form through the spatial logic of street network. In this paper, a quantitative analysis is made on selected parameters in Space Syntax, including Integration, Choice, density of road, and Ht index. The result indicates that there is certain correlation among these parameters. Moreover, these parameters also present certain changing patterns along with the increase of analysis radius. The results reveal that the street network of Hankou presents a multi-hierarchical structure and spatial wholeness from all these three scales. This characteristic creates vitality and diversity while maintaining the feature of wholeness for the urban space. Research has turned out that community-scale street network performs a positive role to keep neighborhoods alive. Therefore, it is an important strategy for maintaining the vitality of urban space and realizing coordination and unification between parts and the whole. It is proposed in this paper that a good street network is a key factor for carrying forward urban context of Hankou. Undoubtedly, it is worthy of reflecting on large-scale demolition of existing urban space, especially in historical areas. Afterwards, the paper proposes a hierarchically synergetic planning strategy based on the analysis. More attention should be paid to street network to preserve diversity, continuity, and integrity, and finally archive holistically sustainable development within a city.

AB  - Green areas have always been an essential feature of urban developments, improving the quality of life within a community, both from a social perspective - offering residents a place for relaxation and interaction, as well as from the point of view of disease prevention improving the overall air quality, but also encouraging inhabitants to spend more time outside. The importance of these areas within a settlement further increases in the present-day context, in which the constant expansion of cities in their surrounding territory, phenomenon known as "urban sprawl", gradually eliminates the natural green spaces and agricultural terrains from our landscape. This trend has devastating effects on the environment, as well as on the microclimate of our settlements, characterized, in recent years, by the formation of heat islands within the built tissue. Moreover, the disappearance of natural green areas leads to the constant estrangement of the inhabitants, and especially of young generations, from the natural values and realities.
   It is thus more important than ever to ensure an adequate percentage of green areas for our cities, uniformly distributed within the urban tissue. Green belts, urban forests, parks, green squares or even urban gardens - all these entities play their parts within the urban green network, having certain radiuses of influence and attraction and thus occupying a specific position within the urban hierarchy. In Romania, the terrains left un-built between the collective housing buildings - or apartment blocks, erected during the communist administration and currently constituting public property, have a huge potential regarding the matter of urban greenery, being easily transformed into active and qualitative green areas.
   However, the local authorities lack the resources (both financial and in terms of human resources) to efficiently develop and then administrate these areas, which are consequently either abandoned, or used as illegal parking lots. This paper therefore explores the possibilities in which the terrains between collective housing buildings can be exploited by the community and transformed into qualitative green areas, as well as their integration within the hierarchy of the existing green network.

AB  - The crisis in Spain has generated new forms of solidarity that have become new ways of being and living the city. Streets and houses have been taken by the population in protests and direct actions. Lack of alternatives and the government's 'do-nothing' policy have pushed people to perform the 'right to the city' on their own and in collective ways. The 15M movement, with its assemblies in every public square and park, the 'mareas' (waves), which occupied hospitals and schools to create dialogue between parents and teachers and between doctors and patients, and the Platform of Mortgage Victims, the leading force in the struggle against evictions, are three examples of new ways of understanding the city. In the context of these experiments in self-management of the social reproduction of life, proposals for the transformation of government have also emerged, pointing precisely to the strengthening of citizen self-government. The most progressive experiments have taken place at the municipal level through popular electoral platforms that won 2015 elections in many cities. we can state that a new form of citizenship seems to be emerging according to which, citizens understand the city as their own, fight for the use and control of urban infrastructures and seek to institutionalise new forms of people's control, participation and decision-making.

AB  - Running waters are among the most threatened ecosystems globally, having altered hydrological regimes, homogenized habitat, and impaired water quality. These multiple stressors impact aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem function across space and time, although a clear mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we examined the trophic response of macroinvertebrates among streams in a Swiss lowland catchment encompassing a gradient of land uses. Clear compositional changes were observed as anthropogenic impacts increased from least-impacted to agricultural and urbanized sites. Taxonomic diversity was lowest at sites with morphological and water quality impairment (agricultural sites), whereas taxonomic identity (susceptible vs. generalist species) mainly changed due to water quality degradation (agricultural and urban sites) based on the SPEAR (pesticides) index. Using stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15), a simplification in macroinvertebrate trophic structure was evident along the land use gradient. At a site receiving wastewater treatment effluent, stable isotopes also revealed trophic shifts in primary consumers that corresponded to changes in available food resources. Results further showed that some taxa losses, e.g., the mayfly Ecdyonurus, to land- use effects may be due to low trophic plasticity. The combination of analyses, including stable isotopes, provided an improved mechanistic understanding of community and population responses to land-use changes along river networks.

AB  - The Third Infoscape is a concept which originates from Soja's Thirdspace, Clement's Third Landscape and Casagrande's Third Generation City. The Third Infoscape deals with the ruins of digital communication just as the Third Generation City deals with the ruins of the industrial city, the Third Landscape deals with ruins of gardens and Thirdspace deals with ruins of regulation and governance. Human beings and the environment ruin the city, and ruins are the city's syncretic maps, describing (in negative) usage patterns and, thus, becoming a form of knowledge of the life of the city. In the data-city, ruins are an open-source global that is progressively becoming the only one that can welcome transgressive behaviors. These are needed for radical innovation, and to host diversity. Floating between small data and big data, amidst the smart dust which circulates in the city, and in the emotions, expressions, desires, relations, interactions and imaginations expressed by humans, digital smart agents and network connected objects and environments, the Third Infoscape is the ruin of digital communication and interaction in the Industrial City.
   What role is there for transgression in the Smart City? What form of governance for the Third Infoscape?
   Gilles Clement, talking about the Third Landscape, wonders "what form does a gardener of a garden without a form have?" The answer is that it is a gardener with different tools and methods: not rake and shovel, but wind and knowledge.
   This scenario holds great opportunities for Design, but requires the cultivation of such tools and methods, since Design Education, and what Massimo Canevacci defines as Methodological Indiscipline, and Elizabeth Grosz calls Excess Space.

TI  - Invasive flora within urban railway areas: a case study from Lublin (Poland) and Lviv (Ukraine)
T2  - ACTA AGROBOTANICA
LA  - English
AB  - Heterogeneous and disturbed habitats within railway areas create an ideal environment for establishment of invasive plant species. In this study, we compared the invasive species composition and abundance within railway areas of two cities, Lublin, SE Poland and Lviv, W Ukraine. In total, 70 invasive species were recorded. The invasive species list was similar for the two cities, with the most invasive species occurring at both (81.4%), 8.5% occurring only in Lublin and 10% only in Lviv. The proportion of invasive species in the total flora was almost 1.5-fold higher at Lviv compared to Lublin. Invasive species have originated mainly from continental America (45.7%), followed by Asia and Eurasia. The participation of invasive plants derived from Asia and Eurasia at Lviv is higher than at Lublin. The invasive flora includes a wide range of taxonomic groups, with a predominance of Asteraceae and Poaceae. The ecological attributes of invasive species on railway areas are: mainly annual therophytes, mostly wind- and insect pollination modes, a predominance of generative reproduction, anthropochorous and anemochorous dispersal and short-term persistent, long-term persistent or transient seed banks.

AB  - We present an analysis of changes of state, pressures and conservation responses over 20 years in the Tanzanian portion of the Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa biodiversity hotspot. Baseline data collected during 1989-1995 are compared with data from a synthesis of recently published papers and reports and new field work carried out across the region during 2010-2014. We show that biodiversity endemism values are largely unchanged, although two new species (amphibian and mammal) have been named and two extremely rare tree species have been relocated. However, forest habitat continues to be lost and degraded, largely as a result of agricultural expansion, charcoal production to supply cities with cooking fuel, logging for timber and cutting of wood for firewood and building poles. Habitat loss is linked to an increase in the number of species threatened over time. The government-managed forest reserve network has expanded slightly but has low effectiveness. Three forest reserves have been upgraded to National Parks and Nature Reserves, which have stricter protection and more effective enforcement. There has also been rapid development of village-owned forest reserves, with more than 14o now existing; although usually small, they are an important addition to the areas being managed for sustainable resource use, and also provide tangible benefits to local people. Human-use pressures remain intense in many areas, and combined with emerging pressures from mining, gas and oil exploration, many endemic species remain threatened with extinction.

AB  - We studied the trade network of the Scorpion Mud Turtle, Kinosternon scorpioides, on Marajo Island, Brazil, from hunting to the final product consumption. We conducted semi-structured interviews at the urban centers of the cities of Soure, Salvaterra and Cachoeira do Arari, where we investigated: A) the socioeconomic profile of the merchants and their activity; B) the origin, form and the frequency of marketing K. scorpioides; and C) the demand for the product. Scorpion Mud Turtle hunting was carried out using the following methods: hand-collection (100%), probing (62%) and burning (54%). They were hunted for two reasons: personal consumption and sale, which was conducted in urban centers. The hunters knew the empirical aspects of the species biology in the wild: habitat, trophic ecology, and reproduction, among others. The trade of K. scorpioides is still a strong activity on Marajo Island, and the legal regulations are not enough to inhibit this practice, which poses a threat to the future of this species in this area. The establishment of educational efforts and captive breeding programs of this species will contribute to employment, to local family income, and to the conservation of this genetic resource. These efforts also be important for that the local population could produce and consume this species in a more sustainable way.

AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between dispersed seed pool and the diet structure of the Rook Corvus frugilegus in two geographical regions of Central and Southeast Europe. We studied the content of regurgitation pellets (N=188) collected in urban and agricultural habitats of Poland and Romania at the end of the breeding period. Seeds (19 taxa) were present in 49% of analysed pellets; the frequency of pellets with seeds was higher in urban habitats in both regions. The vast majority of seeds represented fleshy-fruited species and the pulp of the fruits was an important part of the Rook's diet. The most numerous and frequent was Cerasus avium / C. vulgaris. Seeds and fruits of the dry-fruited species were present in small amounts and with low frequencies. Rooks are successful dispersers of seeds and may contribute to the diversity of vegetation especially in urban areas.

AB  - One of the most prominent urban problems European cities face, is not only the physical degradation of its historic city centers, but also the degradation of their social, economic and environmental context. Moreover, common rehabilitation methods and strategies are often unsuccessful combatting such problem, and new ways and strategies must be researched, tested, and implemented under a new sustainable development policy.
   Creativity and artistic activities can play an important role in the resolution of this problem. For example, the re-occupation of derelict buildings, through creative and innovative activities, can contribute to resolving the primary issue.
   While analyzing a comparative case study using three examples: LxFactory in Lisbon, Ateneu Popular 9 Barris in Barcelona, and 59 Rivoli in Paris, its possible to conclude that their rehabilitation through art and culture, could produce positive side effects leading to social renovation and solid economic activity within itself and its surrounding area, creating new local economies, jobs, new tourists attractions, real estate opportunities and more.
   Considering the current standpoint and outlook on rehabilitation, as an action and movement of sustainability, especially at the environmental level, and associating it with the arts and culture movement, will allow it to solve the social and economic problem simultaneously. By introducing new dynamic living spaces in unoccupied and derelict buildings also re-energizes the economic value of the building as well as, most importantly, regenerating the actual city.

AB  - Urban plans and projects that aim to initiate the redevelopment and gentrification of urban areas create social and ecological pressures on urban environments and thereby stimulate urban movements. These movements have a lifespan, which evolves in interaction with planning authorities under local or central governments and may be marked by institutionalization and co-optation, as well as fragmentation among the people involved in them. Fragmentations are usually based on conflicting individual and collective interests, but may also be the result of different political perspectives in groups. This article is based on a case study conducted in two adjacent gecekondu neighbourhoods of Istanbul, Gulsuyu and Gulensu, where urban politics have played an important role in efforts to resist plans for urban transformation. It shows that fragmentations are very likely to occur in urban movements during planning processes in a neoliberal era, owing to the different perspectives in the movement on what the just city is.

AB  - Macrofungi have long been investigated for various scientific purposes including their food and medicinal characteristics. Their role in aerobiology as a fraction of the primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs), however, has been poorly studied. In this study, we present a source of macrofungi with two different but interdependent objectives: (i) to characterize the macrofungi from a tropical dry evergreen biome in southern India using advanced molecular techniques to enrich the database from this region, and (ii) to assess whether identified species of macrofungi are a potential source of atmospheric PBAPs. From the DNA analysis, we report the diversity of the terrestrial macrofungi from a tropical dry evergreen biome robustly supported by the statistical analyses for diversity conclusions. A total of 113 macro fungal species belonging to 54 genera and 23 families were recorded, with Basidiomycota and Ascomycota constituting 96% and 4% of the species, respectively. The highest species richness was found in the family Agaricaceae (25.3%) followed by Polyporaceae (15.3%) and Marasmiaceae (10.8%). The difference in the distribution of commonly observed macrofungal families over this location was compared with other locations in India (Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and West Bengal) using two statistical tests. The distributions of the terrestrial macrofungi were distinctly different in each ecosystem. We further attempted to demonstrate the potential role of terrestrial macrofungi as a source of PBAPs in ambient air. In our opinion, the findings from this ecosystem of India will enhance our understanding of the distribution, diversity, ecology, and biological prospects of terrestrial macrofungi as well as their potential to contribute to airborne fungal aerosols.

AB  - Despite the intense challenges to wildlife presented by urbanization, many species continue to survive and even to thrive in these highly impacted landscapes. In the urban matrix of Denver, Colorado, USA, two snake species persist in restricted urban habitats near the limit of their geographic ranges: the Western Terrestrial Gartersnake (Thamnophis elegans) and the Plains Gartersnake (Thamnophis radix). We used nuclear microsatellite markers to assess the population genetic structure of three populations of both species living syntopically in this highly developed urban environment and one population of T. elegans in natural habitat. Our findings indicate strong population structure, limited migration between populations of each species, and evidence of inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity, with these patterns more pronounced in T. radix. Additionally, we do not find evidence of increased hybridization between these species in such confined habitat patches. These results suggest that populations of long-lived vertebrate species may require intervention to escape long-term detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation and subsequent genetic isolation.

AB  - The effective management of species requires detailed knowledge of key population parameters. A capture-mark-recapture study of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) was conducted in an urban forest remnant in Brisbane, south-east Queensland. A total of 187 adult gliders (96 females, 91 males) was captured 620 times, in 19 sessions over a 4-year period. A Cormack-Jolly-Seber model was employed to estimate adult survival and abundance. Factors that may affect survival (e.g. sex, year, season) were included in population models. The overall probability of annual apparent survival was 0.49 +/- 0.08. The capture probability over the duration of the study was 0.38 +/- 0.03. The size of the local population was highest in the first year of the study (70-113 individuals) but then declined and generally remained low in the last two years. Apparent survival may include an unknown component of dispersal. However, our study area was mostly surrounded by a hostile urban matrix, so the effect of dispersal may have been minimal. Further studies that assess the survival of squirrel gliders are needed to assess the extent to which this parameter varies among localities.

AB  - Background: Population genetic diversity and structure are determined by past and current evolutionary processes, among which spatially limited dispersal, genetic drift, and shifts in species distribution boundaries have major effects. In most wildlife species, environmental modifications by humans often lead to contraction of species' ranges and/or limit their dispersal by acting as environmental barriers. However, in species well adapted to anthropogenic habitat or open landscapes, human induced environmental changes may facilitate dispersal and range expansions. In this study, we analysed whether isolation by distance and deforestation, among other environmental features, promotes or restricts dispersal and expansion in stone marten (Martes foina) populations.
   Results: We genotyped 298 martens from eight sites at twenty-two microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic variability, population structure and demographic history of stone martens in Poland. At the landscape scale, limited genetic differentiation between sites in a mosaic of urban, rural and forest habitats was mostly influenced by isolation by distance. Statistical clustering and multivariate analyses showed weak genetic structuring with two to four clusters and a high rate of gene flow between them. Stronger genetic differentiation was detected for one stone marten population (NE1) located inside a large forest complex. Genetic differentiation between this site and all others was 20% higher than between other sites separated by similar distances. The genetic uniqueness index of NE1 was also twofold higher than in other sites. Past demographic history analyses showed recent expansion of this species in north-eastern Poland. A decrease in genetic diversity from south to north, and MIGRAINE analyses indicated the direction of expansion of stone marten.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that two processes, changes in species distribution boundaries and limited dispersal associated with landscape barriers, affect genetic diversity and structure in stone marten. Analysis of local barriers that reduced dispersal and large scale analyses of genetic structure and demographic history highlight the importance of isolation by distance and forest cover for the past colonization of central Europe by stone marten. This confirmed the hypothesis that human-landscape changes (deforestation) accelerated stone marten expansion, to which climate warming probably has also been contributing over the last few decades.

AB  - The Occupy movement protests against social and economic inequality around the world. It emerged in New York City's Zuccotti Park in September 2011 and is organized at a city level. In this paper we study its social organization on Facebook, by means of a thorough quantitative analysis on users' content consumption. In particular, we focus on structural patterns of users interaction with the movement pages and on the role of local affiliations on the consumption patterns. First, we characterize users' activity finding that passive endorsement (liking) is more dominant than active participation to the debate (commenting). Then, we label users according to their mobility patterns across pages of the various local communities, finding that online activities are not locally coordinated by geographically close pages. Indeed, pages linked to major US cities, such as New York, Los Angeles, Boston, drive the diffusion of contents online and serve as coordination points for all other pages.

AB  - Including threats in spatial conservation prioritization helps identify areas for conservation actions where biodiversity is at imminent risk of extinction. At the global level, an important limitation when identifying spatial priorities for conservation actions is the lack of information on the spatial distribution of threats. Here, we identify spatial conservation priorities under three prominent threats to biodiversity (residential and commercial development, agricultural expansion, and forest loss), which are primary drivers of habitat loss and threaten the persistence of the highest number of species in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, and for which spatial data is available. We first explore how global priority areas for the conservation of vertebrate (mammals, birds, and amphibians) species coded in the Red List as vulnerable to each threat differ spatially. We then identify spatial conservation priorities for all species vulnerable to all threats. Finally, we identify the potentially most threatened areas by overlapping the identified priority areas for conservation with maps for each threat. We repeat the same with four other well-known global conservation priority area schemes, namely Key Biodiversity Areas, Biodiversity Hotspots, the global Protected Area Network, and Wilderness Areas. We find that residential and commercial development directly threatens only about 4% of the global top 17% priority areas for species vulnerable under this threat. However, 50% of the high priority areas for species vulnerable to forest loss overlap with areas that have already experienced some forest loss. Agricultural expansion overlapped with similar to 20% of high priority areas. Biodiversity Hotspots had the greatest proportion of their total area under direct threat from all threats, while expansion of low intensity agriculture was found to pose an imminent threat to Wilderness Areas under future agricultural expansion. Our results identify areas where limited resources should be allocated to mitigate risks to vertebrate species from habitat loss.

AB  - Rove beetle (Paederus spp.) is of medical interest because it causes nasty skin lesion in humans known as Paederus dermatitis. In addition, Paederus is gaining notoriety as urban pests in human-populated areas. This study aimed to determine some factors and conditions controlling the beetle's abundance, distribution and dispersal time along with the rice field towards human setting. Flight dispersion of P. fuscipes towards a light trap was studied for two cycles of the rice cultivation phase; main rice season (October 2013 - March 2014) and off rice season (March 2014 - October 2014) at an infestation-prone area in Mainland Penang, Malaysia. The effects of rice cultivation phases and variable environmental conditions were considered to further understand the abundance, distribution and dispersal time of P. fuscipes. As shown in the present work, the number of beetles was higher in warmer and humid months, especially during the off season of the rice cultivation phase. The greatest abundance of the beetle towards residential premises was primarily seen during the rice harvesting stage. Peak time of P. fuscipes flight was observed starting at 20: 45 hours, with threshold temperature 25-27 degrees C and relative humidity 84-94% RH. P. fuscipes were capable of flying under marginally windy conditions. However, windless night favour most P. fuscipes flights.

AB  - Palembang City is one of the cities having the largest river in Indonesia and it should be able to take advantage of river transportation as an alternative choice. Inadequate availability of river transport facilities and infrastructures makes the people prefer other modes of land transportation rather than using river transportation. In addition, the development planning of river transportation such as the development of river taxi is less successful because it is not yet based on the movement pattern of the origin of the community travel destination. Based on the above matter, this study was conducted. The aim of the study was to find out the characteristics and factors affecting the mode choice of the community living along the bank of Musi River of Palembang City to be the basis of the development of river transportation system in Palembang City. The selected modes were motorcycles, cars, city transports, and ketek (motorized boats). Survey of home interviews was conducted to determine the origin of the destination and characteristics of travel was conducted in 30 villages located on the banks of Musi River. Field survey was conducted to determine the conditions and types of existing river transportation facilities and services. The results show that only 5.3 % of the occurrence movement used river transportation, the rest used motorcycles (69.1%), urban transport (15.9 %) and cars (9.7%), with the travel range less than 10 minutes and 10 - 20 minutes as much as 43.2 % and 29 % of the total trips. From the socioeconomic profile of the community, it is found that most of the people living along the Musi River have low and middle incomes with the largest types of jobs as workers, students, shop owner, and housewives. The peak movement time for the movement of river transport occurs at 7: 00 - 8: 00, 10: 00 - 11: 00 and 16: 00 - 17: 00 with the movement of origin of the destination of river transportation is known to be 50% at the traditional market center of Dermaga of 16 Ilir. Types of river transportation used for short trips are large, medium and small motorized boats. While for longer trips there are large and medium size speedboats. The statistical analysis results showed that the parameters affecting the mode choice of the community living along the bank of Musi River were age, occupation, monthly income, house types, and travel time.

AB  - This paper attempts to examine the impacts of the spatial structure of landscape on housing premiums in Austin, TX through the years of 2009-2011. Dissimilar to previous studies, this paper highlighted three points. First, landscape patterns was observed-not only the composition but also the configuration in terms of shape, fragmentation, isolation, and connectivity. Second, the definition of neighborhood in this study was closely matched to the nature of a residential neighborhood, which was represented by a residential subdivision that has a name and a high level of homogeneous characteristics (i.e., development age, appraised value, lot size, and housing size). This approach specifically helps understand the impact of landscape configuration at the micro-level neighborhoods. Third, the hierarchical nature of neighborhoods and embedded parcels-nested parcels within the same neighborhood posit a certain level of identity as a whole-was given attention so that multi-level modeling could be employed. Conceptually and theoretically, multi-level modeling is a better approach to examine phenomenon that occur in multi-level units that show a clear hierarchy. The findings indicated that home buyers are willing to pay more to live in neighborhoods with the high ratio of tree cover. This is a finding consistent with previous studies. Meanwhile, the detailed spatial configuration of landscape does not play an important role at the residential neighborhood level. This result urges policy makers to be more scale-sensitive when planning landscape and indicates that micro neighborhoods are not the correct spatial level to discuss the spatial configuration of landscape, greenways, and green network.

AB  - Land Use-Cover Changes (LUCCs) are one of the main problems for the preservation of biodiversity. Protected Areas (PAs) do not escape this threat. Some processes, such as intensive recreational use, forest fires or the expansion of artificial areas taking place inside and around them in response to their appeal, question their environmental sustainability and their efficiency. In this paper, we analyze the LUCCs that took place between 1990 and 2006 in two National Parks (NPs) belonging to the Spanish network and in their surroundings: Ordesa and Monte Perdido (Ordesa NP) and Sierra de Guadarrama (Guadarrama NP). We also simulate land use changes between 2006 and 2030 by means of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), taking into account two scenarios: trend and green. Finally, we perform a multi-temporal analysis of natural habitat fragmentation in each NP. The results show that the NPs analyzed are well-preserved and have seen hardly any significant LUCCs inside them. However, Socioeconomic Influence Zones (SIZs) and buffers are subject to different dynamics. In the SIZ and buffer of the Ordesa NP, there has been an expansion of built-up areas (annual rate of change = +1.19) around small urban hubs and ski resorts. There has also been a gradual recovery of natural areas, which had been interrupted by forest fires. The invasion of sub-alpine grasslands by shrubs is clear (+2735 ha). The SIZ and buffer of the Guadarrama NP are subject to urban sprawl in forest areas and to the construction of road infrastructures (+5549 ha and an annual rate of change = +1.20). Industrial area has multiplied by 3.3 in 20 years. The consequences are an increase in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), greater risk of forest fires and greater fragmentation of natural habitats (+0.04 in SIZ). In the change scenarios, if conditions change as expected, the specific threats facing each NP can be expected to increase. There are substantial differences between the scenarios depending on whether or not incentives are accepted and legal restrictions are respected.

AB  - Background: There was no record of Aedes aegypti in Yunnan Province, China, until 2002, but this species is now continuously found in nine cities (or counties). Until now, little was known about the genetic diversity and population structure of this invasive species. Thus, a detailed understanding of the invasion strategies, colonisation and dispersal of this mosquito from a population genetics perspective is urgently needed for controlling and eliminating this disease vector.
   Methods: The genetic diversity and population structure of Ae. aegypti communities were analysed by screening nine microsatellite loci from 833 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes sampled from 28 locations in Yunnan Province.
   Results: In total, 114 alleles were obtained, and the average polymorphic information content (PIC) value was 0.672. The value of the alleles per locus ranged from 2.90 to 5.18, with an average of 4.04. The value of He ranged from 0.353 to 0.681, and the value of Ho within populations ranged from 0.401 to 0.689. Of the 28 locations, two showed significant departures from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) with P-values less than 0.05, and a bottleneck effect was detected among locations from Ruili and the border areas with the degree of 60% and 50%, respectively. Combined with the F-statistics (F-IT = 0.222; F-CT = 0.145), the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that there was substantial molecular variation among individuals, accounting for 77.76% of the sample, with a significant P-value (<0.0001). The results suggest that genetic differences in Ae. aegypti originated primarily among individuals rather than among populations. Furthermore, the STRUCTURE and UPGMA cluster analyses showed that Ae. aegypti from the border areas were genetically isolated compared to those from the cities Ruili and Jinghong, consistent with the results of the Mantel test (R-2 = 0.245, P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Continuous invasion contributes to the maintenance of Ae. aegypti populations' genetic diversity and different invasion accidents result in the genetic difference among Ae. aegypti populations of Yunnan Province.

AB  - This paper addresses the issue of managing urban pigeon population using some possible actions that make it reach a density target with respect to socio-ecological constraints. A mathematical model describing the dynamic of this population is introduced. This model incorporates the effect of some regulatory actions on the dynamic of this population. We use mathematical viability theory, which provides a framework to study compatibility between dynamics and state constraints. The viability study shows when and how it is possible to regulate the pigeon population with respect to the constraints. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Constructing an urban ecological corridor system is a major component and critical factor of forming an effective network within an urban ecosystem. Shenzhen, as a highly urbanized area in China, is facing the dual pressures of urban development and ecological conservation. The ecological corridors in Shenzhen are being constantly eroded by urban expansion, resulting in an urgent need to carry out sensitivity evaluations and ecological land management studies. By identifying the spatial range of planned ecological corridors in Shenzhen, we develop a GIS-based ecological sensitivity evaluation model from the perspectives of soil environment, habitat conditions, geological hazards, and human disturbance. Management strategies are proposed with regard to macroscopic protection guidance and microscopic land-use control. The results show that there is little difference in the sensitivity grade of ecological corridors in Shenzhen. With regard to spatial distribution, the sensitivity level is high in the north and low in the south, with moderately sensitive corridors being the dominant type. Meanwhile, we design the land-use control program by taking into account the present management and new land demand and provide the path for implementing the withdrawal, reservation, occupation, and avoidance polices. The results of the sensitivity evaluation objectively reflect the eco-environmental condition of ecological corridors in Shenzhen. The classified and graded protection guidance and space regulatory framework proposed in this study are of significance for guiding the ecological conservation, land use, and sustainable development in urban contexts with similar issues.

AB  - This study uses a spatially-explicit land-use/land-cover (LULC) modeling approach to model and map the future (2016-2030) LULC of the area surrounding the Laguna de Bay of Philippines under three different scenarios: 'business-as-usual', 'compact development', and 'high sprawl' scenarios. The Laguna de Bay is the largest lake in the Philippines and an important natural resource for the population in/around Metro Manila. The LULC around the lake is rapidly changing due to urban sprawl, so local and national government agencies situated in the area need an understanding of the future (likely) LULC changes and their associated hydrological impacts. The spatial modeling approach involved three main steps: (1) mapping the locations of past LULC changes; (2) identifying the drivers of these past changes; and (3) identifying where and when future LULC changes are likely to occur. Utilizing various publically-available spatial datasets representing potential drivers of LULC changes, a LULC change model was calibrated using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network algorithm. After calibrating the model, future LULC changes were modeled and mapped up to the year 2030. Our modeling results showed that the 'built-up' LULC class is likely to experience the greatest increase in land area due to losses in 'crop/grass' (and to a lesser degree 'tree') LULC, and this is attributed to continued urban sprawl.

AB  - Urban trees have been increasingly appreciated for the many benefits they provide. As concentrated hubs of human-mediated movement, the urban landscape is, however, often the first point of contact for exotic pests including insects and plant pathogens. Consequently, urban trees can be important for accidentally introduced forest pests to become established and potentially invasive. Reductions in biodiversity and the potential for stressful conditions arising from anthropogenic disturbances can predispose these trees to pest attack, further increasing the likelihood of exotic forest pests becoming established and increasing in density. Once established in urban environments, dispersal of introduced pests can proceed to natural forest landscapes or planted forests. In addition to permanent long-term damage to natural ecosystems, the consequences of these invasions include costly attempts at eradication and post establishment management strategies. We discuss a range of ecological, economic and social impacts arising from these incursions and the importance of global biosecurity is highlighted as a crucially important barrier to pest invasions. Finally, we suggest that urban trees may be viewed as 'sentinel plantings'. In particular, botanical gardens and arboreta frequently house large collections of exotic plantings, providing a unique opportunity to help predict and prevent the invasion of new pests, and where introduced pests with the capacity to cause serious impacts in forest environments could potentially be detected during the initial stages of establishment. Such early detection offers the only realistic prospect of eradication, thereby reducing damaging ecological impacts and long term management costs.

AB  - This paper synthetizes, although within the limits of Italian spatial planning perspective, the enormous opportunities emerging from the application of complex forms of knowledge for the benefit of water culture, especially at the present time of significant climate changes, that is for the purpose of stimulating proper cultural behaviors of the inhabitants in terms of water. The implementation of tools of participatory democracy, as set forth for example in the River Contracts, for governing the territory, soil, water, biodiversity, landscape and existing historical and architectural heritage, gives rise to the awareness that the land is a common good. Even starting with minor land disputes, inhabitants and manufacturers regain the awareness of place and this environmental understanding is useful for overcoming, reducing and settling conflicts between different uses of resources - the common goods, starting with water. As an example, this paper sets out the synthesis of the ecohydrological results of the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research carried out to support preparations of the Environmental Plan for the Adige Park in the meander of the River Adige immediately downstream of the city of Verona, Italy. It aims to demonstrate how, through active participation of the population, the protection and renewal of the natural, cultural, historical, and environmental landscape qualities existing there as a whole, together with the sustainable management of the river flow for the protection of biodiversity and of the river's self-purifying capacity have been achieved.

AB  - Landscape pattern is an important determinant of soil contamination at multiple scales, and a proper understanding of their relationship is essential for alleviating soil contamination and making decisions for land planners. Both soil contamination and landscape patterns are heterogeneous across spaces and scale-dependent, but most studies were carried out on a single scale and used the conventional multivariate analyses (e.g. correlation analysis, ordinary least squared regression-OLS) that ignored the issue of spatial autocorrelation. To move forward, this paper examined spatially varying relationships between agricultural soil trace metal contamination and landscape patterns at three block scales (i.e. 5 km x 5 km, 10 km x 10 km, 15 km x 15 km) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), south China, using geographically weighted regression (GWR). This paper found that GWR performed better than OLS in terms of increasing R square of the model, lowering Akaike Information Criterion values and reducing spatial autocorrelation. GWR results revealed great spatial variations in the relationships across scales, with an increasing explanatory power of the model from small to large block scales. Despite a few negative correlations, more positive correlations were found between soil contamination and different aspects of landscape patterns of water, urban land and the whole landscape (i.e. the proportion, mean patch area, the degree of landscape fragmentation, landscape-level structural complexity, aggregation/connectivity, road density and river density). Similarly, more negative correlations were found between soil contamination and landscape patterns of forest and the distance to the river and industry land (p < 0.05). Furthermore, most significant correlations between soil contamination and landscape variables occurred in the western PRD across scales, which could be explained by the prevailing wind, the distribution of pollutant sources and the pathway of trace metal inputs.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate colonization of restored rivers is a function of dispersal into the restored reach and its suitability for population establishment. To maximize potential for colonization success, spatial considerations such as distance to colonizer source pools and dispersal pathways must be included in restoration planning. Unfortunately, the dispersal abilities of macroinvertebrates and ecological importance of different dispersal modes for colonization are still poorly understood. We used a field experiment that controlled colonization by passive drift and allowed distinction between active upstream aquatic and active/passive aerial dispersal, thus testing their differential importance during colonization of experimentally restored stream reaches. Two agricultural streams emanating below culverts were longitudinally separated along the first 30 m and one stream side each was covered with a fine-mesh net to limit aerial dispersal. Colonization of manually disturbed background and experimentally introduced cobble substrate was investigated over 6 months. We found that upstream in-stream dispersal, especially in these agricultural streams, can be rapid (days) and play an important role in the short-term colonization of restored streams. We conclude that a landscape perspective, in addition to in-stream measures, must be considered when attempting to restore streams dominated by agricultural and urban land use that constrains available species pools and limits dispersal pathways.

AB  - Foliar fungal endophytes represent a diverse and species-rich plant microbiome. Their biogeography provides essential clues to their cryptic relationship with hosts and the environment in which they disperse. We present species composition, diversity, and dispersal patterns of endophytic fungi associated with needles of Pinus taeda trees across regional scales in the absence of strong environmental gradients as well as within individual trees. An empirical designation of rare and abundant taxa enlightens us on the structure of endophyte communities. We report multiple distance-decay patterns consistent with effects of dispersal limitation, largely driven by community changes in rare taxa, those taxonomic units that made up less than 0.31% of reads per sample on average. Distance-decay rates and community structure also depended on specific classes of fungi and were predominantly influenced by rare members of Dothideomycetes. Communities separated by urban areas also revealed stronger effects of distance on community similarity, confirming that host density and diversity plays an important role in symbiont biogeography, which may ultimately lead to a mosaic of functional diversity as well as rare species diversity across landscapes.

AB  - Ancient City of Ray, located at the southern urban part of Tehran province, is one of the best recognized civilization sites in the world. In this study, the past earthquake incidence in Ray was reviewed using hazards united states tool as a geographic information system-based natural hazard analysis tool. hazards united states tool was chosen to estimate the damage on structural and non-structural elements during various earthquake scenarios with magnitudes of 4.5, 6 and 7.5 on the Richter scale in Ray City. Earthquake magnetitudes of 4.5, 6 and 7.5 would severely damage 49, 72 and 82% of buildings, respectively. The number of casualties was estimated to be in the range of 558 to 2220 people. It was also computed that 93, 197 and 331 km(3) of debris would be produced at 4.5, 6 and 7.5 Richter earthquake, respectively. Subsequently, Arc-GIS was used to find out the best route from the affected areas to the temporary disposal locations and to allocate the required number of heavy equipments and manpowers for debris disposal planning. A set of factors, including diversity of the existing wastes, separation of the recyclable wastes, and allocation of the best place and route for debris disposal in the shortest time and with the shortest distance in the street network, were presented and considered in the analyses. Finally, it was concluded that debris management is not only a logistic activity, but also it is an inseparable part of the post-accident recovery process.

AB  - The abandonment of most Maya Lowland cities during the Terminal Classic period is a well-known phenomenon whereas their previous growth in population during the Classic period has not received the same attention. This increase may have been at least partly due to a rapid immigration from the hinterland, which would have eventually favored an inverse movement under deteriorating circumstances. At La Joyanca, Guatemala, a medium-sized center with a 160-hectare residential zone, a burst of monumental construction occurred in both the public plaza and neighborhoods by 600-700 CE. Paleoenvironmental studies of a core from an adjacent lake indicate a local and abrupt decrease in land use activities at the onset of the Late Classic period. Based on the assumption that this decrease was due to a population movement from the hinterland into the city that contributed to construction, in 2012 a systematic test pit program was applied to the La Joyanca residential neighborhoods, allowing us to analyze the dynamics over Classic times. Results point to a significant, possibly rapid mobility into the city by early Late Classic times, a more gradual settlement contraction, and three final movements of desertion by the end of the Terminal Classic phase.

AB  - Land allocation for urban growth is central to sustainable development strategy because urban growth can impact space available for food production, ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Urbanization is a growing stressor due the 2.5 billion additional people projected to live in urban areas by 2050. Potential climate change impacts to natural systems increase the need for sustainable urbanization, which should integrate land use needs for urban growth with climate adaptation objectives such as maintaining biodiversity, food production and ecosystem services. Here we compare climate-neutral and climate-adaptive urbanization scenarios to see which produces the most sustainable urbanization, defined as being the most effective at meeting development, conservation, and two climate adaptation objectives. We modeled five urban growth scenarios portraying an increase of 25.8 million people by 2050 for California, USA comprising three climate-neutral scenarios: business-as-usual, compact-new-growth and infill (redevelopment); and two climate-adaptive scenarios: preservation of agricultural climate refugia or future plant dispersal corridors. Infill was the least impacting for the multiple objectives tested; preserving 46-57% more land for other uses. Each climate-adaptive scenario reduced land consumption for its respective target, but increased impacts to the opposite climate-adaptive scenario target. Infill has the potential to contribute towards sustainable urbanization, particularly if combined with other climate adaptation targets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to detect ventilation corridors in three epochs (1992, 2002 and 2011) by mapping rough urban areas. The roughness parameters calculations are based on a 3D building database obtained from satellite imagery (SPOT) for thee epochs and are conducted accordingly to morphometric methods. Several ventilation paths are clearly recognisable for all three decades and based on the proximity analysis and roughness parameters (by calculating roughness length (z(0)) and zero-plane displacement height (z(d))), we established their extent and analysed the structural and developmental changes. We conducted that changes occurred more rapidly in the second period - almost 90% of the study area was gradually built up, what obstructs the air flow. In addition, winds are blocked in the western part of the city - where the best wind conditions occur. The results urge to re-evaluate the current shape of ventilation corridors and suggest some new areas that should be included in the air ventilation system to improve citizens' comfort and urban climate.

AB  - Urbanization strongly influences headwater stream chemistry and hydrology, but little is known about how these conditions impact bacterial community composition. We predicted that urbanization would impact bacterial community composition, but that stream water column bacterial communities would be most strongly linked to urbanization at a watershed-scale, as measured by impervious cover, while sediment bacterial communities would correlate with environmental conditions at the scale of streamreaches. To test this hypothesis, we determined bacterial community composition in the water column and sediment of headwater streams located across a gradient of watershed impervious cover using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Alpha diversity metrics did not show a strong response to catchment urbanization, but beta diversity was significantly related to watershed impervious cover with significant differences also found between water column and sediment samples. Samples grouped primarily according to habitat-water column vs. sediment-with a significant response to watershed impervious cover nested within each habitat type. Compositional shifts for communities in urbanized streams indicated an increase in taxa associated with human activity including bacteria from the genus Polynucleobacter, which is widespread, but has been associated with eutrophic conditions in larger water bodies. Another indicator of communities in urbanized streams was an OTU from the genus Gallionella, which is linked to corrosion of water distribution systems. To identify changes in bacterial community interactions, bacterial co-occurrence networks were generated from urban and forested samples. The urbanized co-occurrence network was much smaller and had fewer co-occurrence events per taxon than forested equivalents, indicating a loss of keystone taxa with urbanization. Our results suggest that urbanization has significant impacts on the community composition of headwater streams, and suggest that processes driving these changes in urbanized water column vs. sediment environments are distinct.

KW  - SPRAWL
AB  - This article, based on the literature review, aims to study the challenges of the urban dispersion and oversizing of urban perimeters, in the cases where the towns are shrinking or spreading to the rural land-use. It is focused on the case of Portugal where during the last decades there was an escaping to the big cities alongside to the sea (Atlantic and Mediterranean) shore. In the Interior part of the country, which means near to the border with Spain, several towns are shrinking, despite their huge urban perimeters, proposed by the municipal master plans, since the middle of the nineties. Consequently, these urban perimeters are nowadays oversizing, with empty buildings and non-urbanized areas. At the same time, the social patterns of occupation of this territory have changed significantly, moving from a society with signs of rurality to an urban realm, understood not only in territorial terms but also regarding the current lifestyle. This deep changing has occurred not only in urbanistic terms but also in the economic, cultural and social organizations of the country, under a movement that corresponds to a decline of the small urban settlements in rural areas, far away from the cosmopolitan strip of land nearby the sea, in between the capital city, Lisbon and the second one Oporto. These transformations were not driven by any significant public policy for land-use actions. On the contrary, the production of urban areas, supporting the new model of economic and social development was largely left to the initiative of economic and social private agents and land owners. These agents were the leading responsible for the new urban developments and housing. In this sense, this research aims to present some strategies for the short time period regarding the devolution of urban areas to rural land use. In this sense, the next steps of spatial planning policies, under the role of local authorities (the 308 municipalities including Madeira and Azores islands, plus the continental part of the country), which are their main promoters, will be motivated by the need of advocating the swap of many urban areas towards the rural land use, shrinking many existent urban perimeters in depressed territories. How will the non-urbanized spaces, included in the urban perimeters, twenty years ago, by the pivotal instrument of spatial planning in Portugal, the Municipal Master Plans turn back to the rural land-use, losing their market value? This is the base of the challenges ahead, analysed in this article.

AB  - AimWe characterised protistan taxa in ships' ballast water (BW) arriving to port systems across three U.S. coasts. Our goals were to compare (1) diversity and (2) community composition of protists in BW among and between port systems.
   LocationChesapeake Bay in Virginia (Port of Hampton Roads), Galveston Bay in Texas (Ports of Texas City, Houston and Bayport) and Prince William Sound in Alaska (Port of Valdez).
   MethodsWe collected 61 BW samples from 39 vessels from May to August 2013. We conducted amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the hypervariable V4 domain of the small subunit (SSU) gene of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) complex to identify protistan taxa.
   ResultsWe detected 8,561 OTUs from protistan taxa, including 35 taxonomic groups. We found high protistan diversity in the BW entering all three port systems, with the dominant taxa belonging to the Alveolata, Rhizaria and Stramenopiles. Thirty-eight taxa were found in high relative abundance (>10,000 sequences), and some were recovered from multiple samples within and across ports, indicating both a high relative abundance and frequency of introduction events. The composition of the protistan communities entering each of the port systems appeared to vary depending on BW source, with those entering Valdez being consistently more similar to each other than those entering other port systems.
   Main conclusionsThis study is the most comprehensive assessment of protistan diversity in BW and has important implications for microbial biogeography and invasions. Ships' BW is importing distinct and diverse protistan communities to U.S. coasts with high propagule pressure for some taxa, creating opportunity for invasion by novel taxa. Further, our results demonstrate the broad-scale movement of marine protists that has occurred through BW, highlighting a discrepancy between the large magnitude of introductions and limited number of known microbial invasions.

People living in these environments have specific needs and demands in terms of ecosystem services (ES). Urban ecosystems are transformed in many ways by human activities and their floras comprise a high proportion of alien plant species, many of which were intentionally introduced to provide, augment or restore ES. Urban environments also have novel disturbance regimes and provide colonization sites for the establishment, dispersal and proliferation of alien plant species; such conditions often generate biological invasions which may cause marked changes to ES. We review the roles that alien plants play in providing urban ES and ecosystem disservices (EDS) globally. We identify the main ES and EDS associated with alien plants, and highlight the key species involved. A literature search revealed 335 papers, representing studies in 58 cities or urban areas in 27 countries. These studies recorded 337 alien plant species, contributing to 39 different ES and 27 EDS-310 species were recorded as contributing to ES and 53 species to EDS. A small number of alien plant taxa were frequently recorded as providing multiple ES in many urban ecosystems; the 10 most recorded species accounted for 21% of the ES recorded. Some of these species also result in significant EDS; three species accounted for 30% of the EDS recorded. Cultural services (notably aesthetics) are the most reported ES provided by alien plants in urban areas of developed countries, while provisioning services (notably food production) are most reported in developing countries. The most commonly studied EDS provided by alien plants is the impact on human health (notably allergic reactions). Eighty percent of studies on alien plants and ES and EDS have been done in developed countries. To elucidate the full range of effects of alien plants, more work is needed in developing countries. Urban planners and managers need to be mindful of both the positive and negative impacts of alien plant species to maximise the provision of ES.

AB  - Upon establishment in a new area, invasive species may undergo a prolonged period of relatively slow population growth and spread, known as a lag period. Lag periods are, apparently, common in invasions, but studies of the factors that facilitate subsequent expansions are lacking in natural systems. We used 10 semi-independent invasions of the Asian house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus) to investigate which factors facilitate expansion of this human-associated species across the urban-woodland interface. We conducted 590 surveys over 12months on 10 transects running from the urban edge to 2km into adjacent natural woodland. We recorded H.frenatus out to 2km from the urban edge on nine of 10 transects, and at high abundance at many woodland sites. Body size, body condition, sex ratio and proportion of gravid females did not vary with distance from the urban edge, suggesting viable, self-sustaining populations in natural habitats. The extent of expansion was, however, strongly dependent on propagule pressure (the abundance of H.frenatus at the urban edge), and time (time since H.frenatus established in the urban area). The size of the urban area and the structure of the surrounding environment did not impact invasion. Our results show that an invasive species that is deemed human-associated' over most of its range is invading natural habitats, and propagule pressure strongly controls the lag time in this system, a finding that echoes results for establishment probability at larger scales.

AB  - The traffic state evolution of urban road network is complicated and varies significantly with different roads, functional zones, and social activities. Considering the regularity of human travel activities, from a long-term perspective, typical traffic state variation patterns for road network could be extracted. In order to extract traffic variation features, spectral clustering technique, an unsupervised learning method, is applied to analyze daily traffic state variation for the region road network based on section-based traffic speed dataset. The proposed method transforms traditional clustering problems into graph partition problems, which is suitable for the clustering problems with multiple attributes by dimension reduction. In this study, five daily traffic state variation clusters are efficiently grouped with different regularities and ranges. The frequency distributions of the sections in each cluster are related with hierarchies, locations, and functions of roads. Long-term heavy-traffic road sections and abnormal traffic state caused by festivals are detected based on the analysis of clusters. The knowledge on the spatiotemporal diversity, similarity, and relativity for network traffic state variation can be naturally discovered. Traffic variation patterns could be incorporated into network-level traffic-prediction and route-guidance algorithms in intelligent transportation systems.

AB  - In recent years there is greater awareness of the need to match up the large amount of historical and environmental heritage of the Italian territory with the quality and concentration of cultural heritage and tourist services and put them into a network, through a new system of mobility. Urban and territorial policies should identify strategies and projects favoring the connections and use of sites, the perception of landscapes and the subjective emotions they arouse in the community. This interdisciplinary paper aims to rediscover the values and diversity of natural and cultural landscapes in Sicily by following slow routes immersed in valuable rural and urban areas. The proposed investigation by micro-economic method provides the private and public parties interested with initial useful information on the potentiality of implementing services enabling visitors to enjoy environmental and cultural goods, which often represent the true side of territories.

AB  - In much of the United States and elsewhere, urbanization continues to transform landscapes. In central Texas, anthropogenic conversion of land is due in part to a rapidly growing population in the Austin and San Antonio metro areas and the subsequent infrastructure and resources needed to support that growth. Protected natural areas adjacent to urbanized landscapes are often intended to mitigate the impact of land development by serving as wildlife habitat. To maximize the potential of this habitat, we must assess how urbanization influences the occurrence of species in these natural areas (e.g., parks, greenspaces, preserves). We used motion -activated cameras to survey 72 sites (points) across six different regions throughout the urban corridor from San Antonio to Austin. Using occupancy modeling, we examined the influence of ten different urbanization factors (model covariates) on the occurrence of a variety of medium-sized mammal species. Generalist species, such as raccoons and opossums, had an increased probability of occurrence at sites with greater urban influence and were most likely to occur in smaller more urbanized study areas. Ringtails and grey foxes appeared to be unaffected by urbanization and were equally likely to occur across all sites. None of the other examined species were found to have a conclusively positive or negative response to urbanization. Knowledge of the effect of urbanization on wildlife will be important in evaluating current preserves as well as planning future preserves. Our study suggests that natural areas within urbanizing landscapes can be effective in providing habitat for some wildlife species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystems are essential in providing multiple services to society. However, understanding ecosystem services (ESS) in terms of spatial distribution and trade-offs still remains a challenge for landscape planners and natural resource managers. In this paper, we analyzed the supply of a set of ESS carbon storage, soil erosion protection, biodiversity, and recreation within the landscape surrounding the city of Bari in Southern Italy. Through an analysis of this landscape, which includes natural protected areas, such as Natura 2000 Network sites, national and regional parks and nature reserves, and in view of the recent Fitness Check of the Nature Directives, we aimed to provide answers to the following questions: (i) Where are the areas of high and low supply of individual ecosystem services located?; (ii) Where do ecosystem service trade-offs (i.e., 'hotspots' and 'coldspots') occur?; and (iii) To what extent are ecosystem service hotspots and coldspots located within or outside of natural protected areas? Results show that most of the landscape in the study area supplied at least one of the selected ESS and that ESS hotspots were mostly located within forested and/or natural areas. Hotspots occupied 8.0% of the total landscape, with 23.7% located in natural protected areas. Coldspots were scarce and equal to 2.4%; they constituted only 0.1% of natural protected areas. Almost all of the landscape (89.6%) consists of intermediate areas (i.e., between hotspots and coldspots); 76.2% of natural protected areas consists of intermediate areas. This latter finding is relevant because the high intermediate classes are potentially high-performing areas, which lie mainly on the borders of protected spaces; they can positively influence ecological processes and thus enhance a wide-ranging provision of ESS. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing landscapes to facilitate the selection of priority areas where management efforts would yield maximum benefits.

AB  - To determine the seasonal abundance of the medically important rove beetles of the genus Paederus in northeastern Brazil and the influence of trap height on trapping efficiency, the insects were collected one night per week during 2015 in blacklight traps set at three different heights (0 m, 3 m, 6 m) in urban and periurban areas of northeastern Brazil. A total of 255 specimens of Paederus species were collected, mostly during June followed by July, showing one peak of abundance. Trap height had a significant effect on overall trap catch, with more caught in the traps hung at 6 m than the other heights. These findings demonstrate that trap height must be considered in developing a trap system for monitoring Paederus. People must be aware of the phototaxis of Paederus and avoid being beneath or beside light sources at the peak periods of abundance of these beetles.

AB  - Information on the diversity of fungal spores in air is limited, and also the content of airborne spores of fungal plant pathogens is understudied. In the present study, a total of 152 air samples were taken from rooftops at urban settings in Slagelse, DK, Wageningen NL, and Rothamsted, UK together with 41 samples from above oilseed rape fields in Rothamsted. Samples were taken during 10-day periods in spring and autumn, each sample representing 1 day of sampling. The fungal content of samples was analyzed by metabarcoding of the fungal internal transcribed sequence 1 (ITS1) and by qPCR for specific fungi. The metabarcoding results demonstrated that season had significant effects on airborne fungal communities. In contrast, location did not have strong effects on the communities, even though locations were separated by up to 900 km. Also, a number of plant pathogens had strikingly similar patterns of abundance at the three locations. Rooftop samples were more diverse than samples taken above fields, probably reflecting greater mixing of air from a range of microenvironments for the rooftop sites. Pathogens that were known to be present in the crop were also found in air samples taken above the field. This paper is one of the first detailed studies of fungal composition in air with the focus on plant pathogens and shows that it is possible to detect a range of pathogens in rooftop air samplers using metabarcoding.

AB  - This article presents an analysis and environmental characterization of the area known as Wetlands of the Paranapanema River, in Rosana municipality, using GTP System (Geosystem-Terrritory-Landscape) methodology proposed by Bertrand (1990), aiming environmental planning of the area, based on a proposal to create an ecological corridor. For this, a broad bibliographic review was done with themes such as landscape, geosystem and environmental legislation. The landscape characterization and analysis was carried out from Ecological Potential (Geomorphology-Climate-Hydrography) and Ecological Exploration (Vegetation-SoilFauna) mapping, as well as environmental legislation analysis about APPs and Legal Reserves. Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were applied to elaborate maps, along with fieldwork to validate the information. The proposals for corridor creation were based on Public Inquiry 263/2010 of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Sao Paulo, which discusses an on-site reserve area creation. In addition, other proposals analyzed which includes the study area in the regional context as in the case of the Parana River Biodiversity Corridor. Also, semi-structured interviews were performed with the purpose of extracting local population feelings towards this landscape and evaluate their intentions for the future of the area. Based on the results obtained, it is intended to establish an initial draft about the possibility of creating this ecological corridor, providing this material to Rosana City Hall, among other public agencies, nongovernmental organizations and local population, contributing to the debate.

AB  - Mangrove forests worldwide undergo anthropogenic fragmentation that may threatentheir existence, and yet there have been few tests of the effects of fragmentation on demographic processes critical for mangrove regeneration. Predicting the effects of habitat fragmentation on mangroves is problematic as pollinators may move more freely across water than terrestrial habitat, and propagules can be widely dispersed by water. Here, within each of two estuaries, we compared pollinator diversity and activity, reproductive effort and output, and rates of recruitment for sets of three large (>1500 trees), medium (300-500) and small (<50) stands. As predicted, most measures of reproductive activity and success were inversely related to stand size with large stands typically producing significantly more and larger fruit, and significantly more seedlings. Most strikingly, we found the effect of fragmentation on the abundance of pollinators (honeybees), the production and quality of fruit and the survival rate of seedlings to be similar, showing significant reduction of recruitment in small stands. This study provides the first rigorous evidence that recruitment of mangroves, like for many terrestrial plants, is negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation. From a management perspective, we argue that in the short term our data imply the importance of conserving the largest possible stands. However, additional work is needed to determine (1) the proportion of recruits within small stands that originate within large stands, (2) how seedling performance varies with fruit size and genotype, and (3) how seedling size and performance vary with the abundance and diversity of pollen.

AB  - The stability and reliability of the symbiosis network in industrial parks have attracted many concern of researchers. How to construct the symbiosis network and deal with the accidents happened in a symbiosis network is a key problem. Analogizing the concept of redundancy species and complex network redundancy, a framework to quantify the redundancy on symbiosis network was established to improve the stability and reliability in this paper. In addition, we characterized the redundancy of an industrial symbiosis network into three types: stock redundancy, scale redundancy and functional redundancy and further quantified the impact of redundancy on the stability of symbiosis network and environmental risks. The results show that increasing the stock redundancy can improve the stability of a symbiosis network to a certain degree (except tailing impoundment) while only slightly changing the environmental risks. The stock redundancy, scale redundancy and functional redundancy were 0.54, 0.09 and 0.71, respectively. The tailing impoundment temporarily used for hazardous waste storage is effective measure to improve redundancy of the symbiosis network. The case study of a hazardous waste symbiosis network confirmed that the scale of a temporary storage facility and other downstream symbiosis provided useful insights for developing and managing of Eco-industrial parks. Also it is useful for planning and designing of Eco-industrial parks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Patrick Geddes is a recognized founder of urban and regional planning. Despite this accolade, a review of US planning programs reflects Geddes's work largely absent from planning pedagogy. Recently interest in Geddes has revived in several fields. However, many researchers, particularly in planning, still criticize his ideas as lacking a coherent theoretical framework or as obsolete in addressing the power relations in contemporary cities and social movements. In this paper, I seek to augment recent work on Geddes as well as explore criticisms of his approach. I examined published and archival manuscripts dealing with Geddes's approach to planning. I argue Geddes did, across his voluminous output, frame a consistent planning theory valuable for contemporary environmental planning and social movements. I conclude by calling for wider reintroduction of Geddes's ideas into planning education and research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - California's black bear (Ursus americanus) population has tripled over the last 3 decades, causing an increased incidence of human bear conflicts, many of which now occur in urban areas. Consequently, it is imperative that bear managers have the ability to monitor population parameters in both wildland and urban environments to help manage bears. Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods using uniquely typed genetic samples (DNA) collected via hair-snares have been widely used to monitor bears in wildland areas. However, we are unaware of researchers applying this technique to bears occupying urban areas. We implemented a multi-year DNA-based CMR study to compare bear densities between an urban area and a nearby wildland area. We deployed hair-snares for 6 weekly capture occasions during June and July, 2011 and 2012. We uniquely typed DNA from snared hair follicles using 14 microsatellite loci and 2 sexing loci. We coupled unique identification with robust-design closed-capture models and model averaging in Program MARK to estimate. abundance. We identified 41 and 62 individual bears on the urban and wildland study areas, with average densities of 3.8 and 1.8 bears/10 km(2), respectively. Our data support the hypothesis that bears can occur at greater densities in urban areas. Based on these results, we recommend using DNA-based CMR methods to monitor populations of bears in urban areas, but we suggest increasing the density of sampling locations to account for greater bear densities. Furthermore, we contend that DNA-based CMR can also estimate survival, recruitment, rate of population change (lambda), and identify movement patterns by incorporating additional survey years.

AB  - The loss of ponds and the fragmentation of their surrounding landscape negatively impacts the biodiversity of wetlands, such as damselflies. They are short-distance dispersers and can be influenced by the quality of suitable habitats and the landscape matrix. The aim of this study was to test the effect of the environmental context (i.e. pond characteristics and the surrounding landscape) on movements and survival probability in a damselfly species, Ischnura elegans. Three approaches (i.e. capture-mark-recapture, individual tracking and translocation studies) were performed in Northwestern France. The characteristics of ponds did not influence damselfly survival. However, the landscape context affected movements within ponds, and between ponds. Individuals from open-field ponds moved over longer distances than individuals from urban ponds. Moreover, in cases of disturbances, such as a pond drying up, movements from one pond to another were observed only in the open-field context. The ecological quality of the pond did not appear to affect survival of individuals, probably because I. elegans has a high tolerance to changes in ecological factors. However, higher local movements depend on the degree of openness of the landscape. Landscape context is hence a key issue in damselfly conservation planning and in maintaining ecological continuities, such as along greenways and blueways, and specifically the degree of landscape openness during pond creation.

AB  - In this paper, I explore the notions of community' and trust' with regard to Congolese refugees living in the city Kampala, Uganda. I collected the primary data from individual refugees and refugee communities in 2010-2011. Jabareen and Carmon's [2010. Community of Trust: A Socio-cultural Approach for Community Planning and the Case of Gaza. Habitat International 34: 446-453] analytical framework on communities of trust' is applied in this paper. I analyse refugees' five distinct types of communities of trust' here by examining three mutually reinforcing community-elements: daily life practices, basic beliefs and attitudes, and shared space. I conclude that certain communities identified by the refugees form an important informal space of protection' for them. Participation in community activities does not, however, automatically signify a strong sense of belonging. Shared beliefs and attitudes bring refugees together and act as reinforcing factors in community building. Inter-community mistrust also strengthens intra-community trust. Urban refugee communities occupy various micro-spaces in their city of exile, and engage both in acts of resistance and cooperation when it comes to their spatial practices. These main findings have implications for refugee communities and for agencies and authorities working with these communities.

AB  - In large cities there are two serious problems connected with increasing number of cars. The first problem is the congestion of vehicles' movement. The second one is too small of car parks, especially in centres of the cities. Authorities of cities and management of municipal streets introduce limitations in vehicles' movement and reduce the number of car parks to minimalize streets crowd. That acting seems logical, but this is only the one point of view. From the other point of view municipal governments should aim to improve the level of the occupants' life and assure the financial incomes, which enable to cover indispensable expenses. From this point of view, the municipal car parks are needed and bringing the profits element of municipal infrastructure. Cracow, which is one of the largest cities in Poland (about 760 thousands of occupants, and Cracovian agglomeration is about 1.4 million persons), was chosen as the object of the investigations. The zone of paid parking in Cracow, administered by the company belonging to city, has possessed 28837 parking places in 28.01.2016. In the zone there are assigned car parks or parking places near to the curbs and on pavements. The zone operates from Monday to Friday, from 10.00 to 20.00. Assuming using car parks only in 50% and fare of about 0.7 euro per hour, we receive incomes figuring out about 740000 euro/month. The purpose of the investigations was the identification of technical parameters of car parks being preferred by drivers. The investigations had been executed by method of questionnaires. Next the mathematical model of competition was made. The model was executed basing on the theory of games. Strategies of "Player 1" were prices and technical equipment of car parks and parking places lying in the zone of paid parking, administered by municipal company. Strategies of "Player 2" were prices and technical equipment of car parks belonging to private owners and two commercial centres in the city center. There were assumed that from the city's point of view it is one rival, independently on the actual ownership of private car parks on whose strategy of acting the city do not have an influence. It is consistent with the basic foundations of the game theory. Both players compete for consumers -drivers using car parks, with such parameters like: price, distance from the destination, car parks' equipment. The built model allows to indicate the best strategy. Knowing that strategy, one can form prices and equipment of car parks. That model may be used by municipal governments and companies which administer car parks. However, one should remember about limitations, which occur in reality, e.g. law restrictions referring to maximum prices for parking. The increasing pressure of cities' authorities in Poland for changing those regulations, and examples of such solutions received, e.g. in USA, which concern varying prices for parking according to the demand on different car parks, and different hours, permit to have hopes, that the proposed model will be possible to use practically, soon.

AB  - In recent years, urban neighborhoods in many Western nations have undergone neighborhood restructuring initiatives, especially in public housing developments. Regent Park, Canada's oldest and largest public housing development, is a neighborhood currently undergoing 'neighborhood revitalization' based on the social mix model. One tenet of this model is the idea that original public housing residents are benefiting from interactions with middle class residents. Based on qualitative interviews and ethnographic observations with original housing residents as well as new middle-class homeowners, we examine whether cross-class interactions actually occur "on the ground" in Regent Park. By examining an iteration of the model that differs with respect to the direction of resident movement-that is, the revitalization of Regent Park involves more advantaged residents buying into the once low-income neighborhood, as opposed to providing lower-income residents with housing vouchers to move out of the community (and into more affluent neighborhoods across the city)-our study provides a unique contribution to the existing research on social mix. In particular, our research examines whether the direction of this resident movement has any distinct or demonstrable impact on: (1) the daily perceptions, attitudes, and actions of original and new residents, and (2) the nature of cross-class interactions. Second, unlike the vast majority of studies done in Europe and the United States, which are conducted "postrevitalization," we examine the effects of neighborhood revitalization as the process unfolds.

AB  - The arapaima, Arapaima gigas, is a fish whose populations are threatened by both overfishing and the ongoing destruction of its natural habitats. In the Amazon basin, varying levels of population structure have been found in A. gigas, although no data are available on the genetic diversity or structure of the populations found in the Araguaia-Tocantins basin, which has a topographic profile, hydrological regime, and history of fishing quite distinct from those of the Amazon. In this context, microsatellite markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and connectivity of five wild A. gigas populations in the Araguaia-Tocantins basin. The results of the analysis indicated low levels of genetic diversity in comparison with other A. gigas populations, studied in the Amazon basin. The AMOVA revealed that the Arapaima populations of the Araguaia-Tocantins basin are structured significantly. No correlation was found between pairwise F-ST values and the geographical distance among populations. The low level of genetic variability and the evidence of restricted gene flow may both be accounted for by overfishing, as well as the other human impacts that these populations have been exposed to over the years. The genetic fragility of these populations demands attention, given that future environmental changes (natural or otherwise) may further reduce these indices and eventually endanger these populations. The results of this study emphasize the need to take the genetic differences among the study populations into account when planning management measures and conservation strategies for the arapaima stocks of the Araguaia-Tocantins basin.

AB  - Food provided by householders represents a key resource for urban red foxes Vulpes vulpes. Using long-term video footage, we examined how patterns of feeding site attendance varied with season, sex, and likely residence status. For foxes attending frequently (proportion individual attendance >15%) we found feeding site attendance highest for females in spring, probably because of feeding dependent young, and lowest for both sexes in autumn because of changes in seasonal food abundance or in time spent in other activities. For infrequent attenders (proportion individual attendance <15%), females attended most often in autumn and winter, coinciding with the dispersal period. Male attendance was not higher during the breeding season. Our combined results show how feeding site attendance changes throughout the year relative to potential intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

AB  - This article analyzes both representations of disability in popular media and the role of disabled workers in urban India and demonstrates how the category of disability becomes a form of non-threatening 'feel good' diversity. Unlike other axes of difference such as class, caste, gender, sexuality, and religion, India's disability rights movement, corporations, and mainstream media represent disability as largely apolitical. Drawing on Nehruvian ideals about 'unity in diversity', this article discusses how disability functions as a means of imagining and creating unity in India. As a result of skillful manipulation that collapses and conflates nationalist and neoliberal projects, the success of disabled people is considered to be synonymous with the success of the nation. This essay thus examines how thinking, feeling, and representing through disability provides a new way of conceptualizing the nation and critically engages with ideas and ideals of 'disability publics'. Disability is rendered into a representation and while tension exists between feeling good and feeling bad, the specter of a contentious disability politics is kept at bay.

AB  - The Red-eyed Coqui, Eleutherodactylus antillensis, is a terrestrial frog endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank (Puerto Rico and numerous islands and cays off its eastern coast), in the eastern Caribbean Sea. The species was likely introduced in Saint Croix, an island c. 100 km southeast of Puerto Rico, in the late 1930s, and in Panama City, Panama ', in the late 1950s or early 1960s, but the source(s) of these introductions are unknown. We analyzed sequence data from one mtDNA locus and four nuDNA introns to infer the origin(s) of the Saint Croix and Panama City populations and quantify their genetic diversity. Saint Croix and Panamanian populations do not share any haplotypes, and they cluster with different native populations, suggesting that they are derived from separate sources in the Puerto Rican Bank. Patterns of population structure trace the probable sources of E. antillensis in Saint Croix to islands off Puerto Rico's eastern coast, which include Vieques, Culebra, Saint Thomas, Saint John, Tortola, and Virgin Gorda, and possibly to eastern Puerto Rico as well. In contrast, Panama City E. antillensis probably originated from either western or eastern Puerto Rico. Genetic diversity in the introduced populations is similar to or lower than in populations in the species' native range, indicating that genetic diversity has not increased in the alien frogs. Our findings may facilitate the development of preventive measures to minimize introductions of non-native amphibians in the Caribbean and Central America.

AB  - The energy landscape is experiencing accelerating change; centralized energy systems are being decarbonized, and transitioning towards distributed energy systems, facilitated by advances in power system management and information and communication technologies. This paper elaborates on these generations of energy systems by critically reviewing relevant authoritative literature. This includes a discussion of modern concepts such as 'smart grid', 'microgrid', 'virtual power plant' and 'multi-energy system', and the relationships between them, as well as the trends towards distributed intelligence and interoperability. Each of these emerging urban energy concepts holds merit when applied within a centralized grid paradigm, but very little research applies these approaches within the emerging energy landscape typified by a high penetration of distributed energy resources, prosumers (consumers and producers), interoperability, and big data. Given the ongoing boom in these fields, this will lead to new challenges and opportunities as the status-quo of energy systems changes dramatically. We argue that a new generation of holonic energy systems is required to orchestrate the interplay between these dense, diverse and distributed energy components. The paper therefore contributes a description of holonic energy systems and the implicit research required towards sustainability and resilience in the imminent energy landscape. This promotes the systemic features of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, and balances global and local system objectives, through adaptive control topologies and demand responsive energy management. Future research avenues are identified to support this transition regarding interoperability, secure distributed control and a system of systems approach.

AB  - Circeo National Park (CNP) is one of the oldest protected areas in Italy. Knowledge of the herpetofauna of CNP is relatively scarce, with the most recent records dating from the 1970s. This gap of knowledge needs to be addressed, considering that this area is one of the last pristine fragments of coastal Mediterranean forest in the Italian Peninsula and potentially hosts high reptile diversity. In this study, we assessed reptile diversity and distribution at the landscape scale, covering all habitats within the park boundary. We performed field surveys during two sampling sessions in 2004-2005 and in 2009-2010, using 127 cells of 1 km(2). We collected 1,471 distribution data points on 16 reptile species. While natural land use categories supported the whole reptile community, urban and agricultural environments hosted about half of the species detected. Reptile distribution was uneven among the natural land categories with 80% of species and all snake species inhabiting the broad-leaved forest category and confirming the expectation of a high herpetological diversity hosted by this last fragment of coastal Mediterranean Forest ecosystem. We discuss the pattern of species distributions in terms of conservation prioritization.

AB  - The abundance of airborne fungal spores in agricultural and urban settings increases with greater air temperature, relative humidity, or precipitation. The same meteorological factors that affect temporal patterns in spore abundance in managed environments also vary spatially across natural habitats in association with differences in vegetation structure. Here we investigated how temporal and spatial variation in aerial spore abundance is affected by abiotic (weather) and biotic (vegetation) factors as a foundation for predicting how fungi may respond to changes in weather and land-use patterns. We measured the phenology of airborne fungal spores across a mosaic of naturally occurring vegetation types at different time scales to describe (1) how spore abundance changes over time, (2) which local meteorological variables are good predictors for airborne spore density, and (3) whether spore abundance differs across vegetation types. Using an air volumetric vacuum sampler, we collected spore samples at 3-h intervals over a 120-h period in a mixed-evergreen forest and coastal prairie to measure diurnal, nocturnal, and total airborne spore abundance across vegetation types. Spore samples were also collected at weekly and monthly intervals in mixed-evergreen forest, redwood forest, and maritime chaparral vegetation types from 12 field sites across two years. We found greater airborne spore densities during the wetter winter months compared to the drier summer months. Mean total spore abundance in the mixed-evergreen forest was twice than in the coastal prairie, but there were no significant differences in total airborne spore abundance among mixed-evergreen forest, redwood forest, and maritime chaparral vegetation types. Weekly and monthly peaks in airborne spore abundance corresponded with rain events and peaks in soil moisture. Overall, temporal patterns in meteorological factors were much more important in determining airborne fungal spore abundance than the vegetation type. This suggests that overall patterns of fungal spore dynamics may be predictable across heterogeneous landscapes based on local weather patterns. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization is considered as a major driver for biotic homogenization. Urbanization also promotes the dispersal of non-native species. This study examined the roles of suburban settlements and of the surrounding landscape composition for the spread of non-native plant species into adjacent mixed deciduous forests in Southern and Northwestern Switzerland. The number and abundance of native and non-native vascular plant species in both the ground vegetation and shrub layer were recorded in 15 forest sites situated adjacent to settlements and 15 control sites far from settlements. Various site and landscape characteristics were assessed in the surroundings (100 m radius) of the study sites. In both regions we found a higher number and larger abundance of non-native plant species in forest sites adjacent to settlements than in control forest sites. Furthermore, non-native plants were more frequently recorded close to roads and in sites surrounded by a large percentage cover of garden. All these effects were more pronounced in Southern Switzerland, a region with milder winter climate, than in Northwestern Switzerland. Our study showed that settlements are a source for the spread of non-native plant species into Central European suburban forests, and that the composition of the surrounding landscape matrix (e.g. traffic infrastructure, percentage cover of gardens) also affects the establishment of non-native plants.

AB  - Using a set of structural and network analysis approaches, this paper focuses on the monumental structure known as 'the Palace' at the Swahili stone town site of Gede, located near the Kenya coast. Gede is one of many stone towns that flourished on the East African littoral from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries AD. The 'Palace complex' is the largest building on site and developed in at least three stages within the last 100-150 years of the site's occupation. Its palatial function has so far been considered mainly in light of its monumentality and relative size, hence on the basis of its formal properties. This article utilises approaches that examine the spatial structure of the complex, offering an analysis of its spatial organisation by studying its inherent potential in terms of movement and visibility. The interpretation of the social logic of its development presented here is based on access and visibility analyses and on network analysis and thus connects methodologies developed in the 1980s with those that have started to be more widely discussed only within the last decade. The results reveal how the configuration and use of rooms, their place in the communication network within the building and their social potential changed through time.

AB  - Nuphar submersa (Nymphaeaceae) is a critically endangered freshwater macrophyte indigenous to central Japan, with only four small extant populations represented across its entire range. We investigated the genotypic and genetic diversity as well as the genetic structure of all extant individuals of N. submersa based on analysis of 15 microsatellite loci. Among 278 individual ramets, 52 multilocus genotypes were detected: 30 genotypes in Nikko City (NIK), 18 in Nasukarasuyama City (NAS), 3 in Mooka City (MOK), and 1 in Sakura City (SAK). The average number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.20 to 1.93, whereas the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.11 to 0.33 and from 0.10 to 0.24, respectively. With the exception of SAK, all populations contained multiple clones, but our results indicated low levels of within-population genetic diversity. The populations NIK and NAS comprised few large or middle-sized genets and many small genets. The populations NIK and NAS were suggested to comprise large old, old fragmented, and/or young small genets resulting from seedling establishment. All four populations were differentiated, and gene flow between the populations was restricted (average level of gene flow (Nm) = 0.122, G' (ST) = 0.639). Of the total genetic diversity, 67.20 and 9.13% were attributable to inter- and intra-population diversity, respectively. STRUCTURE analysis revealed two or three well-differentiated groups of populations. Cluster I comprised one population (NIK) and cluster II comprised the remaining populations at K = 2. The populations NIK, NAS, and the remaining populations were assigned to clusters I, II, and III, respectively, at K = 3. For conservation practices, we recommend that each cluster be regarded as a different management unit. We further suggest that artificial gene flow among MOK and SAK populations is an appropriate option, whereas NIK should not be reinforced with genotypes from the remaining populations.

AB  - Spaceborne Multi-Temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (MT-InSAR) has been a valuable tool in mapping motion phenomena in different scenarios. Recently, the capabilities of MT-InSAR for risk monitoring and preventive analysis of heritage sites have increasingly been exploited. Considering the limitations of conventional MT-InSAR techniques, in this study a two-step Tomography-based Persistent Scatterers (PS) Interferometry (Tomo-PSInSAR) approach is proposed for monitoring ground deformation and structural instabilities over the Ancient City Walls (Ming Dynasty) in Nanjing city, China. For the purpose of this study we utilized 26 Stripmap acquisitions from TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X missions, spanning from May 2013 to February 2015. As a first step, regional-scale surface deformation rates on single PSs were derived (ranging from 40 to +5 mm/year) and used for identifying deformation hotspots as well as for the investigation of a potential correlation between urbanization and the occurrence of surface subsidence. As a second step, structural instability parameters of ancient walls (linear motion rates, non-linear motions and material thermodynamics) were estimated by an extended four-dimensional Tomo-PSInSAR model. The model applies a two-tier network strategy; that is, the detection of most reliable single PSs in the first-tier Delaunay triangulation network followed by the detection of remaining single PSs and double PSs on the second-tier local star network referring to single SPs extracted in the first-tier network. Consequently, a preliminary phase calibration relevant to the Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) is not needed. Motion heterogeneities in the spatial domain, either caused by thermal kinetics or displacement trends, were also considered. This study underlines the potential of the proposed Tomo-PSInSAR solution for the monitoring and conservation of cultural heritage sites. The proposed approach offers a quantitative indicator to local authorities and planners for assessing potential damages as well as for the design of remediation activities.

AB  - Sweden aims to increase the proportion of renewable energy sources, ultimately to be able to phase out fossil fuels. To achieve this, new energy sources need to be explored. In this multi-disciplinary article, we examine the technical, economical, ecological and legal possibilities to commercially and sustainably harvest brushwood for bioenergy, while simultaneously gaining positive environmental effects, both for biological diversity, the cultural heritage, and the climate.
   The Swedish open landscape is becoming covered with secondary brushwood regrowth through natural succession, except where it is kept open. Brushwood is spreading along roads, railway lines, edge zones, in power line corridors, abandoned semi-natural grasslands, nature reserves, and in marginal land in urban areas. Such brushwood consists of saplings, bushes and young trees of a range of deciduous plant species, e.g. birch, aspen, alder and goat willow, sometimes mixed with conifers, often forming dense thickets.
   Such secondary brushwood regrowth could be systematically utilised as a new source of renewable bioenergy. Commercial brushwood harvesting in Sweden may contribute 26 PJ of energy annually, which may be a small but significant contribution, considering the favourable energy ratio (E-r = 28), indicating that large emission reductions can be achieved, if fossil fuels are replaced. Growing brushwood does not require fertilizers or pesticides, soil tillage or crop management, and it does not compete with any other potential land use. Many brushwood habitats are already being managed to clear brushwood, for other purposes, minimizing the added harvesting cost.
   Apart from providing bioenergy, it has also been suggested that brushwood harvesting would benefit biological diversity. A large number of nationally redlisted species are dependent on the active management of open habitats, including semi-natural grasslands, and man-made habitats such as road verges and power line corridors.
   Our literature review shows that brushwood harvesting could benefit both biological diversity and the cultural heritage, and contribute to the management of the open cultural landscape. There are however certain limitations. Brushwood harvesting would favour a certain set of species, including many redlisted, but it may also threaten another set of species, especially species associated with early successional stages of forest regeneration, as well as forest edge species, depending on how and where it is applied. Harvesting may be affected by legislation imposing limitations regarding habitats of particular importance for biodiversity. The environmental and legal constraints would probably reduce the profitability of brushwood harvesting in certain areas, as well as the annual production of bioenergy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapid expansion of urban built-up areas since the 1950s has led to the Milan region becoming one of the major metropolitan areas of Europe. This has been accompanied by significant structural changes to urban and peri-urban landscapes and fragmentation of formerly contiguous green corridors by the distribution of new urban forms such as housing and transport infrastructure. The need to address the loss of green space was first recognised by policy-makers at the end of the 1970s and in due course, this has led to new policies and laws. These policies included the introduction of the Milan metropolitan parks approach that, nowadays, is represented by numerous urban forests that have become the backbone of green infrastructure (GI) creation and management. In the last decades, a total of 10000 hectares of new forests and green systems have been created. Boscoincitta and Parco Nord Milano are the best known examples of this approach aimed to redevelop the neighbourhoods of some suburbs of Milan to create multifunctional green spaces (forests, grasslands, wetlands, river corridor, and allotment gardens) in lands previously industrial or uncultivated. The creation and management of urban forests has become the backbone of GI creation and management in the Metropolitan Area of Milan. In recent decades, trends of land use change have been characterised by a rapid decrease in natural and agricultural areas and an increase in artificial and urban structures. Although the phenomenon is growing rapidly in this area, there is evidence of an opposite social and environmental trend highlighting the importance of GI positively affecting urban quality of life. Recent policies and management plans are dealing with this evidence by turning their attention to expanding green areas and infrastructure. The purpose of our investigation is to revisit effective measures designed to increase the quality and quantity of UGI in the metropolitan region under study. To this end, we assessed land use changes and described the potentialities and impacts of policies on such phenomena. The study analyses the main elements of UGI in the Italian context within the framework of the European Union Life+project called Emonfur, a research programme involving, inter alia, the establishment of an Urban Forest inventory and impact analysis of ecosystem services in the Metropolitan Area of Milan. Our research has allowed us to determine the current status of key sites by monitoring the policy and planning decisions that resulted in their development. We believe that such an analysis can pave the way to understand future land-use dynamics not only in northern Italy but in other metropolitan territories as well.

AB  - Processes relating to urbanization, neoliberal reforms, and militarization increasingly bring state, capitalist, and civil society interests into conflict over varied and competing notions of the use, meaning, and nature of public space. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Oaxaca, Mexico, this article focuses on how a network of youth activists from peripheral colonias (working-class neighborhoods) built on their participation in a social movement that took control of the capital city in 2006. The aim was to construct spatial networks that combined physically and symbolically occupied public space with more territorialized spaces such as youth-run cultural centers. Through an event-centered analysis, this article argues that attending to the material and social constitution of power and space allows us to better grasp the complexities of how power and resistance are produced, contested, and negotiated, such that we can reimagine how we evaluate and understand social movements.

AB  - Differently to other European countries Lithuania has inherited from Soviet time period quite width protection zones of state importance with wooden plantations along railways. Those protection zones vary from 20 m (in cities) up to 45-70 m (in rural areas) in one side. The planted or spontaneous wooden plantations within those zones occupy over 2 thous. ha. The status of protective plantations serve for multifunctional purposes by ensuring railway traffic safety, mitigating negative impact of railway traffic, exhibiting Lithuanian landscape for travellers, improving landscape connectivity, living and working environment quality. At the same time there is a challenge for proper management of those plantations and profitability. In the middle of XX century planted pioneer species reach or is going to reach mature age. There is the threat of increasing number of dangerous trees, challenge for ensuring continuous cover of protective plantations, their services and structure match for predominating function.
   This study presents the challenges for future development and society preferences to services of protective lineside plantations along railways. The results of analysis of present condition of railway lineside vegetation, as well the results of social survey showed, what it is not enough just to manage the dangerous trees for railway safeness but it is essential complex means for protective plantations development, services succession.

AB  - QuestionsWhich types of land use adjacent to Atlantic Tropical Forests induce the strongest edge effects in terms of the functional responses of arboreal and understorey plants? Which functional traits respond to stress imposed by each land-use type in the two forest layers?
   LocationFull-protection conservation areas in the metropolitan region of Recife, Pernambuco State, Brazil.
   MethodsWe calculated the proportions of species and individuals of woody plants in terms of their functional traits (seed size, maximum height, dispersal syndrome and regeneration strategy) along the edge and in the interior of tropical Atlantic Forest remnants exposed to different degrees of adjacent urbanization along their borders (urban, suburban and rural) by establishing 120 sampling points (60 plots considering the arboreal components and 60 subplots considering woody understorey plants).The degree of urbanization adjacent to the edges of the remnant forests were determined by mapping the sites based on satellite images. The intensities of the edge effects on functional composition, and the differences in the functional traits were assessed using multivariate analysis.
   ResultsFunctional composition along the edges and within the forest interiors of remnants with the highest densities of urban areas around them demonstrated the greatest variability of both the arboreal and understorey components. The arboreal component of the forest sites adjacent to rural areas (intense agricultural activities) tended to demonstrate intermediate intensity edge effects. Species showing shade intolerance, with smaller maximum heights, producing small seeds and with abiotic dispersion were present in high proportions in forests bordering heavily urbanized areas. Biotic dispersal predominated in the arboreal component of the rural remnant.
   ConclusionsFrom a functional point of view, the forest with the most highly urbanized border is more impacted by edge effects than forests bordering on suburban or rural areas. Nonetheless, in an urban-rural gradient, intense agricultural activity was observed to create intermediate pressure in terms of the intensities of its edge effects. These edge effects differentially impact the functional traits of the arboreal and understorey components, influencing different traits, depending on the type of border.

AB  - This paper looks at the Occupy Central Movement (OCM) in Hong Kong from an innovative and understudied angle of transport resilience. With the OCM as a shock event, subsequent responses may be conceptualised as having three different phases. Phases One and Two refer to chaos at an adverse event's initial outbreak, and the subsequent state of flux. Phase Three may or may not exist; it sets in when people in the society accept these adaptations as longer-term arrangements. Fragmented data and information about the severe disruptions and ensuing changes of the transport system during and after this shock event have been carefully assembled and systematically analysed in relation to the actions and adaptations made by the Government, the industry and the general public. With increasing urbanisation, all stakeholders, including city governments, the industry and the general public, need to be more prepared for large-scale disruptions caused not just by natural hazards but also human beings. Government actions alone are not sufficient. Speedy and concerted responses of the industry. are indispensable in achieving transport resilience. Effective dissemination of information through different channels is critical. Moreover, there needs to be concrete steps towards establishing Key Resilience Performance Indicators for cities, covering both the hardware and software components of a transport system.

AB  - Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) games are changing the way players interact with other players and in cities in the real world. The game's content influences players' decision to explore the outside world (whole body movement outside the house) instead of staying inside playing stationary games (not whole body movement required). While users interact with these games in the real world, humorous experiences may occur while players attempt to accomplish a goal. In this paper, we discuss the humor interaction implications that Pokemon Go has in the player's experience in the real world. We also describe how these games can provide humor occurrences based on the theories of humor. We aim to provide a discussion on humorous situations that players experience and contribute design guidelines on incorporating humor in mobile AR games based on what players have experienced.

AB  - Retailing presented by network of building objects has been undergoing the constant development.. Present image of Slovak retail premises is the result of social proces by economic and political conditions in the last century. Varied functional operating and volume diversity of trade building built during the era of central controlled economy without competitive environment was affected by planned reduction, lack of premises and austere architectural image. The change from directional to market system in 1989 has brought a great deal of economic reforms with liberalisation of economic environment and also intense impact of globalisation of trade, new kinds of market objects have appeared. These offer a wide range of goods with reasonable prices, especially in towns. The huge expansion of shopping centres built on the outskirts of the towns has been the results of shopping. Big pressure of these big shopping centres resulted into negative position of the shops located in the central parts of the towns.Cultural life has gradually disappeared from historical urban places. On the other hand spending time in marble glass interiors are labeled as the whole day shopping tourism. Urban architectural solution of majority of the markets pursues only acquisitive aims.The absence of philosophy of permanent existence of town urban structure is in their location and image solution.

AB  - Land cover data are often used to examine the impacts of landscape alterations on the environment from the local to global scale. Although various agencies produce land cover data at various spatial scales, data are still limited at the regional scale over extended timescales. This is a critical data gap since decision-makers often use future and long-term land cover maps to develop effective policies for sustainable environmental systems. As a result, land change science incorporates common data mining tools to create future land cover maps that extend over long timescales. This study applied one of the well-known land cover change models, called Land Transformation Model (LTM), to produce urbanization maps for the Lower Peninsula of Michigan in United States from 2010 to 2050 with five year intervals. Long-term urbanization data in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan can be used in various environmental studies such as assessing the impact of future urbanization on climate change, water quality, food security and biodiversity.

AB  - Levels Of Service (LOS) evaluation criteria for off-street pedestrian facilities are not well defined in urban Indian context; hence an in-depth research is carried out in this regard. Defining Pedestrian Level of Service (PLOS) criteria is basically a classification problem; therefore a comparative study is made using three methods of clustering i.e. Affinity Propagation (AP), Self-Organizing Map (SOM) in Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithm-Fuzzy (GA-Fuzzy) clustering. Pedestrian data are used on validation measure of clustering method to obtain optimal number of cluster used in defining PLOS categories. To decide the most suitable algorithm applicable in defining PLOS criteria for urban off-street facilities in Indian context, Wilk's Lambda is used on results of the three clustering methods. It is observed from the analysis that GA-Fuzzy is the most suitable clustering analysis among the three methods. With the help of GA-Fuzzy clustering analysis the ranges of the four measuring parameters (average pedestrian space, flow rate, speed of pedestrian and volume to capacity ratio) are defined by using the data collected from two mid-sized cities located in the state of Odisha, India. It is also observed that at >16.53 m(2)/ped average space, 0.061 ped/sec/m flow rate, >1.21 speed and 0.34 v/c ratio pedestrians can move in their desired path at LOS A' without changing movements and it is the best condition for off-street facilities. But in the pedestrian facility having 4.48 m(2)/ped average space, >0.146 ped/sec/m flow rate, 0.62 average speed and >1.00 v/c ratio, pedestrian movement is severely restricted and frequent collision among users occurs. The ranges of the parameters used for LOS categories found in this study for Indian cities are different from that mentioned in HCM (Highway Capacity Manual 2010) because of differences in population density, traffic flow condition, geometric structure and some other factors.

TI  - The South Asian Presence in the Ecumenical Movement
T2  - ECUMENICAL REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - This article surveys the distinct role South Asian Christianity played in the modern ecumenical movement. It explores how the longevity, vitality, and diversity of Christianity in South Asia, coupled with the pluralistic ethos and inter-religious context of the region, provided a conducive atmosphere for the ecumenical movement to take root in the early decades of the 20th century. The article argues that while there were outstanding ecumenical thinkers and path-breaking church unity efforts in the region, what was most important was the emergence of new theological trends that reverberated across the ecumenical world, such as Dalit theology, tribal theology, and Urban and Rural Mission. While discussing these developments from a historical perspective, this article also tries to identify contemporary issues and challenges in these areas. Today, as the forces of religious nationalism, sectarianism, and fundamentalism are gaining ground in South Asia, the task before us is to realize anew the meaning of ecumenism.

AB  - Traffic behavioral monitoring within urban intersections is an essential issue in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for a smart city. This paper investigates on gathering traffic information within an urban intersection where accidents frequently occur. In this paper, traffic pattern modeling, trajectory classification and a real-time vehicle tracker within the urban intersection are proposed. Trajectories of vehicles within the intersection are more regular than that of pedestrians; such monotonous trajectories can be classified with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) into various kinds of motion patterns and tracklet prediction can be performed then. So, given an identified prefix trajectory (for a new coming vehicle), the most likely model is determined and the probable template (tracklet) with the highest similarity is selected. This template gives the direction to forecast the next few locations the vehicle may pass through. Besides, tracking all of trajectories in real-time is a computational challenge, on the basis of vehicle movement and tracklet prediction, the proposed method can remove most of the unnecessary particles. The experimental results demonstrate both the computational effectiveness and tracking correctness of the proposed method, and the tracker truly executes in real-time for the intersections of six traffic lanes, say around six vehicles per second on tracking.

AB  - Although floodplain restoration may improve stream-riparian connectivity and increase channel stability through cross-vane installation, stream bank regrading, and buffer revegetation, the impact of these geomorphic alterations on denitrification across the aquatic-terrestrial interface is poorly understood. Seasonal denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was compared in stream-riparian ecotones of four streams with varying hydrologic connection, riparian vegetation composition, and agricultural influence. Riparian and stream DEA was generally higher in sites adjacent to agricultural fields due to proximity to nitrate source. Mean DEA was higher in the dormant season (riparian: 928 +/- 116 ng N g(-1) dry mass [DM] h(-1), stream: 108 +/- 149 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1)) than in the growing season (riparian: 355 +/- 55 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1), stream: 45 +/- 40 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1)) and was influenced by antecedent precipitation, soil texture, and landscape characteristics (land use, vegetation type, topography) in multivariate models. Hot spots of denitrification occurred at the confluence of fine soil textures with high organic matter and moisture, often at low-lying areas of the landscape. At the restored site, we observed enhanced denitrification in the reconnected floodplain but decreased stream denitrification capacity in pools. Across all sites, streams had lower DEA than riparian zones, stressing the importance of restoration approaches designed to conserve riparian areas and maintain hydrologic connectivity. Easily obtainable data including precipitation, adjacent land use, vegetation, and stream and floodplain geomorphology reasonably predicted denitrification potential compared with more complex models, showing potential for application in water resources and nitrogen management.

AB  - This article examines the territorial restructuring of the metropolis of Buenos Aires from a functional approach, using commuting relational data along with indicators of concentration and density of population and employment. It is observed that metropolitan growth follows patterns of dispersion and polycentricism, which appear in various areas of the metropolis. The sub centers of employment have the ability to structure the metropolitan operation and exercise different degrees of influence in the respective corridors. However, the central city plays a structuring role mainly in relation to the labor flows in higher skilled and trained occupations, which come mainly from the North and Northwestern corridors. The complexity of these processes must be considered in the formulation of public policies designed to mitigate the unwanted impacts of the dispersion, while the sub centers of employment are consolidated to articulate metropolitan dynamics.

AB  - This study explores the role played by social media in reshaping the repression mobilization relationship. Drawing on the case of the Occupy Wall Street movement, we examine the impact of Facebook and Twitter on the spatial diffusion of protests during a period of heightened state repression. Results from event history analyses suggest that the effects of repression on protest diffusion are contingent on the presence of social media accounts supporting the movement. We find that state repression at earlier protest sites encouraged activists to create Facebook and Twitter accounts in their own cities, which then served as important vehicles for the initiation of new Occupy protests. Moreover, results suggest that repression incidents can directly facilitate future protests in cities that already have Occupy Facebook accounts. This study highlights the potential of social media to both mediate and moderate the influence of repression on the diffusion of contemporary movements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - To find a solution regarding sustainable arable land use pattern in the important grain-producing area during the rapid urbanization process, this study combined agricultural production, locational condition, and ecological protection to determine optimal arable land use. Dongting Lake basin, one of the major grain producing areas in China, was chosen as the study area. The analysis of land use transition, the calculation of arable land barycenter, the landscape indices of arable land patches, and the comprehensive evaluation of arable land quality(productivity, economic location, and ecological condition) were adopted in this study. The results showed that (1) in 1990-2000, the arable land increased by 11.77%, and the transformation between arable land and other land use types actively occurred; in 2000-2010, the arable land decreased by 0.71%, and more ecological area (forestland, grassland, and water area) were disturbed and transferred into arable land; (2) urban expansion of the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan city cluster (the major economy center of this area) induced the northward movement of the arable land barycenter; (3) the landscape fragmentation and decentralization degree of arable land patches increased during 1990-2010; (4) potential high-quality arable land is located in the zonal area around Dongting Lake, which contains the Li County, Linli County, Jinshi County, Taoyuan County, Taojiang County, Ningxiang County, Xiangxiang County, Shaoshan County, Miluo County, and Zhuzhou County. The inferior low-quality arable land is located in the northwestern Wuling mountainous area, the southeastern hilly area, and the densely populated big cities and their surrounding area. In the optimized arable land use pattern, the high-quality land should be intensively used, and the low-quality arable land should be reduced used or prohibitively used. What is more, it is necessary to quit the arable land away from the surrounding area of cities appropriately, in order to allow more space for urban expansion. This study could provide guidance for sustainable arable land use by both satisfying the future agricultural production and the local economic development, which can be used for the other major grain-producing areas in this rapid developing country.

AB  - Nonnative Monk Parakeets have been reported in increasing numbers across many cities in Mexico, and were formally classified as an invasive species in Mexico in late 2016. However, there has not been a large-scale attempt to determine how international pet trade and national and international governmental regulations have played a part in colonization, and when the species appeared in different areas. We describe the changes in regulations that led the international pet trade market to shift to Mexico, then used international trade data to determine how many parakeets were commercially imported each year and where those individuals originated. We also quantified the recent increases in Monk Parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) sightings in Mexico in both the scientific literature and in citizen science reports. We describe the timeline of increased reports to understand the history of nonnative Monk Parakeets in Mexico. As in other areas where the species has colonized, the main mode of transport is through the international pet trade. Over half a million Monk Parakeets were commercially imported to Mexico during 2000-2015, with the majority of importation (90%) occurring in 2008-2014, and almost all (98%) were imported from Uruguay. The earliest record of a free-flying Monk Parakeet was observed during 1994-1995 in Mexico City, but sightings of the parakeets did not become geographically widespread in either the scientific literature or citizen science databases until 2012-2015. By 2015, parakeets had been reported in 97 cities in Mexico. Mexico City has consistently seen steep increases in reporting since this species was first reported in Mexico. Here we find that both national and international legal regulations and health concerns drove a rise and fall in Monk Parakeet pet trade importations, shortly followed by widespread sightings of feral parakeets across Mexico. Further monitoring of introduced Monk Parakeet populations in Mexico is needed to understand the establishment, growth and spread of introduced populations.

AB  - In November 2010, a large sinkhole opened up in the urban area of Schmalkalden, Germany. To determine the key factors which benefited the development of this collapse structure and therefore the dissolution, we carried out several shear-wave reflection-seismic profiles around the sinkhole. In the seismic sections we see evidence of the Mesozoic tectonic movement in the form of a NW-SE striking, dextral strike-slip fault, known as the Hessleser Fault, which faulted and fractured the subsurface below the town. The strike-slip faulting created a zone of small blocks ( <100m in size), around which steep-dipping normal faults, reverse faults and a dense fracture network serve as fluid pathways for the artesian-confined groundwater. The faults also acted as barriers for horizontal groundwater flow perpendicular to the fault planes. Instead groundwater flows along the faults which serve as conduits and forms cavities in the Permian deposits below ca. 60m depth. Mass movements and the resulting cavities lead to the formation of sinkholes and dissolution-induced depressions. Since the processes are still ongoing, the occurrence of a new sinkhole cannot be ruled out. This case study demonstrates how S-wave seismics can characterize a sinkhole and, together with geological information, can be used to study the processes that result in sinkhole formation, such as a near-surface fault zone located in soluble rocks. The more complex the fault geometry and interaction between faults, the more prone an area is to sinkhole occurrence.

AB  - Urbanisation is one of the major drivers of ecosystem change and includes increased temperatures in cities leading to an urban heat island (UHI). This study quantified the phenological response of odonates across London, UK, from 1990 to 2012, using a database of 1,031,277 historical sightings. The ordinal flight dates of each species were used to calculate the leading edge, middle and trailing edge of the flight period (P5, P50 and P95, respectively). The results suggest that the phenology of odonates is affected by the UHI only at a community level: no significant changes in the P5 or P50 of the flight period were found, although the P95 shows a mean advance of 4.13 days compared to rural areas, thus suggesting a contraction of the flight period in urban areas. However, only one individual species (Sympetrum striolatum) exhibited an advance in the P95 of the flight period in urban areas compared to rural areas. On the other hand, climate change (minimum temperature) had a much stronger impact on the phenology of odonates at the community level with a significant advance of 6.9 days A degrees C-1 in the P5 of the flight period, 3.1 days A degrees C-1 in the P50 and 3.3 days A degrees C-1 in the P95 flight date. Similarly, a significant advance in P5 was found in 7 of the 15 species tested in response to minimum temperature, and 2 species showed a significant advance in P50 in response to minimum temperature, but no species showed a shift in the P95 flight date due to minimum temperature. As shown in previous studies, life history influences the phenological response of odonates, with spring species and those species lacking an egg diapause being the most responsive to increased temperatures, although summer species and species with obligate egg diapause also respond to the UHI by advancing the P95 by 3.8 and 4.5 days, respectively, compared to rural areas, thus contracting the flight period. The present study shows that the UHI has negligible impacts on emergence patterns of odonates compared to climate change, which may result from the capacity of aquatic habitats to buffer the microclimatic conditions of the surrounding terrestrial habitats. We conclude by highlighting the importance of climate change on freshwater habitats over the impacts of the UHI.

AB  - The population genetic structure of Oligoryzomys longicaudatus colilargo was examined at two geographical scales: (a) regional, including five populations of the Argentinean Patagonia separated by 60-315km and (b) landscape scale, using five populations from different valleys of the locality of Cholila in the subantarctic forest separated by 6-27km, and a nearby locality of the Patagonian steppe, with an average distance from Cholila of 33km. Eight microsatellite loci specific for O.longicaudatus were used as genetic markers. At the regional scale, four genetic clusters were detected by the Geneland software. The genetic structure was found to follow a latitudinal pattern. This result was supported by the F-ST statistic, indicating low levels of current gene flow within the region. At the landscape level, genetic differentiation among the five populations was also found. Estimated migration rates were, in general, low and asymmetrical between nearby populations. Using a causal modeling approach, we detected that the combination of landscape features such as lakes, rivers, urban settlements and roads appear to constrain the dispersal of O.longicaudatus at this scale. This result would explain why nearby populations were so different in their genetic composition. The information about geographic features limiting rodent dispersal provided here could help to design more accurate prevention measures against the expansion of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

AB  - Social information, acquired through the observation of others, has been documented in a variety of adaptive contexts. The transmission of social information relies on social connections and therefore it is important to consider that individuals may vary in their access to, and use of, such information. Social network analysis allows for the consideration of individual variation in social connections, which until recently has been ignored in the study of social processes. Furthermore, few previous studies of social information use have considered the potential effects of traits such as dominance and personality, which have been found to influence group social structure. We used network-based diffusion analysis, which incorporates information on individual social associations, to examine whether wild flocks of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, utilize social information when locating novel foraging patches. Additionally, we incorporated individual traits (age, sex, dominance and exploratory personality) while examining flocks from rural and urban environments, to assess the influence of individual and habitat level characteristics on the rate of information transmission. Social information transmission was found to occur in all flocks, as individual time of discovery of the novel foraging patches was explained by network connections as predicted. However, the only individual level variable found to influence social transmission was dominance rank: dominant individuals had higher rates of information transmission than subordinates. We also found that the rate of social information transmission was higher in rural than urban environments. Our results highlight the importance of considering social associations when examining social information use. Additionally, our results suggest that dominant individuals have greater access to social information than more subordinate individuals, which may demonstrate a previously undocumented additional benefit provided by social dominance.

AB  - Species interactions can determine range limits, and parasitism is the most intimate of such interactions. Intriguingly, the very conditions on range edges likely change host-parasite dynamics in nontrivial ways. Range edges are often associated with clines in host density and with environmental transitions, both of which may affect parasite transmission. On advancing range edges, founder events and fitness/dispersal costs of parasitism may also cause parasites to be lost on range edges. Here we examine the prevalence of three species of parasite across the range edge of an invasive gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus, in northeastern Australia. The gecko's range edge spans the urban-woodland interface at the edge of urban areas. Across this edge, gecko abundance shows a steep decline, being lower in the woodland. Two parasite species (a mite and a pentastome) are coevolved with H. frenatus, and these species become less prevalent as the geckos become less abundant. A third species of parasite (another pentastome) is native to Australia and has no coevolutionary history with H. frenatus. This species became more prevalent as the geckos become less abundant. These dramatic shifts in parasitism(occurring over 3.5 km) confirm that host-parasite dynamics can vary substantially across the range edge of this gecko host.

AB  - The development of infrastructure in an urban city, such as road widening and building work, will inevitably result in the removal of trees. Therefore, innovative solutions such as containerised tree in the manner of increasing the portability of trees would be necessary to facilitate efficient transplanting in order to maintain a sustainable green urban environment. Differences in soil hydraulic properties between soil mixture and in situ soil naturally occur in tree planting, but this difference becomes more important in the use of container due to the limited tree root movement. The objective of this research was to examine the effects of soil hydraulic properties between the soils inside and outside of the container with focus being placed on moisture infiltration both in and out of the container. Field instrumentation and laboratory tests were carried out together with parametric study using numerical model. The results suggested that the higher the ratio between the saturated permeability of the soils inside and outside the container, the lower was the ability of water to flow in and out of the container.

AB  - Traffic signals play a significant role in the urban transportation system. They control the movement of traffic on urban streets by determining the appropriate signal timing settings. Due to the stochastic nature of the traffic flow, deciding on the best signal timing settings is a computationally complex problem, with the result that traditional analytical methods have been found to be inadequate in dealing with real world scenarios. This issue has already been tackled using computational intelligence algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA). However, despite good results, GA may experience slow convergence, especially when dealing with constrained optimisation problems. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive memetic algorithm (MA) for optimising signal timings in real world urban road networks using traffic volumes derived from induction loop detectors. The proposed MA combines the strengths of GA with the exploitation power of a local search algorithm, in an adaptive manner, so as to accelerate the search process and generate high quality solutions. In this work, we propose two important techniques for improving the performance of a traditional MA. First, we use a systematic neighbourhood based simple descent algorithm as a local search to effectively exploit the search space around GA solutions. Second, to achieve a proper balance between the exploration of GA and the local search algorithm, we propose an indicator scheme to control the local search application based on the diversity and the quality of the search process. The proposed MA was tested in two different case studies for the cities of Brisbane, Australia, and Plock, Poland, using the well-known microscopic traffic simulator, AIMSUN. Results demonstrate that our MA is better than GA and traditional fixed-time traffic signal settings. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Squatters and migrants use the city space in a peculiar and anomalous manner. Their contributions to the social and political production of urban space are not usually considered crucial. Furthermore, their mutual relationship is under-researched. In this paper I investigate the participation of migrants in the squatting of abandoned buildings. This may entail autonomous forms of occupation but also various kinds of interactions with native squatters. By looking historically at the city of Madrid I distinguish four major forms of interactions. I collect evidence in order to show that deprivation-based squatting is not necessarily the prevailing type. The forms of empowerment' and engagement' were increasingly developed while autonomy' and solidarity' were continuously present. These variations occurred because of specific drivers within the cycles of movements' protests and other social and political contexts which facilitated the cooperation between squatters and migrants, although language barriers, discrimination in the housing market and police harassment constrained them too. Therefore, I argue first that two key social organisations triggered the interactions in different protest cycles. Second, I show how, in spite of the over-representation of Latin American migrants, the political squatting movement in Madrid has consistently incorporated groups of migrants and their struggles in accordance with anti-fascist, anti-racist and anti-xenophobic claims and practices. The analysis also provides a nuanced understanding about the political' implications of squatting when migrants are involved.

AB  - The article analyzes the process of institutional development of Drohobych ' banking establishments in the period after the end of the Polish-Ukrainian war, until the start of the stormy events of September 1939. It is established that in Drohobych, during this short period of time, the Polish authorities organized an efficient system of private and state banks that concentrated the capital mainly of Polish and Jewish bankers, whereas the Ukrainian capital had a sporadic balance in that system and, though partialy, even some restrictions. On the other hand, of many provincial cities of Galicia Drohobych occupied the second place after Lviv due to the movement of funds and diversity of banking institutions. Thus, a brief history of the development of the banks of "Galician California's capital" has been reconstructed in the article.

AB  - Tetraponera rufonigra, commonly known as the arboreal bicolored ant has gained its notoriety as one of the medically-important pest insects in Malaysia. T. rufonigra is recognizable by its excruciating sting, causing a severe anaphylaxis especially to those with the history of allergy. In this study, genetic diversity and population structure of T. rufonigra populations were examined based on a 503 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) gene. Specimens were collected from six different localities in urban areas in the eastern part of Penang Island. The six populations exhibited high pairwise genetic differentiation (F-ST), ranging from 0.42 to 1.00 and low gene flow (Nm), ranging from 0.00 to 0.69, except for populations of CSA and CH (F-ST = 0.0, N-m = 1813.68). From AMOVA analysis, a high genetic variation was observed among populations i.e. 99.58% (FsT = 0.996 p = 0.000 +/- 0.000). These results provided the bake information for entomologists to better understand the difference of genetic structure of T. rufonigra at a population level and can be further utilized to estimate the contributing factors in the genetic differentiation of this species in urban areas. Our results suggested that the population structure and the gene flow of T. rufonigra in some studied areas might have been affected by the dispersal ability of the insect, environmental conditions, and/or human-mediated dispersal, while, populations of other areas retained their gene flow. These findings might provide useful baseline information for the implementation of area-wide pest management as well as for further characterization of genetic variation and population structure of this medically-important pest.

AB  - The recent decades have witnessed a shift from the traditional top-down model of service delivery led by the state to the provision and delivery of services by community organisations. This article explores the extent to which community initiatives in Jane-Finch, a highly diverse, lower income, inner-suburban neighborhoods of Toronto, were successful in achieving their goals, and the relevance of the experience for current neighbourhood initiatives targeting diversity. It discusses the factors which contributed to the effectiveness of 10 analysed initiatives in terms of reaching their primary objectives. The analysis shows that despite the efforts within community initiatives to improve conditions for inhabitants, their impacts remain limited due to underlying structural challenges such as poverty and institutionalised racism, increasing fragmentation within the over-all network of initiatives and precarious funding, which pit programs against one another and hamper effective collaboration and solidarity needed in order to achieve transformative change.

AB  - The coastal seagrass meadows in the Townsville region of the Great Barrier Reef are crucial seagrass foraging habitat for endangered dugong populations. Deteriorating coastal water quality and in situ light levels reduce the extent of these meadows, particularly in years with significant terrestrial runoff from the nearby Burdekin River catchment. However, uncertainty surrounds the impact of variable seagrass abundance on dugong carrying capacity. Here, I demonstrate that a power-law relationship with exponent value of -1 (R-2 similar to 0.87) links mortality data with predicted changes in annual above ground seagrass biomass. This relationship indicates that the dugong carrying capacity of the region is tightly coupled to the biomass of seagrass available for metabolism. Thus, mortality rates increase precipitously following large flood events with a response lag of <12-months. The management implications of this result are discussed in terms of climate scenarios that indicate an increased future likelihood of extreme flood events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rapids, falls, and cascades might act as barriers for freshwater species, determining the species community up- and downstream of barriers. However, they affect community composition not only by acting as barriers but also by their influence on environmental gradients. Moreover, the directional dispersal of species along the watercourse might determine community composition. A suitable system to study these differential effects is the Congo River, the world's second largest river by discharge. The small 'Upper Congo Rapids' ecoregion features several rapids known as barrier for fish. The Wagenia Cataract at the town of Kisangani constitutes the strongest drop of the Congo River and several studies have emphasized its role as barrier for fish distribution. Alternative explanations for this pattern, however, are rarely evaluated. Though mollusks represent a vital component of the macrozoobenthos, with distribution patterns and underlying drivers often distinct from that of fishes, virtually no field surveys of the Congo River have been reported for decades. We collected and determined mollusks of 51 stations, recorded environmental conditions, and generated proxies for directional species dispersal and an indirect barrier effect. Those variables were subjected to distance-based redundancy analyses and variation partitioning in order to test whether the mollusk community compositions are better explained by an individual or combined influence of the direct and indirect effect of the cataract barrier, environmental conditions, and downstream-directed dispersal. Our survey showed an exclusive upstream/downstream distribution for just four out of the 19 species, suggesting a limited barrier effect. We revealed no direct influence of the barrier itself on community composition but of substrate type. However, we found an indirect effect of the barrier through replacing spatially structured communities upstream of the cataract with more uniform ones downstream. Downstream-directed dispersal explained the highest fraction of variation in mollusk communities. Thus, environmental factors, the indirect cataract effect, and downstream-directed spatial proxies model mollusk community composition in concert. These results support previous studies showing a multi-factorial imprint on communities. However, a large fraction of variation community composition remained unexplained, potentially due to flood plain dynamics that (re-) shape mollusk communities constantly and a high temporal turnover, evidenced by the comparison with historical surveys. This is likely caused by the growth of Kisangani and resulting human activities. A monitoring system could allow better assessments of these impacts on communities and the conservation status of endemic species in the Wagenia Cataract.

AB  - Geographers studying protest movements have brought attention to the social and spatial contexts in which political action is constituted. As the legal right to protest has become more and more restricted in many Western, activists have had to seek new times and spaces for protest, with protest camps having risen alongside the anti-austerity movement since 2011. The ongoing Nuit Debout protests in Paris have turned explicitly to night, drawing on experience of previous protests to colonise this timespace on a recurring basis, laying to claim to the night as a moment for protest. This paper therefore uses the case of Nuit Debout to consider more widely how night shapes (urban) protest movements. I argue that the move to the night might be seen as an attempt to find a timespace in which a more open and creative politics is possible, strategically responding to the reduction in the freedom to protest in the more heavily surveyed day. I explore how the specific characteristics of night have both facilitated innovation at Nuit Debout and other sites, but also the restrictions that night has brought. More broadly, this helps us understand the changing dynamics of urban spaces and rhythms as night-time activity intensifies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data for biophysically modeled and Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS)-derived cultural ecosystem services have potential to identify natural resource management synergies and conflicts, but have rarely been combined. Ecosystem service hot/coldspots generated using different methods vary in their spatial extent and connectivity, with important implications.
   We map biophysically modeled and PPGIS-derived cultural services for six U.S. national forests using six hot/coldspot delineation methods. We evaluate the implications of hotspot methods for management within and outside of designated wilderness areas.
   We used the ARIES and SolVES modeling tools to quantify four biophysically modeled and 11 largely cultural ecosystem services for six national forests in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. We mapped hot/coldspots using two quantile methods (top and bottom 10 and 33 % of values), two area-based methods (top and bottom 10 and 33 % of area), and two statistical methods (Getis-Ord Gi* at alpha = 0.05 and 0.10 significance level) and compare results within and outside wilderness areas.
   Delineation methods vary in their degree of conservatism for hot/coldspot extents and spatial clustering. Hotspots were more common in wilderness areas in national forests near the more densely populated Colorado Front Range, while coldspots were more common in wilderness areas in more urban-distant forests in northwest Wyoming.
   Statistical hotspot methods of intermediate conservatism (i.e., Getis-Ord Gi*, alpha = 0.10 significance) may be most useful for ecosystem service hot/coldspot mapping to inform landscape scale planning. We also found spatially explicit evidence in support of past findings about public attitudes toward wilderness areas.

AB  - An incident involving a radiation dispersal device (RDD) would most likely occur in an urban or metropolitan area. However, the majority of radiochemical separation schemes available have been developed for environmental samples that are not necessarily representative of those found in an urban environment. Sr-90 is one of the possible radioisotopes that could be used in an RDD. It is therefore important to find efficient and accurate ways to separate it from debris in the area of deployment. This research demonstrates that the presence of steel in dissolved samples shows no appreciable interference with extraction chromatographic separations. Instead, it indicates that the separation could actually be improved by the presence of the steel constituents.

AB  - Driven by shared concerns about climate change, social justice and health and wellbeing, Urban Agriculture (UA) is an emergent global movement. In this paper, we present an exploratory case study of UA practice on the Southside of Glasgow, UK that traced the emergence and development of four UA projects. Data from the four projects revealed a diversity of practices, including temporary gardening projects organised by local volunteers, a community and market garden operated by a charity, a food shop and vegetable distribution service run by a social enterprise, and a permanent growing space for charities and schools provided by local government. UA practitioners in Glasgow have sought to re-purpose vacant and derelict land, build social cohesion, contribute to environmental and food sustainability and provide participation space for marginalised groups. Reflecting on future avenues for research on UA in Glasgow, we have identified two broad policy pathways that are emerging both at the local level and through national legislation in Scotland to harness local urban food growing and support UA. We conclude by pointing to a need to preserve the self-organising spirit of UA in Scotland as new legislation comes into force.

AB  - Urbanization often has negative impacts on wildlife, nevertheless many species can persist in heavily modified habitats. Understanding factors that promote species persistence in urbanizing landscapes is therefore important for maintaining biodiversity in changing landscapes and may inform more biodiversity-friendly development. We investigated effects of landscape-scale variables on habitat occupancy of Smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) in the Inner Gulf of Thailand. In this internationally important wetland complex, 86% of natural habitats have been altered and are now highly urbanized. We conducted track and sign surveys in 60, 25 km(2) grid cells encompassing 1,474 km(2). Within each cell, we quantified the landscape cover types including urban areas, natural habitat (predominately thin ribbons of mangrove along waterways), agriculture, aquaculture, and potential prey availability using a GIS and field surveys. We used occupancy models to identify habitat variables that affected probability of detection and occupancy. Estimated otter occupancy, based on the top model, was 0.33 +/- 0.07 (95% CI 0.18-0.48) and detection probability was 0.50 +/- 0.05 (95% CI 0.41-0.60). Otter occupancy was positively associated with the proportion of natural habitat and the cover of traditional aquaculture ponds, but negatively associated with agriculture and urban cover. The remaining natural patches appear to act as critical refuges for otter, allowing them to persist in an otherwise heavily transformed landscape. Because aquaculture ponds are likely important prey sources for otters, it may lead to conflict with aquaculture farmers. Further studies of feeding and movement patterns in cooperation with aquaculture farmers would be beneficial for developing detailed management plans for the species in this human dominated landscape.

AB  - Ningbo City in Zhejiang Province is one of the largest port cities in China and has achieved high economic development during the past decades. The port construction, land reclamation, urban development and silt deposition in the Ningbo coastal zone have resulted in extensive coastline change. In this study, the spatio-temporal change of the Ningbo coastlines during 1976-2015 was detected and analysed using Landsat time-series images from different sensors, including Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Fourteen individual scenes (covering seven phases) of cloud-free Landsat images within the required tidal range of +/- 63 cm were collected. The ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) image of 2015 was used to extract the reference coastline for the accuracy assessment. The normalised difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were applied to discriminate surface water and land features, respectively. The on-screen digitising approach was then used to further refine the extracted time-series coastlines in the period from 1976 to 2015. Six relevant indices, length, length change, annual length change, fractal dimension (FD), average net shoreline movement (NSM) and average annual NSM, were calculated to analyse and explore the spatio-temporal change features of Ningbo coastlines. Results show that the length of the Ningbo coastlines increased from 910 km to 986 km, and the value of FD increased from 1.09 to 1.12, and the coastline morphology changed from sinuous to straight. The average NSM increased from 187 m to 298 m and the average annual NSM reached 85 m/year, indicating the advance of coastlines towards the sea at a high level. The spatio-temporal change patterns also varied in different areas. In Hangzhou Bay, significant advancement along the coastlines was experienced since 2001 mainly because of urban construction and land reclamation. In Xiangshan Bay, the forces of nature played a major role in coastline dynamics before 2008, whilst port construction, urban construction and island link projections moved the coastlines towards the sea. The coastline changes of Sanmen Bay were affected by the interaction of nature and human activities. All these observations indicate that forces of nature and human activities were the two important influential factors for the observed coastline change. In this case, the coastline complexity variation was considered responsible for various coastline patterns change of the Ningbo coast. In addition, erosion and accretion occurred in turn because of forces of nature and human activities, such as urban development and agricultural exploitation.

AB  - Free-roaming cat populations are increasing in urban areas around the world. Management strategies remain controversial, as attempts to rapidly minimize the impact of cats may conflict with finding an ethical means of population reduction in this domesticated species. Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is a non-lethal strategy which can theoretically lead to population decline with an ethical approach. The present study aimed to estimate free-roaming cat populations and also to measure the efficacy of a one-year TNR campaign in a highly urban area. Using a sight/resight methodology, we examined free-roaming cat populations in four sites across two neighbourhoods (Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant) in New York City. Sampling was repeated after 1 year, during which an intensive TNR effort occurred in each of those areas. Results from this study found population estimates range from 2.6-4.1 cats/km. Additionally, we found between 78-98% turnover in each study area. After one year of TNR, the proportion of sterilised individuals in our treatment sites increased to 50%. Model results suggest there is no evidence that sterilised individuals are more likely to be encountered, indicating that sterilisation may not affect movement patterns of cats. Free-roaming cats occur at high densities at all study sites, though populations varied, even within the same neighbourhood. We found evidence of considerable migration within study sites, which further complicates the application of a sterilisation management strategy. Management strategies directed toward free-roaming cats, such as TNR, may require a broad-scale approach, involving different facets of the community and should occur over multiple years.

AB  - Natural disasters that frequently occur, such as typhoons and earthquakes, heavily affect human activities in urban areas by causing severe congestion and economic loss. Predicting the delay in usual commuting activities of individuals following such disasters is crucial for managing urban systems. We propose a novel method that predicts such delay of individuals' movements in several frequently occurring disasters using various types of features including the commuters' usual movement patterns, disaster information, and geospatial information of commuters' locations. Our method predicts the irregularity of commuting activities in metropolitan Tokyo during several typhoons, and earthquakes, using Yahoo Japan's GPS dataset of 1 million users. The results show that the irregularity of individuals' movements are significantly more predictable than with previous models. Also, we are able to understand that commuters' usual movement patterns, disaster intensity, and geospatial features including road density and population density are main factors that cause commuting delay following disasters.

AB  - Tetragonisca angustula is one of the most widespread stingless bees in the Neotropics. This species swarms frequently and is extremely successful in urban environments. In addition, it is one of the most popular stingless bee species for beekeeping in Latin America, so nest transportation and trading is common. Nest transportation can change the genetic structure of the host population, reducing inbreeding and increasing homogenization. Here, we evaluate the genetic structure of 17 geographic populations of T. angustula in southern Brazil to quantify the level of genetic differentiation between populations. Analyses were conducted on partially sequenced mitochondrial genes and 11 microsatellite loci of 1002 workers from 457 sites distributed on the mainland and on 3 islands. Our results show that T. angustula populations are highly differentiated as demonstrated by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite markers. Of 73 haplotypes, 67 were population-specific. MtDNA diversity was low in 9 populations but microsatellite diversity was moderate to high in all populations. Microsatellite data suggest 10 genetic clusters and low level of gene flow throughout the studied area. However, physical barriers, such as rivers and mountain ranges, or the presence or absence of forest appear to be unrelated to population clusters. Factors such as low dispersal, different ecological conditions, and isolation by distance are most likely shaping the population structure of this species. Thus far, nest transportation has not influenced the general population structure in the studied area. However, due to the genetic structure we found, we recommend that nest transportation should only occur within and between populations that are genetically similar.

AB  - The majority of radiochemical separation schemes available have been developed for environmental samples that are not necessarily representative of those found in an urban environment. However, it is much more likely that an incident involving a radiation dispersal device (RDD) would occur in an urban or metropolitan area. It is unclear if the currently available separation schemes would be effective in such an event. It is therefore important to determine if the current schemes would be adequate, or to find efficient and accurate ways to separate radiological material from urban debris. One important radiological material that could be used in an RDD is Sr-90. Part I of this work investigated the effects steel had on strontium separations, while this work investigates cement and concrete. This research demonstrates that the individual elements present in a cement and concrete sample matrix can give rise to significant interferences with extraction chromatographic separations. Solutions of the constituents mixed in representative ratios; however, show fewer problems.

AB  - Introduction: The present research joins within the framework of a program developed by the REMIGRAF (Network of studies of the African migrations) on the Specificity of the Senegalese migratory models with a focus on breaks and continuities observed in their modes of management. Theses developed below are the product of observations led in the villages around Niakhar, at the heart of Sine or country of Serer group, which is known as an important region of exodus.
   Method: To reach the fixed goals, field inquiries were led in May and June, 2014 to measure the importance of the migratory fact and its impact on the space. Forty-eight households were questioned about their conditions of existence in rural areas and the strategies deployed to overcome the difficulties of the everyday life the exodus towards the Senegalese urban areas. These inquiries were completed by conversations deepened with bridgeheads of the migratory networks which live in Dakar, main destination of the studied populations.
   Results: Inquiries led on both hillsides of the Serer migration that are Dakar and villages around Niakhar indicate that today more yesterday, the exodus towards the Senegalese urban areas remains a distinctive character of the hinterland of Fatick. Because of the social control exercised by the social group, leave in town do not means breaking with the country of origin. The circular migration which characterizes from now the local practices since the opening of the road Fatick-Bambey has a positive impact on the transformation of villages and at the same time in the progressive modernization of the housing environment and the equipment of villages in community infrastructures by the local associations.
   Discussion: The new configuration of the exodus serer is translated by a big diversity of movements which correspond to a will to maintain the links with the countries of origin while continuing to take advantage of rare opportunities which still offers the city. Such a dynamic does not certainly augur of the end of the exodus but it indicates an awareness of the more and more obvious difficulty benefiting from the migratory movement because of the depth of the crisis and/or the poverty which affects the Senegalese urban world.

AB  - Between September and November 2011, the Occupy Wall Street protest encampment in New York captured the public imagination worldwide and generated similar events in hundreds of urban spaces. Even after riot police evicted the occupations, the Occupy social movement continued to confront political authority over questions of inequality, and it remains active both online and at diverse protest events. However, beyond the social movement there has been a growth of related anti-capitalist politics. The Occusphere is constituted by the totality of Occupyinspired activity on the internet and in social networks, and in the larger area of political ideas. This study explores the Occusphere as an expanding zone of densely interlinked anti-capitalist politics with three modes of existence - urban spaces, virtual electronic spaces, and intellectual spaces.

AB  - Diversification in shopping, a long-pursued subject in consumer behavior analysis, is approached from a broad perspective of the diversity in daily travel patterns, which may or may not involve shopping trips, as well as the diversity in shopping locations and frequency. The focus of this analysis is on the heterogeneity across individuals in the ways in which they each diversify their respective shopping behavior. This study explores differences across individuals in the variations of their shopping travel patterns across days. Treating the day-of-the-week evolution of shopping travel patterns as a stochastic process, characteristics of diversification are quantified for respective individuals. Finally, heterogeneity across individuals is identified using an array of statistical methods. The analysis, based on results of a six-week travel diary survey in Germany with geo-coded activity locations, reveals the effects of individual, household, and urban attributes on diversification in shopping behavior, including that full-time workers with medium incomes (4000-4999 Deutsche Mark per month) tend to have more variations in their shopping engagement.

AB  - Haze occurs frequently in many cities, and becomes the authors' great common concern. A distributed real-time monitoring system for atmospheric particles has been designed, implemented and tested. The proposed system consists of a front-end data wireless acquisition network, an embedded web server system, a central server and remote monitoring terminals. The front-end data-acquisition network is made up of mobile data-acquisition nodes distributed in atmospheric particle monitoring areas which collect atmospheric particle data periodically. The data is transmitted by Jennet wireless network and sent to the Internet through the embedded web servers attached to the coordinator nodes via the serial ports. Only a common Internet browser is required for a remote user to check the atmospheric particle data. The central server is responsible for storing the pollution data for further usage of pollution analysis, evaluation and early warning. In this study, the PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10 particle data were successfully collected, transmitted and checked by the monitoring system in Lanzhou, China. The results show that the designed system can meet the needs of functional requirements of atmospheric particle monitoring.

AB  - Costa Rica established the National Biological Corridor Program in 2006. Under the National Biological Corridor Program, the long-running Payment for Environmental Services Program was newly prioritized into biological corridors throughout the country. The National Biological Corridor Program caused a nationwide spatial shift in placement of payments for environmental services throughout Costa Rica. We classified ASTER 15-m resolution imagery in a central Costa Rica corridor connecting the eastern and western protected areas networks to analyze the change in forests during the National Biological Corridor Program with its targeted payments for environmental services effort. We used object-based classification methods, and compared land cover changes over an initial four-year period of corridor policy enactment. We calculated the changes within PES properties and outside of PES regions, and we also calculated forest patch metrics during the same time period. Results indicate a decline in forest cover over the study period, along with an increase in urban and pasture land. covers, with higher change and loss of forest centered inside of the biological corridor, near the construction area for the new San Carlos highway, and within eastern pasture areas. We also saw a higher percentage of forest loss inside of the biological corridor area as compared to areas outside of the biological corridor. Forest loss was drastically less within current and historic PES properties, as compared to the overall study region. Across the entire study region, patch metrics show a decrease in the number of patches and a slight decrease in average patch size. These results suggest that current and past designation of PES prevents forest loss within PES properties while the current designation of priority conservation status via the National Biological Corridor Program is not increasing connectivity and forest conservation. This is shown by increased land use change and a decrease in forest associated with biological corridor designation. These results are antithetical to the goals of the National Biological Corridor Program. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wastewater transport along sewers favors the colonization of inner pipe surfaces by wastewater-derived microorganisms that grow forming biofilms. These biofilms are composed of rich and diverse microbial communities that are continuously exposed to antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) from urban wastewater. Sewer biofilms thus appear as an optimal habitat for the dispersal and accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, the concentration of antibiotics, integron (intI1) and antibiotic resistance genes (qnrS, sul1, sul2, bla(TEM), bla(KPC), ermB, tetM and tetW), and potential bacterial pathogens were analyzed in wastewater and biofilm samples collected at the inlet and outlet sections of a pressurized sewer pipe. The most abundant ARGs detected in both wastewater and biofilm samples were sul1 and sul2 with roughly 1 resistance gene for each 10 copies of 16s RNA gene. Significant differences in the relative abundance of gene intI1 and genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones (qnrS), sulfonamides (sul1 and sul2) and betalactams (bla(TEM)) were only measured between inlet and outlet biofilm samples. Composition of bacterial communities also showed spatial differences in biofilms and a higher prevalence of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with high sequence identity (>98%) to well-known human pathogens was observed in biofilms collected at the inlet pipe section. Our study highlights the role of sewer biofilms as source and sink of ARB and ARGs and supports the idea that community composition rather than antibiotic concentration is the main factor driving the diversity of the sewage resistome.

AB  - Our study object is the discourse about violence in teachers' strike movement, occurred in 2015. We aim to show how meanings related to the 2015 strike slid and produced effects of meanings related to violence, the choice between being on the side of education or violence and abuse of power by the state government. Analysis corpus is consisted of two materialities, a billboard jagged from urban space of the city of Guarapuava, broadcast by APP-Union and a text-image that circulated on social networks and has at its center the statement-image in which the state governor, Beto Richa is represented as Adolf Hitler. The analysis has as theoretical support the French Discourse Analysis. We conclude that the discourse of violence and abuse of power is sustained from the speech (recall) that establishes effects of meanings that support a speech about (celebration) that updates meanings. Memory networks are established around events and figures that belong to history and mean as historicity.

AB  - To contribute to the prevention of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, a process of scaling up an innovative intervention to reduce Aedes aegypti habitats, was carried out in the city of Salto (Uruguay) based on a transdisciplinary analysis of the eco-bio-social determinants. The intervention in one-third of the city included the distributions of plastic bags for all households to collect all discarded water containers that were recollected by the Ministry of Health and the Municipality vector control services. The results were evaluated in 20 randomly assigned clusters of 100 households each, in the intervention and control arm. The intervention resulted in a significantly larger decrease in the number of pupae per person index (as a proxy for adult vector abundance) than the corresponding decrease in the control areas (both areas decreased by winter effects). The reduction of intervention costs ("incremental costs") in relation to routine vector control activities was 46%. Community participation increased the collaboration with the intervention program considerably (from 48% of bags handed back out of the total of bags delivered to 59% of bags handed back). Although the costs increased by 26% compared with intervention without community participation, the acceptability of actions by residents increased from 66% to 78%.

AB  - Patterns of mosquito spatial persistence and temporal presence, as well as synchrony, i.e., the degree of concerted fluctuations in abundance, have been scarcely studied at finely grained spatial scales and over altitudinal gradients. Here, we present a spatial persistence, temporal presence, and synchrony analysis of four common mosquito species across the altitudinal gradient of Mt. Konpira in Nagasaki, Japan. We found that Aedes albopictus (Skuse) was more frequently found at the mountain base. In contrast, Aedes japonicus (Theobald) and Aedes flavopictus Yamada were common higher in the mountain, while Armigeres subalbatus (Coquillet) was uniformly present across the mountain, yet less frequently than the other species during the studied period. Our analysis showed that these spatial heterogeneities were associated with differences in landscape and microclimatic elements of Mt. Konpira. Temporally we found that presence across sampling locations was mainly synchronous across the four species and positively associated with rainfall and temperature. With the exception of Ae albopictus, where no significant synchrony was observed, mosquito species mainly showed flat synchrony profiles in Mt. Konpira when looking at the geographic (2-D) distance between their sampling locations. By contrast, when synchrony was studied across altitude, it was observed that Ae. flavopictus tracked the temperature synchrony pattern, decreasing its synchrony with the separation in altitude between sampling locations. Finally, our results suggest that differences in mosquito species persistence, temporal presence, and synchrony might be useful to understand the entomological risk of vector-borne disease transmission in urban landscapes.

AB  - If there is a resistant idea in the Brazilian social thought, although it has already been deconstructed several times, it is the idea that identifies popular culture - in the sense of tradition or folklore - with the essence of nationality. However, what is considered "popular culture" can change according to the conceptions of the social agents constantly reinterpret it. This paper aims to discuss the evidences collected in a field research, carried out in Sao Paulo city, between 2003 and 2013, on the mediators of "popular culture". This research revealed the nowadays-called Afro-descendants cultural practices have acquired great relevance in the field. Starting from the hypothesis that such relevance is related to the struggles for recognition undertaken by the black movement, especially in its cultural and artistic aspects, the text concludes the African matrix, formerly dissolved with the social-political construction of the national identity, it is now a strong appeal for the constitution of a Brazilian identity/brand in the context where cultural diversity becomes imperative.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, has traditionally been considered an important water and foodborne protozoonosis with important public health considerations. Although felids play a well-established role as definitive hosts, canine epidemiological involvement in the parasite's life cycle remains questionable and controversial. The increasing closeness of the human-dog bond, particularly seen in urban settings, has been recognized as a historically unprecedented worldwide movement. Sharing daily lives in the same households, dogs may be exposed to similar associated risks of T. gondii infection as their owners. Thus, epidemiological assessment of the intra-domiciled environment, especially among socio-economically different human populations, may provide novel information regarding the actual role of dogs in animal and human toxoplasmosis. Despite spatial approaches being recently used for other water and foodborne diseases, no study has been conducted on the simultaneous spatial seroprevalence of both human and animal IgG antiT. gondii antibodies in urban areas of major cities. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to assess the seroprevalence and associated variables of Toxoplasma infection in owners and their domiciled dogs in Londrina, southern Brazil. Human and canine seroprevalence rates and variables associated with seroprevalence were investigated through representative random sampling among 564 households, which included 597 owners and 729 dogs. Overall, statistically significant differences between the seroprevalence of human and dog anti-T. gondii antibodies were found by Immunofluorescence Antibody Testing in 248/597 (41.54%) owners and 119/729 (16.32%) dogs. Through multiple analysis, significant concomitant variables for seropositivity of household individuals (people and dogs) were determined, including public sewer service, yard cleaning frequency, and having a dirty yard. Although no statistically significant multiple logistic model was observed among owners, univariate analysis detected associations with monthly income, soil contact, and occupation. Among dogs, the absence of other dogs and the absence of a dirty yard were concomitant significantly protective associated factors. Age differences between seropositive and seronegative individuals was significant only for human beings, with the median age of negative individuals significantly higher than positive individuals. Although no spatial clusters were identified for humans or residences, a significant cluster was identified for dogs. In conclusion, characteristics of urban toxoplasmosis may include significantly higher owner seroprevalence than their owned dogs, with canine seroprevalence directly associated with having more dogs and a dirty backyard, and spatial differences in both human and dog exposures. Although not a good indicator for human foodborne diseases, dogs may be a reliable sentinel for environmental infection. Moreover, such a holistic approach may provide crucial information for more focused prevention and monitoring programs, particularly in households with multiple pets and trash-filled backyards.

AB  - The existing resettlement infrastructure for informal settlements in Manila, Philippines provide an opportunity to facilitate future climate change adaptation in the city. This research assesses the feasibility of using resettlement as climate change adaptation (CCA) in Manila using the 5 Principles for climate-related resettlement developed by Tadgell, Doberstein and Mortsch (2017 forthcoming). Data from key informant interviews (n=27) with resettlement, CCA, and DRR professionals, addresses the topic in three phases. First, it investigates the role of resettlement in existing CCA and DRR projects to understand if movement from environmental hazards is already occurring. Next, the research gathers interviewee perspectives on the applicability of the 5 Principles in relation to Manila's existing resettlement landscape, and identifies any amendments or foreseen challenges to them. Finally, it explores the perceptions of resettlement, DRR, and CCA actors on the feasibility of employing resettlement as CCA in Manila, including any challenges that may impede the strategy. The findings suggest that existing resettlement infrastructure could be enhanced to provide effective CCA as identified by the 5 Principles, such as initiatives with in-city relocation sites and vertical housing. Poverty is the greatest challenge to implementing any successful adaptation strategy, including resettlement. Thus, poverty reduction should the foundation of CCA planning for some urban poor communities in Manila.

AB  - Many cities and countries are now striving to create intelligent transportation systems that utilize the current abundance of multisource and multiform data related to the functionality and the use of transportation infrastructure to better support human mobility, interests, and lifestyles. Such intelligent transportation systems aim to provide novel services that can enable transportation consumers and managers to be better informed and make safer and more efficient use of the infrastructure. However, the transportation domain is characterized by both complex data and complex problems, which calls for visual analytics approaches. The science of visual analytics is continuing to develop principles, methods, and tools to enable synergistic work between humans and computers through interactive visual interfaces. Such interfaces support the unique capabilities of humans (such as the flexible application of prior knowledge and experiences, creative thinking, and insight) and couple these abilities with machines' computational strengths, enabling the generation of new knowledge from large and complex data. In this paper, we describe recent developments in visual analytics that are related to the study of movement and transportation systems and discuss how visual analytics can enable and improve the intelligent transportation systems of the future. We provide a survey of literature from the visual analytics domain and organize the survey with respect to the different types of transportation data, movement and its relationship to infrastructure and behavior, and modeling and planning. We conclude with lessons learned and future directions, including social transportation, recommender systems, and policy implications.

AB  - Sustainability is crucial to the urban zones, especially related to the water management, which is vulnerable to flood occurrence. This research applies the procedure contemplated by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) to determine the generated volumes when the impervious areas can exceed the drainage capacity of existing pluvial water networks. Several computational simulations were developed for the current scenario of an existing basin in Lisbon. Using CivilStorm software from Bentley Systems (Bentley EMEA, Bentley Systems International Limited, Dublin, Ireland), it enabled the evaluation of the volumes of flood peaks and the hydraulic behavior of a small hydrographic basin in the continuation of an urbanization process, considering the modification of its superficial impervious parts and the growth of the urbanized area. Several measures are suggested to solve the limited capacity of the existing drainage system. This study analyzes the efficiency of the application of constructive measures, pondering the viability of their effectiveness, individually and combined. The option that best minimizes the effects of the urbanization is the combination of different structural measures, in particular retention ponds, storage blocks, ditches and specific drainage interventions in some parts of the network.

AB  - Urban landscapes provide habitat for many species, including domesticated and feral honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae). With recent losses of managed honey bee colonies, there is increasing interest in feral honey bee colonies and their potential contribution to pollination services in agricultural, natural, and urban settings. However, in some regions the feral honey bee population consists primarily of Africanized honey bees. Africanized honey bees (AHB) are hybrids between European honey bees and the African honey bee, Apis mellifera scutellataLepeletier, and have generated economic, ecological, and human health concerns because of their aggressive behavior. In this study, we used two long-term datasets (7-10years) detailing the spatial and temporal distribution of AHB colonies in Tucson, AZ, USA, where feral colonies occupy a variety of cavities including water meter boxes. A stage-structured matrix model was used to elucidate the implications of nest site selection and the effects of colony terminations on the structure and dynamics of the AHB population. Our results suggest that Tucson's AHB population is driven by a relatively small number of source' colonies that escape termination (ca. 0.165 colonies per km(2) or 125 colonies in total), although immigrating swarms and absconding colonies from the surrounding area may have also contributed to the stability of the Tucson AHB population. Furthermore, the structure of the population has likely been impacted by the number and spatial distribution of water meter boxes across the city. The study provides an example of how urban wildlife populations are driven by interactions among landscape structure, human management, and behavioral traits conferred by an invasive genotype.

AB  - The article presents process of shaping place identity on the example of an important for Pomerania region investment - European Solidarity Centre. The idea of a Solidarity social movement is strongly associated with the formation of post-socialist national identity of Poland as well as local identity of Pomerania, from which movement originates. The realization of the European Solidarity Centre aims to be one of the essential elements of shaping Gdansk's identity of space. The article is an attempt to analyse how the presence of realization gradually affects the formation of the place identity of new urban space. Analysis of this realization will allow on the one hand to verify design assumptions made by authors, on the other provides the opportunity to search for best description of still vague notion of local identity. This concept, though intuitively close to everyone still seems to elude conceptual apparatus of theory of architecture. The intention of this article is to explore the notion of identity based on the observations of the newly realized significant cultural space. This analysis approaches the concept of identity from two perspectives. The first approach draws from the concept of identity of Christian Norberg-Schulz. Here, local identity is seen as a unique set of characteristics of space. So seen the concept of place identity is a correlate of concept of personal identity. In this analysis, methods of description of personal identity were transferred to the identity of the place. In the second approach, the identity of place is understood as a unique for that place way of being in space, way to spend time and development of the sitespecific urban rituals. Such a concept of identity, draws from the concept of place of Kim Dovey. Both presented approaches seems to complement each other but they also emphasize different qualities. The now-traditional concept of Genius Loci sees architecture as a structural system of meanings. Meaningful elements are seen here primarily from aesthetic perspective. As something we can see. In this perspective, the concept of place identity is seen as a static formation. This perfectly corresponds to design determinants of historical spaces associated with the concept of cultural heritage. In the authors' opinion identity of the place is also built on the interactions that occur between users in space. The space in this approach becomes a catalyst for social contact. What is important for the user is the formation of identity through customs, rituals and urban traditions - that create new network of social connections. This concept of place recognizes dynamic nature of space identity -as a changeable formation which is continuously co-created. Such recognition can give better understanding of identity for specific design conditions, such as gradual formation of new urban spaces. It is so because this approach places emphasis on the processual nature of space identity -as in the case discussed in the article.

AB  - Long-distance public passenger transport by road is one of the principal means for the articulation of the settlements. In Ecuador, public transport is of massive use for long-distance travel and how routes are disponibles, the centers which interconnect, and frequencies of services suggest wich are the main relationships that take place in the territory. When there are no other expressive indicators of these relationships it becomes a fundamental source to know the functioning of urban systems. Likewise, the analysis of territorial accessibility contributes in a complementary way to defining these relationships, especially in areas where there are no public transport connections. The article analyzes territorial relations that occur at different levels of the system of settlements through the transport system and accessibility analysis, and made an approach to areas that are generated around the main nodal centers of Ecuador.

AB  - Apex predators are critical to ecological function, however their life history traits are often not conducive to survival in urban environments. While this can result in the loss of some apex predators, others are able to inhabit and utilize urban environments. Understanding predator resource requirements and the factors driving their distribution is often difficult due to their cryptic nature, however, this understanding is essential, given the current rate of urban expansion. In this research we use a threatened apex predator, the powerful owl (Ninox strenua) as a case study. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop a Species Distribution Model (SDM) to ascertain environmental variables driving habitat suitability across an urban gradient (2) determine fine scale spatial movements of powerful owls using GPS telemetry; (3) validate the SDM against collected GPS movement data; and (4) evaluate habitat predicted by the SDM against current reserve systems to establish whether they are adequate for the future protection of this species. We used MaxEnt and citizen science data to produce SDMs that predicted habitat suitability for powerful owls and identified the environmental variables driving habitat across the landscape. Fine-scale spatial movements for urban powerful owls, gained via GPS telemetry, were used to establish home-range sizes, validate models and assess the fit of telemetry data against SDM predictions. Rivers, vegetation (particularly dense tree cover) and distance to riparian areas were the ecological variables driving predicted habitat for powerful owls across the urban gradient. There was a strong relationship between habitat predicted by the SDM and the fine scale movements of powerful owls in urbanized environments. Home-ranges within this urban study were notably smaller than previous estimates established for forested environments. The powerful owls in our study were also shown to utilize considerable amounts of habitat outside of the reserve system. This has severe conservation implications,because it is often the space outside of reserves that are at most risk from urban intensification. Conservation of the powerful owl in urban environments, therefore, needs to focus on both habitat management within existing reserves, and on establishing clear vegetation management strategies in the surrounding urban matrix.

AB  - In assessing the health of rivers, the standardization of environmental and biological information as a baseline is essential in order to determine the set of conditions that are closest to the natural state of ecosystems. This is the case especially in pen-urban rivers where anthropogenic transformations occur rapidly and constantly. The objective of this work was to determine hydromorphological, physicochemical and biological parameters in 10 mountain rivers of the Mexico Basin, in order to establish a network of potential reference conditions and to validate the regional ecological quality. The potential reference conditions in this study are defined as oligotrophic water bodies with well-oxygenated concentrations and low ion concentrations. These conditions were recorded in 4 sub-basins with high hydromorphological quality. These results were corroborated through a base assembly composed of the macroinvertebrate families Baetide, Chrironomidae, Dugesiidae, Heptageniidae, Limnephilidae, Tipulidae and the class Arachnida (Acarina). The algal community was represented by Nostoc parmelioides, Placoma regulare, Batrachospermum gelatinosum, Paralemanea mexicana, Draparnaldia mutabilis, Prasiola mexicana and Vaucheria bursata. The major disturbances were structural changes in the riverbed that affect the structure and function of rivers. (C) 2017 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Instituto de Biologia.

AB  - The wider Athens metropolitan area serves as an interesting setting for conducting geodetic studies. On the one hand, it has a complex regional geotectonic characteristic with several active and blind faults, one of which gave the deadly M-omega 5.9 Athens earthquake on September 1999. On the other hand, the Greek capital is heavily urbanized, and construction activities have been taking place in the last few decades to address the city's needs for advanced infrastructures. This work focuses on estimating ground velocities for the wider Athens area in a period spanning two decades, with an extended spatial coverage, increased spatial sampling of the measurements and at high precision. The aim is to deliver to the community a reference geodetic database containing consistent and robust velocity estimates to support further studies for modeling and multi-hazard assessment. The analysis employs advanced persistent scatterer interferometry methods, covering Athens with both ascending and descending ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat Synthetic Aperture Radar data, forming six independent interferometric stacks. A methodology is developed and applied to exploit track diversity for decomposing the actual surface velocity field to its vertical and horizontal components and coping with the post-processing of the multi-track big data. Results of the time series analysis reveal that a large area containing the Kifisia municipality experienced non-linear motion; while it had been subsiding in the period 1992-1995 (12 mm/year), the same area has been uplifting since 2005 (+4 mm/year). This behavior is speculated to have its origin on the regional water extraction activities, which when halted, led to a physical restoration phase of the municipality. In addition, a zoom in the area inflicted by the 1999 earthquake shows that there were zones of counter-force horizontal movement prior to the event. Further analysis is suggested to investigate the source and tectonic implications of this observation.

AB  - Man-made barriers are well known for their effects on ecosystems. Habitat fragmentation, for instance, is a recognised consequence of modern-day infrastructure. The aim of the present study was to investigate the diversity and abundance of tick species, as well as the risks of acquiring tick-borne infections in habitats adjacent to a freeway. Therefore, ixodid ticks were collected from the vegetation at two-week intervals (in the main tick season, from March to June) in eight habitats of different types (forest, grove, grassland) along both sides of a freeway. Ixodes ricinus females were molecularly screened for three species of tick-borne bacteria. In the study period, 887 ixodid ticks were collected. These included 704 I. ricinus (79.4%), 51 Dermacentor reticulatus (5.7%), 78 D. marginatus (8.8%), 35 Haemaphysalis inermis (3.9%) and 19 H. concinna (2.1%). There was no significant difference in the abundance of tick species between similar habitats separated by the freeway, except for the absence of Dermacentor spp. on one side. In I. ricinus females, the overall prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum was low, and (in part due to this low rate) did not show significant difference between the two sides of the freeway. Rickettsia helvetica had significantly different overall prevalence between two distant habitats along the same side of the freeway (12.3% vs. 31.4%), but not between habitats on the opposite sides. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. showed significantly different overall prevalence between habitats both on the same and on the opposite sides of the freeway (8.6-35.9%), and the difference was higher if relevant habitats were also separated by the freeway. Importantly, the prevalence rate of the Lyme disease agent was highest in a forested resting area of the freeway, and was significantly inversely proportional to the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum (taking into account all evaluated habitats), apparently related to deer population density. Prevalence rates of these bacteria also differed significantly on single sampling occasions between: (1) closely situated habitats of different types; (2) distant and either similar or different habitat types; and (3) habitats on the opposite sides of the freeway. In conclusion, the findings of the present study show that a fenced freeway may contribute to differences in tick species diversity and tick-borne pathogen prevalence along its two sides, and this effect is most likely a consequence of its barrier role preventing deer movements.

AB  - Recent years have seen the emergence of a literature focused on physical activity outcomes among children, in relation to their transportation and bodily movement. As this literature grows, the importance of an integrated approach to understand a child's movement/mobility behaviour is beginning to be recognized in policy and practice. Few studies examine patterns in children's daily activities and transportation together. In particular, an important research gap exists at the intersection of activity-transportation lifestyles and objective measures of physical activity. Using data gathered from 700 students attending grades 5 and 6, in 16 public elementary schools in Toronto, Canada, this research identifies patterns in activity-transportation participation among children, and their associations with various measures of physical activity. A two-step cluster analysis identified four distinct activity-transportation lifestyles, namely-Artists, Readers, Homebound and Athletes. Athletes accumulated the most daily physical activity. In contrast, the homebound group had the highest screen time. Further analysis using logistic regression models identified that lifestyle group membership can be explained by gender, ethno-cultural diversity, neighbourhood-level income and residential location (i.e., inner-urban versus suburban). Findings from this study may inform future programming and interventions to address emerging guidelines focused on children's 24-hour movement.

AB  - Could we use Computer Vision in the Internet of Things for using pictures as sensors? This is the principal hypothesis that we want to resolve. Currently, in order to create safety areas, cities, or homes, people use IP cameras. Nevertheless, this system needs people who watch the camera images, watch the recording after something occurred, or watch when the camera notifies them of any movement. These are the disadvantages. Furthermore, there are many Smart Cities and Smart Homes around the world. This is why we thought of using the idea of the Internet of Things to add a way of automating the use of IP cameras. In our case, we propose the analysis of pictures through Computer Vision to detect people in the analysed pictures. With this analysis, we are able to obtain if these pictures contain people and handle the pictures as if they were sensors with two possible states. Notwithstanding, Computer Vision is a very complicated field. This is why we needed a second hypothesis: Could we work with Computer Vision in the Internet of Things with a good accuracy to automate or semi-automate this kind of events? The demonstration of these hypotheses required a testing over our Computer Vision module to check the possibilities that we have to use this module in a possible real environment with a good accuracy. Our proposal, as a possible solution, is the analysis of entire sequence instead of isolated pictures for using pictures as sensors in the Internet of Things. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mademoiselle Giraud, ma femme, Adolphe Belot's 1870 potboiler of devious Parisian lesbians and their cuckolded husbands, is overwrought with spatialized tropes. Scenes of the bedroom, traditionally intimate domestic space, instead separates the couple, subverted by wife Paule's sexual resistance and husband Adrien's frustration outside her locked door. The partitioning of intimacy also occurs at the narrative level through constructed layers of a story within a story; Paule is distanced by the retelling, never to speak for herself. In stark contrast, scenes of exteriors Second Empire urban space newly shaped for freedom of movement-carry significant erotic charge. From their initial meeting along the Chams-lyses to Adrien's pursuit of his unfaithful wife along the boulevards marking the thresholds between Haussmann's old and new Paris, Belot situates the tension of an untenable marriage in the constantly shifting terms of uncertain and unfamiliar boundaries, reflecting back the sense of liberation and disorientation produced by les Grands Travaux.

AB  - Since the financial crash of 2008, the strategy of occupation has been widely deployed as a means of expressing and mobilizing political dissent. Within legal studies, responses to this mode of protest have remained wedded to a statist perspective that fails to assess the normative commitments immanent to occupations themselves. Rather than examining the strategy of occupation through a legalistic lens, this article approaches a recent occupation through the theoretical apparatus of the nomosphere'. This term - originally coined by David Delaney but substantially expanded here - allows for an assessment of the spatial, narrative and atmospheric orderings of the Umbrella Movement, a pro-democracy campaign that sustained a 79-day occupation in Hong Kong's city centre in late 2014. This nomospheric inquiry' assesses the forms of ordering that animated the movement from within and seeks to foreground the lived and felt reality of the occupation rather than focus on its legalistic or constitutional significance alone.

AB  - It is documented that dances have spread from Lithuania as well as to Lithuania as early as the 14th century, due to the openness of the country to international relations. Dance exchanges also occurred among rural and urban areas since that time. The folk movement since the 1970s had the goal of maintaining Lithuanian identity, and its participants considered all rural dances to be "ours", including those that came from other countries. Currently, new folk dances from other countries are coming to Lithuania, especially through traditional dance clubs. One can see some similarities when comparing the present-day and the 19th and earlier centuries when many foreign dances became popular in Lithuania, assumed some local characteristics, and gradually became thought of as "our own dances".

AB  - Taking as north the protests erupted from the year 2011, including the Arab Spring, the Spanish 'indignants', the Wisconsin unions, the Chilean students and the Occupy Wall Street, the common thread of this article is to ask the democracy in globalization. Usually, the movement used the slogan "We are the 99%" and the speech was based on extreme inequality and a dysfunctional economy. Although the manifestations have ceased, or by repression or by exhaustion, a question remained: in the contemporary world, highly complex, there seems to have a denial of the politic and its bilateralism, in its opposition and situation code, and probably the globalization shrunk or expanded the politic. This article intend to answer this question, in order to reconstruct democracy, using the traveler-map of the literary work Invisible Cities, by Italo Calvino, as a starting point. Also, aims to reveal the political bilateralism, discuss globalization as an awakening of a breakthrough movement and analyze the archive and the memory of democracy. As a result, it is observed that democracy must reveal its expansion beyond the multi-party state political form, rebuilding, incessantly, the politic. This article used the contributions of the systems theory of Niklas Luhmann.

AB  - A "dirty bomb" is a type of radiological dispersal device (RDD) that has been the subject of significant safety and security concerns given the disruption that would result from a postulated terrorist attack. Assessing the risks of radioactive dose in a hypothetical scenario requires models that can accurately predict dispersion in a realistic environment. Modelling a RDD is complicated by the fact that the most important phenomena occur over vastly disparate spatial and temporal length scales. Particulate dispersion in the air is generally considered on scales of hundreds to thousands of meters, and over periods of minutes and hours. Dispersion models are extremely sensitive, however, to the particle size and source characterization, which are determined in distances measured in micrometers to meters, over milliseconds or less.
   This study examines the extent to which the explosive blast determines the transport of contaminant particles relative to the atmospheric wind over distances relevant to "near-field" dispersion problems (i.e., hundreds of meters), which are relevant to urban environments. Our results indicate that whether or not the effect of the blast should be included in a near-field dispersion model is largely dependent on the size of the contaminant particle. Relatively large particles (i.e., >40 pm in diameter), which are most likely to be produced by a RDD, penetrate the leading shock front, thereby avoiding the reverse blast wind. Consequently, they travel much farther than suspended aerosols (<10 mu m) before approaching the ambient wind velocity. This suggests that, for these "near-field" dispersion problems in urban environments, the transport of contaminants from the blast wave may be integral to accurately predicting their dispersion.

AB  - The process of increasing social inequality in Spain is laid bare in urban areas such as the Madrid district of Tetuan. Unemployment, precariousness in the labour market and the weakness of social protection systems have given rise to situations involving great vulnerability among the population. Increasing bureaucracy, the welfare perspective and a lack of resources all place restrictions on social services in this context. This hinders multidimensional responses to exclusion, making transformative work impossible. Invisibles de Tetuan uses collective work and neighbourhood self-organization in order to visibilize highly diverse realities of exclusion and seek to transform them on various scales. On the basis of mutual support, respect for diversity and the horizontal methodology of the 15M movement, this small group offers alternatives to individualism and tests instruments for the construction of a fairer society and a more efficient social policy.

AB  - During the 20th century, several uncontrolled processes compromise the dynamics and trends of technological transitions that for centuries, had been characterizing the built environment and the manufacturing processes. In the agenda drawn by the Sustainable Transition Network, referring to manufacturing landscapes, the transition is a long process, deeply rooted to cultural and settlement specificities, to the skills of the workforce, to the opening of new markets, to the community needs. In a circular perspective for development, returning congruence to productive cycles, by linking them to the settlements vocations and communities' skills, is the design commitment. Taking into account the systemic vision for the built and performance approach, a design strategy is experienced during three years, for the Vesuvius foodscape. It consists of three main phases: *outlining the relationships between places and manufacturing, in terms of processes, products and wastes, *mapping the technological transition processes occurring at the architectural and urban scales, *defining compatibility ranges for shortening the loops and promoting inclusive technological innovations. The project outlines a regeneration strategy informed to the following visions: 1. The productive landscape is a common good, a complex system resulting from the encounter between resources and technological thinking. 2. Strengthening the community skills is an indispensable condition for promoting regeneration. 3. The third sector, social, economic and cultural reality of a private nature but tended to produce public or collective goods and services can be a privileged actor of sustainability.

AB  - The study of fragmentation processes should be tackled using different approaches, in order to obtain solid and robust evidence that could help in identifying potential barriers and threats for species. In this study, we have evaluated the spatial fragmentation patterns in Artemisia crithmifolia (Asteraceae) along its current distribution along the Atlantic coastlines of Europe, from Portugal to the Netherlands and the UK. Niche modelling analyses considering current and past climatic conditions, combined with plastid markers, have been used to evaluate the disconnected distribution pattern of the species, genetic flow between populations and habitat suitability for present and past populations. Plastid markers showed very low variability, while suggesting that the westernmost populations from the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula are partially genetically isolated, due to the existence of a potential barrier for gene flow on the northern Spanish coast. However, niche models identify this area as a potential habitat for the species, even during the last glacial maximum (20,000 years ago). The combination of both techniques allows identification of potential refugia for the species, highlighting the most likely recolonisation routes and distribution patterns which resulted in the overall low levels of genetic diversity. Anthropogenic activities (urban sprawl, beach expansions, etc.) are most likely behind local extinctions, thus preventing the establishment and expansion of new populations.

AB  - The markedly anthropophilic and endophilic behaviors of Aedes aegypti (L.) make it a very efficient vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Although a large body of research has investigated the immature habitats and conditions for adult emergence, relatively few studies have focused on the indoor resting behavior and distribution of vectors within houses. We investigated the resting behavior of Ae. aegypti indoors in 979 houses of the city of Acapulco, Mexico, by performing exhaustive indoor mosquito collections to describe the rooms and height at which mosquitoes were found resting. In total, 1,403 adult and 747 female Ae. aegypti were collected, primarily indoors (98% adults and 99% females). Primary resting locations included bedrooms (44%), living rooms (25%), and bathrooms (20%), followed by kitchens (9%). Aedes aegypti significantly rested below 1.5 m of height (82% adults, 83% females, and 87% bloodfed females); the odds of finding adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes below 1.5 m was 17 times higher than above 1.5 m. Our findings provide relevant information for the design of insecticide- based interventions selectively targeting the adult resting population, such as indoor residual spraying.

AB  - Regional planning approaches to mining infrastructure aim to reduce the conflict associated with mining operations and existing land uses, such as urban areas and biodiversity conservation, as well as the cumulative impacts that occur offsite. In this paper, we describe a method for conducting Geographical Information System (GIS) least-cost path and least-cost corridor analysis for linear mining infrastructure, such as roads. Least-cost path analysis identifies the optimal pathways between two locations as a function of the cost of traveling through different land use/cover types. In a case study from South-East Sulawesi, Indonesia, we identify potential linear networks for road infrastructure connecting mines, smelters, and ports. The method used interview data from government officials to characterise their orientation (perceived importance and positive/negative attitude) toward the social and environmental factors associated with mining infrastructure. A cost-surface was constructed by integrating spatial layers representing the social and environmental factors to identify areas that should be avoided and areas that were compatible with linear infrastructure using the least-cost path analysis. We compared infrastructure scenario outputs from local and national government officials by the degree of spatial overlap and found broad spatial agreement for infrastructure corridors. We conclude by discussing this approach in relation to the wider social-ecological and mine planning literature and how quantitative approaches can reduce the conflict associated with infrastructure planning.

TI  - Temperature and Relative Humidity Vertical Profiles within Planetary Boundary Layer in Winter Urban Airshed
T2  - WORLD MULTIDISCIPLINARY EARTH SCIENCES SYMPOSIUM (WMESS 2017)
LA  - English
CP  - 3rd World Multidisciplinary Earth Sciences Symposium (WMESS)
AB  - The planetary boundary layer is a dynamic system with turbulent flow where horizontal and vertical air mixing depends mainly on the weather conditions and geomorphology. Normally, air temperature from the Earth surface decreases with height but inversion situation may occur, mainly during winter. Pollutant dispersion is poor during inversions so air pollutant concentration can quickly rise, especially in urban closed valleys. Air pollution was evaluated by WHO as a human carcinogen (mostly by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and health effects are obvious. Knowledge about inversion layer height is important for estimation of the pollution impact and it can give us also information about the air pollution sources. Temperature and relative humidity vertical profiles complement ground measurements. Ground measurements were conducted to characterize comprehensively urban airshed in Svermov, residential district of the city of Kladno, about 30 km NW of Prague, from the 2nd Feb. to the 3rd of March 2016. The Svermov is an air pollution hot-spot for long time benzo[a] pyrene (B[a] P) limit exceedances, reaching the highest B[a] P annual concentration in Bohemia - west part of the Czech Republic. Since the Svermov sits in a shallow valley, frequent vertical temperature inversion in winter and low emission heights of pollution sources prevent pollutant dispersal off the valley. Such orography is common to numerous small settlements in the Czech Republic. Ground measurements at the sports field in the Svermov were complemented by temperature and humidity vertical profiles acquired by a Vaisala radiosonde positioned at tethered He-filled balloon. Total number of 53 series of vertical profiles up to the height of 300 m was conducted. Meteorology parameters were acquired with 4 Hz frequency. The measurements confirmed frequent early-morning and night formation of temperature inversion within boundary layer up to the height of 50 m. This rather shallow inversion had significant influence on air quality due to inversion cap over the valley. Nevertheless, formation of an inversion showed strong diurnal variability. For example, on the 18th Feb. early morning shallow inversion quickly disappeared within less than 2 hours. According to this study tethered balloon measurements has proved to be a good tool for completion comprehensive ground air quality measurements.

AB  - Architecture and constructing are the main tools that both the present and the bygone civilizations have used to tame and articulate Nature. Structures of living, production and movement have in a short period of time overlaid primeval and complex ecosystems everywhere on the planet. What is coming next and where are we heading? The biological and cultural background of Man is the forest, the matrix of Nature. Many of the words and concepts describing our contemporary society still have their root in the space and symbols of the forest. Living in a forest has left a trace, a tradition which is part of our common memory. The loss of this connection would be both a biological and a cultural catastrophe. Good architecture in the future should therefore be related more to gardening than to constructing: planting seeds first in the small scale of a home, then of the neighbourhood, and finally growing into the scale of a city.

AB  - Determining the effect of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical Race 4 on various soil parameters is essential in modeling and predicting its occurrence in banana plantations. One way to fulfill this is through a sensor network that will continuously and automatically monitor environmental conditions at suspect locations for an extended period of time. A wireless sensor network was developed specifically for this purpose. This sensor network is capable of measuring soil acidity, moisture, temperature, and conductivity. The designed prototype made use of off-the-shelf Parrot Flower Power soil sensor, pH sensor, Bluno Beetle, battery, and 3D-printed materials, catering specifically to the conditions of tropical banana plantations with consideration for sensor node size, communication, and power. Sensor nodes were tested on both simulated tropical environments and on an actual banana plantation in San Jose, General Santos City, Philippines. Challenges were resolved through iterative design and development of prototypes. Several tests including temperature and weather resilience, and structural stress tests were done to validate the design. Findings showed that the WSN nodes developed for this purpose are resilient to high tropical temperatures for up to 12 hours of continuous exposure, are able to withstand compressive forces of up to 8880.6 N, and can reliably collect data automatically from the area 47.96% of the time at an hourly frequency under actual field conditions.

KW  - Barcelona
KW  - urban hygiene
KW  - Walls
KW  - Monlau
KW  - Cerda
AB  - Barcelona's old town had been suffering from overpopulation, congestion and several epidemic outbreaks that raised awarness concerning urban hygiene. One of the first intents of urban hygiene began when Carlos III and Carlos IV issued Royal Decrees concerning the exhumation of cemeteries. The first prohibited burial grounds next to churches and hospitals and imposed the conversion of existing ones into public squares, and the second enabled the construction of extramural cemeteries away from populated areas. This gave way to many of Barcelona's open spaces and small scale squares. The second intent of creating public spaces was taking advantage of the confiscation of ecclesiastic assets, like the Alvarez Mendizabal's Act (1834-1837) in particular, and the burning of convents in 1835 where the Catholic Church lost a large number of its convents, churches, and colleges to new buildings, streets and squares.
   In the 19th century, Spain also witnessed a hygienist movement and several doctors and scientists were prominent including Pere Felip Monlau who thoroughly discussed hygiene in all its aspects. Spain, and Barcelona in particular, experienced large waves of immigration coming from rural areas in search of work, and a massive industrial growth. By the 1850's the old town became overpopulated, increasingly dense, unhealthy and degraded, and was left in an unstable political and social tension. Basically, the old town was suffocating within its own walls. Monlau, as did Cerda after him, described in his writings the drastic living conditions, the occupied spaces and exceedingly high buildings, the lack of sanitary infrastructure, clean water, sunlight and ventilation. He stressed on the importance of creating open spaces, squares and gardens and their impact on improving urban hygiene. He called for the demolition of old town's Roman Walls and the expansion towards the urban land reserve of 'Pla de Barcelona' or Barcelona Plain. After many debates the destruction of the walls began in 1854 and lasted until 1868.

AB  - The patterns of subspecies distribution, diversity and differentiation of the house mouse Mus musculus provide insights into past dispersal events in natural populations of this species. We investigated the molecular phylogenetics of Chinese house mice based on 466 DNA sequences from mitochondrial D-loop fragments. Our analyses revealed that Mus musculus musculus and M m. castaneus are older colonized subspecies with broad distributions in East China, while M m. domestics is a newly arrived subspecies currently restricted to Shanghai, indicating the elevated risk in this cosmopolitan cities. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that M. m. musculus migrated from northern China to eastern China and that M. m. casianeus invaded from southern China. The two subspecies form a hybrid zone in eastern China. There were three major well-differentiated clades within M. m. castaneus, which were designated as CAS1, CAS2 and CAS3 and confirmed previous internal sublineage differentiation of this subspecies. Of the three clades, only CAS1 was detected in all the samples from mainland China. M. m. musculus exhibited no broadly distributed Glade, which might be explained by frequent human-assisted movements. Our study offers a newly detailed perspective on the subspecies distribution of M. musculus and its history of migration to eastern China.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Western Area (WA) of Sierra Leone including the capital, Freetown, experienced an unprecedented outbreak of Ebola from 2014 to 2015. At the onset of the epidemic, there was little information about the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and risk factors in urban settings as previous outbreaks were limited to rural/semi-rural settings. This study, therefore, aimed to describe the epidemiology of the outbreak and the factors which had most impact on the transmission of the epidemic and whether there were different drivers from those previously described in rural settings.
   METHODS: We conducted a descriptive epidemiology study in WA, Sierra Leone using secondary data from the National Ebola outbreak database. We also reviewed the Ebola situation reports, response strategy documents, and other useful documents.
   RESULTS: A total of 4,955 Ebola cases were identified between June 2014 and November 2015, although there were reports of cases occurring in WA toward end of May. All wards were affected, and Waterloo Area I (Ward 330), the capital city of Western Area Rural District, recorded the highest numbers of cases (580) and deaths (236). Majority of cases (63.4%) and deaths (66.8%) were in WA Urban District (WAU); 44 cases were imported from other provinces. Only 20% of cases had a history of contact with an Ebola case, and more than 30% were death alerts. Equal numbers of males and females were infected, and very few cases (3.2%) were health workers. Overall, transmission was through contact with infected individuals, and intense transmission occurred at the community level. In WAU, transmission was mostly between neighbors and among inhabitants of shared accommodations. The drivers of transmission included high population movement to and from WA, overcrowding, fear and lack of trust in the response, and negative community behaviors. Transmission was mostly through contact and with limited transmission through sex and breast milk.
   CONCLUSION: The unprecedented outbreak in WA was attributed to delayed detection, inadequate preparedness and response, intense population movements, overcrowding, and unresponsive communities. Anticipation, strengthening preparedness for early detection, and swift and effective response remains critical in mitigating a potential urban explosion of similar future outbreaks.

AB  - In this paper the vision of Valladolid offered in the novel La emparedada del Corral de Campanas, of Jose Luis Guerra Fernandez, is analyzed, comparing it with that given in some tourist guides of the city. We analyze the rhetorical and persuasive strategies employed in the novel and in tourist guides. In the novel, the protagonist movement of a large number of streets of the city is minutely described, always specifying their names, which is an original and attractive resource. In addition, some historical events and the names of the streets of Valladolid in which they occurred are explained, relating these ancient streets with current and indicating the changes they have experienced in their names. All this raises the question of the type of "ideal reader" to whom the novel is addressed, because not all readers, even the generality of residents in the city, know where are all the named streets or the history of Valladolid.

AB  - Numerous marine species have been introduced via anthropogenic vectors; however, many species, including highly abundant ones, have uncertain invasion histories. Here, we include the first large-scale population genetics study of the Asian shorecrab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) in native (east Asia) and non-native (east USA) regions to help resolve questions of source, vector, and multiple introductions. Using a barcoding gene and six microsatellite loci, we analyzed 731 cytochrome oxidase I sequences and 500 microsatellites across 51 populations over two time periods, 2001-2002 and 2013-2014. Explorations of both genetic and historical data indicated that multiple introductions to USA are probable with the greatest genetic diversity concentrating around Long Island (near New York City). Analyses of ballast water flux and genetic data suggest that introductions from Japan via shipping are the likely source and pathway of introduction to USA. In particular, we found unexchanged ballast arriving to USA (otably New York region) from sources throughout Japan, including southern and northern areas where closer genetic connections to USA were detected. Western Europe was also a prominent source of unexchanged ballast, suggesting possible trans-Atlantic transfers. Altogether, extensive biogeographic studies like this help provide integral evidence for resolving key invasion history questions, as well as a baseline understanding of a species ' probable success and prospect for further spread. In turn, while mandatory ballast water exchange in USA has greatly lessened ballastborne invasions, our study underscores that hotspots of unexchanged ballast can remain potential sources of novel or supplemental introductions worldwide.

AB  - This study examines the existing podium-tower form of mixed-use residential development in Hong Kong and reveals its effects on street lives and pedestrian movements within high-rise, high-density residential areas. The podiums accommodate shops, facilities, and modes of transportation for those living above and in the surrounding area. The Tuen Mun complex's well-linked podium spaces illustrate that the podium form maximizes internal uses below residential areas, but segregates the closely located residential space from daily commercial activities. The existing podium spaces privatize streets and plazas for residents in towers and visitors to podium-space commercial shops, not for a layperson exploring there. Although ground-level streets and plazas are public spaces where diverse urban activities occur, podiums' internal corridors and halls are semipublic areas where designated shopping activities occur. While podiums enhance the convenience and safety of common space, these internal space become less public for internal users and include more barriers such as vertical circulation from the public street. The findings are expected to contribute to public awareness of and consciousness in relation to the development of compact and composite residential environments.

AB  - The Vermilion River and major tributaries (VRMT) are located in the Vermilion watershed (4272 km(2)) in north-central Ontario, Canada. This watershed not only is dominated by natural land-cover but also has a legacy of mining and other development activities. The VRMT receive various point (e.g., sewage effluent) and non-point (e.g., mining activity runoff) inputs, in addition to flow regulation features. Further development in the Vermilion watershed has been proposed, raising concerns about cumulative impacts to ecosystem health in the VRMT. Due to the lack of historical assessments on riverine-health in the VRMT, a comprehensive suite of water quality parameters was collected monthly at 28 sites during the ice-free period of 2013 and 2014. Canadian water quality guidelines and objectives were not met by an assortment of water quality parameters, including nutrients and metals. This demonstrates that the VRMT is an impacted system with several pollution hotspots, particularly downstream of wastewater treatment facilities. Water quality throughout the river system appeared to be influenced by three distinct land-cover categories: forest, barren, and agriculture. Three spatial pathway models (geographical, topographical, and river network) were employed to assess the complex interactions between spatial pathways, stressors, and water quality condition. Topographical landscape analyses were performed at five different scales, where the strongest relationships between water quality and land-use occurred at the catchment scale. Sites on the main stem of Junction Creek, a tributary impacted by industrial and urban development, had above average concentrations for the majority of water quality parameters measured, including metals and nitrogen. The river network pathway (i.e., asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM)) and topographical feature (i.e., catchment land-use) models explained most of the variation in water quality (62.2%), indicating that they may be useful tools in assessing the spatial determinants of water quality decline.

AB  - Road networks are characterised by several structural and geometrical properties. The topological structure determines partially the hierarchical arrangement of roads, but since these are networks that are spatially constrained, geometrical properties play a fundamental role in determining the network's behaviour, characterising the influence of each of the street segments on the system. In this work, we apply percolation theory to the UK's road network using the relative angle between street segments as the occupation probability. The appearance of the spanning cluster is marked by a phase transition, indicating that the system behaves in a critical way. Computing Shannon's entropy of the cluster sizes, different stages of the percolation process can be discerned, and these indicate that roads integrate to the giant cluster in a hierarchical manner. This is used to construct a hierarchical index that serves to classify roads in terms of their importance. The obtained classification is in very good correspondence with the official designations of roads. This methodology hence provides a framework to consistently extract the main skeleton of an urban system and to further classify each road in terms of its hierarchical importance within the system.

AB  - The recent wave of occupations highlighted how closely space and social movements are related. While this revived scholarly interest in the role of space during protests, little attention so far has been paid to the role of space in protests' long-term internal effects. Bringing together the literatures on trans formative effects and space in social movements, the paper examines the role of protests' spatiality in their transformative effects, drawing on a narrow approach to space. The analysis focuses in particular on effects on collective identity building in social movements. Based on interviews and focus groups with activists in 2011, the paper examines the long-term effects of an incisive protest event of the Global Justice Movement (GJM) in Europe, the protests against the G8 summit in Genoa in 2001. The paper shows that this event's spatiality plays a crucial role in building movement identity several years later: it provides activists with interpretational devices to delineate the GJM's internal and external boundaries. The paper thus underlines that research on transformative effects can considerably profit from considering spatiality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chrysomela populi L. (Coleoptera; Chrysomelidae) is one of the most serious pests affecting poplars. Chemical control is the most widely known suppressive method against this pest. This method is not acceptable in urban forests because of their proximity to people. Entomopathogenic organisms are environmentally friendly control agents and suppress the pest populations under natural conditions. In the present study, the occurrence and distribution of a new entomopathogenic protist, a neogregarine, Ophryocystis anatoliensis (Apicomplexa) in C. populi populations and a member of the family Chrysomelidae is presented for the first time. In total, 90 of 2185 C. populi adults and larvae collected from 16 localities during three years (from 2013 to 2015) were found to be infected by this pathogen. Neogregarine infection was observed in 14 of 16 investigated C. populi populations. The infection was variable between the populations and years. These results confirm that the neogregarine pathogen has a high dispersal potential through the C. populi populations and can be an effective natural biological suppressing factor on the pest populations.

AB  - In urban areas with a high level of human disturbance, wildlife has to adjust its behavior to deal with the so called "landscape of fear." This can be studied in risk perception during movement in relation to specific habitat types, whereby individuals trade-off between foraging and disturbance. Due to its high behavioral plasticity and increasing occurrence in urban environments, wild boar (Sus scrofa) is an excellent model organism to study adjustment to urbanization. With the help of GPS tracking, space use of 11 wild boar from Berlin's metropolitan region was analyzed: we aimed at understanding how animals adjust space use to deal with the landscape of fear in urban areas compared to rural areas. We compared use vs. availability with help of generalized linear mixed models. First, we studied landscape types selected by rural vs. urban wild boar, second, we analyzed distances of wild boar locations to each of the landscape types. Finally, we mapped the resulting habitat selection probability to predict hotspots of human-wildlife conflicts. A higher tolerance to disturbance in urban wild boar was shown by a one third shorter flight distance and by an increased re-use of areas close to the trap. Urban wild boar had a strong preference for natural landscapes such as swamp areas, green areas and deciduous forests, and areas with high primary productivity, as indicated by high NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) values. The areas selected by urban wild boar were often located closely to roads and houses. The spatial distribution maps show that a large area of Berlin would be suitable for urban wild boar but not their rural conspecifics, with the most likely reason being a different perception of anthropogenic disturbance. Wild boar therefore showed considerable behavioral plasticity suitable to adjust to human-dominated environments in a potentially evolutionarily adaptive manner.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how the principles of Black Lives Matter can be used to enact a culturally sustaining pedagogy (CSP) in higher education settings, particularly in small colleges that serve significant populations of students who are underrepresented in higher education.
   Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on examples from college courses in media and society, organizational communication, and interpersonal communication, the case study shows application of the principles of Black Lives Matter in the college classroom at two different institutions in the urban Northeast USA, where the majority of the students are young people of color and/or first-generation college students.
   Findings - The paper shows how founding principles of Black Lives Matter, particularly diversity, intersectionality, loving engagement, and empathy, can be used to guide concrete pedagogical practices. It provides examples of how to use Black Lives Matter as a framework to enhance and improve college teaching to make it more diverse and inclusive.
   Research limitations/implications - This case study is based on the author's experiences teaching at two majority-minority colleges in Greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA. This paper is not the result of a systematic research study.
   Practical implications - This paper has significant implications for how to enact CSP in higher education settings. This paper is valuable to those looking for specific strategies to include more diverse and inclusive teaching strategies. This research also shows both the utility and impact of Black Lives Matter when applied to higher education.
   Social implications - This paper improves public understanding of Black Lives Matter as a social movement.
   Originality/value - Since the Black Lives Matter movement is fairly new, there is limited academic research on it. Further, there has not been attention to how Black Lives Matter provides insight into pedagogy, particularly in higher education.

AB  - Initiatives using parkour and parkour-inspired hybrid activities are emerging in increasingly varied settings from formal physical education to the performance arts. This proliferation in England has led to the need for more formal governance resulting in the formation of a Sport England-sanctioned national governing body, Parkour UK.
   In this paper, we document attempts to challenge the perceived sportization process in England through the emergence of Performance-Parkour [2PK] a version of parkour practice rooted in the performance arts. We discuss the implications of these developments for maintaining parkour's diversity and inclusivity as a practice for inspiring participation. We draw on a range of data sources including observations, formal interviews, and reflections from different positions from academic outsides to involved practitioner. We then consider the implications of these developments for maintaining parkour's diversity and inclusivity as a practice for inspiring participation, particularly with regard to pedagogic style and gender inclusion. This process highlights some of the challenges and difficulties in the institutionalisation of an informal movement practice into an organised and formalised one. Our paper therefore contributes to our understanding of the role informal sporting activities can play in promoting inclusive and equitable physical cultures, and provides insights into emergent boundary-crossing practices that are situated between sports and the arts.

AB  - Inspired by the Arab Spring, massive social movements have erupted since 2011 in many places around the world. Despite their differences, these movements have had at least two remarkable common features: all of them struggled for real democracy' and occupied prominent urban public spaces to erect temporary tent encampments. By focusing on the case study of the 2011 Israeli tent protests, this paper argues that the production of such places of resistance works as a crucial, albeit ambivalent, strategy to confront hegemonic power relations. On the basis of the literature on the spatialities of contentious politics, the article demonstrates that the establishment of more than 70 tent camps in public spaces all across Israel was of vital importance not only to challenging the post-democratic political system but also to overcoming an internal crisis of representation within the Israeli protest movement. However, the case of the Israeli J14 tent protests also underlines that while the production of place can be a powerful starting point for social movements, it is not a durable alternative to multi-scalar, networked forms of organisation, which are also able to confront state authorities in the long term.

AB  - The leafhopper species Tautoneura polymitusa Oh & Jung, 2016 (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha: Cicadellidae: Typhlocybinae: Erythroneurini), described recently from Korea, is recorded from Hungary, representing the first known European occurrence of the species and also of the genus Tautoneura Anufriev, 1969. The species is illustrated, its diagnostic characters are discussed and compared with those of the closely related congeners. The occurrence of T. polymitusa in three isolated localities in Hungary and regular records in Budapest over a period of five years since 2012 indicate that stable populations exist in Hungary, the species is probably already established and it is locally abundant. It is apparently associated with elm trees (Ulmus spp.) and other members of the plant family Ulmaceae. Its further spread in Europe is expected.

AB  - Over the last 30 years, America has witnessed its urban areas transform through the application of neoliberal political economy, going from a state of industrial decay to one of modernized, technologically-advanced, highly skilled service occupations. At the same time, many of this process's socio-economic benefits have largely been concentrated along ethnic lines and rarely bestowed upon original residents, allowing some to rightfully label the movement as gentrification. Thus, we pose the following question: what makes urban electorates consistently vote for administrations that implement economic policies directly antagonistic to their best interests? The answer, we argue, is found in an extension of William K. Black's concept of control fraud, which we label as a 'political economic control fraud'. In doing so, we show how this allows top governing authorities to implement a neoliberal platform of unsustainable policies that, at least initially, causes the economy to grow rapidly, allows them to leverage this and improve their political capital, and enables them to seek higher office and/or private occupations while simultaneously abrogating them of any responsibility associated with the transformation's eventual collapse. Finally, we show that neoliberal political economic governance must necessarily be rooted in fraud since it creates and intensifies a divergence of economic class interests. To overcome this and promote such a platform, politicians appeal to the symbolism Americans attach to freedom and democracy because if the consequences of this ideology were genuinely sold to the electorate their political careers would be short lived.

AB  - We investigated clonal structure, growth pattern and colonization through sprouting in the invasive tree species Triadica sebifera on Mt. Mikasa, Nara City, Japan. Genets of T. sebifera were identified by microsatellite DNA analysis. The age of stems was determined by counting annual growth rings. In a 25 x 60-m plot, we found 214 genets among 315 stems >= 130 cm in height. Of these, 23 genets were multistemmed. Numbers of stems on a genet increased with increasing genet age. The size, shape and number of stems indicated that several genets adopted a guerilla growth strategy in which stems are widely spaced along roots. Only one genet seemed to adopt a phalanx growth strategy characterized by high stem density within limited areas. Older stems occurred only in the vicinity of the parental stems of genets. Young stems occurred not only at the leading edge of the genet but also close to the parental stem. Stem size was negatively correlated with the number of younger stems but positively correlated with that of older stems on the same genet. This suggests that stems were physiologically connected and that translocation of photosynthetic products was directed from old to young stems. Physiological integration may allow small stems to persist under low light availability. These findings indicate that urgent measures are required to control the T. sebifera population because the species increases its area of occupancy by vigorous stem sprouting which may compromise the natural forest.

AB  - Acoustic signals that emanate from ecosystems are an important ecological variable which can provide evidence of current ecological condition as well as ecological change over time. The Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) established protocols to record sounds in ten SuperSites distributed throughout Australia with the objective of characterizing the soundscape in a representative landscape in different regions of Australia. This acoustic monitoring system enables a comparison of the soundscapes within and between Australian regions to determine similarities and differences in these landscapes and regions.
   This research quantifies the soundscape patterns in one of these SuperSites, Samford Ecological Research Facility (TERN-SERF), which is part of the South-East Queensland Peri-Urban SuperSite. An analysis and visualization of patterns in the soundscape was conducted using a continuous acoustic recording collected at TERN-SERF. The recording was made using a Song Meter (SM2) in a representative wooded habitat at TERN-SERF from 1 August to 30 September 2013. The recording was made in 16-bit stereo at 44 kHz and stored in way file format. The recording was split into 1-minute-long recordings comprising 86,196 records and then sub-sampled at a 30-minute interval, providing 2878 one-minute-long recordings every 1/2 h. Soundscape metrics were computed for each of the two recording intervals. Soundscape power values were computed for each of ten frequency intervals (11 kHz) for both the 1-minute and the 30-minute interval.recordings. In addition, six acoustic indices were computed from each recording.
   The acoustics metrics derived from the two sets of recordings (1-minute and 30-minute recording intervals) were examined to determine if they revealed different patterns. Several soundscape metrics were calculated for each recording including ten soundscape power values at 1 kHz frequency intervals and six acoustics indices. The soundscape shows a dynamic but consistent pattern over time of day during the monitoring period, depending on the metric examined. The metrics revealed different soundscape patterns. All soundscape power values at 1 kHz frequency intervals defined the dawn and dusk chorus, some more distinctly than others. Three of six acoustic indices also changed abruptly at the dawn chorus. No significant difference was found when soundscape metrics were compared between the 1-minute (high resolution) and 30-minute (lower resolution) recording intervals. A t-test was used to compare the mean values of ten soundscape power frequency intervals (p = 0.44) and the mean values of six acoustics indices (p = 0.41).
   Sounds were identified in 180 recordings made at 0530 h, 0600 h and 0630 h in the 1-minute long 30-minute interval recordings each day during the recording period (August and September). Sixty-seven species of birds were identified. Soundscape metrics were correlated with avian species counts and calls by all species using a correlation threshold of r> 0.7. This analysis revealed that soundscape power at the frequency interval 34 kHz was correlated with both the number of species (r = -0.927) and total calls (r = -0.996) over the three time periods. Three indices, the ADI (r = 0.953, r = 0.709), the AEI (r = 0.978, r = 0.774) and (H) (r = 0.795, r = 0.985) were similarly correlated as was an index derived soundscape power, the Shannon-Weaver Index (r = -0.997, r = -0.849). Other indices were correlated (r> 0.7) with only the number of avian species or only the number of calls.
   This methodology establishes an analysis protocol for analyzing large acoustic data sets, and demonstrates the effectiveness of using acoustic metrics for summarizing and interpreting long-term recordings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasive allergenic plant species may have severe health-related impacts. In this study we aim to predict the effects of climate change on the distribution of three allergenic ragweed species (A mbrosia spp.) in Europe and discuss the potential associated health impact. We built species distribution models based on presence-only data for three ragweed species, using MAXENT software. Future climatic habitat suitability was modeled under two IPCC climate change scenarios (RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5). We quantify the extent of the increase in `high allergy risk' (HAR) areas, i.e., parts of Europe with climatic conditions corresponding to the highest quartile (25%) of present day habitat suitability for each of the three species. We estimate that by year 2100, the distribution range of all three ragweed species increases towards Northern and Eastern Europe under all climate scenarios. HAR areas will expand in Europe by 27-100%, depending on species and climate scenario. Novel HAR areas will occur mostly in Denmark, France, Germany, Russia and the Baltic countries, and overlap with densely populated cities such as Paris and St. Petersburg. We conclude that areas in Europe affected by severe ragweed associated allergy problems are likely to increase substantially by year 2100, affecting millions of people. To avoid this, management strategies must be developed that restrict ragweed dispersal and establishment of new populations. Precautionary efforts should limit the spread of ragweed seeds and reduce existing populations. Only by applying cross-countries management plans can managers mitigate future health risks and economical consequences of a ragweed expansion in Europe.

AB  - This article is concerned with how the indignados social movement (also known as M15) used distinctive symbolic and visual communication strategies to articulate their collective self-representation as a movement of global citizens. Through social semiotic analysis and critical discourse analysis of textual and visual materials available in the blogs of the encampments of Lisbon, Barcelona and Madrid, the author illuminates how the indignados used the image of the occupied square as a model of dissent and democratic participation, which becomes available for global circulation. Drawing upon Hariman and Lucaites's conception of iconic image described in No Caption Needed: Iconic Photographs, Public Culture, and Liberal Democracy (2007), the author argues that the image of the occupied square is a global icon that embodies the universal value of democracy. It is suggested that if we want to understand the image of the occupied square as an embodiment of democracy across nationally-defined public spheres, we need to understand the ways in which the indignados, as political agents, devised and used particular protest images to develop and dramatize a particular vision of democracy that resonates strongly with global audiences. The article goes on to show that the image of the occupied square resonates with global audiences because its meanings tap on a repertoire of culturally shared representations of non-violent occupations of urban space in the 20th century (e.g. Tiananmen Square, the American Civil Rights Movement sit-ins) that is powerfully embedded in Western public memory.

AB  - The result of a breakage of a buried water pipe is the water movement in soil, which can cause that fine soil particles are washed out from the solid matrix and transported through pores (suffosion process). It is widely known that the most hazardous suffosion effects in urban areas relate to water-engineering structures. Holes, that can form on the soil surface by water outflowing after a failure of a buried pipeline (suffosion holes), are in different shapes and sizes. Recognition of factors influencing holes shapes and sizes would facilitate the prevention of hazardous suffosion effects connected with failures of water distribution systems. In the range of the presented article, the influence of selected parameters on the dimensions of suffosion holes was analyzed. The basis of the analysis was results of laboratory investigations of the controlled leakage from a buried water pipe. The vast majority of values of suffosion holes areas, selected according to area of leak and hydraulic pressure head in a pipe, occurred normally distributed. The tendency of average area of suffosion holes to be higher with rising pressure head in a pipe was clearly visible, but we were as yet unable to select one regression model fitting measured and calculated data better than others. Moreover, no tendency was observed between the biggest probable area of suffosion hole and pressure head in a pipe.

AB  - Dealing with the consequences of lowered groundwater levels and consequent untreated timber pile deterioration in Boston's Back Bay is not uncommon. Urban sprawl in this area in the late 1800s and early 1900s was made possible through land reclamation, filling in the remnants of the old bay. Untreated timber piles were often used as the foundation of choice in these conditions. Unfortunately, urban construction also resulted in decreased groundwater levels as a result of underground construction, leaking utilities, and leaking basements. The Mother Church (TMC), located on The First Church of Christ, Scientist (TFCCS) campus, is a historic landmark in downtown Boston supported on hundreds of untreated timber piles, and has long been implementing a system of movement and groundwater monitoring to identify any areas at risk of timber pile deterioration. In particular, the surveys indicated that the bell tower of The Original Mother Church (TOMC) was at a high risk of having deteriorated timber piles, and test pit investigations confirmed this. To mitigate future settlements, and extend the service life of the structure, we designed and implemented a foundation underpinning and repair scheme consisting of two phases: underpinning of the main tower with steel needle beams and pre-loaded micropiles, and cut-and-post underpinning in the remaining areas of the TOMC. The design and construction of the foundation underpinning had to accommodate for highly congested and restricted access areas, maintain the integrity of the unreinforced masonry tower structure during the load transfer process, incorporate micropiles needled through the forest of timber piles below the tower, and provide for a system with minimal future settlement and a service life in the order of 500 years. The project was completed successfully and on schedule, with minimal adjustments to the contract plan. Follow up movement monitoring surveys shows no additional movement of the TOMC bell tower has occurred.

AB  - Installing the through-movement waiting area (TWA) at the signalized intersections has seen the gradual popularity in the metropolitan cities in China. The traffic design allows the through vehicles to enter the waiting area prior to its green phase and wait for the through green time. Several studies have demonstrated that installing the TWA could improve the operational efficiency of the intersections. However, there is no study specifically conducted to assess the safety performance of the intersections with TWA. The paper implements the traffic conflict technique and ordered probit model to compare the scenarios of intersections with and without TWA, and identifies the significant factors contributing to the severity levels of conflicts occurring at TWA. Results show that: (1) the employment of TWA increases the severity of left-turn crossing conflicts, which has a negative impact on the intersection safety; (2) driving beyond the TWA, vehicle type on the adjacent-right lane, left-turn vehicles entering left-turn waiting area at the inappropriate moment, and the lane position of the through vehicles are the significant factors attributing to the severity of left-turn crossing conflict; and (3) the trailing vehicle type and the lane width of TWA affect the severity of the lane-changing conflict. The findings serve to improve the safety design and operational management of TWA. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Along with the improvement of living quality, indoor thermal comfort has been drawing increasing attentions. In this paper, a comparison between South Europe, North America and Asia on winter indoor thermal environments, occupants' clothing insulations and their thermal sensations was conducted. The compared regions all locate in similar latitude range of temperate climate zone (northern latitude 39 degrees 54'-53 degrees 31'). Field study data representing 10 cities chosen from ASHRAE RP-884, SCATs and China thermal comfort databases were used for the comparative study. It was observed that the indoor operative temperature and relative humidity varied from regions. European and North American cities had higher temperature while temperature of Chinese cities was the lowest. Among the three regions, indoor environments in Europe and China met well with the comfort requirements in their own regional or national standard, while North America had the highest ratio of matching the comfort zones no matter in which standard. Most of the off-comfort-zone conditions in Europe were due to overheating, contrary to those in China were mainly overcooling. Clothing insulation of Chinese was the highest and had a wider range. The winter neutral temperature for Europe, North America and China were 23.4, 22.7 and 21.7 degrees C respectively. A comparison between TSV and PMV was made and obvious deviation features were discovered. Europeans tend to feel colder than predicted when indoor temperature is out of the neutral zone. Chinese TSVs were closer to neutral than they were predicted by PMV, while North Americans showed an opposite result. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Kale-i Tavas (Tabae) which is an ancient settlement was established on a hill. At the top of the geological units horizontally layered lacustrine limestone and under gravel, sand and clay units located. There is an angular unconformity between two geological units. Geological units are fractured. Tabae, was abandoned due to landslides and rock falls in 1954. Since the historical period, man made water retaining structures (cisterns, wells, underground openings, galleries etc.) are available to collect The effects of fractures, water, and earthquake have been investigated on the mass movements. The wells, cisterns, lithological units, and fractures that are detected in the area, were transferred to 1/2000 scale map. Denizli city and vicinity has the 1st degree earthquake risk zone. In the region, many destructive earthquakes have occurred. Rock and soil samples were taken for experimentation in the laboratory. In the dry state the density of rock samples: 23.3-24.4 kN/m(3) and uniaxial compressive strength: between 12-25 MPa; In the wet state the density of rock samples. 23.7-25.6 kN/m(3) and uniaxial compressive strength: 5-12 MPa values ranged from. Freezing of the water filled into the fractures, earthquake, increase of pore water pressure, and decreasing cohesion due to moisture etc. are major factors accelerating the mass movement In experiments conducted in silty clayey sand cohesion 16-25 kPa; friction angle varies between 18-20 degrees When all the results evaluated together; water retaining structures and fractures have accelerated occurring to the mass movements.

AB  - We assessed potential economic losses and transmission to residential houses from wildland fires in a rural area of central Navarra (Spain). Expected losses were quantified at the individual structure level (n = 306) in 14 rural communities by combining fire model predictions of burn probability and fire intensity with susceptibility functions derived from expert judgement. Fire exposure was estimated by simulating 50,000 fire events that replicated extreme (97th percentile) historical fire weather conditions. Spatial ignition probabilities were used in the simulations to account for non-random ignitions, and were estimated from a fire occurrence model generated with an artificial neural network. The results showed that ignition probability explained most of spatial variation in risk, with economic value of structures having only a minor effect. Average expected loss to residential houses from a single wildfire event in the study area was 7955(sic), and ranged from a low of 740 to the high of 28,725(sic). Major fire flow-paths were analyzed to understand fire transmission from surrounding municipalities and showed that incoming fires from the north exhibited strong pathways into the core of the study area, and fires spreading from the south had the highest likelihood of reaching target residential structures from the longest distances (> 5 km). Community firesheds revealed the scale of risk to communities and extended well beyond administrative boundaries. The results provided a quantitative risk assessment that can be used by insurance companies and local landscapemanagers to prioritize and allocate investments to treat wildland fuels and identify clusters of high expected loss within communities. The methodological framework can be extended to other fire-prone southern European Union countries where communities are threatened by large wildland fires.

AB  - A crucial step in adapting to urban habitat is switching to novel, often man-made, resources. Switching to a novel resource can influence the dynamics of species coexistence, particularly if it alters trade-offs in performance. While such switches are frequently documented, their influence on species coexistence has been difficult to assess because it requires knowledge of performance trade-offs in the context of both historical and novel resource use. Western and mountain bluebirds provide a unique system in which to investigate the effects of a resource switch on species coexistence because both depend on secondary nest cavities to breed and, across a large part of their range, have switched to using man-made nest boxes. Western bluebirds are less dispersive, but more aggressive, than mountain bluebirds leading to a successional pattern of species replacement in many nest box populations; however, there is evidence of continued coexistence in natural post-fire habitat. Nest boxes differ from natural cavities in both distribution, which may affect the dynamics of interference competition between the species, and thermal conductance, which may impact competition by altering survival of ectothermic young. Here, we use a combination of experimental manipulations of nest box density and more than a decade of fitness and incubation temperature data to investigate whether altered resource distribution or thermal environment best explain patterns of species replacement in nest box populations. In both species, we found that females breeding in nest boxes were unable to maintain normal incubation temperatures during inclement weather and experienced similar offspring mortality patterns. Moreover, climatic variation across populations did not predict species' relative abundance. Instead, experimental manipulation of nest box density showed that mountain bluebirds persisted longer when nest boxes were distributed farther apart, suggesting that nest box distribution may be a key factor in understanding how human-created habitat impacts coexistence of bluebird species. These results emphasize that knowledge of species interactions in the historical habitat is crucial to understanding population dynamics as species transition to novel, man-made habitat.

AB  - Invasive and over-abundant predators pose a major threat to biodiversity and often benefit from human activities. Effective management requires understanding predator use of human-modified habitats ( including resource subsidies and disturbed environments), and individual variation within populations. We investigated selection for human-modified habitats by invasive red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, within two predominantly forested Australian landscapes. We predicted that foxes would select for human-modified habitats in their range locations and fine-scale movements, but that selection would vary between individuals. We GPS-tracked 19 foxes for 17-166 days; ranges covered 33 to >2500 ha. Approximately half the foxes selected for human-modified habitats at the range scale, with some 'commuting' more than five kilometres to farmland or townships at night. Two foxes used burnt forest intensively after a prescribed fire. In their fine-scale nocturnal movements, most foxes selected for human-modified habitats such as reservoirs, forest edges and roads, but there was considerable individual variation. Native fauna in fragmented and disturbed habitats are likely to be exposed to high rates of fox predation, and anthropogenic food resources may subsidise fox populations within the forest interior. Coordinating fox control across land-tenures, targeting specific landscape features, and limiting fox access to anthropogenic resources will be important for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - New state-subsidised 'RDP' housing in South Africa aims to provide former informally-housed residents with a better quality of life, stronger community and decreased levels of crime. Despite the state's ambitions, this process is highly contradictory, increases in safety occurring alongside rising incivilities and tensions. This paper contributes to an emerging set of debates on the socio-political outcomes of state-led housing interventions in the global South, through an illustration of the limitations of efforts to produce 'safe neighbourhoods' in contexts of high unemployment alongside high levels of violence. The conceptual framing of 'Southern Criminology' (Carrington et al., 2015), centres the significance of histories of colonial and post-colonial violence, inequality, hybrid governance and justice practices, as well as informal living, and is employed to analyse recently housed residents' experiences of crime and safety in South Africa, in a north eThekwini settlement, Hammond's Farm. Recognising these 'Southern' factors, the paper argues that movement into new formal housing, is typified by significant material changes at the home and neighbourhood scale which foster privacy and safety, formalised governance practices and (partial) improvements in policing services. These occur in conjunction with access to new leisure activities including alcohol consumption and 'township life' which alongside ongoing poverty foster urban incivilities. A 'Southern Criminology' perspective frames concluding questions about the nature of crime in contexts of urban change, which are persistently shaped by inequality and wider historical and structural factors, challenging the state's aspirations to achieve crime reduction through housing.

AB  - China's tremendous economic growth in the past three decades has resulted in a number of environmental problems, including the deterioration of air quality. In particular, fine particulate matter (PM) has received increasing attention from scientists, governmental agencies, and the public due to its adverse impacts on human health. Monitoring the spatiotemporal patterns of air pollution is important for understanding its transport mechanisms and making effective environmental policies. The main goal of this study, therefore, was to quantify the spatial patterns and movement of air pollution in China at annual, daily, and hourly scales, so that the underlying drivers could be better understood. We used remote sensing data and landscape metrics together to capture spatiotemporal signatures of air pollution. Our results show that, at the annual scale, PM2.5 concentrations in China increased gradually from 1999 to 2011, with the highest concentrations occurring in the North China Plain as well as the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin. The total population affected by air pollution was about 975 million in 2010 (about 70% of China's population). Our more detailed analysis on daily and hourly scale further revealed that a heavy air pollution event occurred, expanded, aggregated, and finally dissipated over Northern China during Oct. 6-12, 2014, suggesting that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region a center of severe pollution. Crop stalks burning in agricultural areas in this region seemed to be one of the leading drivers, along with coal burning and transportation emissions. Our study demonstrates that spatial pattern analysis with landscape metrics is effective for analyzing source-sink dynamics of air pollution and its potential drivers. Our findings of major source areas and movement trajectories should be useful for making air pollution control policies to improve China's air quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article proposes an alternative method to Markovian approaches through the housing systems analysis (ASHA) model. Its objective is to simulate the impact of the housing stock on population redistribution at a given scale and duration, by modelling the processes whereby residential mobilities are linked, initiated either by a change in the housing stock, or by a movement of housing releases that does not lead to a dwelling being occupied within the study area. The model takes into account the mobilities specific to each household category, in terms - for example - of social position, age, size or the dwelling occupied. It provides information on trends in the population structures of the different housing types brought about by vacancies-reoccupancies. The article begins by describing the model's theoretical foundations (filtering process and housing vacancy chains) and conception. It then goes on to present, through the example of the city of Lille (Nord, France), a method of data classification that allows comparative analysis suited to the application of the ASHA model. Next, it illustrates the model's analytical scope and the way it can be used to understand the organisation of a housing system. Finally, drawing on a number of examples (family accommodation, gentrification, housing programmes), it sets out the model's operational utility and the way local managers can use it to understand and anticipate the impact of housing policy on the urban population.

TI  - Efficient Mining of Regional Movement Patterns in Semantic Trajectories
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Semantic trajectory pattern mining is becoming more and more important with the rapidly growing volumes of semantically rich trajectory data. Extracting sequential patterns in semantic trajectories plays a key role in understanding semantic behaviour of human movement, which can widely be used in many applications such as location-based advertising, road capacity optimisation, and urban planning. However, most of existing works on semantic trajectory pattern mining focus on the entire spatial area, leading to missing some locally significant patterns within a region. Based on this motivation, this paper studies a regional semantic trajectory pattern mining problem, aiming at identifying all the regional sequential patterns in semantic trajectories. Specifically, we propose a new density scheme to quantify the frequency of a particular pattern in space, and thereby formulate a new mining problem of finding all the regions in which such a pattern densely occurs. For the proposed problem, we develop an efficient mining algorithm, called RegMiner (Regional Semantic Trajectory Pattern Miner), which effectively reveals movement patterns that are locally frequent in such a region but not necessarily dominant in the entire space. Our empirical study using real trajectory data shows that RegMiner finds many interesting local patterns that are hard to find by a state-of-the-art global pattern mining scheme, and it also runs several orders of magnitude faster than the global pattern mining algorithm.

AB  - This paper uses the concept of viscosity to highlight how structural impediments to movement affect not only populations and individuals characterised by low (or no) mobility but also highly mobile groups. Using the cyclo' riding paratransit workers of Phnom Penh as a lens, it is suggested here that groups of this sort are trapped in high-mobility cycles by a combination of structural factors and the discourse of their livelihoods. Specifically, cyclo riders are bound to their livelihoods by three overlapping forces: the evolution of Cambodia's paratransit system during the past 20years leading to diminishing demand for their services; shifts in agricultural production practices; and the changing narrative meaning of the occupation in the eyes of its customers. By combining a migration systems perspective with insights from previous work on the cultural discourse of mobility, it is argued here that this combination of pressures impels cyclo riders movement - and prevents its cessation - in such a way as to constitute the components of a circular, or mobile, viscosity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and discuss the conceptions of pharmaceutical services in Brazilian Primary Health Care, according to different subjects.
   METHODS: This study is part of the Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utilizacao e Promocao do Uso Racional de Medicamentos - Servicos, 2015 (PNAUM - National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines - Services, 2015), which is composed of an information survey in a representative sample of cities, stratified according to Brazilian regions, and a subsample of primary health care services. Municipal secretaries of health, those responsible for pharmaceutical services, and those responsible for medicine delivery in pharmacies/dispensing units of the selected services were interviewed. The questionnaires included one question about the understanding of the interviewee regarding pharmaceutical services. The content analysis technique was used to apprehend, in the statements, the meanings attributed to pharmaceutical services, which were subsequently classified into categories according to their main conceptions.
   RESULTS: Among the wide diversity of conceptions on pharmaceutical services (PS), we highlight the ones focused on 1) logistic control of medicines with activities concerning guidance or information on their use and 2) guidance or information to users on the use of medicine. The findings reveal a shifting tendency from a medicine-focused conception to one that considers the users and their needs as the final recipient of these actions. However, the lack of references to conceptions regarding care management and integrality point out the slowness of this change; after all, this is a social and historical process that comprises the production of meanings that transcend legal, logistic, and technical arrangements in pharmaceutical services.
   CONCLUSIONS: The diversity of conceptions expresses the several meanings attributed to pharmaceutical services; we also identified, in their reorientation process, a movement that reflects a gradual shift in the technical paradigm, from the focus on medicine logistics to a user-oriented approach of health services.

AB  - The polyphagous shot hole borer and Kuroshio shot hole borer, two members of the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), are invasive ambrosia beetles that harbor distinct species of Fusarium fungal symbionts. Together with the damage caused by gallery construction, these two phytopathogenic Fusarium species are responsible for the emerging tree disease Fusarium dieback, which affects over 50 common tree species in Southern California. Host trees suffer branch dieback as the xylem is blocked by invading beetles and fungi, forcing the costly removal of dead and dying trees in urban areas. The beetles are also threatening natural riparian habitats, and avocado is susceptible to Fusarium dieback as well, resulting in damage to the avocado industries in California and Israel. Currently there are no adequate control mechanisms for shot hole borers. This paper summarizes efforts to find a suitable lure to monitor shot hole borer invasions and dispersal. Field trials were conducted in two counties in Southern California over a span of two years. We find that the chemical quercivorol is highly attractive to these beetles, and perform subsequent field experiments attempting to optimize this lure. We also explore other methods of increasing trap catch and effects of other potential attractants, as well as the deterrents verbenone and piperitone.

AB  - Extreme precipitation events that occurred between March 24 and March 26 of 2015 in the region of the Atacama Desert (26-29 degrees S) left around 30000 victims, being one of the biggest events over the past 50 years, with total a cost of reconstruction of about 1.5 billion dollars. The mudflows which increased during the flashflood inundated much of the city of Copiapo and Tierra Amarilla. This manuscript aims to model the mudflow of March 2015 in the Rio Copiapo, specifically in the towns of Copiapo and Tierra Amarilla. The modeling process is performed using the Rapid Mass Movement Simulation Model (RAMMS) that allows modeling the dynamics of the mudflow in two dimensions, only using the topographic features of the modeling domain. Calibration of the model was carried out successfully using data from inundation heights captured around the city after the 2015 event. A detailed analysis of the hydrometeorological event is carried out using satellite images obtained from Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), and pluviometric and hydrographic data available in the Copiapo River basin. The simulation of the flood is reproduced with maps of inundation heights associated with two modeling scenarios. The maximum flood heights are ultimately used for developing risk maps at both sites. According to our results, the RAMMS model is an appropriate tool for modeling mudflow and mapping flood risk to improve hydrological risk management in arid and semiarid basins of Chile.

AB  - The 1755 earthquake of November 1, also called the Lisbon Earthquake for being the main city that suffered its multiple effects: earthquake, tsunami and fire. However, the affected area was very extensive, could be estimated at ten million square kilometres. The movement of the soil caused much damage in large parts of Spain, Portugal and Morocco, resulting in significant economic and social costs. The earthquake, with marine epicenter, also generated a noticeable alteration of the sea whose waves swept the Atlantic coasts of the Peninsula and North Africa. Also, as with large earthquakes (8,5 Mw, Martinez Solares, 2001), most of the hydrogeological effects that can be produce in nature, from cracks in the field to liquefaction, also occurred.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to characterize the geological setting of tin-bearing mineralization at the Bou El Jaj (BLJ) sector, located in the NE termination of the Moroccan Central Massif, South of Meknes city, along the NE-SW-striking shear zone. The main tin mineralization corresponds to a NNE-SSW altered corridor of tourmaline, about 10 to 12 km long, from BLJ to Achmmach mount. The geological structures are affected by three ductile deformation phases D1, (E-W shortening), D2 (NW-SE shortening), and D3 (N-S shortening), overprinting folds, and one brittle deformation event D4 (NW-SE shortening), which was synchronous with alteration and mineralization. The tourmaline-altered sediments occur in two parallel veins, about 2.5 km long and 200 m wide for each one, and are controlled by structures such as bedding, main cleavage, thrusts, and joints. Tin mineralization as cassiterite is always associated with tourmaline alteration and is controlled by the different structures.

AB  - Terrain surface displacements at a site can be induced by more than one geological process. In this work, we use advanced differential interferometry SAR (A-DInSAR) to measure ground deformation in Arcos de la Frontera (SW Spain), where severe damages related to landslide activity and subsidence have occurred in recent years. The damages are concentrated in two residential neighborhoods constructed between 2001 and 2006. One of the neighborhoods, called La Verbena, is located at the head of an active retrogressive landslide that has an extension of around 0.17 x 10(6) m(2) and developed in weathered clayey soils. Landslide motion has caused building deterioration since they were constructed. After a heavy rainfall period in winter 2009-2010, the movement was accelerated, worsening the situation. The other neighborhood, Pueblos Blancos, was built over a poorly compacted artificial filling undergoing a spatially variable consolidation process which has also led to severe damage to buildings. For both cases, a short set of C-band data from the "ENVISAT 2010+" project has been used to monitor surface displacement for the period spanning April 2011-January 2012. In this work we characterize the mechanism of both ground deformation processes using in situ and remote sensing techniques along with a detailed geological interpretation and urban damage distribution.

AB  - Comprehensive studies on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) within an urban river are urgently needed to carry out strategies to limit their contamination and dispersal. Here, we analyzed 16 PAH occurrehces in water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment monthly for a year in the Maozhou River mainstream (Shenzhen, South China). Monthly rainfall positively correlated with both total PAH concentrations in filtered water (water PAHs) and SPM. Sediment PAH concentration increased from the river source to estuary. Compared to the earlier record, the sediment PAHs decreased at altnost all sites due to the high-molecular-weight PAH (>= 4 rings; especially the 4-ring PAH) degradation, except the estuary site that accumulated more low-molecular weight PAHs (<4 rings). Results suggest that the water and SPM PAHs had similar and recent sources (e.g., rainfall and storm runoff) and actively exchanged with each other. The sediment PAM had relatively different and complicated sources (fossil fuel combustion: 44.0%; oil pollution: 28.4%; biomass birrning: 27.6%), and showed a longterm accumulation effect and increasingly weaker source-sink relation with both water and SPM PAHs from river source to estuary. This study highlights a disconnection in the source and migration mechanism between the water body (including water and SPM) and sediment PAHs.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Developers in urban areas have a duty to undertake responsible approaches in evaluation, assessment, design, and construction procedures that minimize risk of damage to adjacent structures. This risk often falls on the various project participants, including owners, designers, contractors, and consultants. Opportunities to minimize such risk can occur at various stages during the design and construction of a project. This paper evaluates the various forensic opinions of damage to a twostory, one hundred-year-old office building that experienced significant foundation movement and structure damages during construction of an adjacent multi-story hotel project. It also chronicles numerous missed opportunities to either evaluate or recognize damage potential by various project parties and itemizes steps to aid those involved in similar future projects.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyzed the variability of the ambient particulates mass concentration in an area occupied by rural development. The analysis applied daily and hourly PM2.5 and PM10 levels. Data were derived on the basis of measurement results with the application of stationary gravimetric samplers and optical dust meter. The obtained data were compared with the results from the urban air quality monitoring network in Opole. Principal Component Analysis was used for data analysis. Research hypotheses were checked using U Mann-Whitney. It was indicated that during the smog episodes, the ratio of the inhalable dust fraction in the rural aerosol is greater than for the case of the urban aerosol. It was established that the principal meteorological factors affecting the local air quality. Air temperature, atmospheric pressure, movement of air masses and occurrence of precipitation are the most important. It was demonstrated that the during the temperature inversion phenomenon, the values of the hourly and daily mass concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 are very improper. The decrease of the PM's concentration to a safe level is principally relative to the occurrence of wind and precipitation.

AB  - Today is the world of moves with faster speed and reduced time. With the increase in population, there has been a sudden increase in the amount of vehicular traffic. These increased number of vehicles around us causes huge traffic jams which produces a large delay in day to day life. Also there are situations where in quick movement of emergency (priority) vehicles like fire truck, ambulances, etc. is needed. This event fails to occur in the time of need, due to the traffic jams caused by unorganized traffic and the unwanted movement of vehicles in the path of priority vehicle. In a way to avoid this in the route of emergency vehicles, use of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) is the best possible solution. It is an effective way to communicate between the priority vehicle and other vehicles. A VANET based scenario is proposed in this paper, wherein the routing of data packets from V2V (priority vehicle to other) is being done with the multi-hop routing protocol. The considered VANET scenario is simulated using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and NS2. The performance parameters as related with the used protocol are also evaluated.

AB  - Vehicular wash-off introduces toxic heavy metals into riverine environments, but the delivery patterns of such contaminants are normally difficult to observe. This study examines the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in metal loading of riverbed sediments at two river fords in the Mill Creek Watershed located in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Riverbed sediment samples were collected over the course of the 2015 driving season (April to December) upstream and downstream of the two fords, which greatly differ in traffic density, and analyzed for their trace metal concentrations (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) and percent particulate organic carbon (%POC). Overall, metal concentrations were in the upper range of literature values for road-derived sediments. Comparing the sites, the more heavily trafficked ford had significantly higher concentrations, confirming the role of traffic density on metal accumulation. Highly enriched concentrations of Cu and Zn coupled with diagnostic metal:Cu ratios points to the strong influence of brake lining dust. While an increase in metal concentration was observed over the driving season, the highly variable spatial and temporal signal suggests other factors such as local geomorphological and hydrological conditions also play a role in metal accumulation and dispersal. Metal concentrations in excess of levels known to impact aquatic ecosystems, coupled with strong correlations between metal concentrations and the %POC content of the sediments, suggest vehicular-derived metals may play a role in the historically observed decrease in macroinvertebrate diversity in the watershed. These findings add to a growing body of literature highlighting the potential for vehicular and road sourced metals to persist and potentially impact riverine environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Four ash species are native to Russia (Fraxinus excelsior, F. angustifolia, F. chinensis, F. mandshurica) while F. pennsylvanica was introduced from North America. Ash forests cover 666 300 ha (0.1% of total forest area of Russia) and constitute a volume of 77.91 mln m(3). Ash is widely used in the greening of populated places, around fields and along inter-city roads. We review the current situation with two recent invaders - ash dieback fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus (Ascomycota) and emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera). Hymenoscyphus fraxineus was likely accidentally introduced from Asia to Western Europe, expanded its range eastward and by 2014 reached Moscow, whereas A. planipennis was accidentally introduced from Asia to Moscow Region, expanded its range in all directions but most noticeably southwards. By 2012, A. planipennis reached Smolensk Region bordering Belarus, and by 2013, Voronezh Region bordering Ukraine. At least between Belarus and Moscow city, the ranges of invaders overlap. Both species are a threat to the native as well as introduced ash in Europe. We list known records of two invaders in Russia (as of 2016) and for A. planipennis also review food plants, seasonal cycle, dispersal, parasitoids and susceptibility of different ash species. We analyze the synergetic effect of two invaders on ash in the area of overlapped ranges and potential losses of biological diversity associated with ash decline and conclude that the future of ash in Europe is precarious. The following directions of actions in Eurasia are proposed: (1) studies of resistance mechanisms to both agents in Asian ash species (first of all, F. chinensis and F. mandshurica) and hybrids between Asian and European or North-American ash species, (2) studies on selection of resistant ash forms and hybrids (to both agents), (3) controlled introduction of resistant Asian ash species, (4) slowing down of expansions of A. planipennis to Western Europe and H. fraxineus within Russia, (5) studies of natural control agents, (6) monitoring of invasions and sanitary condition of ash, and (7) studies on synergetic effect of H. fraxineus and A. planipennis on ash.

AB  - The hurried footsteps of the people who follow toward downtown Rio, the movement of cars and millions of collectives in the South Zone corridor or access the North Zone does not allow us to imagine the past of the Leopoldina region, so familiar to all in Rio de Janeiro... Until about 150 years ago, the region we call Leopoldina was a marshland partially grounded where feathered and noble noblemen carriages followed towards the Sao Cristovao Palace where they sought to kiss the hand of the king or emperor or do any request. Being a visceral crossroads of the city of Rio de Janeiro, the land of Leopoldina preserved valuable information about the archaeological past of the region that no one ever thought that could be revealed after so long forgotten. The land goes from Francisco Bicalho to Ceara Street and across the Flag Square to the Francisco Eugenio Street and the high walls that surround the Leopoldina helped preserve archaeological record that only recently were rescued by a multidisciplinary team of archaeologists, historians and researchers hired by the company Terra Brasilis Archaeology, under the patronage of CL4S Consortium Line 4 South of Metro Rio de Janeiro and operational support of the Institute of Historical Research and Archaeology of Rio de Janeiro. The team, which came to have 39 people engaged in researching and preserving the vestiges of the past from the perspective of the future interests because, under the shade of one of the finest soil excavation equipment that technology can produce: punch TBM (which was in Brazil dubbed Tatuzao) found an archaeological site of gigantic proportions and reveals much of the past of the region and the city's education as we know it today. At that location a partial excavation of the entire area and excavated areas were found more than 220 thousand items in just four months of systematic work was performed (between March and August 2013). The field archeology begins at about 30 cm from the surface and deepens to about 2.80 and predicting the future is to collect over 2 million artifacts. In these layers dishwasher parts, glass, porcelain, leather and even gold pieces that show unusual details of the society's elite daily in Rio de Janeiro from centuries past. The most amazing is that a significant part of the collection was found intact. The chronology of these artifacts is especially the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but we also find pieces of the XVII, XVI. And as a multicomponent archaeological site, in addition to the remnants of the Slaughterhouse Imperial city, we find indigenous material of the Tupi-Guarani phase (probably associated with Arariboia tribe that occupied the vicinity) and surprisingly were found archaeological material of a Sambaqui that existed nearby and the result of relocation of soil, which occurred in the region of Saint Kitts in the process of planning the region.

AB  - Emerging sensing technologies such as probe vehicles equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) devices on board provide us real-time vehicle trajectories. They are helpful for the understanding of the cases that are significant but difficult to observe because of the infrequency, such as gridlock networks. On the premise of this type of emerging technology, this paper propose a sequential route choice model that describes route choice behavior, both in ordinary networks, where drivers acquire spatial knowledge of networks through their experiences, and in extraordinary networks, which are situations that drivers rarely experience, and applicable to real-time traffic simulations. In extraordinary networks, drivers do not have any experience or appropriate information. In such a context, drivers have little spatial knowledge of networks and choose routes based on dynamic decision making, which is sequential and somewhat forward looking. In order to model these decision-making dynamics, we propose a discounted recursive logit model, which is a sequential route choice model with the discount factor of expected future utility. Through illustrative examples, we show that the discount factor reflects drivers' decision making dynamics, and myopic decisions can confound the network congestion level. We also estimate the parameters of the proposed model using a probe taxis' trajectory data collected on March 4, 2011 and on March 11, 2011, when the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred in the Tokyo Metropolitan. area. The results show that the discount factor has a lower value in gridlock networks than in ordinary networks.

AB  - In Hong Kong, rain-induced shallow slope failures are recognized as one of the most catastrophic hazards due to Hong Kong's hilly terrain and frequent heavy storms. Due to climate changes, extreme storms are expected to be more frequent and intense in the future. The prediction of shallow slope failures under extreme storms is therefore essential. This study aims at simulating likely shallow slope failures on western Hong Kong Island under extreme storms. The terrain and slopes are discretized into a grid of cells on a geographical information system. Then, the pore-water pressure regime in the ground is analyzed through an infiltration analysis. Next, the slope stability and debris movement are assessed using a well-established model, which has been validated with landslides triggered in two past storm events. Finally, the shallow slope failures under three extreme storms at 44, 65, and 85% of the probable maximum precipitation are simulated. Under such extreme storms, more than 300 major slope failures may occur, occupying 0.5-1.7% of the natural terrain area. Some of the simulated movement traces and deposition locations are close to the urban area, calling for new strategies for landslide risk management.

AB  - On Saturday July 23, 2011, Guillermo, a young student from Lleida (Catalonia, Spain), who had been camping out since the beginning of the 15M movement, arrived in Madrid after walking over 450kilometers, in one of the six columns that had crossed the Iberian Peninsula during the previous weeks. The Popular Indignant March had been conceived as an original way of rounding off the occupations of hundreds of squares throughout Spain, their objective being Puerta del Sol in Madrid, the first square to be occupied. On the way, which was from the urban periphery toward the center, passing by the rural Spanish plateau, the population's claims and complaints were to be gathered and taken to the agora of the participatory democracy. The experience of having groups of people walking from different origins with a common destination evokes the classical anthropological experience of the religious pilgrimage. Spain's best example is the Camino de Santiago, which has attracted thousands of pilgrims from all over Europe since the Middle Ages. When we ask Guillermo about this parallelism, he denies any spiritual content, although his account of Camino de Sol is like the fulfillment of a civic promise, the ritualization of a festive and revindicative appropriation of the territory, the colonization of a terra incognita that they had taken over two months before, on 15M, when the hashtag #spanishrevolution became a trending topic within the social networks. The article relates this experience to the narratives of the 15M movement and to the situation of young people in Spain in times of crisis.

AB  - The dune field that stretches NE of Buenos Aires coast has been altered by urbanization since the early 20th century,with a maximum urban growth reached in 1970 that generated important changes in natural dune landforms and vegetation cover. The introduction of some exotic shrub and tree species has increased dune-field stabilization and changed wind transport rates on it and toward the beach. This lack of aeolian sediment supply to the beach caused subsaturation in marine littoral drift currents, increasing beach erosion along several resorts located along the northern Buenos Aires coast. Additionally, some native herbaceous species, at some time dominant in the past in dune communities, have been replaced by these foreign woody plants, altering consequently the structure and composition of the original plant communities and, indirectly, dune growth, activity, and mobility. The purpose of this paper is to study the original geomorphology and some basic attributes of the natural plant communities that characterize the coastal dune field to establish the relationship between the original aeolian dynamics and man-induced changes in the evolution of the coastal system. This study documents dune morphology and salient aspects of the associated vegetation (floristic composition, abundance of each species) over an original dune field and discusses the impacts of afforestations accompanying dune-field real-state developments. In the future, coastal management should regulate the expansion of forested areas in the dune barriers and preserve natural dune fields as potential reserves of sand for beach equilibrium.

AB  - Background: While alcohol-related harm is reportedly greater on weekend evenings, research investigating trends in the intoxication levels of patrons and factors that increase risk of harm over the night is lacking. Objectives: The aim was to observe trends over the course of the night for patron demographics, venue characteristics and patron intoxication. Methods: Observations of licensed venues and patrons in night-time entertainment districts of five Australian cities were conducted. In total, 798 observations occurred between 9 pm and 2 am on Friday and Saturday nights across 61 unique bars, nightclubs, and pubs. Patron characteristics such as gender and percentage of patrons under 25 years of age were estimated. Measures of venue characteristics included number of patrons, percentage venue capacity, ease of patron movement, bar crowding, and time to service. Measures of intoxication included the percentage of patrons showing any signs of alcohol intoxication, percentage of patrons too intoxicated to remain in the venue, overall level of intoxication, and percentage of patrons showing signs of drug use. Results: Patron capacity increased across the night, peaking at 11 pm in bars, and 1 am in nightclubs. Patron intoxication measures increased for all venue types across the night. Patrons showed more signs of drug use in nightclubs than other venue types. Conclusions: Increasing intoxication and decreasing patron numbers later in the night provides support for restricted trading hours and improved responsible service of alcohol policies. Specific venue types should be targeted to reduce drug use in the night-time economy.

AB  - The consumer price index (CPI) contains rich information of the consumer market, in order to characterize the essential characteristics of the consumer market of China, a novel method by using complex network theory is proposed to visualizing the evolution and transformation characteristics of correlated modes among the regional consumer markets. CPI data of 31 provinces and cities of China are selected as sample data. Underlying dynamics of time-evolving correlation networks are revealed. A formula to measure the systemic risk in the consumer market is designed. And the correlation modes transmission network of the regional consumer markets is obtained. Numerical simulations show that the consumer market network has co-movement, group-occurring and small-word property. Different regions played different roles in the consumer market of China. The risk in the consumer market presented a decreasing trend from April 2013 but remain at the high level. Different from the stochastic system, the consumer market of China both has the short-range correlation and the long-range correlation. The strength of correlation modes transmission network basically satisfies a power-law distribution. The correlation modes are transferred into each other conveniently, although the consumer market system is highly complicated. The transformation of the correlation patterns of the regional consumer markets mainly revolves around three core correlation modes and each transformation needs to undergo 4 non-core modes.

AB  - The last ten years researching street art as a large-scale socio-cultural phenomena has increased many times over. But until now, researchers discuss about the nature of street art, its genesis, and even the legitimacy of the term. One of the key open issues is the question of the Genesis of street art. One of the key open questions is the question of the genesis of street art. The vast majority of researchers speak about the formation of street art from the earlier practice of graffiti. At the same time, questions about the genesis of the graffiti and the problem of continuity and separation of graffiti and street art are quite controversial. Currently, the research Convention is achieved in the understanding of the Genesis of street art, which appeared as the continuation of the development of American graffiti 1970-ies.. Most researchers agree with the concept of Baudrillard, which considers the American graffiti as a new socio-cultural phenomenon, born in the protest movement of American cities and different in their characteristics from traditional graffiti. Thus, the version of the genesis of modern American graffiti (but also grew out of his street art) from traditional graffiti is gradually replaced by scientific discourse. In addition, researchers have reached the Convention in understanding the essence of this socio-cultural phenomenon. Despite the commercialization and institutionalization of street art, most researchers consider it the essential signs of the desire to fight for the redistribution of public space, illegal occupation of urban spaces and surfaces, an open expansion and the total spread of new symbolic systems, codes and descriptive messages; the nature of the protest, free expression on political and social issues, and building dialogue with citizens (open, dialogical communication); the fragility of created objects; balancing on the verge between art and vandalism. While discussions about the specifics of street art have continued, there is a gradual transition from a simple essentialist questions about the nature of street art to a more mobile contextual logic, allowing through street art to explore the various aspects of social relationships and practices.

AB  - Earthquakes of low to intermediate magnitudes are a commonly observed feature of continental rifting and particularly in regions of Quaternary to Recent volcanism such as in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). Although the seismic hazard is estimated to be less in the Hawassa region of the MER than further north and south, a significant earthquake occurred on the 24th January 2016 in the Hawassa caldera basin and close to the Corbetti volcanic complex. The event was felt up to 100 km away and caused structural damage and public anxiety in the city of Hawassa itself. In this paper we first refine the earthquake's location using data from global network and Ethiopian network stations. The resulting location is at 7.0404 degrees N, 38.3478 degrees E and at 4.55 km depth, which suggests that the event occurred on structures associated with the caldera collapse of the Hawassa caldera in the early Pleistocene and not through volcano-tectonic processes at Corbetti. We calculate local and moment magnitudes, which are magnitude scales more appropriate at regional hypocentral distances than (mb) at four stations. This is done using a local scale (attenuation term) previously determined for the MER and spectral analysis for ML and Mw respectively and gives magnitude estimates of 4.68 and 4.29. The event indicates predominantly normal slip on a N-S striking fault structure, which suggests that slip continues to occur on Wonji faults that have exploited weaknesses inherited from the preceding caldera collapse. These results and two previous earthquakes in the Hawassa caldera of M > 5 highlight that earthquakes continue to pose a risk to structures within the caldera basin. With this in mind, it is suggested that enhanced monitoring and public outreach should be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the security constitutes the most important section of our lives. Automation of a home is an exciting field for security applications. This area has developed with new technologies like Internet of things (IoT). In IoT, each device behaves as a small part of an internet node and each node communicate and interact. Currently, security cameras are used in order to construct safety areas, cities, and homes. The camera records the images and, when a problem occurs, the problem is detected by monitoring the old record. In this study, an IoT-based system is combined with computer vision in order to detect the people. A Raspberry PI 3 card with the size of a credit card was used for this purpose. A motion is detected by the PIR sensor mounted on the Raspberry PI. PIR sensor helps to monitor and get alerts when movement is detected. Afterward, human is detected in the captured image and sends images to a Smartphone by using telegram application.

AB  - The article analyzes the political action of the Landless Rural Workers' Movement (MST) in Brazil from 1989 to 2002. The objective is to reveal analytically the particularities of the MST's nonviolent struggles for the democratic and equitable access of peasants to ownership of land since 1989; a stage characterized using violent mechanisms by the Government, at the boom of neoliberalism. It is carried out from a qualitative methodological perspective, using as techniques of data collection the Bibliographic-Documentary Review and the Content Analysis. The results allow to conclude that the MST and its leaders were criminalized and faced the violence of the police, the army and the gunmen at the service of the corporations and the large landowners. However, it was verified how the struggle of the MST is carried out through nonviolent political action and using peaceful methods, including land occupations, camps, walks, letters to politicians, public statements, mass protests, demands to the national executive, demonstrations in large cities, publications and political manifests in the media and in the Jornal dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, its own press organ.

AB  - Conflict generated by the exercise of the right do assemble have become commonplace. They are no longer restricted to the simple question of whether the occupation of public spaces by protesters cause embarrassment to the movement of vehicles or people. With the proliferation of dissatisfaction and the ease of communication between events organizers and protesters, the problems have become more complex. Problems that are exacerbated when such ideas and dissatisfaction are expressed in an urban environment, in which people mobility is hampered and the clash of interests, everyday. Know how, under what conditions, in which local, in short, which outlines the fundamental right to free expression and assembly is therefore a task not only interesting, but also urgent. The work proposes a discussion of these aspects under a legal approach, without alienating potential points of contact with other areas of knowledge.

AB  - Uplifted ultramafic rocks represent an important vector for the transfer of carbon and reducing power from the deep subsurface into the biosphere and potentially support microbial life through serpentinization. This process has a strong influence upon the production of hydrogen and methane, which can be subsequently consumed by microbial communities. The Santa Elena Ophiolite (SEO) on the northwestern Pacific coast of Costa Rica comprises similar to 250 km(2) of ultramafic rocks and mafic associations. The climatic conditions, consisting of strongly contrasting wet and dry seasons, make the SEO a unique hydrogeological setting, where water-rock reactions are enhanced by large storm events (up to 200 mm in a single storm). Previous work on hyperalkaline spring fluids collected within the SEO has identified the presence of microorganisms potentially involved in hydrogen, methane, and methanol oxidation (such as Hydrogenophaga, Methylobacterium, and Methylibium spp., respectively), as well as the presence of methanogenic Archaea (such as Methanobacterium). Similar organisms have also been documented at other serpentinizing sites, however their functions have not been confirmed. SEO's hyperalkaline springs have elevated methane concentrations, ranging from 145 to 900 mu M, in comparison to the background concentrations (< 0.3 mu M). The presence and potential activity of microorganisms involved in methane cycling in serpentinization-influenced fluids from different sites within the SEO were investigated using molecular, geochemical, and modeling approaches. These results were combined to elucidate the bioenergetically favorablemethane production and/or oxidation reactions in this tropical serpentinizing environment. The hyperalkaline springs at SEO contain a greater proportion of Archaea and methanogens than has been detected in any terrestrial serpentinizing system. Archaea involved in methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation accounted from 40 to 90% of total archaeal sequences. Genes involved in methanogenic metabolisms were detected from the metagenome of one of the alkaline springs. Methanogenic activities are likely to be facilitated by the movement of nutrients, including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), from surface water and their infiltration into serpentinizing groundwater. These data provide new insight into methane cycle in tropical serpentinizing environments.

AB  - Freeway networks are designed to provide a flexible flow of vehicles and uninterrupted routes especially in the metropolitan areas where the traffic volumes are considerably high. However; when the traffic volumes reach the highway capacity, speed differentials occur leading to phenomenon of congestion which either can be recurrent in peak hours or nonrecurrent in case of having an incident on the highway. Congestions are considered a case of matter as the freeway network performance is adversely affected in terms of reducing the speed, increasing the travel time, and increasing the vehicle emissions due to increase the fuel consumption. Also the distraction during congestion period, can increase the probability of accidents occurrence, where all drivers try to pass the congested segment of the freeway. For instance the structural solutions for congestion has become inefficient for economic, urban and environmental considerations. Thus, since 1960s the trend have been changed to control the link traffic and optimize its capacity by using coordinated and integrated surveillance and control strategies. For the recent decades ramp metering strategies are noticed to be an effective approach for controlling and managing the freeway traffic. This paper depicting a microscopic simulation based evaluation case study for local ramp metering strategy ALINEA on a segment of D-100 freeway in Istanbul using the microscopic simulator VISSIM integrated with MATLAB.

AB  - Flood is a natural disaster that can occur in a region within a country. Some things can cause flooding, for example: high rainfall, blockage of drainage, improper environmental damage, insufficient water pump capacity in flood prone areas, and so on. Flood disaster will result in the loss of an area both material and immaterial losses. Therefore, several things can be done to minimize the incidence of flooding. Surakarta region is located in the lowlands at 105m above sea level and in the city center 95m above sea level, with an area of 44.1 square km (0.14 percent of Central Java area). The highest rainfall is 560mm, while the average rainfall during the rainy day is 22 mm on that day. Land elevation in downtown is lower than suburban Surakarta, therefore it is necessary to model water drainage to know water movement in Surakarta area. Of course this system must be accompanied by accurate information, appropriate early flood handling, and good water management engineering to minimize flooding. The method used to create water channel mapping model using MASIM method approach (Material Simulation). This research modeled and observed the process through simulation. The objectives of this research are: 1) to know the result of the flooded flood model based on the assessment of the main parameters covering rainfall, water flow discharge, and regional drainage capacity, 2) identifying the distribution of potential flood inundation, 3) evaluating the existing drainage management. The discovery of this study is a new model in controlling water flow.

TI  - THE MOBILIZING VIRTUAL SPACES OF THE OCCUPIED SCHOOLS IN PORTO ALEGRE: MUTUAL SUPPORT AS THE BASIS OF COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
T2  - ETD EDUCACAO TEMATICA DIGITAL
LA  - Portuguese
KW  - Exercise of citizenship
KW  - Mutual learning
KW  - Political education
AB  - This article analyzes the movement of school occupations through virtual spaces. On the period from may to june 2016, 41 state schools were occupied by the community in the city of Porto Alegre. This movement was an act of collective defiance against the decay and depreciation of public education by the State. Forty of the occupied schools utilized Facebook as a tool of organization and cooperation with, and propagation to, society. To measure the importance of the use of social networking in these movements, data from the pages of all involved schools was collected, as well as the number and quantity of 'likes' and 'shares'. These virtual spaces have a disseminative and viral character, rapidly spreading information to their users by direct means. As such, here we find a powerful information network that Pierre Lvy would refer to as 'Collective Intelligence', where the involved subjects restructure their relations and their learning methods. In these pages, students act according to their own whims, building horizontal relations with the virtual community, that through 'shares' and interactions benefit the maintenance and growth of the occupations. The exchanges of knowledge are held together by what Piotr Kropotkin calls 'Mutual Support', networks of spontaneous cooperation that ignore barriers and geographical limits. Well beyond a simple tool of communication, these virtual spaces become devices for the organization and empowerment of a collective political intelligence, just as vital as the actions coordinated by students inside the schools.

AB  - Wuhan as a megacity of Central China was suffering from severe, particulate matter pollution according to previous observation studies, however, the mechanism behind the pollution formation especially the impact of regional chemical transport is still unclear. This study, carried out on the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS) coupled with an on-line source-tagging module, explores different roles regional transport had in two strong haze episodes over Wuhan in October 2014 and quantitatively assesses the contributions from local and regional sources to PM2.5 concentration. Validation of predictions based on observations shows modeling system good skills in reproducing key meteorological and chemical features. The first short-time haze episode occurred on 12 October under strong northerly winds, with a hourly PM2.5 peak of 180 mu g m(-3), and was found to be caused primarily by the long-range transport from the northern regions, which contributed 60.6% of the episode's PM2.5 concentration (versus a total of 32.7% from sources in and near Wuhan). The second episode lasted from the 15-20 October under stable regional large-scale synoptic conditions and weak winds, and had an hourly PM2.5 peak of 231.0 mu g m(-3). In this episode, both the long-distance transport from far regions and short-range transport from the Wuhan-cluster were the primary causes of the haze episode and account for 24.8% and 29.2% of the PM2.5 concentration respectively. Therefore, regional transport acts as a crucial driver of haze pollution over Wuhan through not only long-range transfer of pollutants, but also short-range aerosol movement under specific meteorological conditions. The present findings highlight the important role of regional transport in urban haze formation and indicate that the joint control of multi city-clusters are needed to reduce the particulate pollution level in Wuhan.

AB  - Background
   Dengue virus (DENV) transmission is spatially heterogeneous. Hence, to stratify dengue prevalence in space may be an efficacious strategy to target surveillance and control efforts in a cost-effective manner particularly in Venezuela where dengue is hyperendemic and public health resources are scarce. Here, we determine hot spots of dengue seroprevalence and the risk factors associated with these clusters using local spatial statistics and a regression modeling approach.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   From August 2010 to January 2011, a community-based cross-sectional study of 2012 individuals in 840 households was performed in high incidence neighborhoods of a dengue hyperendemic city in Venezuela. Local spatial statistics conducted at household-and blocklevel identified clusters of recent dengue seroprevalence (39 hot spot households and 9 hot spot blocks) in all neighborhoods. However, no clusters were found for past dengue seroprevalence. Clustering of infection was detected at a very small scale (20-110m) suggesting a high disease focal aggregation. Factors associated with living in a hot spot household were occupation (being a domestic worker/housewife (P = 0.002), lower socio-economic status (living in a shack (P< 0.001), sharing a household with < 7 people (P = 0.004), promoting potential vector breeding sites (storing water in containers (P = 0.024), having litter outdoors (P = 0.002) and mosquito preventive measures (such as using repellent, P = 0.011). Similarly, low socio-economic status (living in crowded conditions, P< 0.001), having an occupation of domestic worker/housewife (P = 0.012) and not using certain preventive measures against mosquitoes (P< 0.05) were directly associated with living in a hot spot block.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our findings contribute to a better comprehension of the spatial dynamics of dengue by assessing the relationship between disease clusters and their risk factors. These results can inform health authorities in the design of surveillance and control activities. Focalizing dengue control measures during epidemic and inter-epidemic periods to disease high risk zones at household and neighborhood-level may significantly reduce virus transmission in comparison to random interventions.

AB  - Occupy, the Gezi park movement, the Maidan protests, or the recent solidarity marches for Charlie Hebdo-since the uprisings of the Arab Spring, we could observe many examples of on-site protests on big squares and streets being accompanied by waves of collective action in social media. We present the design stage of an agent-based model that will allow us to explore the following questions: What role does social media play in street protests? How does social media usage influence the dynamics of collective action during street protests? Do social media affect the speed, scale, fluctuation, duration of the protest at large, and in which way? Do they impact specific crowd patterns, e.g., the development of groups within groups? The model builds on and integrates existing models of social media, protests, and crowd behavior to simulate the dynamics of street protests in an urban setting. Our central aim is to compare scenarios with intense, moderate, and no social media usage by the protesters.

AB  - This paper examines the traffic and the associated environmental impacts of traffic incidents with the use of the traffic microscopic simulation software Aimsun. The specific software simulates the movement of the individual vehicles and provides the option of simulating incidents at specific periods of time, thus constituting an appropriate simulation testbed. The study area includes a 14km section of the Thessaloniki's inner ring road. The traffic volumes used in the model are of a typical weekday and they are the outputs of a macroscopic traffic assignment model properly applied in the greater city area. Traffic counts made with the use of sensors in the city road network were input in the traffic assignment model. Different scenarios of possible traffic incidents on the inner ring road in terms of location and duration were developed and evaluated using Aimsun. The impacts of defined incidents to the performance of the ring road were examined with emphasis to the near and outer area of incident position. For the evaluation process two different time periods (25 and 50 mins) and three different demand levels (low, base-case, and high) were examined. Thus, 12 different scenarios were defined and tested with the traffic microscopic simulation software. The indicators used in the evaluation process include, among others, traffic density, mean network speed, vehicle -kilometers travelled, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions etc. Results have shown that traffic speed and delays are seriously affected when incidents occur near merging or diverging areas in the inner ring road. At the same time incident duration and traffic demand deteriorated as traffic conditions increased in values. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The thorough analytical modelling of seismic actions, of the structural system and of the foundation soil is essential for a proper dynamic analysis of a building. However, the validation of the used models should be made, whenever possible, with reference to results obtained from experimental investigations, building instrumentation and monitoring of vibrations generated by various seismic or non-seismic sources. In Romania, the permanent seismic instrumentation/monitoring of buildings is part of a special follow-up activity, performed in accordance with the P130/1999 code for the time monitoring of building behaviour and with the seismic design code, P100-2013. By using the state-of-the-art modern equipment (GeoSIG and Kinemetrics digital accelerographs) in the seismic network of the National Institute for Research and Development URBAN-INCERC, the instrumented buildings can be monitored remotely, with recorded data being sent to authorities or to research institutes in the field by a real-time data transmission system. The obtained records are processed, computing the Fourier amplitude spectra and the response spectra, and the modal parameters of buildings are determined. The paper presents some of the most important results of the institute in the field of building monitoring, focusing on the situation of some significant instrumented buildings located in different parts of the country. In addition, maps with data received from seismic stations after the occurrence of two recent Vrancea (Romania) earthquakes, showing the spatial distribution of ground accelerations, are presented, together with a comparative analysis, performed with reference to previous studies in the literature.

AB  - How have the recent real estate, mortgage and financial crises affected different countries, territories and cities? How have the different public and private stakeholders behaved and how accountable have they been for the origin and development thereof? What links are there among the local, national and global contexts in the crises? Recent geographic research ought to attempt to answer these questions, but there have, however, been few in-depth studies on the link between urbanisation, financial markets and the global crisis. The present paper analyses one of the principal causes of Spain's recent evolution: urbanisation of the territory, the start and consequences of housing bubble; our study emphasises the differential elements in relation to the crisis in other countries. We study in greater depth the municipality of Torrelodones, which constitutes a reference due to the appearance of a residents' movement opposed to the development process and which is a perfect example of the dynamics that led to the economic and social crisis. We describe in detail the lack of any strategic vision, participation or transparency in town planning decision-making, the processes by which reports and inspections were doctored, and the mechanisms of corruption of public decision-making in town planning. Finally, we analyse the concrete manner in which huge losses in mortgage markets occurred, with the collapse of the real estate bubble and the financial markets, which subsequently forced a State bailout.

AB  - Several mosquito species are capable of invading new geographic regions and exploiting niches that are similar to their natural home ranges where they may introduce, or reintroduce, pathogens. In addition to initial invasion, introduction of new genotypes into established populations may also occur. Zika virus is spreading throughout the world, posing significant health risks to human populations, particularly pregnant women and their infants. The first locally acquired case of Zika virus in the US occurred in July 2016 in Miami, Florida on the Atlantic coast; the first locally acquired case in another US county occurred in the Tampa, Florida area. Three port cities in Florida were chosen to assess the risk of import and spread of Zika virus: Mayport Naval Station, Miami, and Tampa. The bioagent transport and enviromental modeling system TIGER model and ArcGIS were used to analyze abiotic and biotic factors influencing potentially Zika-infected Aedes species, should they enter through these ports. The model was tested by overlaying documented and suspected concurrent Zika cases and comparing published high-risk areas for Zika virus. In addition to Zika hot zones being identified, output indicates surveillance and integrated mosquito management should expect larger zones. Surveillance sites at ports should be identified and prioritized for pathogen and vector control to reduce the import of mosquitoes infected with Zika virus. Low resolution maps often provide valuable suitability of the geographic expansion of organisms. Providing a higher resolution predictive map, identifying probable routes of invasion, and providing areas at high risk for initial invasion and control zones, will aid in controlling and perhaps eliminating the spread of arboviruses through mosquito vectors.

AB  - In the past few decades, numerous ultra high-rise buildings have been erected in the metropolitan areas of many cities around the world. For the related building designers, building occupants and the governments, fire safety problem is certainly a major concern, especially after the collapse of World Trade Center in the 9/11 event. That disaster makes people reconsider ultra high-rise building evacuation strategies. Of the current strategies, using elevators in ultra high-rise buildings to assist evacuation seems to be promising in improving evacuation efficiency. To quantitatively evaluate elevator assisted evacuation process, an event-driven agent-based modeling approach is proposed in the present paper. This modeling approach could capture not only the movement characteristics of stair using occupants but also the detailed elevator motion features. The combined effects of occupants' and elevators' parameters on the evacuation efficiency have been investigated. Results indicated that the model is helpful to reveal the dynamics of elevator assisted evacuation, and sometime, using elevators to move all occupants to ground safety point may not be an optimal solution.

AB  - In the Catalan context that emerged with the outbreak of the crisis in the winter of 2008, the debate on water management has become important to the point where it is a central part of the political programs that the new candidacies that emerged after the square occupations in 2011 prepared for the local council elections of 2015. This process has run altogether with the social changes that took place after May 2011, with the citizen movement known as 15M, a fact that is verified in different aspects, such as: the message, change of subjects and treatment of water; As well as an important shift of a strategy focused on non-privatization, towards a demand of the increase of the capacity of the citizens in taking decisions on water management at the municipal scope. Moving from a national and / or regional struggle to a local scale.
   This article describes those aspects that give rise to the question: What conception of the common are listed articulates the new stage of struggle for municipal water and what empirical forms adopted.

AB  - Natural landslide occurs frequently in some areas of Indonesia. Cianjur is considered as one of cities in Indonesia where natural landslide mostly taken place. Natural disaster in the form of landslide occurred in the Ciloto region on January 21, 2014, had an impact of suffering for the local inhabitants and also caused a number of victims. Based on the result of data mapping, there were 46 families or 213 people who have been victims of the landslide and soil movement. The situation faced by the victims of the disaster required an intensive and sustained treatment both from the government who were responsible for the implementation of the protection for disaster victims as well as from various elements of the community who had the capacity to do the protection. Disaster management is needed to control disasters and emergencies while providing a framework in helping people at high risk to recover from the disasters. The purpose of this study is to analyze what values on the vulnerable group for landslide disasters that can improve their psychological well-being using indigenous psychological analysis in Cianjur city, West Java, Indonesia. The research design used was a non-experimental correlation method using survey data collection methods. Data collection was conducted through in-depth interviews, participatory observation, focus group discussions and questionnaire. Data analysis method used was a simple regression. Result of this study confirmed that Religiosity had an influence on the establishment of Psychological Well-being of the landslide victims. For Cianjur people, there are some values influencing their life: ngaos, mamaos, and maenpo. In their culture, people of Cianjur are determined to uphold their misery with their relationship with God. Ngaos is reading Quran for religious activity as Muslim. In the afternoons, there is a tradition where children and adolescents go to Masjid to read Quran together. As psychosocial support, meeting people who believed in Islamic values and had the same situation caused by the landslide disaster had made their psychological well-being improved. They shared their existence as a courteousness, mannered, and ethical society in believing in God, that what happened to them is because God will. Their value of religiosity can improve their psychological well-being, so they have spirit and courage to move forward and rebuild their future. The final model of the use of psychosocial interventions in disaster management can be used elsewhere in the context of community empowerment in upgrading Psychological Well-Being to regain the spirit and passion for rising and rebuild its future.

AB  - The Campi Flegrei volcanic field (Italy) poses very high risk to the highly urbanized Neapolitan area. Eruptive history was dominated by explosive activity producing pyroclastic currents (hereon PCs; acronym for Pyroclastic Currents) ranging in scale from localized base surges to regional flows. Here we apply probabilistic numerical simulation approaches to produce PC hazard maps, based on a comprehensive spectrum of flow properties and vent locations. These maps are incorporated in a Geographic Information System (GIS) and provide all probable Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) scenarios from different source vents in the caldera, relevant for risk management planning. For each VEI scenario, we report the conditional probability for PCs (i.e., the probability for a given area to be affected by the passage of PCs in case of a PC-forming explosive event) and related dynamic pressure. Model results indicate that PCs from VEI<4 events would be confined within the Campi Flegrei caldera, PC propagation being impeded by the northern and eastern caldera walls. Conversely, PCs from VEI 4-5 events could invade a wide area beyond the northern caldera rim, as well as part of the Naples metropolitan area to the east. A major controlling factor of PC dispersal is represented by the location of the vent area. PCs from the potentially largest eruption scenarios (analogous to the similar to 15 ka, VEI 6 Neapolitan Yellow Tuff or even the similar to 39 ka, VEI 7 Campanian Ignimbrite extreme event) would affect a large part of the Campanian Plain to the north and the city of Naples to the east. Thus, in case of renewal of eruptive activity at Campi Flegrei, up to 3 million people will be potentially exposed to volcanic hazard, pointing out the urgency of an emergency plan. Considering the present level of uncertainty in forecasting the future eruption type, size and location (essentially based on statistical analysis of previous activity), we suggest that appropriate planning measures should face at least the VEI 5 reference scenario (at least 2 occurrences documented in the last 10 ka).

AB  - Izmir and its surroundings constitute an important tectonic region for the control of the Western Anatolian region. The study area is located in the western part of Izmir city and inside of Karaburun Peninsula. In the study area and its surroundings, a great amount of earthquakes occurred in both land and sea in recent years. Hence, the kinematic structures of Gulbahce fault and Uzunkuyu intrusive were examined within this study. As a first step, the mechanism and the velocities of these faults were identified using the GNSS data. Then, a stress and strain analysis of the region was performed for different depths using Coulomb software. In this study, the strain changes on vertical direction were evaluated and compared with the changes of observed gravity anomalies for the first time for the study area as distinct from the previous studies. From this integrated analysis, we retrieved the kinematic parameters and movement mechanisms of Gulbahce fault and Uzunkuyu intrusive and defined the regional stresses, the strain changes and the kinematic models of them.

AB  - Bacterial taxa shape microbial community composition and influence aquatic ecosystem dynamics. Studies on bacterial persistence in rivers have primarily focussed on microbial-source tracking as an indicator for faecal-source contamination, whereas archetypal freshwater species have received minimal attention. The present study describes the river microbial communities upstream and 3.3km downstream of a small rural town. By 16S rDNA sequencing, we report three patterns in microbial community composition, namely, persistence, loss and appearance. Persistence was observed as 46% inter-site similarity, perhaps owing to generalists that have information lengths that exceed 3.3km and are capable of adapting to system fluctuations. Loss was observed as 10% site exclusivity upstream, perhaps owing to removal processes such as predation and lysis during transport downstream. Last, appearance was observed as 44% site exclusivity downstream, indicating potential anthropogenic impacts from land run-off on bacterial community composition. High multivariate dispersion among downstream samples, as well as overall sample dissimilarity, present as microscale hotspots of discrete Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria species, indicated higher heterogeneity downstream, and therefore increased patchiness from downstream transport and inputs of bacterial genotypes. These findings suggest relativities among three fates for bacterial species of fluvial systems, persistence, loss and appearance, with each having different effects on system dynamics.

AB  - The active Irazu Volcano is the highest of several composite volcanic cones which make up the Cordillera Central in Costa Rica, close to the city of Cartago. The top of the volcano is strategic for the Country, since at the height of over 3400 m sit 84 telecommunication towers used by government agencies and several TV and radio stations, which guarantee the station coverage of more than 60 percent of the national territory. Since December 2014, a series of minor tremors, or microseisms, occurred at the Irazu and some open and deep fissures formed on the upper part of the volcano associated with formation of landslides. More research is needed to determine if these fissures are directly related to recent seismic activity. However, the landslide formation has made it necessary to relocate the towers and there is evidence of the possible destabilization of a volume of about 3.5 million cubic meters of material. In particular, if the landslide triggers in conjunction with heavy rains the movement could evolve into a huge debris flow that could affect Cartago city, similar to the debris flow disaster of December 1963. The dynamics of this potential event have been analyzed using the numerical code RASH3D. The calculated flow intensities and flow paths could be used to support hazard mapping and the design of mitigation measures. The reliability of the obtained results are a function of assumptions regarding source areas, magnitudes of possible debris flows and calibration of rheological characteristics, but also digital terrain model (DTM) quality. As to this last aspect, a systematic comparison of numerical results, DTM and air photos enabled identification of various weak points of the digital terrain model and identified potentially critical zones due to the presence of man-made structures.

AB  - Transportation networks are critical infrastructure in urban environments. Before, during and following volcanic activity, these networks can incur direct and indirect impacts, which subsequently reduces the Level-of-Service available to transportation end-users. Additionally, reductions in service can arise from management strategies including evacuation zoning, causing additional complications for transportation end-users and operators. Here, we develop metrics that incorporate Level-of-Service for transportation end-users as the key measure of vulnerability for multi-hazard volcanic impact and risk assessments.
   A hypothetical eruption scenario recently developed for the Auckland Volcanic Field, New Zealand, is applied to describe potential impacts of a small basaltic eruption on different transportation modes, namely road, rail, and activities at airports and ports. We demonstrate how the new metrics can be applied at specific locations worldwide by considering the geophysical hazard sequence and evacuation zones in this scenario, a process that was strongly informed by consultation with transportation infrastructure providers and emergency management officials. We also discuss the potential implications of modified hazard sequences (e.g. different wind profiles during the scenario, and unrest with no resulting eruption) on transportation vulnerability and population displacement.
   The vent area of the eruption scenario used in our study is located north of the Mangere Bridge suburb of Auckland. The volcanic activity in the scenario progresses from seismic unrest, through phreatomagmatic explosions generating pyroclastic surges to a magmatic phase generating a scoria cone and lava flows. We find that most physical damage to transportation networks occurs from pyroclastic surges during the initial stages of the eruption. However, the most extensive service reduction across all networks occurs-6 days prior to the eruption onset, largely attributed to the implementation of evacuation zones; these disrupt crucial north-south links through the south eastern Aucldand isthmus, and at times cause up to similar to 435,000 residents and many businesses to be displaced. Ash deposition on road and rail following tephra-producing eruptive phases causes widespread Level-of-Service reduction, and some disruption continues for >1 month following the end of the eruption until clean-up and re-entry to most evacuated zones is completed. Different tephra dispersal and deposition patterns can result in substantial variations to Level-of-Service and consequences for transportation management. Additional complexities may also arise during times of unrest with no eruption, particularly as residents are potentially displaced for longer periods of time due to extended uncertainties on potential vent location. The Level-of-Service metrics developed here effectively highlight the importance of considering transportation end-users when developing volcanic impact and risk assessments. We suggest that the metrics are universally applicable in other urban environments. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Podostemum ceratophyllum, commonly called Hornleaf Riverweed, occurs in mid-order montane and piedmont rivers of eastern North America, where the plant grows submerged and attached to rocks and stable substrates in swift, aerated water. Multiple studies, mostly conducted in the southern portions of the plant's range, have shown that Podostemum can variously influence benthic communities in flowing waters. However, a synthetic review of the biology and ecology of the plant is needed to inform conservation, particularly because P. ceratophyllum is reported to be in decline in much of its range, for mostly unknown reasons. We have thus summarized the literature showing that Podostemum provides substantial habitat for invertebrates and fish, may be consumed by invertebrates, turtles, and other vertebrates, removes and sequesters dissolved elements (i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, etc.) from the water column, and contributes organic matter to the detrital pool. Podostemum may be tolerant to some forms of pollution but appears vulnerable to sedimentation, epiphytic over-growth, and hydrologic changes that result in desiccation, and possibly increased herbivory pressure. Much remains unknown about Podostemum, including aspects of morphological variation, seed dispersal, and tolerance to changes in temperature and water chemistry. Nonetheless, Podostemum may be considered a foundation species, whose loss from eastern North American rivers is likely to affect higher trophic levels and ecosystem processes.

In this movement searching for new political feeling structures, even though mixed with old resistance morphologies, to understand to what extent the growing since Junho (2013), occupations of schools and public universities aswell as urban spaces, mainly by the homeless, show questions, experiences and material knowledges, as symbolic procedures able to mobilize outstanding intelectual people including social fights not only from the comfort/certainty but also from the moving and mobilizations produced by political-pedagogic procedures. Our theoric-metodologic-analytic basis remains, after all, on historic materialism contribution with double articulation: the concept of eventin Zizek and the concept of experience in Benjamim (Erfahrung), aiming to undersrtand the occupations as political paths under circunstances of exceptions.

AB  - When the plug-holing phenomena occurs, the actual amount of smoke exhaust could not be able to satisfy the design criteria of the smoke ventilation. The plug-holing phenomenon is influenced by various factors, but has not yet suggested accurate criteria for the plug-holing. Especially, the effect of tunnel geometry was not considered, despite the smoke movement is influenced by hydraulic diameter of tunnel. In this study, we performed the numerical simulation to analyze the effect of the hydraulic diameter of a tunnel on plug-holing.
   According to the numerical result, it was identified that the total mass flux increased and the mass flux of smoke decreased as the hydraulic diameter of tunnel was increased. A new, modified Froude number is suggested for estimating the occurrence of plug-holing by including the effect of the hydraulic diameter for shallow tunnels. Additionally, the critical value of the modified Froude number is defined as 0.104 based on the results of the numerical simulation.

AB  - On 28 May 2013 a peaceful demonstration by environmental activists who were protesting against the demolition of Gezi Park - one of the few green areas left at the heart of Istanbul and construction of a shopping mall along with a mosque instead was suppressed by excessive and aggressive police intervention. In response to the police suppression, thousands of individuals in Istanbul gathered in Taksim and Kadikoy followed by other big city centers in Turkey, which subsequently evolved into a resistance movement throughout the country. Particularly the peak days of the uprisings generated so much interests both in domestic and international public opinions, it was even perceived as the biggest political resistance in the history of modern Turkey. Although the government side tried to portray the incidents as "demonstrations" to degrade its impact, the opposition side presented the incidents as "riots" to boost participation. This paper aims to look from three years back at the Gezi Resistance in terms of its nature and grass-roots mobilization of masses and where it stands from the perspective of the New Social Movements Theory. Comparisons are made with similar social movements in other countries and implications for political communication of such movements are discussed.

AB  - Both the Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008, and the Lushan earthquake on April 12, 2013, produced many coseismic landslides along the Nanya River in Shimian City. Subsequent debris flows that initiated from these landslides and are triggered by intense rainfall become the secondary hazard in the years after the earthquake; in particular, some debris flows led to a serious river blocking event. For example, the Guangyuanbao debris flow which occurred on July 04, 2013, partly blocked the Nanya River, presenting a major threat to the national highway and residential areas. To analyze the pattern of landslide damming, we analyzed numerical simulations of the movement characteristics of the Guangyuanbao debris flow using rainfall intensities with varying recurrence periods of 5, 20, and 50 years. The accuracy of the spreading of the numerical simulation is about 90%. The simulation indicated a small volume of sediment entering the river for a rainfall under 5-year return period. A debris flow induced by rainfall under 20-year return period partly blocked the river, while rainfall under 50-year return period has potential to block the river completely. This proposed analysis of river blocking induced by a debris flow could be used for disaster prevention in earthquake-stricken area.

AB  - Seasonal variation of thermal comfort demands directly affects the energy needs for heating or cooling purpose. In previous studies, the differences of neutral temperatures between summer and winter were revealed, but the studies on the difference of human thermal adaption in transitional seasons are insufficient. To clarify this, this paper presents a year-long survey which was carried out in 505 residential buildings in six cities located in the Hot Summer and Cold Winter (HSCW) zone of China involving 11,524 subjects. Results show a significant difference of adaptive responses in different seasons, and a lag of behavioral responses behind climate change in transitional seasons is observed. Occupants not only adjust clothing insulation according to air temperattire in different seasons, but also actively control indoor air movement, including closing/opening windows and using fan's. The seasonal, monthly and daily neutral temperatures are studied, implying that occupants' thermal experience has significant effect on their thermal comfort by behavioral, physiological and psychological paths. According to the comparative study, the running mean air temperature method and aPMV model are recommended in free-running space. The findings provide scientific evidence to the concept that dynamic thermal comfort temperature range should be considered in evaluation of indoor thermal environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Musician's dystonia is a task-specific dystonia (TSD) worldwide disabling disorder, and most of the affected individuals may have severe difficulty to play their instrument. Many professional music players may have to quit working as a player. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and frequency of TSD in Brazilian music players and to promote awareness of this condition among musicians. We visited orchestras and music schools delivering lectures on TSD and about the scope of our survey. Musicians were invited to answer a questionnaire, and those with possible neurological dysfunction associated with musical performance were recorded by video while playing the instrument. We visited 51 orchestras and music schools in 19 Brazilian cities between March 2013 and March 2015. We collected 2,232 questionnaires, and 72 subjects with suspicion of dystonia were video recorded during specific tasks and evaluated regarding motor impairment. Forty-nine individuals (2.2%) were diagnosed as having TSD (mean age 36.4 years; 92% male). The instruments most associated with TSD were acoustic guitar (36.7%) and brass instruments (30.6%). We concluded that Brazilian TSD music players are mainly male, classical music professionals, around 30 years of age, with arms, hands, or oromandibular muscles affected. TSD is a neurological condition that can impair musical performance and should receive more attention from musicians, teachers, and health professionals.

AB  - Weeds in reclamations interfere with success by: 1) competing with desirable species seeded during revegetation; 2) preventing recolonization of reclamations by native species; and 3) reducing the integrity of landscapes by expanding from reclamations into adjacent, intact areas. In the Bakken oilfield of western North Dakota, dispersed reclamation activity and increased traffic may provide many opportunities for weeds to spread. To determine the potential for disturbance and reclamation to increase resident weed populations and introduce new weed species, we tracked twenty-one weed (non-native/ruderal/invasive) species over a four-year period after the installation of a 1.8 km livestock water pipeline and subsequent land reclamation on a historic ranch in western North Dakota. We included areas of historic (early 20th century homestead) and recent (prairie dog town) landscape disturbances and tracked weed frequency and density in the disturbed pipeline and in the directly adjacent intact prairie. Most of the weeds in the pipeline were non-persistent populations of naturalized species. Our data show that although naturalized weeds may respond positively to disturbance, they can quickly return to pre-disturbance levels. However, disturbance may have resulted in the introduction of one new noxious weed, Hyoscyamus niger (black henbane). Agropyron cristatum (crested wheatgrass), an invasive, non-native perennial grass that reduces native plant diversity and forage value, was also introduced. This study demonstrates the importance of prevention of weed dispersal during disturbance and reclamation, contamination-free seed sources, and post-reclamation follow up to control any weeds that may have been introduced as a result of pipeline development.

AB  - In modern society, various crimes are occurring. This is seriously threatening the safety of the city. It is most important to prevent crime before it occurs. There are many studies to prevent crime. However, most of the existing research methods try to prevent crime by analyzing the frequency of crime occurrence and the motives of crime using statistical and psychological factors. Several recent studies have used Big Data to provide real-time crime incidence rates to mobile phone users in specific regions. However, there is no research that reports the risk of crime according to the time and day of the user's movement. In this paper, we propose a safety route recommendation method according to user's movement time and day of the week. To do this, we calculate the crime risk rate for a particular facility and calculate the crime risk rate for the route based on the crime risk rate of the facilities included in the user's route. To calculate the facility crime risk rate, we analyze information on the facility where the crime occurred for the five major types of crime. The facility crime risk rate is expressed in levels from 1 to 10, with 1 being the safest and 10 being the most dangerous. An analysis of crime information shows that the probability of crime on the route increases when facilities with high crime risk or facilities with similar crime rates are in close proximity. Even at the same facility, crime is 20% more likely to occur at night than night, and more crimes occur on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays than other days. Therefore, the crime risk rate for the route is calculated by using the risk rate of the crime occurrence of the facilities included in the route, the risk rate of crime occurrence at the adjacent facilities, and the time and day weight. When a user chooses a start and end points, our system calculates the crime risk rate according to the time and day of use and recommends the safest route among various routes.

AB  - Natural sporulation of a pine stem rust, Cronartium flaccidum, was investigated in forested habitats in northern Finland. First, a diffuse sample (100) of seven species of hemiparasitic plants was collected in their natural habitats close to one another. C.flaccidum was found to sporulate on six species. The rust was most common on Melampyrum sylvaticum with 21% of the plants and 2% of the leaves carrying telia. Telia occurred occasionally also on Euphrasia frigida, E.nemorosa, E.stricta, Pedicularis palustris ssp. palustris and Melampyrum pratense (less than 5% of the plants and 0.3% of the leaves). The rust was absent on Rhinanthus minor. Second, a diffuse sample of each of M.sylvaticum, M.pratense, Euphrasia sp. and Rhinanthus sp. was collected from 10 sample plots surrounding the city area. C.flaccidum occurred on 0.29% of the leaves of M.sylvaticum, and 0.02%-0.03% of M.pratense and Euphrasia, but it was lacking from Rhinanthus. The results indicated that C.flaccidum was most common and widespread on M.sylvaticum, but sporulated sporadically also on Euphrasia sp., P.palustris and M.pratense. This is the first report of sporulation of C.flaccidum on Euphrasia frigida and E.nemorosa in their natural habitats. In contrast, a second rust observed in this survey, Coleosporium sp. needle rust, was much more common than C.flaccidum on the investigated plants. In the first site, 43%-54% of plants and 8%-17% of leaves of Melampyrum spp. and 0%-13% of plants and 0%-2% of leaves of Euphrasia spp., Rhinanthus minor and Pedicularis palustris carried uredinia or telia. In the second site, 9%-15% of leaves of Melampyrum spp. and 1%-2% of Euphrasia sp. and Rhinanthus sp. carried rust uredinia and/or telia. The results indicate frequent spore dispersal of both Cronartium and Coleosporium in the area, and versatile rust sporulation on hemiparasitic plant species.

AB  - Landslides are very common in the Indian Himalayas especially during monsoon season. Existence of large number of faults and lineaments make the region geologically very fragile and prone to landslides at any scale. Landslides may be divided into two types: progressive and sporadic. Sporadic landslides, from which large deformations generally result in a short period, are difficult to measure. However, small progressive slides are often likely to occur prior to a sporadic slip. Therefore, progressive slides are investigated in order to enhance disaster prevention capabilities.
   Remote sensing and GIS based techniques have already been used extensively for landslide mapping and monitoring applications worldwide. Although, the availability of high resolution optical sensors has provided enormous thrust to the landslide research, yet atmospheric conditions like clouds and fog and restrictions on time of imaging sometimes make it difficult to fully exploit these sensors. To overcome these difficulties microwave radar remote sensing, which allow mapping irrespective of meteorological conditions both day and night, has gained its importance. Among them DInSAR technique appears to be most attractive for detecting small to large mass movements. The aim of this research is to investigate the potential of advanced DInSAR technique, Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) to estimate the temporal behaviour of slope movement in the landslide prone Nainital town of the Kumaon Himalaya.
   The outcomes demonstrated that SBAS technique can be effectively used to identify and estimate slope movement. It also provides the early warning support for slope instability.

AB  - We present an exposure analysis of infrastructure and lifeline to tephra fallout for a future large-scale explosive eruption of Sakurajima volcano. An eruption scenario is identified based on the field characterization of the last subplinian eruption at Sakurajima and a review of reports of the eruptions that occurred in the past six centuries. A scenario-based probabilistic hazard assessment is performed using the Tephra2 model, considering various eruption durations to reflect complex eruptive sequences of all considered reference eruptions. A quantitative exposure analysis of infrastructures and lifelines is presented primarily using open-access data. The post-event impact assessment of Magill et al. (Earth Planets Space 65: 677-698, 2013) after the 2011 VEI 2 eruption of Shinmoedake is used to discuss the vulnerability and the resilience of infrastructures during a future large eruption of Sakurajima. Results indicate a main eastward dispersal, with longer eruption durations increasing the probability of tephra accumulation in proximal areas and reducing it in distal areas. The exposure analysis reveals that 2300 km of road network, 18 km(2) of urban area, and 306 km(2) of agricultural land have a 50% probability of being affected by an accumulation of tephra of 1 kg/m(2). A simple qualitative exposure analysis suggests that the municipalities of Kagoshima, Kanoya, and Tarumizu are the most likely to suffer impacts. Finally, the 2011 VEI 2 eruption of Shinmoedake demonstrated that the already implemented mitigation strategies have increased resilience and improved recovery of affected infrastructures. Nevertheless, the extent to which these mitigation actions will perform during the VEI 4 eruption presented here is unclear and our hazard assessment points to possible damages on the Sakurajima peninsula and the neighboring municipality of Tarumizu.

AB  - Modern transportation systems aim at maximizing the use of available resources in a sustainable manner to deliver efficient and safe movement of traffic. Variable Speed Limit (VSL) system is one of the techniques adopted in order to improve mobility. In this study, we analyse this system using simulation techniques on a 5.2 kilometre section of Istanbul Freeway D100. Being one of the most congested cities in the world, Istanbul freeways provide an excellent opportunity to test the potential benefits of VSL systems. Latest advancements along with comprehensive literature of this field based on simulation are included in this study. Microscopic traffic simulation software VISSIM is used along with MATLAB to implement VSL algorithm based on volume, occupancy and average speed. Remote Traffic Microwave Sensor (RTMS) data is provided by Istanbul municipality which is used to calibrate VISSIM.Scenarios with and without VSL system were simulated for morning hours. It is concluded that driver compliance to VSLs is an important factor for better results. Although 100% driver Compliance Level (CL) for VSL results in significantly higher improvement in performance compared to lower compliance, it is not a practical approach therefore results at 75% and 50% CL has been discussed in this study. Evaluation of network performance is done in terms of Total Travel Time (TTT) in network along with volume, speed and occupancy. Results show reduction in TTT and occupancy level along with improvement in average speed and volume. Fuel consumption and emissions is also found to be reduced in the network indicating sustainable and environmental friendly mobility. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Indigenous School Education in the present time of the Mayrob, Apiaka and Kayabi Communities in the city of Juara-MT has experienced a constant re-signification in order to become differentiated, intercultural and bilingual. This movement of re-signification is based on the plots and the ways undertaken in the indigenous movements in the context of popular education. This process occurs with the empowerment, dialogues and experiences of indigenous knowledge, always in the perspective of critical interculturality. For it is in the effort of the ethnic affirmation of each people that by the pedagogical educational practices and in the valuation of the own culture. An education that builds a curriculum articulated to life, interculturality and the memory of culture and mother tongue in a globalized and diverse world, a curriculum negotiated with tensions and protagonism. In other words, an own, differentiated, intercultural education, made by the Cosmo-Anthropological Pedagogy. The aforementioned text originates in a doctoral research carried out in the period from 2012 to 2014, at Dinter UFRGS / UNEMAT. The research path was supported by the contributions of the qualitative research of the ethnographic type, with the orientations of Geertz (1989) and Andre (2003). Indigenous school education was the object of study, and the main authors who assisted in the construction of this research were: Kusch (2000), Dussel (1993), Paulo Freire (1996; 2005) and Viveiros de Castro (2002).

AB  - The present research reports the results of a questionnaire-based statistical study of some complex parameters derived from subjective answers by occupants regarding thermal comfort in their area of residence. There is not enough data regarding comfort in residential environment in Madagascar. This will help to define guidelines for constructing more comfortable buildings in Madagascar and other countries on the Indian Ocean. The experimental field study was carried out in 5 big hospitals, 50 small and big shopping centers, 67 traditional buildings, and 25 schools, which were distributed in 25 districts with different micro-climates of the urban communes in Northern of Madagascar. A total of 1092 people were investigated by means of 250 interviews and 842 analysed questionnaires during rainy and dry seasons. The physical measurements of air temperature and other parameters were performed simultaneously. Results showed that there were no very great differences between males and females thermal sensations, humidity sensations, and air movement sensations. The air temperature and relative humidity have a significant impact on the thermal preference in the studied place. With air temperature between 22.9 and 27.2 degrees C, relative humidity from 45.2 to 70.5%, associated with air speed varying from 0.15 to 0.45 m/s, at least 80% of voters found their environment comfortable.

AB  - The repercussions of climate change will be felt in various ways throughout both natural and human systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Climate change projections for this region point to a warming trend, particularly in the inland subtropics; frequent occurrence of extreme heat events; increasing aridity; and changes in rainfall-with a particularly pronounced decline in southern Africa and an increase in East Africa. The region could also experience as much as one meter of sea-level rise by the end of this century under a 4 A degrees C warming scenario. Sub-Saharan Africa's already high rates of undernutrition and infectious disease can be expected to increase compared to a scenario without climate change. Particularly vulnerable to these climatic changes are the rainfed agricultural systems on which the livelihoods of a large proportion of the region's population currently depend. As agricultural livelihoods become more precarious, the rate of rural-urban migration may be expected to grow, adding to the already significant urbanization trend in the region. The movement of people into informal settlements may expose them to a variety of risks different but no less serious than those faced in their place of origin, including outbreaks of infectious disease, flash flooding and food price increases. Impacts across sectors are likely to amplify the overall effect but remain little understood.

AB  - The Niumiangou landslide (similar to 7.5 x 10(6) m(3)) was the largest that occurred in the town of Yingxiu (the epicentral area) during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. This landslide originated on a steep slope (similar to 30 degrees) that was located directly above the rupture surface of the responsible fault and then traveled similar to 2 km after flowing down the axes of two gently sloping (<12 degrees) valleys. Evidence at the site indicates that the landslide materials were highly fluidized and underwent rapid movement. To examine the initiation and movement mechanisms of this landslide, we performed a detailed field survey, conducted laboratory tests on samples taken from the field, and analyzed the seismic motion. We conclude that the landside materials were displaced due to seismic loading during the earthquake and that liquefaction may have been triggered in saturated layers above the sliding surface with progressive downslope sliding, which resulted in the high mobility of the displaced materials. The liquefaction of colluvial deposits along the travel path due to loading by the sliding mass enhanced the mobility of the displaced mass originating in the source area. Using an energy-based approach, we estimated the dissipated energy in our cyclic loading test and the possible energy dissipated to the soil layer on the slope by the earthquake. We infer that the seismic energy available for the initiation of the slope failure in the source area may have greatly exceeded the amount required for the initiation of the liquefaction failure. The slope instability might have been triggered several seconds after the arrival of seismic motion.

AB  - The present study aims at understanding the seismotectonic province of the Shillong Plateau (SP) by identifying the potential seismic source zones within a radius of 500 km from the centre of the SP. From existing literature and earthquake (EQ) data, the seismotectonic region is found to vary in terms of seismicity, tectonic features, geology, thickness of overburden, rupture characteristics and rate of movement. Thus, entire 500-km-radius seismotectonic region is divided into four seismic source zones: namely (1) the Shillong Plateau-Assam Valley Zone (SP-AVZ), (2) the Indo-Burma Ranges Zone (IBRZ), (3) the Bengal Basin Zone (BBZ) and (4) the Eastern Himalaya Zone (EHZ). EQ catalogues for each source zone is analysed for completeness of magnitude and time. Seismic parameter b estimated using a maximum likelihood method is found to be 0.91 +/- 0.03, 0.94 +/- 0.02, 0.80 +/- 0.03 and 0.89 +/- 0.03 for the SPAVZ, IBRZ, BBZ and EHZ, respectively. In addition, the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the mean annual activity rate, maximum possible magnitude (m(max)), return period and probability of exceedance for the four zones. The b values estimated suggest that the BBZ is seismically more active; however, the rate of occurrence of EQs is highest in the IBRZ. Findings from this study are an indication of the relative contribution from each of the four seismic source zones towards a seismic hazard of the SP.

AB  - The history of harm reduction in the USA has led to the development of some of the most important methods for treating persons for drug use disorders, such as methadone and buprenorphine for opiate use disorder. However, there has been fierce political resistance to implementation and scale-up of harm reduction in the USA. This resistance is rooted in historical demonization of particular psychoactive drugs that were associated with stigmatized racial/ethnic groups. With the discovery of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981, harm reduction became important not only for treating substance use disorders, but for reducing transmission of blood-borne infection. However, within the context of the crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s, it was very difficult to implement any programs that appeared to "condone" drug use.
   It was not until the late 1980s that syringe exchange programs began at the state and local level in the USA. With funding primarily from state and local governments and the support of the North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN), there are now approximately 200 programs for syringe exchange in the USA. Research has shown that these programs have been extremely effective in reducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission among persons who inject drugs (PWID). The programs in the USA also offer many additional services for drug users, including condom distribution, referrals to substance abuse treatment, HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) counseling and testing, overdose education and naloxone distribution to reverse for overdose. Currently, the USA is experiencing an opioid/heroin epidemic, with significant increases in overdose deaths among drug users. Much of this epidemic is occurring in suburban and rural of the country without harm reduction services. The current challenges for harm reduction and harm reduction research involve expansion of services to suburban and rural areas and implementation science on how to effectively and efficiently address HCV transmission and overdose. Most importantly, continued research efforts are needed to reduce the stigma of psychoactive drug use. While political opposition continues, harm reduction activists and researchers have developed a highly effective partnership based on a common core values.

AB  - Zambia has a generalized HIV epidemic, and HIV is concentrated along transit routes. Female sex workers (FSWs) are disproportionately affected by the epidemic. HIV testing is the crucial first step for engagement in HIV care and HIV prevention activities. However, to date little work has been done with FSWs in Zambia, and little is known about barriers and facilitators to HIV testing in this population. FSW peer educators were recruited through existing sex worker organizations for participation in a trial related to HIV testing among FSWs. We conducted five focus groups with FSW peer educators (N=40) in three transit towns in Zambia (Livingstone, Chirundu, and Kapiri Mposhi) to elicit community norms related to HIV testing. Emerging themes demonstrated barriers and facilitators to HIV testing occurring at multiple levels, including individual, social network, and structural. Stigma and discrimination, including healthcare provider stigma, were a particularly salient barrier. Improving knowledge, social support, and acknowledgment of FSWs and women's role in society emerged as facilitators to testing. Interventions to improve HIV testing among FSWs in Zambia will need to address barriers and facilitators at multiple levels to be maximally effective.

AB  - Background: Prisons in Madagascar are at high risk of plague outbreak. Occurrence of plague epidemic in prisons can cause significant episode of urban plague through the movement of potentially infected humans, rodents and fleas. Rodent and flea controls are essential in plague prevention, by reducing human contact with plague reservoirs and vectors. Insecticide treatment is the key step available for the control of rat fleas which transmit the disease from infected rodents to human. The implementation of an adapted flea control strategy should rely on the insecticide susceptibility status of the targeted population. For the purpose of plague prevention campaign in prisons, we conducted insecticide resistance survey on Xenopsylla cheopis, the rat flea.
   Methods: Fleas were collected on rats caught in six prisons of Madagascar. They were exposed to insecticide treated filter papers and mortality was recorded following World Health Organization protocol.
   Results: The fleas collected in the prisons had different resistance patterns, while a high level of resistance to insecticides tested was described in the Antanimora prison, located in the heart of Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar.
   Conclusions: This finding is alarming in the context of public health, knowing that the effectiveness of flea control could be jeopardized by insecticide resistance. In order to establish more accurate rat fleas control in prisons, the main recommendations are based on continuous monitoring insecticide susceptibility of flea, insecticide rotation, and the development of a new method for flea control.

AB  - Traditionally, in Spain bullfighting represents an ancient and well-respected tradition and a combined brand of sport, art and national identity. However, bullfighting has received considerable criticism from various segments of society, with the concomitant rise of the animal rights movement. The paper reports a survey of the Spanish citizens using a face-to-face survey during January 2016 with a total sample of 2522 citizens (1256 men and 1266 women). The survey asked about degree of liking and approving; culture, art and national identity; socio-economic aspects; emotional perception and animal welfare. The hypothesis proposed that the perception of bullfights may be affected by gender, age, occupation, origin and nationality of the persons surveyed. The hypothesis was confirmed. The majority of citizens surveyed do not like bullfights and great majorities do not attend or watch such events. Two extreme clusters were described: one representing favorable attitude towards bullfighting and other against bullfighting. The proportion of indifferent persons was important. Women and young people showed a more favorable attitude towards animal welfare issues associated with these events. Rural people were more accepting bullfights than urban people. Students were more anti-bullfight than those in other occupations. Additionally, technical economic factors made people favor more bullfights. The growth of claim against bullfights establishes an element of a far more multifaceted phenomenon that animal cruelty per se and support of a new paradigm called social change in countries as Spain.

AB  - In the Romanian principalities, the emergence and assertion of a humanist thinking current occurs later than in the West. The cause of this situation of cultural delay is related to the late appearance of cities, the formation of a bourgeois class and the persistence of still strong feudal structures. Another cause consists in the pressure from an environment of Byzantine culture, allowing borrowings from West - in art, in literature, in the court habits, and so on but only with strict observance of tradition and without doctrinal deviating. The numerous armed confrontations in the area, imposed by the expansion of some eastern populations with barbaric beliefs, direct the attention on issues placed away from art and culture. In medieval times the Church was the main factor of culture. Alphabetization was quite low in all Romanian provinces. In the XVth century, the few scholars from the Romanian Principalities hadn't the power of imposing the cultural movement existing in the West, the nobles didn't support in any way the arts. The leaders of medieval era were facing numerous wars triggered by the expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the barbarian invasions. Perfect strategists, they didn't have the opportunity to study in western schools, to establish a direct contact with arts, but they were able to support the building of religious monuments, encouraging an own style of architecture and the respect for the arts that were developing in the monastic places. Thus appear here, guarded defensive walls, the first voivodal schools and the first libraries, are copied books, is painting and singing. All that we leave behind us are the stories. The mural paintings of the churches and monasteries of XIVth - XVIth centuries from Moldavia are a part of the story about the ancestral faith on this land.

KW  - OBESITY
AB  - Increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in childhood youngsters have been reported worldwide. The prevalence figures vary; approximately 30% in the USA and the Mediterranean countries, 20% in other parts of Europe with lower rates, under 10%, in Africa and Asia. The aims of present studies were to evaluate the secular trends in BMI distribution and the prevalence of overweight and obesity of children in birth cohorts. The ability of parents to assess the weight class of their children was also analyzed. Data was analyzed by qualitatively. Difference in the growth of the children in the five birth cohorts began to emerge starting from the age of one year. Instead, changes in the mean BMI of newborns or in 0.5-year-old children between birth cohorts were not obvious in the longitudinal analysis. During the past four decades, in contrast to the obesity epidemic, the entire BMI distribution of toddlers has shifted to a lower level and toddlers have become slimmer. Getting closer to puberty the BMI distribution started to skew to the right. In teenagers the upper parts of BMI distribution have risen to higher levels while lower BMI percentiles have remained quite stable. Young adolescents, especially boys, have become taller and heavier. Overweight seems to be more common in children living in rural than in urban areas. The rural vs. urban difference was greater in children over 5 years than at younger ages. The falling BMI seen in toddlers might indicate that the age of adiposity rebound now occurs earlier. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the synergy between air pollution and obesity in causing damage to health. We try to create a sort of guideline of conduct tending to modify the lifestyle. The goal is to improve health both directly by increasing the possibility of movement of children and indirectly by reducing air pollution. It's been shown that obesity, reduced physical activity and air pollution are cofactors that can cause systemic diseases. This is most evident in children because they are more susceptible, have immature metabolism, phenomena of bioa-ccumulation. Children breathe proportionately more air volume than adults so they inhale a higher concentration of pollutants, also breathe more being lower near the ground. An obesity prevention program is needed in public health and education should start early in childhood. The skills of health care professionals are needed to help parents to build up a realistic perception of their child's weight status.

KW  - OPTIMIZATION
AB  - Existing traffic control strategies at signalized intersections aim at the optimization of signal timing parameters while assuming fixed lane assignments to the movements at each approach. Such control results in the waste of time-space resources especially at intersections where significant variations in the demand of turning and through traffic movements occur with time. Such demand variations with fixed space allocation per movement will lead to longer cycle lengths and excessive delays. This study aims to develop a model that integrates the optimization of space allocation (dynamic lane grouping) with the optimization of signal timing parameters for the whole intersection in order to improve its mobility. The effectiveness of dynamic lane grouping is evaluated using collected traffic data at an isolated signalized intersection in Dhahran City, Saudi Arabia. MATLAB environment is utilized to build the model in which the main outputs are the optimal lane group combinations and the optimal signal timing parameters that minimizes average intersection delay. The main input parameters are intersection geometry (mainly number of lanes, and median width) and traffic volumes for all movements. Based on number of lanes at each approach, possible lane group combinations are generated considering the possibility of having shared lanes. A comparison between fixed-lane grouping and dynamic lane grouping strategies in terms of average intersection delay and optimized cycle lengths is presented. It is concluded that operating isolated signalized intersections with controls that consider the optimization of space and time allocations simultaneously can substantially enhance their performance by significantly reducing intersection delay and queue lengths.

AB  - Can present day grassroots direct actions be considered revolutionary? In this paper, I argue that seemingly "reformist" demands can be considered revolutionary in today's neoliberal capitalism. At the turn of the twenty-first century, working class Ecuadorian migrants in Barcelona were trying to join the global middle classes via subprime mortgage loans and despite their precarious jobs. Following the collapse of Spain's housing bubble, unemployed, defaulting on their mortgages, and risking home eviction, they turned to housing activism. They joined the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages (PAH) and became daily protestors for the right to housing and against indebtedness. Looking at PAH approaches that encouraged debt default among low-income families, strategies to reconvert repossessed homes by rescued banks into social housing units, or the effective occupation of buildings that belonged to these banks by the PAH to house evicted families, I claim that these moments represent revolutionary instances of a broader fight against indebtedness taking place globally which can be considered-as many did at the PAH-a fight against capitalism at large. In this paper I illustrate how people who had seldom participated in social mobilization became part of a small Barcelonan movement for the right to housing that grew exponentially throughout Spain succeeding in canceling thousands of mortgage debts and stopping equally as many evictions. PAH's spaces of encounter and action made possible a cross-class alliance upheld by weekly assemblies and near daily direct actions against financial institutions and a proausterity central government. These moments demonstrate the ability of everyday people to reclaim housing, redefine the narrative of indebtedness, and-in the case of Barcelona-it even made possible taking control of City Hall.

AB  - Shortly before Velika Zupa Dubrava witnessed its collapse within the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in October 1944, the inhabitants fell victim to ceaseless clashes throughout the year and fierce terror on behalf of all warring parties, plunder, killings of innocent civilians and the burning of houses. Famine and shortage of goods due to irregular transport and a general halt of all economic activities threatened to take its toll. The authorities of Velika Zupa Dubrava did their best to improve the conditions, although they had no control over a significant portion of the territory occupied by the Cetniks, nor were they able to exert any authority on the territory under their own military and police control because the German occupation forces were in full command.
   The organisation of public administration on the territory of Velika Zupa Dubrava testifies to the authority's efforts to cope with all the administrative issues systematically, yet the lack of professional staff and the prevailing adverse circumstances proved a crucial impediment. Constant crisis marked by military incidents caused deep anxiety and distrust among the inhabitants, which deteriorated by the German retaliation, especially by the deportation of all men from Korcula and Peljesac. This contributed to an increasing support of the partisan movement and their frequent illegal actions, such as the distribution of pamphlets, writing of graffiti and the assassination of distinguished executives of Velika Zupa Dubrava. The air raids by the Allies further deepened the calamity, whose bombing of Dubrovnik and the wider city area caused great material damage. Under the mentioned conditions, the collapse of Velika Zupa Dubrava in October 1944 followed as a natural and anticipated outcome.

AB  - The remaining buildings of Gediminas's Castle in Vilnius stand on the top of a 40 m high hill composed of Quaternary glacial, glaciolacustrine, glaciofliuvial inter-layered deposits and technogenic (cultural layer) accumulations. The city center and castles are located in an area at the very margin at the maximum advance of the Weichselian glaciation. There was no direct erosion impact in the area of Vilnius's hills from meltwater for the formation of the upper reaches of the highest ravines. Therefore, it is proposed that the main features of the Vilnius Castles hills were formed by periglacial thermal erosion-the movement of land masses due to the thawing of permafrost at a time of climate change and the beginning of the vanishing of the Weichselian ice body. Over the course of history people reshaped the slopes of these hills for living and defense purposes. The saddle connecting Gediminas's Hill and the massif of the Hill of Three Crosses goes back to historical times when the artificial channel for the Vilnia River was dug and it became a separate hillfort. Due to the steep slopes of the hills, slope deformations and landslides have been occurring since the historical past until the present. Recently a landslide formed on the eastern slope in 2004 and reactivated in 2008. In early spring of 2016 two new landslides appeared on the northwestern slope preceded by a number of cracks on the ground surface. Causes of slopes failure and general problems of stabilization are dealt with this article, also covered is the necessity of early warning system installation, slopes surfaces permanent monitoring based on 3D laser scanning, etc.

AB  - In recent days, the major problem in the roads we face is due to lack of maintenance of traffic control. The traffic management in the urban communities requires appropriate arrangements and administration activity on the grounds that there is an enormous movement issue there. Lesser the streets and more are the vehicles. Along these lines activity is to be kept up in light of the fact that it influences the nation personals straightforwardly. There are numerous accidents and different sorts of lethal occurrences that are brought on by the inappropriate activity control framework. Keeping in mind the end goal to limit the street accidents and to protect the general population's lives, the traffic control system is intended to guarantee the security of the drivers and personals. This paper depicts a design of Fuzzy Logic Controller for a traffic control system. Finest signal settings can be fixed while fares of the trip and system flow are in balance. This problem can be considered as a nonlinear mathematical system with equilibrium constraints. Here, the performance of the system can be defined as a function of signal setting variables. In genuine figuring atmosphere, the data is not finished, exact and definite, creating extremely hard to infer a real choice. To manage handling and displaying data, fuzzy systems are connected to practice the correct termination. This manuscript concentrates on the essentials of Fuzzy Logic and its purpose in Rule Based Systems to make them proficient to hold this current certainty problems. In addition, a traffic activity control framework is projected and assessed utilizing MATLAB.

AB  - Wind discomfort and the dangers that the wind may lead can be harmful in terms of comfort conditions of both indoor and outdoor environment of the building/buildings to be constructed or just completed. The extent of discomfort to pedestrian varies from inducing slightly unpleasant feeling to producing a falling down hazard. Typically, the cause of frequent occurrences of strong wind at pedestrian area is primary related to the configuration of building structures and/or topography in the vicinity of the pedestrian area. Depending on the characteristics of the wind including magnitude, uniformity, ambient temperature, and so on, the level of disturbance to users of pedestrian areas can be different. In this context, the regions where Necmettin Erbakan University temporary education buildings are located have a fairly intensive topography in terms of wind. Therefore, detailed analysis of the inside regions and the surrounding areas of education buildings in particular are performed in terms of microclimatic comfort and indoor energy recovery. Especially, the topography where university campus temporary educational buildings are located has very high wind climate conditions compared to the city of Konya climate conditions. In this study, pedestrian-level wind conditions around N.E.U. campus buildings and in urban areas and the topography of campus settlements were analyzed through on-site measurement with Delta OHM microclimatic instruments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the pedestrian-level comfort conditions around the project buildings suggested by concept architects together with microclimatic measurements of comfort conditions, in the light of current topographic and climatic conditions presented by the head architect. However, presentation of these topographic and microclimatic measurements around currently completed temporary classrooms of the university campus have not yet been completed. The topography of the university campus, which is at an altitude higher than that of Konya centrum, is exposed to an extremely high wind velocity. The pedestrian-level comfort conditions are measured using Delta OHM instrument. The study also aims to compare pedestrian-level comfort conditions at locations of various buildings. In addition, outdoor comfort survey was also conducted in the campus area. However, measurement results of the microclimatic measurement device, DeltaOHM, are evaluated in this study. It can be observed from the results that pedestrian-level comfort of current campus settlements around the buildings reach very discomforting levels. Since the university's topography varies between very high and very low temperature levels and wind velocity values, climatic comfort problems are observed in the area. Some reasons for the discomfort problems observed in current settlement are; incorrect use of climatic parameters, incorrect directions of buildings, thermal effects due incorrect selection of materials used in constructions of buildings. In order to achieve thermal comfort, more studies are required on pedestrian-level comfort, use of passive design techniques such as correct direction of buildings and correct selection of materials utilized in the buildings based on their thermal effects. This would help university campus buildings consume less energy and maximize people's satisfaction.

AB  - This article examines correspondence between Baron P. P. Shafirov and Prince A. D. Menshikov from the spring of 1716 to the summer of 1717. These letters reveal the details of Peter I's stay in Copenhagen, different German cities, and the Netherlands during his second European voyage. As one of the leaders of the Russian foreign ministry and a close companion of the tsar, Shafirov was at the centre of many of the political and domestic events that occurred during this tour. Like the majority of those surrounding the tsar, the baron unofficially informed A. D. Menshikov of all business requiring attention, since Menshikov was in charge of managing the Russian state during Peter's absence. Published here for the first time, Shafirov's letters come down to us in the form of copies made in Menshikov's chancellery in February 1723: these are kept in fond 198 (A. D. Menshikov) of RGADA (Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts). The information in these letters is multisided. Firstly, one finds important military and political reports. While these historical narratives are rather well-known, Shafirov provides additional interesting details. Secondly, these letters are of interest because they provide news about the movement of Peter I and his wife, Tsarina Yekaterina Alekseevna, around Europe. Of particular note are the baron's reports about the tsar's serious illness in Amsterdam during the winter of 1716-17. The epistles also clarify the dates and routes that the tsar took, allow us to look at the climate in the countries where he stayed, and provide details about transport and communication links. Thirdly, and rather indirectly, the correspondence helps us to reconstruct the nature of the relationship between Shafirov and Menshikov and their families. All of these reasons make Shafirov's letters a valuable historical source. Their significance is fully revealed when analysed alongside analogous documentation connected with Peter the Great's second tour of Europe and the Great Northern War in general.

AB  - A main component of a transportation network is travel time or distance. Due to stochastic events such as accidents and failures in roads, a deterministic estimation of the travel time between two cities or regions is impossible. Also, on special occasions like holidays, with increase in the traveling population in the transportation network, probabilities of occurrence of these events increase. The increase in traveling population has a direct effect on the estimation of travel times and subsequently on the decision-making process. Therefore, provision of an appropriate model for the intelligent probabilistic travel times to distribute the population in a transportation network is a practical necessity. Here, we study a capacitated location-multi allocation-routing problem with intelligent probabilistic travel times. In our study, the concept of intelligent probabilistic travel times incurs two issues: (1) consideration of some random factors in computing the travel times and (2) impact of the traveling population on these random factors simultaneously. Here, we consider three random factors of the time spent in traffic, the number of accidents and the number of road failures. It is assumed that server nodes and arcs have limited capacities for accepting the population. After proposing a function for computing the intelligent probabilistic travel time, we first formulate the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model, and then suitably transform it into a mixed-integer linear programming one. Our aim is to determine appropriate server locations among the candidate locations, allocate the existing population in each demand node to server locations, and find the movement path of each member to reach its corresponding server with respect to the simultaneous change of the probabilistic travel times so that the expected total transportation time is minimized. For small problems, the model is efficiently solvable by the CPLEX software package. For large problems, two solution approaches, a heuristic algorithm incorporating genetic algorithm and local search, and an evolutionary simulated annealing algorithm, are proposed. Comparative numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic model and the proposed algorithms.

AB  - A large landslide occurred near the Grohovo Village in outback of the City of Rijeka, Croatia, on 13 February 2014 after long term period of heavy rain. The preliminary surface observation was carried out immediately after sliding appearance enabled estimation of site condition, dimension of the landslide so as an assessment of a hazard of further landslide movements. The estimated dimension of landslide body are length of 350 m, width of 135 and 20-30 m of depth to the slip surface. The movement of approximately 12-15 m down the slope caused the complete damage of the local road over the landslide body. The toe of the landslide reached the bank of the Valici Reservoir 250 m away from the downstream located Valici Dam. Based on hazard assessment of further landslide movements, a lowering of the water level in reservoir and surface drainage from the landslide body were conducted as emergency landslide mitigation measures but the main reason for further landslide movements reduction was the end of heavy rain. Although the detailed filed investigations were not carried out, the analysis of possible further development of sliding was conducted. To establish the engineering geological model of the landslide, the analyses of existing LiDAR imagery and engineering geological mapping were carried out. It was identified that the recent landslide is a reactivation of the dormant landslide. Since a slip surface position was not identified by field investigation, a numerical analysis of a slope using the strength reduction method was introduced to determine the shape of a zone of rupture which would be used in landslide simulation. As a main hazard of further landslide movements, the filling of the Valici Reservoir, forming a landslide dam so as possible overflow of the dam and forming the wave that can reach the center of the City of Rijeka downstream the Rjecina River were identified. To determine possible scenarios those could be realized in case of new long term rainy period and raising of ground water level in the landslide body, a numerical simulations of further landslide development were conducted using LS-Rapid simulation software. In case of high reservoir water levels correspondent to the dam overflow, the sliding mass would significantly fill the reservoir and cause the landslide dam, while the water level rising and landslide caused waves (tsunamis) would overflow the Valici Dam and cause significant damage downstream the Rjecina River channel. Conducted LS-Rapid simulation results enabled a selection of relatively safe reservoir water level at which, in case of further landslide movements, no current harmful consequences would be realized. The reservoir filling by sliding mass would cause significant reduction of reservoir volume, disturbances in the Rjecina River and Valici Reservoir flow regimes so as long term disruption of hydro power plant work that imply on necessary landslide remediation before further landslide reactivation.

AB  - Contemporary times can be characterized as turbulent, shifting and uncertain. Rapid urbanization and dramatic intensification are coupled with technological leaps and a call for sustainability. Conventional architecture was typically purpose-built with limited concerns about adapting downstream to new users, different purposes and altering conditions. Today however, with climate change, different demographics, resource depletion and affordability challenges, it is argued that building plasticity is urgently needed (Sinclair, 2015a). Rather than having people adjust to static spaces and places, next generation architecture must be dynamic, responsive and adaptive to needs, circumstances, culture and context.
   Japan is a country that has historically approached extreme demands on space in unique, innovative and successful ways (Sinclair, 2015b). In this island nation with inadequate resources, large population and limited legroom, environmental design has assumed directions that explore and overlap inside with outside, pragmatics and poetics, and the sacred with the profane. Spirituality is pervasive in many dimensions of everyday living, including in the design, construction and occupation of architecture. Powerful Buddhist concepts such as emphemerality, impermanence and non-attachment have had demonstrable consequences on the theories and practices of design. Traditional Japanese housing, for example, deploys tatami mats and shoji screens to afford infinite degrees of mutability, plasticity and change. Spaces shift in size and function. Borders blur between interiors and landscapes. Proportions swing, walls move and movement becomes fluid. The architecture accommodates fluctuations in need, intention and experience.
   For a wealth of reasons it is argued that architecture of the 21st century must approach similar levels of flexibility and adaptability. Rather than demolishing buildings to bulk up landfills, our architecture should be developed for disassembly, redesign, reassembly and reuse. The present research, following from focused literature reviews in Architecture and Spirituality realms, examines housing & commercial (both historic and modern) case studies from Japan. Included in the methodology is a critical examination of Japan's open building movement, undeniably a leading edge strategy for introducing greater choice and freedom in design, delivery and dwelling. A series of qualities, variables and approaches are delineated that hold relevance, and provide lessons, for agile architecture more broadly considered. Building upon the analytical aspects of the present research, a model is then synthesized and presented, suggesting a novel path for next-generation architecture.
   At the present juncture architectural theory, education and practice needs to grapple with unprecedented demands, unforeseen complexity and a call for much greater responsibility. Within this milieu agile architecture stands as one viable route to meeting such charges. The author contends that Japan's proven methods for environmental flexibility hold tremendous value beyond Japan as we struggle to make our cities, blocks, buildings and interiors more mutable, adaptable, responsive and responsible. The present paper draws unique connections between agility (e.g., Open Building) and spirituality (especially Buddhism), while concurrently expressing the need for other nations to learn from the design accomplishments of Japan. Emphemerality, impermanence and non-attachment prove highly pertinent notions in the new millennium as we strive to reposition architecture from static to dynamic and from fixed to flexible.

AB  - Mass movements represent a major threat to human life, properties and infrastructures in most densely populated and hilly towns in humid tropical areas. The present work is focused on the evaluation of the safety factor of natural slopes of mount Eloumden, located at the West-South-West of Yaounde, and on a contribution to address various problems related to the uncontrolled occupation of natural areas and the consequent potential mass movement occurrence. This natural slope stability study was carried out on the basis of field and laboratory tests: physical identification and geomechanical characterization of constituent materials from natural risk zone. The results obtained show that: the basement is made up of gneiss and the soil is ferrallitic; the constituent materials are silty-sand of the class A-6 (13) and A-6 (14), plastic, averagely water saturated, over consolidated and highly compressible. Their compaction can be tolerated when their preconsolidation stress is greater than their final effective stress; the short term factors of safety of these natural slopes, calculated on Excel, have values between 1.579 and 1.296 according to Fellenius for EL1 and EL2; 1.714 and 1.392 according to Bishop simplified. This infers that the slope EL1 is stable (Fs > 1.4) while the slope EL2 is potentially unstable (Fs < 1.4). Depending on simulations, the factor of safety decreases progressively in the presence of groundwater flow; with the reduction of the cohesion and with an increase of the density of the wet soil.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the organizational background of the protests "Against dictatorship" that took place in several Serbian towns, in the spring of 2017. The absence of the official organizers and the role social networking sites played in terms of communication, organization and coordination of the protest events, raises the following question: Could the protest "Against dictatorship" be considered as an example of a digitally enabled "connective" action?
   According to the connective action" approach (Bennett & Segerberg, 2012, 2013), in the information society a new connective" form of collective action is emerging as a result of personalization of political action that occurs within new socio-technological environment. Connective action is enabled by innovative technological opportunities for individual participation in collective ventures and supported by the role that ICTs play as "stitching" and organizing agents of collective action.
   In such circumstances, conventional social movement organizations and solid collective identities seem to become far less necessary.
   The analysis of the data collected in the field (N = 175) and in the online survey of the experiences and attitudes towards the protest (N=225), leads to the conclusion that the organizational background of the protest "Against dictatorship" is closest to the ideal-type of "self-organized network", as one of the two basic models of connective action.
   In the concluding part of this paper, the authors argue that the connective action" model is adequate for the interpretation of the emergence of the digitally mediated protests. However, with the transformation of protests into more solid and stable forms of collective action, this model loses its explanatory power.

AB  - Ischia Island (Italy) is an impressive example of the rare phenomenon of caldera resurgence. The emplacement and replenishment of magmas at shallow depth resulted in a vertical uplift of about 900 m, concentrated in the western portion of Mt. Epomeo (789 m a.s.l.). As a consequence of this uplift, the island has experienced several slope instabilities at different scales since the Holocene, from shallow mass movements to large rock and debris avalanches. These mass wasting events, which mobilised large volumes of greenish alkali-trachytic tuff (the Mt. Epomeo Green Tuff, MEGT), were strictly related to volcano-tectonic activity and the interaction between the volcanic slopes and the hydrothermal system beneath the island. Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformation (DSGSD) at Mt. Nuovo, located adjacent to densely populated coastal villages, is an ongoing process that covers an area of 1.6 km(2). The Mt. Nuovo DSGSD involves a rock mass volume of 190 Mm(3) and is accommodated by a main shear zone and a series of sub-vertical fault zones associated with high-angle joint sets. To improve our understanding of this gravity-induced process, we performed a physical (porosity and permeability) and mechanical (uniaxial and triaxial deformation experiments) characterisation of two ignimbrite deposits - both from the MEGT - that form a significant component of the NW sector of Mt. Epomeo. The main conclusions drawn from our experiments are twofold. First, the presence of water dramatically reduces the strength of the tuffs, suggesting that the movement of fluids within the hydrothermal system could greatly impact slope stability. Second, the transition from brittle (dilatant) to ductile (compactant) behaviour in the tuffs of the MEGT occurs at a very low effective pressure, analogous to a depth of a couple of hundred metres, and that this transition is likely moved closer to the surface in the presence of water. We hypothesise that compactant (porosity decreasing) behaviour at the base of the layer could therefore facilitate slope instability. Although our results show that transient exposure to 300 degrees C does not influence the short-term strength of the tuff, we speculate that the high in situ temperature could increase the efficiency of brittle and compactant creep and therefore increase the rate of slope deformation. Taken together, our experimental data highlight a potentially important role for the hydro thermal system (that reaches a minimum depth of similar to 1 km) in dictating the DSGSD at Mt. Nuovo. An understanding of this deformation process is not only important for the proximal coastal villages, at risk of engulfment by a large debris avalanche, but also for the towns and cities along the coast of the Gulf of Naples that are at risk to a secondary consequence of such an avalanche - a tsunami wave.

AB  - At present, China's grain production pattern runs counter to the distribution patterns of farmland resources and water-heat conditions. It is urgently important to conduct research on the spatial matching of grain production and farmland resources. Based on the Potential Crop Rotation data, with regards to the situations of irrigation and rain feeding, this paper builds a measuring model of potential farmland, and separately measures the spatial matching/index of grain yield with actual and potential farmland resources, thus revealing China's grain production pattern. The results indicate that serious spatial mismatch exists between grain production and farmland resources in China. Take the potential crop rotation system into consideration, the spatial mismatch of grain yield and potential farmland resources has been aggravated by the grain production barycenter's shift to the north China, with low Crop Rotation Index. The function-promoting regions of grain production in China are going through two evolution patterns of "northward and southward expansion" and "westward movement and northward expansion," respectively. Inefficient use of farmland mainly occurs in the fragile ecological environments, such as the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China, the northwest area of Xinjiang and the southwest karst landform areas. The inefficient use of and the decreasing amount of available farmland have become the main causes of the decline in grain production. The problems facing Chinese agriculture caused by the spatial mismatch include the imbalance in regional structures, ecological risks, agricultural production risks, and the risk of food price. In order to cope with these problems, this paper provides some advices on protecting farmland acreage, expanding farmland potential, ensuring the safety of water resources, and extending the industrial grain chain. Our paper additionally proposes policy reforms and innovations designed to ensure the implementation of the above measures, so as to commonly defuse China's food security crisis.

TI  - Cypriot Mortaria from the Pedasa Athena Sanctuary and their Role in Interregional Commercial Relations
T2  - ADALYA
LA  - Turkish
KW  - POTTERY
KW  - KOMMOS
AB  - Archaeological finds obtained from the settlements, sanctuaries, and necropoleis of the southeastern Aegean provide ample and detailed information about the eastern Mediterranean and the cultural and commercial ties established in the archaic period. Among all the imported votive objects, Cypriot votive figurines from the sanctuaries of Samos Heraion, Miletos Aphrodite, Emecik Apollon, and Rhodes constitute, without exception, the largest group in terms of quantity and typological diversity. Finds from the Pedasa Athena sanctuary on the Lelegian Peninsula confirm that the city was in fact a part of the Mediterranean cultural and commercial network.
   Mortaria, both local and impbrted, were used as filling material during the construction of the large terrace wall of the Pedasa-Athena Sanctuary which dates back to the second half of 4th century B.C. Finds Nos. 1-9 (Figs. 3-4) were among the functional cult objects from the sanctuary and are similar to archaic Cypriot mortaria with their yellow buff appearances, flat bases, diagonal walls, conic bodies, and thick, quadrangular rim profiles. Local imitations repeating the shape (Fig. 5) of imported examples (Cat. nos. 10-12, 14-15), some featuring a decorative band (Cat. no. 13), attest that local examples were soon reproduced in the southeastern Aegean. The majority of the finds (Cat. nos. 1-6, 8-11, 13, 15, 17-18) have been discovered from the same fill as the local and imported high-quality ceramics. Most of the finds from these fills can be dated to the late 7th century B.C. and the first three decades of the 6th century B.C. Mortaria form a close group showing typological and chronological common features as other forms from the same fill. The suggested date of 620-560 B.C. for mortaria unearthed at other centers that show typologically similar features must also be the timeline for the mortaria from Pedasa.
   The findings from the sanctuaries of Naucratis Apollo, Emecik Apollo, Samos Heraion, Ephesus Artemis, Assesus Athena, and Miletus Aphrodite suggest that mortaria were used to prepare and serve the food and cakes during the rituals for cult purposes in the sanctuaries of the Aegean world and related areas. All the archaeological evidence confirms that mortaria were among the absolutely indispensable cult objects of sanctuaries.
   Considering the mortaria discovered in southeastern Aegean-settlenients and sanctuaries, as well as the examples from the commercial cargo-of the cayeagiz Koyu shipwreck, they were clearly quite popular in the region for roughly eighty years extending from the third quarter of the 7th century B.C. to the second quarter of the 6th century B.C. The primary cargo of the Kepce Burnu shipwreck on the shores of Caria dated around the mid-7th century B.C. and the caycagtz Koyu shipwreck dated to the early 6th century B.C. is basket-handled Cypriot amphorae. An overall evaluation of mortaria discovered in settlements, sanctuaries, and shipwrecks in the area reveals that they emerge as commercially valuable merchandise immediately after the mid-7th century when they first appear in the area. The presence of mortaria among the primary merchandise of the cargo aboard the caycagiz Koyu shipwreck leaves no room for doubt about the commercial value of the mortaria.
   Various functions such as mashing, grinding, and mixing accelerated the rapid spread of imported mortaria and their local counterparts emulating imported originals, and caused them to become widespread in and around the shores of Caria. The scarcity of lekanai and similar bowl forms in the ceramic assemblage from the archaic period of the region explains the ample number of mortaria also used as bowls.
   Current archaeological data indicates that as of mid-7th century B.C., the relationship between the shores of Caria and Cyprus, which dates far back to the Early Iron Age, continued to grow and evolve in a more regular and uninterrupted fashion. In this network of relations, limestone and terracotta votive objects of Cypriot origin, basket-handled amphorae, mortaria, and surprisingly limited number of other ceramics constitute the documented cluster of data. The collected evidence reveals that the people of Caria were an integral part of the network of cultural and commercial ties in the Mediterranean world and that these relations were instrumental in familiarizing the locals with mortaria. It can be assumed that foreign visitors, locals returning from naval journeys, and mercenaries on their way home contributed towards the popularization of mortaria in the southeastern Aegean.
   Basket-handled Cypriot amphorae from the shipwrecks indicate that agricultural goods of Carian communities may have held an important place in the relationship between Cypriot and Carian societies as well. For the time being, it may be suggested that the olive oil, wine, and other regional produce of Carian communities played a part in eastern Mediterranean trade. It is striking to see that only a limited number of Cypriot amphorae have been discovered compared to the shipwreck data documented on the shores of the southeastern Aegean. It is evident that merchants of the northeastern Mediterranean procured a portion of the merchandise they sold on the international market directly from Caria and that the amphorae found in the shipwrecks were predominantly used for storing and transporting these goods aboard the ships.

AB  - The town of Hay River, located in the Northwest Territories, Canada, is vulnerable to ice jam flooding occurring in the adjacent Hay River delta. The most extreme flooding events have occurred when ice jams in the channels of the delta were pushed downstream towards the mouth at Great Slave Lake. This movement has been linked to incoming waves from ice jam release in the upstream reaches of the Hay River. This study incorporated the effect of an upstream ice jam release wave into the prediction of ice jam caused flood levels in the delta by integrating three one-dimensional models. The method was validated with observed breakup events and then used to simulate various combinations of ice and water conditions in the river and the delta. Multiple linear regression analyses were applied to the results to develop a prediction tool for assessing ice jam flood risk.

AB  - With rural-development, high-profile projects tend to garner much of the attention in terms of media coverage and political focus. In Slovakia, this can be seen with the reconstruction of some of the castles, manor houses, and other historical buildings around the country. There is, however, a private movement afoot that is quietly re-vitalizing areas and objects that have been abandoned or disused for a long period of time. Though these objects don't have the historical significance of places of royalty, they do have significant cultural value. One such region that is undergoing resurgence and stabilization is central Slovakia, more specifically the area south of the Banska Bystrica/Zvolen commuter zone. Even as new homes are being built, old businesses and buildings are being repaired and repurposed, creating ideal small town communities. This paper will detail the small-scale efforts that are occurring on an individual level that are helping to stabilize a rural sub-set in Slovakia.

AB  - During the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference period, Beijing's air quality was greatly improved as a result of a series of tough emission control measures being implemented in Beijing and its surrounding provinces. However, a moderate haze occurred during the period of 4-5 November. In order to evaluate the emission control measures and study the formation mechanism of the haze, a comprehensive field observation based on a supersite and a lidar network was carried out from 25 October 2014 to 20 January 2015. By investigating the variations in aerosol number concentration and mean backscattering coefficient before, during and after the APEC period, it was found that number concentration of accumulation mode and coarse mode particles experienced the most significant decrease by 47% and 68%, and mean backscattering coefficient below 1 km decreased by 34% during the APEC period. Being characterized as "rapidly accumulating and rapidly dispersing", the moderate haze occurred during the APEC period was probably initiated by a wind direction change to south and an increase of wind speed to 4 m/s. Sulfur dioxide involved plume nucleation without growth in size as well as a burst of particles ranging between 100 and 300 nm were observed simultaneously during the haze episode. The elevation of sulfur dioxide concentration and particle number concentration was highly correlated with the southerly wind, signifying the contribution of regional transport. It was observed by the lidar network that the aerosol backscattering coefficient increased in sequence among three sites along the southwest pathway, suggesting that aerosols might be transported from the southwest to the northeast of Beijing with a speed of approximately 17 km/h, which agreed with the movement of air masses modeled by Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT). The dual wavelength lidar (355 and 532 nm) observation suggested that transportation of fine particles from high-level atmosphere (approximately 2 km) could be the potential sources of the haze. Our result showed that regional transport would contribute to haze formation in Beijing under such meteorological conditions, thus, to maintain the "APEC blue", significant attention should be paid to controlling regional transport through the southwest pathway.

AB  - In the Samoan language, culture, activities and beliefs are based on hidden volcanic characteristics and other elements that hint at people's and communities' experiences with volcanism and their consequences. Hardly any of these significant features appear in earlier western scientific literature. Traditional and cultural components, however, are mirrored mainly in place names, tattooing traditions, dancing activities (siva or faafiafiaga), traditional speeches (lauga) and songs (pese). To identify volcanic features that correspond with specific volcano names, linked to volcanic events, and document the cultural experience of people with Samoa's rich volcanic landscape, field work was conducted. The field surveys equally looked for field evidence to link collected cultural data that has remote relevance with volcanism and targeted communities to map out their understanding of volcanism in areas considered to represent the youngest volcanic phases in the islands (from the Late Pleistocene to present time). These volcanic features were linked to collected oral traditions and stories uncovered by interviewing people from various villages located near these young volcanoes. Elderly people, especially, were able to recall and recite many such oral traditions. The study concentrated on Samoa's two main and most populated islands, Upolu and Savai'i Island. The aim of this study was to experience how the early arrivals to the islands defined and responded to the active volcanism and the volcanic landscape of Samoa. This study helps us understand how the early occupants transformed volcanic features into part of the main culture components, which still continue throughout the modern generation. In other words, these people use volcanic information as record, memory or evidence to let the later arrivals know that they were the first to arrive at this particular place. This confirms the fact that most of these occupants were witnessing volcanic activities in this part of Savai'i. Skills used by the early occupants to classify stronger and less strong impact activity (e.g. thickness of volcanic smoke) provide valuable information for the volcanic monitoring system on the island. The study also identified the movement of people not only within the main islands of Samoa but also the arrival of the Tonga group in several parts of Samoa.

AB  - The security and intelligence system of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (Komunisticka partija Jugoslavije - KPJ) and the Partisan movement was institutionalised through intelligence centres (obavjestajni centri - OC, late 1942), the Department for People's Protection (Odjeljenje za zastitu naroda - OZNA, May 1944), and the State Security Administration (Uprava drzavne bezbjednosti - UDBA, March 1946) and gradually created a system of recording and categorising enemies. The author uses key documents regarding the establishment of the security and intelligence system, instructions given by its leadership, and reports of security and intelligence bodies from Croatia in order to reconstruct the way in which records of armed enemies and political opponents were made and according to which criteria such people were categorised. At the beginning of the war, this matter wasn't given much consideration, but with the gradual strengthening of the Partisan units i.e. the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (Narodnooslobodilacka vojska i partizanski odredi Jugoslavije - NOV i POJ), later the Yugoslav Army (Jugoslavenska armija - JA) and their establishment of control over larger areas, and even more so at the end of the war and in its immediate aftermath as well as after the establishment of Democratic Federative Yugoslavia (Demokratska Federativna Jugoslavija - DFJ) and later the Federative People's Republic of Yugoslavia (Federativna Narodna Republika Jugoslavija - FNRJ), the need for making such records became a pressing matter. Therefore, during the early phase of building this security and intelligence system, its main focus was on recording and categorising wartime enemies. Security and intelligence operatives reported on the state of affairs in the occupied territories, the number of enemy soldiers and their armament, and enemy military plans. However, the category of "class" i.e. political and ideological enemy was soon introduced, according to which the population's stance towards the Partisan movement became a subject of interest. Therefore, political opponents such as members and supporters of "bourgeois" political parties, the clergy, and people who possessed a certain amount of property, especially owners of various types of shops, stores, and enterprises were all considered potential enemies. Records were kept on Ustashas, Crusaders, Chetniks, Gestapo agents, members of the Croatian Peasant Party, priests, convicts, emigres, informants working for Western intelligence services (particularly the British Intelligence Service), and also those who had familial ties to such people or were considered to be their friends. In addition to active enemies and political opponents, they also monitored all other citizens. Therefore, as the end of the war was approaching, the KPJ and OZNA strove to secure their dictatorship and a one-party system in which there would be no room for opposition activity. With the establishment of the UDBA and the forming of separate departments and offices for various groups of armed, political, and ideological opponents, the security system was finally complete. Whether they were active or passive, living or dead, acting in the country or abroad, records were kept on all enemies and political opponents as well as their family members and friends.
   Unfortunately, these claims can be substantiated only with fragmentary data since full lists for Croatia or some of its larger or smaller territorial units such as districts (okrugs) or provinces (oblasts) are unavailable, at least for the 1940s and early 1950s. However, lists and reports of security and intelligence services regarding the number and types of enemies are available for certain smaller areas, such as districts or cities, or at least for some categories of enemies, such as those sentenced to death by the courts or without trial, active enemies of the people, former convicts, suspicious persons, and emigres. They prove that records were kept on almost all types of enemies. The same conclusion applies to the monitoring of all other citizens, since all those working in state institutions and mass organisations - such as women's and youth organisations - were monitored, as were critically-minded individuals. The main goal of the communist authorities and their security and intelligence services was to have a complete insight into enemy activities, rival political forces, and possible discontent among their own citizens so as to nip any opposing political activity in the bud.

AB  - Increased loading of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural and urban intensification has led to severe degradation of inland and coastal waters. Lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands (lentic systems) retain these nutrients, thus regulating their delivery to downstream waters. While the processes controlling N and P retention are relatively well-known, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how these processes manifest across spatial scales. We synthesized data from 600 lentic systems around the world to gain insight into the relationship between hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on nutrient retention. Our results indicate that the first-order reaction rate constant, k [T-1], is inversely proportional to the hydraulic residence time, tau [T], across 6 orders of magnitude in residence time for total N, total P, nitrate, and phosphate. We hypothesized that the consistency of the relationship points to a strong hydrologic control on biogeochemical processing, and validated our hypothesis using a sediment-water model that links major nutrient removal processes with system size. Finally, the k-tau relationships were upscaled to the landscape scale using a wetland size-frequency distribution. Results suggest that small wetlands play a disproportionately large role in landscape-scale nutrient processing-50% of nitrogen removal occurs in wetlands smaller than 10(2.5) m(2) in our example. Thus, given the same loss in wetland area, the nutrient retention potential lost is greater when smaller wetlands are preferentially lost from the landscape. Our study highlights the need for a stronger focus on small lentic systems as major nutrient sinks in the landscape.
   Plain Language Summary Excess nutrient pollution from intensive fertilizer use and farming operations poses an increasing threat to water quality worldwide. Lakes, streams, and wetlands restrict the movement of nutrients, and thus protect downstream waters. We have a limited understanding, however, of how removal processes are affected by the size and type of the water body. Based on a synthesis of data from lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands worldwide, we found that smaller water bodies tend to have higher nutrient removal rates. We applied our findings to the landscape scale and found that for the same wetland area lost, the loss of small wetlands corresponds to a greater loss in wetland nutrient removal potential. Such findings are significant to wetland protection and restoration efforts, which have historically focused on maximizing total wetland area rather than on preserving a distribution of different wetlands sizes within a landscape.

AB  - The Central Apennines in Italy have had multiple moderate-size but damaging shallow earthquakes. In this study, we optimize the fault geometry and invert for fault slip based on coseismic GPS and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for the 2016 M-w 6.2 Amatrice earthquake in Italy. Our results show that nearly all the fault slip occurred between 3 and 6 km depth but extends 20 km along strike. There was less than 4 cm static surface displacement at the town Amatrice where the most devastating damage occurred. Landslides triggered by earthquake ground shaking are not uncommon, but triggered landslides with submeter movement are challenging to be observed in the field. We find evidence of coseismically triggered deep-seated landslides northwest and northeast of the epicenter where coseismic peak ground acceleration was estimated >0.5 g. By combining ascending and descending InSAR data, we are able to estimate the landslide thickness as at least 100 and 80 m near Monte Vettore and west of Castelluccio, respectively. The landslide near Monte Vettore terminates on the preexisting fault Monte Vettore Fault (MVEF) scarp. Our results imply that the long-term fault slip rate of MVEF estimated based on paleoseismic studies could potentially have errors due to triggered landslides from nearby earthquake events.

AB  - As 10,000 American baby boomers turn 65 years of age every day between 2017 and 2030, society needs to help our aging population find ways to handle the restrictions and limitations that come with increasing age: visual impairment, hearing loss, osteoarthritis, dementia, and other conditions common in older adults. Institutional or long-term care for elderly individuals costs an average of $82,000 to $92,000 per person per year and varies by location. Care in an assisted living facility costs $43,500 per person annually. Living in a personal home or residential setting-aging in place-by contrast, costs an average of $23,000 per person per year. Successful aging in place encompasses safety, health, and economic security. Numerous aging-in-place programs exist in contained geographic areas (towns and counties) or in areas that promote community living (e.g., cohousing or home-sharing) or focus on special interests like the arts. Two such programs, the naturally occurring retirement community (NORC) model and the Village model, seem to have had the most success. Elderburbs-older, age-unfriendly communities not focused on residents' health care and mobility needs-remain and can present unique problems. Handheld technology or that integrated into housing can improve the standard of Irving, help elders improve their functioning, and even monitor medication. The aging-irvplace movement presents numerous opportunities for consultant pharmacists.

AB  - Araquio, a verse play on the search of the holy cross, is an indigenous folk theatre in the town of Penaranda, province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines that has survived for over a hundred years. This ethnographic-phenomenological study explores the holistic nature of the transmission and learning processes of araquio music and songs as a theatre-ritual. Its transmission as a social phenomenon is an avenue for music learning that may in fact overshadow its being a diminishing tradition. Using the framework of three modes of enculturation (Merriam, 1964) and interpretation of culture (Geertz, 1973), I investigate the music transmission and learning processes and sought to reveal how these processes were meaningful to the practitioners. Participants in this inquiry involve 21 adult practitioners, namely: 4 maestros (teachers of araquio), 3 female and 5 male personajes (characters of the verse play), and 9 musikeros (community musicians). An ethnographic method is employed using participant-observation and informal semi-structured interview script. Guiding questions have centered on how transmission and learning strategies, and meaning define these experiences. As a living oral tradition, intergenerational learning is found to be the product of transmission by enculturation occurring in the araquio and happens within genealogical generation. The practitioners, through the unspoken meaning of the tradition, have certain unspoken factors: unity of purpose, ancestral adhesion, unification of tribal strength, and shared experiences.

AB  - At 5: 39 AM on 24 June 2017, a huge landslide-debris avalanche occurred on Fugui Mountain at Xinmo village, Diexi town, Maoxian county, Sichuan province, China. The debris blocked the Songpinggou River for about 2 km, resulting in a heavy loss of both human lives and properties (10 deaths, 3 injuries, 73 missing, and 103 houses completely destroyed). The objectives of this paper are to understand the overall process and triggering factors of this landslide and to explore the affecting factors for its long term evolution before failure. Post event surveys were carried out the day after the landslide occurrence. Information was gathered from literature and on-site investigation and measurement. Topography, landforms, lithology, geological setting, earthquake history, meteorological and hydrological data of the area were analysed. Aerial photographs and other remote sensing information were used for evaluation and discussion. Eye witnesses also provided a lot of helpful information for us to understand the process of initiation, development and deposition. The depositional characteristics of the moving material as well as the traces of the movement, the structural features of the main scarp and the seismic waves induced by the slide are presented and discussed in detail in this paper. The results show that the mechanism of the landslide is a sudden rupture of the main block caused by the instability of a secondary block at a higher position. After the initiation, the failed rock mass at higher position overloaded the main block at the lower elevation and collapsed in tandem. Fragmentation of the rock mass occurred later, thus forming a debris avalanche with high mobility. This landslide case indicates that such seismic events could influence geological hazards for over 80 years and this study provides reference to the long term susceptibility and risk assessment of secondary geological hazards from earthquake.
